the seventh part of the surf
progressions<00:00:02.070> is<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.760> add<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.330> backswing<00:00:04.020> to

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470

progressions is to add the backswing to
the<00:00:04.589> motion<00:00:05.040> we've<00:00:05.460> worked<00:00:05.759> on<00:00:05.970> up<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.660> this

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779

the motion we've worked on up to this
point<00:00:07.170> now<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.069> motion<00:00:08.580> I'm<00:00:08.790> about<00:00:08.970> to

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
point now the motion I'm about to

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.150 
point now the motion I'm about to
demonstrate<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.990> sometimes<00:00:10.500> referred<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.889> as

demonstrate is sometimes referred to as
the<00:00:11.969> broken<00:00:12.509> serve<00:00:12.980> because<00:00:13.980> your<00:00:14.639> arms<00:00:15.059> are

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
the broken serve because your arms are

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.510 
the broken serve because your arms are
gonna<00:00:15.240> move<00:00:15.540> separately<00:00:16.260> from<00:00:16.890> your<00:00:17.010> stance

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
gonna move separately from your stance

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.109 
gonna move separately from your stance
to<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.600> L<00:00:18.750> position<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.710> if<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.520> remember<00:00:20.789> in

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
to the L position and if you remember in

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.790 
to the L position and if you remember in
the<00:00:21.270> serve<00:00:21.510> fundamental<00:00:22.260> section<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the serve fundamental section of the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.769 
the serve fundamental section of the
website<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.430> said<00:00:23.670> during<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.180> preparation

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
website we said during the preparation

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.689 
website we said during the preparation
your<00:00:24.960> arms<00:00:25.230> move<00:00:25.410> down<00:00:25.680> together<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.279> then

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
your arms move down together and then

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.509 
your arms move down together and then
they<00:00:26.849> come<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.330> together<00:00:27.510> they<00:00:27.840> rise<00:00:28.170> together

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
they come up together they rise together

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.250 
they come up together they rise together
but<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> surf<00:00:30.060> progressions<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.840> haven't

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
but in the surf progressions we haven't

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.310 
but in the surf progressions we haven't
quite<00:00:31.439> made<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.340> point<00:00:32.399> yet<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:34.110> here

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
get to the L position we're gonna focus

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.389 
get to the L position we're gonna focus
on<00:00:49.020> my<00:00:49.230> hitting<00:00:49.530> arm<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.860> my<00:00:49.950> tennis<00:00:50.309> racket

on my hitting arm and my tennis racket

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.970 
on my hitting arm and my tennis racket
and<00:00:50.989> just<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.260> talked<00:00:52.500> about<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and just like we talked about in the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.549 
and just like we talked about in the
serve<00:00:53.250> fundamental<00:00:53.940> section<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:55.079> racket

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
serve fundamental section the racket

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.799 
serve fundamental section the racket
starts<00:00:55.920> by<00:00:56.100> pointing<00:00:56.520> down<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> court<00:00:57.600> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
starts by pointing down at the court and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.950 
starts by pointing down at the court and
then<00:00:58.559> when<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.800> bring<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.370> racquet<00:00:59.850> up<00:00:59.969> my<00:01:00.629> palm

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.920 
court and then I bring the tennis racket
and<00:01:05.250> my<00:01:05.339> hitting<00:01:05.610> arm<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:06.000> get<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> L

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and my hitting arm up get to the L

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
and my hitting arm up get to the L
position<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.070> racket<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.549> pointed

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
position and the racket is pointed

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
position and the racket is pointed
straight<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.299> sky<00:01:09.710> now<00:01:10.710> if<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.890> go<00:01:11.040> back

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
straight up at the sky now if we go back

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.530 
straight up at the sky now if we go back
to<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> stance<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.970> other<00:01:12.150> thing<00:01:12.390> you'll

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
to the stance the other thing you'll

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
to the stance the other thing you'll
notice<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.170> I'm<00:01:13.470> transferring<00:01:14.159> during

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
notice is that I'm transferring during

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.990 
notice is that I'm transferring during
the<00:01:14.880> step<00:01:15.150> my<00:01:15.720> weight<00:01:16.020> from<00:01:16.320> my<00:01:16.409> front<00:01:17.130> foot<00:01:17.430> to

the step my weight from my front foot to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.170 
the step my weight from my front foot to
my<00:01:18.180> back<00:01:18.600> foot<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.920> when<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.430> back<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> L

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
my back foot so when I get back to the L

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.230 
my back foot so when I get back to the L
position<00:01:22.040> my<00:01:23.040> weight<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.580> all<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.880> my<00:01:24.000> back

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
position my weight is all in my back

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.910 
position my weight is all in my back
foot<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.750> body<00:01:24.990> position<00:01:25.409> I'm<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.710> right

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
foot and this body position I'm in right

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
foot and this body position I'm in right
now<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.970> same<00:01:27.180> body<00:01:27.420> position<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:28.049> would

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
now is the same body position we would

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 
now is the same body position we would
start<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> previous<00:01:29.340> steps<00:01:29.610> when<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
start in in the previous steps when I

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.569 
start in in the previous steps when I
was<00:01:30.630> slowly<00:01:30.960> hitting<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> tennis<00:01:32.130> ball<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
was slowly hitting the tennis ball and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.390 
was slowly hitting the tennis ball and
really<00:01:32.820> trying<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.299> work<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> technique<00:01:34.400> once

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
really trying to work the technique once

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.219 
really trying to work the technique once
you've<00:01:35.579> mastered<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.210> weight<00:01:36.420> transfer<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you've mastered the weight transfer and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.370 
you've mastered the weight transfer and
the<00:01:38.070> backswing<00:01:38.640> from<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> stance<00:01:39.450> getting<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the backswing from the stance getting to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.560 
the backswing from the stance getting to
the<00:01:40.500> L<00:01:40.619> position<00:01:40.880> then<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.150> add<00:01:42.299> those

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the L position then you can add those

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.569 
the L position then you can add those
mechanics<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> mechanics<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.310> talked

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
mechanics to the mechanics we talked

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.969 
mechanics to the mechanics we talked
about<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> previous<00:01:45.450> sets<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.110> videos<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
disjointed but that's actually what you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.249 
disjointed but that's actually what you
