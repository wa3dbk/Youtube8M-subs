all<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.180> pieces<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:47.260> looks<00:02:47.440> perfect<00:02:48.240> so<00:02:49.240> all

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
all the pieces it looks perfect so all

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.090 
all the pieces it looks perfect so all
that's<00:02:49.510> left<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.720> do<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.350> pre<00:02:50.650> heat<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.890> oil

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
that's left to do is to pre heat the oil

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.420 
that's left to do is to pre heat the oil
so<00:02:51.520> we<00:02:51.610> want<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.850> put<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.060> on<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.420> medium<00:02:52.690> heat

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.500 

and<00:02:57.430> once<00:02:57.580> it's<00:02:57.730> heated<00:02:57.880> then<00:02:58.180> we<00:02:58.270> can<00:02:58.390> start

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
and once it's heated then we can start

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.080 
and once it's heated then we can start
throwing<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.960> pakoras<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.790> tell<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.880> need

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
throwing the pakoras I tell you need

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.580 
throwing the pakoras I tell you need
little<00:03:01.240> trick<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.810> check<00:03:02.020> if<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.290> oil<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.530> hot

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
little trick to check if the oil is hot

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.920 
little trick to check if the oil is hot
enough<00:03:02.820> Pierre<00:03:03.820> wooden<00:03:04.090> spoon<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.720> stick

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
enough Pierre wooden spoon and you stick

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.500 
enough Pierre wooden spoon and you stick
feedback<00:03:05.260> end<00:03:05.500> into<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.890> oil<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:07.360> should

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
feedback end into the oil you should

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.750 
feedback end into the oil you should
stop<00:03:07.630> bubbling<00:03:07.960> up<00:03:08.230> around<00:03:08.500> around<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.490> spoon

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
stop bubbling up around around the spoon

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.950 
stop bubbling up around around the spoon
so<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.090> means<00:03:10.270> it<00:03:10.390> was<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.810> perfect

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
so that means it was the perfect

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.980 
so that means it was the perfect
temperature<00:03:11.520> okay<00:03:12.520> oh<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:12.850> ready<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.930> you

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
temperature okay oh it's ready so you

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.230 
temperature okay oh it's ready so you
just<00:03:14.140> get<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:15.090> tablespoon<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:17.010> big<00:03:18.010> heap<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:18.520> the

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
just get a tablespoon a big heap of the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.800 
just get a tablespoon a big heap of the
mixture<00:03:19.600> with<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.780> potatoes<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:21.700> throw<00:03:22.690> it

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
mixture with the potatoes just throw it

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.640 
mixture with the potatoes just throw it
into<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.020> oil<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.840> can<00:03:25.960> make<00:03:26.080> them<00:03:26.230> as<00:03:26.320> big<00:03:26.530> or

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
into the oil you can make them as big or

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.530 
into the oil you can make them as big or
as<00:03:26.710> small<00:03:26.800> as<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.250> want<00:03:27.280> but<00:03:27.880> ape<00:03:28.270> spoons

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
as small as you want but ape spoons

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:54.449 
as small as you want but ape spoons
usually<00:03:29.140> about<00:03:29.290> right<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:54.040> soon<00:03:54.280> they'll

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
usually about right so soon they'll

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.710 
usually about right so soon they'll
start<00:03:54.550> floating<00:03:54.880> to<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.150> top<00:03:55.239> that's<00:03:55.570> when

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
start floating to the top that's when

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.120 
start floating to the top that's when
you<00:03:55.810> know<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:56.200> leaves<00:03:56.410> one<00:03:56.530> side<00:03:56.739> is<00:03:56.890> nearly

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
you know that leaves one side is nearly

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.470 
you know that leaves one side is nearly
cooked<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:57.700> then<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:57.850> can<00:03:58.000> flip<00:03:58.239> them<00:03:58.390> over

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
cooked and then you can flip them over

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.360 
cooked and then you can flip them over
we're<00:03:59.380> trying<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.620> get<00:03:59.709> them<00:03:59.830> to<00:03:59.860> a<00:03:59.980> golden

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
we're trying to get them to a golden

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.300 
we're trying to get them to a golden
brown<00:04:00.610> color<00:04:01.650> can<00:04:02.650> actually<00:04:02.950> keep<00:04:03.130> the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
brown color can actually keep the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.130 
brown color can actually keep the
mixture<00:04:03.790> for<00:04:04.180> another<00:04:04.420> day<00:04:04.630> if<00:04:04.690> you<00:04:04.840> just<00:04:05.020> put

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
mixture for another day if you just put

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.960 
mixture for another day if you just put
it<00:04:05.230> into<00:04:05.500> a<00:04:05.530> plastic<00:04:06.040> container<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.730> sealed

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
it into a plastic container a sealed

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.460 
it into a plastic container a sealed
plastic<00:04:07.120> container<00:04:07.630> sticking<00:04:08.080> in<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.260> fridge

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
plastic container sticking in the fridge

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.400 
plastic container sticking in the fridge
and<00:04:08.500> then<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.830> can<00:04:08.950> use<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.100> again<00:04:09.430> tomorrow

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
and then you can use it again tomorrow

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.360 
and then you can use it again tomorrow
but<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.530> course<00:04:11.590> if<00:04:11.890> you're<00:04:11.950> having<00:04:12.100> a<00:04:12.220> party

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
that you can use the whole lot

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.729 
that you can use the whole lot
straightaway<00:04:16.380> usually<00:04:17.380> they'll<00:04:17.500> take<00:04:17.709> a

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
straightaway usually they'll take a

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.830 
straightaway usually they'll take a
couple<00:04:17.980> of<00:04:18.100> minutes<00:04:18.340> on<00:04:18.459> each<00:04:18.580> side

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.659 

it's<00:04:22.500> time<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.830> look<00:04:22.919> like<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.190> nearly<00:04:23.400> done<00:04:23.639> I

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
it's time to look like the nearly done I

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.800 
it's time to look like the nearly done I
think<00:04:23.790> another<00:04:24.060> minutes<00:04:24.449> and<00:04:24.600> they'll<00:04:24.720> be

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
think another minutes and they'll be

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.810 
think another minutes and they'll be
ready<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.949> can<00:04:26.040> actually<00:04:26.160> feel<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.669> they're

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
ready you can actually feel that they're

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.430 
ready you can actually feel that they're
a<00:04:26.850> bit<00:04:27.060> crispy<00:04:29.780> they're<00:04:30.780> already<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.260> can<00:04:31.290> see
