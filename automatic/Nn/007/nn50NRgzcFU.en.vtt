00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
little crash but I think most of the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.960 
little crash but I think most of the
girls<00:00:25.080> were<00:00:25.380> off<00:00:25.560> bike<00:00:25.830> off<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.130> bike<00:00:26.490> now<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
girls were off bike off the bike now and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.210 
girls were off bike off the bike now and
then<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.570> technical<00:00:28.140> course<00:00:28.380> I'm<00:00:29.160> happy

with<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.000> fifth<00:00:30.210> place<00:00:30.450> but<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.930> course

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
with the fifth place but of course

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.680 
with the fifth place but of course
feeling<00:00:31.829> the<00:00:31.980> lack<00:00:32.220> of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.790> extra<00:00:33.150> gear<00:00:33.360> it's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
feeling the lack of the extra gear it's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.780 
feeling the lack of the extra gear it's
something<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.650> miss<00:00:34.920> especially<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.550> you
