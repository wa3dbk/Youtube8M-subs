there a block here a redstone dust there

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.740 
there a block here a redstone dust there
we've<00:00:55.949> already<00:00:56.100> used<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:56.610> half<00:00:56.940> our<00:00:57.120> materials

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
we've already used up half our materials

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.810 
we've already used up half our materials
half<00:00:58.260> our<00:00:58.739> materials<00:00:59.370> then<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.640> put<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
half our materials then we put a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.369 
half our materials then we put a
redstone<00:01:00.030> torch<00:01:00.210> there<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.809> I'm<00:01:01.050> versus

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
redstone torch there so that I'm versus

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.590 
redstone torch there so that I'm versus
the<00:01:01.469> signal<00:01:01.859> put<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> command<00:01:02.850> block<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.239> either

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the signal put a command block on either

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
the signal put a command block on either
side<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.619> we're<00:01:04.769> set<00:01:04.949> except

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
side and that's it we're set except

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.929 
side and that's it we're set except
obviously<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.479> still<00:01:06.750> need<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.930> put<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
obviously we still need to put down a

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.219 
obviously we still need to put down a
command<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:09.780> we're<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> be

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.359 
snow and it's simple anyways how this
works<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.049> daylight<00:01:55.439> sensor<00:01:55.860> powers

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
works is that the daylight sensor powers

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.899 
works is that the daylight sensor powers
this<00:01:56.610> redstone<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.960> turn<00:01:58.610> turns<00:01:59.610> off<00:01:59.729> this

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
this redstone it in turn turns off this

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.609 
this redstone it in turn turns off this
redstone<00:02:00.210> torch<00:02:00.570> which<00:02:00.869> powers<00:02:01.229> these<00:02:01.439> two

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
redstone torch which powers these two

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.539 
redstone torch which powers these two
command<00:02:01.890> blocks<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:03.740> once<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.100> becomes

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
command blocks and once it becomes

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.609 
command blocks and once it becomes
nighttime<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.360> redstone<00:02:06.780> dust<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.259> not

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
nighttime the redstone dust is not

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.540 
nighttime the redstone dust is not
powered<00:02:08.069> however<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.030> torch<00:02:09.330> will<00:02:09.569> turn<00:02:09.780> on

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
powered however the torch will turn on

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.340 
powered however the torch will turn on
and<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.850> will<00:02:11.090> power<00:02:11.390> both<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.900> these<00:02:12.020> blocks

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
and it will power both of these blocks

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.690 
and it will power both of these blocks
uh<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:14.810> going<00:02:15.320> i<00:02:15.560> think<00:02:16.280> if<00:02:16.460> i'm<00:02:16.580> not

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
uh it's going i think if i'm not

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.580 
uh it's going i think if i'm not
mistaken<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.480> delayed<00:02:17.720> sensor<00:02:18.080> turns<00:02:18.380> on

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
mistaken the delayed sensor turns on

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.830 
mistaken the delayed sensor turns on
this<00:02:19.040> command<00:02:19.400> block<00:02:19.640> first<00:02:20.210> which<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.630> why<00:02:20.780> it

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
this command block first which is why it

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.900 
this command block first which is why it
clears<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.950> weather<00:02:22.100> first<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.550> then<00:02:22.640> they

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
clears the weather first and then they

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.870 
clears the weather first and then they
like<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.570> doesn't<00:02:23.960> matter<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.500> works<00:02:24.880> we're

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
like it doesn't matter it works we're

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.220 
like it doesn't matter it works we're
going<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.090> try<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.300> out<00:02:26.420> right<00:02:26.660> now<00:02:26.840> it's<00:02:27.080> going

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
going to try it out right now it's going

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.830 
going to try it out right now it's going
to<00:02:27.290> be<00:02:27.350> really<00:02:27.500> quick<00:02:27.770> we're<00:02:28.220> going<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.840> set

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
to be really quick we're going to set

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.950 
to be really quick we're going to set
the<00:02:29.930> time<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.910> 15,000<00:02:31.910> because<00:02:32.180> that's<00:02:32.480> my

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
the time to 15,000 because that's my

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.980 
the time to 15,000 because that's my
time<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.500> as<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.520> can<00:02:34.670> see<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:35.480> shows<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> day

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
time and as you can see it shows a day

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.900 
time and as you can see it shows a day
immediately<00:02:36.380> ok<00:02:37.310> we're<00:02:37.490> going<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.640> do<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.820> from

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
immediately ok we're going to do it from

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.690 
immediately ok we're going to do it from
up<00:02:38.090> here<00:02:38.270> Oh<00:02:38.450> quick<00:02:38.870> tip<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.620> quick<00:02:39.830> tips<00:02:40.130> you

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
up here Oh quick tip to quick tips you

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.190 
up here Oh quick tip to quick tips you
can't<00:02:40.940> put<00:02:41.150> blocks<00:02:41.360> on<00:02:41.630> top<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:41.960> daylight

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
can't put blocks on top of the daylight

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.870 
can't put blocks on top of the daylight
sensor<00:02:42.560> otherwise<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:43.490> not<00:02:43.580> gonna<00:02:43.790> work

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
sensor otherwise it's not gonna work

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.210 
sensor otherwise it's not gonna work
because<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.930> works<00:02:45.170> off<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.470> sunlight<00:02:45.980> it's

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
because it works off of sunlight it's

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.560 
because it works off of sunlight it's
pretty<00:02:47.150> easy<00:02:47.660> concept<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.770> understand

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
pretty easy concept to understand

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.880 
pretty easy concept to understand
secondly<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:50.810> must<00:02:50.840> have<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.350> chunk<00:02:51.590> loaded

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
secondly you must have the chunk loaded

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.000 
secondly you must have the chunk loaded
why<00:02:52.490> well<00:02:52.910> first<00:02:53.360> off<00:02:53.540> if<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.680> don't<00:02:54.710> have<00:02:54.890> the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
why well first off if you don't have the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.590 
why well first off if you don't have the
truck<00:02:55.190> loaded<00:02:55.220> then<00:02:55.730> this<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.060> not<00:02:56.300> gonna<00:02:56.420> be

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
truck loaded then this is not gonna be

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.620 
truck loaded then this is not gonna be
loaded<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:57.110> not<00:02:57.290> gonna<00:02:57.380> work<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.630> secondly

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
loaded it's not gonna work and secondly

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.780 
loaded it's not gonna work and secondly
any<00:02:59.960> red<00:03:00.830> stone<00:03:01.070> thing<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.550> you<00:03:01.640> actually

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
any red stone thing that you actually

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.880 
any red stone thing that you actually
want<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.750> work<00:03:02.900> while<00:03:03.230> you're<00:03:03.320> AFK<00:03:03.620> or

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
want it to work while you're AFK or

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.990 
want it to work while you're AFK or
you're<00:03:04.400> gone<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:05.750> going<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.770> have<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.130> have<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
you're gone is going to have to have the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.690 
you're gone is going to have to have the
chunk<00:03:08.300> loaded<00:03:08.600> for<00:03:08.870> its<00:03:08.960> word<00:03:09.400> alright<00:03:10.400> let's

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
chunk loaded for its word alright let's

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.760 
chunk loaded for its word alright let's
try<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:11.060> again<00:03:11.330> we're<00:03:12.170> going<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.350> set<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.590> time

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
try it again we're going to set the time

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.010 
try it again we're going to set the time
to<00:03:12.800> 15,000<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.060> works<00:03:14.240> we're<00:03:14.870> going<00:03:14.959> to

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
to 15,000 and it works we're going to

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.920 
to 15,000 and it works we're going to
set<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.200> against<00:03:15.620> 15,000<00:03:16.520> and<00:03:16.700> that's<00:03:17.690> how<00:03:17.870> it

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
set it against 15,000 and that's how it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.090 
set it against 15,000 and that's how it
works<00:03:18.670> it's<00:03:19.670> pretty<00:03:20.000> simple<00:03:20.239> method<00:03:20.959> if<00:03:21.110> you
