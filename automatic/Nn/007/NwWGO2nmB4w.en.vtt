with people that use Windows 7
complaining<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:31.970> basically<00:00:32.450> what<00:00:32.599> it<00:00:32.719> is<00:00:32.750> was

complaining and basically what it is was

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.420 
complaining and basically what it is was
that<00:00:33.579> do<00:00:34.579> you<00:00:34.670> think<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:35.360> hack<00:00:35.719> was<00:00:35.989> not

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
that do you think the hack was not

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.739 
that do you think the hack was not
working<00:00:37.430> within<00:00:37.879> their<00:00:38.149> program<00:00:38.449> so<00:00:38.480> it's

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:38.749 
working within their program so it's

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:39.970 
working within their program so it's
called<00:00:38.929> for<00:00:39.109> we<00:00:39.230> were<00:00:39.320> using<00:00:39.589> for<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.800> hack

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
called for we were using for the hack

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.029 
called for we were using for the hack
and<00:00:40.870> when<00:00:41.870> I<00:00:41.899> got<00:00:42.109> today<00:00:42.379> was<00:00:42.530> a<00:00:42.559> PM<00:00:42.859> from

take the time to help me out sort this

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.290 
take the time to help me out sort this
problem<00:00:55.010> because<00:00:55.489> I<00:00:55.519> was<00:00:55.699> about<00:00:55.879> to<00:00:55.940> restore

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
problem because I was about to restore

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.110 
problem because I was about to restore
Windows<00:00:56.600> 7<00:00:56.989> 64<00:00:57.469> bit<00:00:57.859> on<00:00:58.069> my<00:00:58.219> system<00:00:58.579> to<00:00:58.729> figure

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
Windows 7 64 bit on my system to figure

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.219 
Windows 7 64 bit on my system to figure
out<00:00:59.329> what<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.479> problem<00:00:59.780> was<00:00:59.809> because<00:01:00.050> I

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
out what the problem was because I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:01.959 
out what the problem was because I
thought<00:01:00.499> it<00:01:00.620> was<00:01:00.679> in<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.889> code<00:01:01.069> so<00:01:01.699> basically

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
thought it was in the code so basically

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.570 
thought it was in the code so basically
what<00:01:02.149> he<00:01:02.210> says<00:01:02.449> he<00:01:02.719> was<00:01:03.469> that<00:01:03.649> up<00:01:03.769> because<00:01:04.220> that

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
what he says he was that up because that

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.630 
what he says he was that up because that
is<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.330> c-sharp<00:01:05.840> injector<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.520> was

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
is the c-sharp injector and it was

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.030 
is the c-sharp injector and it was
compiled<00:01:08.030> for<00:01:08.299> probably<00:01:08.810> 86<00:01:09.320> bit<00:01:09.530> only<00:01:09.860> now

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
compiled for probably 86 bit only now

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.410 
compiled for probably 86 bit only now
he's<00:01:10.190> assuming<00:01:10.670> this<00:01:10.790> but<00:01:11.030> he's<00:01:11.120> most<00:01:11.270> likely

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
he's assuming this but he's most likely

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.230 
he's assuming this but he's most likely
right<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:12.710> doesn't<00:01:13.190> work<00:01:13.370> oh<00:01:13.610> sorry<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:14.120> was

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
right it doesn't work oh sorry it was

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.890 
right it doesn't work oh sorry it was
compiled<00:01:14.570> for<00:01:14.900> I'm<00:01:15.170> 32-bit<00:01:15.830> only<00:01:16.100> I<00:01:16.220> meant<00:01:16.900> it

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
compiled for I'm 32-bit only I meant it

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.500 
compiled for I'm 32-bit only I meant it
doesn't<00:01:18.350> work<00:01:18.470> for<00:01:18.590> 64-bit<00:01:19.250> now<00:01:19.430> as<00:01:19.970> he<00:01:20.240> says

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
doesn't work for 64-bit now as he says

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.720 
doesn't work for 64-bit now as he says
here<00:01:20.870> the<00:01:21.080> person<00:01:21.410> that<00:01:21.590> compiled<00:01:21.950> GX<00:01:22.310> inject

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
here the person that compiled GX inject

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.010 
here the person that compiled GX inject
should<00:01:23.270> have<00:01:23.390> chosen<00:01:24.190> to<00:01:25.190> have<00:01:25.510> any<00:01:26.510> CPU

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
should have chosen to have any CPU

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.100 
should have chosen to have any CPU
instead<00:01:27.410> of<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.220> specific<00:01:28.850> operating<00:01:29.720> system

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
instead of the specific operating system

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.750 
instead of the specific operating system
the<00:01:30.830> he<00:01:31.370> chose<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:33.010> what<00:01:34.010> he's<00:01:34.130> saying

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
the he chose so what he's saying

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.020 
the he chose so what he's saying
basically<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:35.660> that<00:01:35.690> you<00:01:36.080> can<00:01:36.290> use<00:01:36.500> any

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
basically is that you can use any

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.610 
basically is that you can use any
injector<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:38.240> now<00:01:38.480> I<00:01:38.510> should<00:01:39.290> have<00:01:39.410> done<00:01:39.590> I

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
injector so now I should have done I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.660 
injector so now I should have done I
should<00:01:39.740> have<00:01:39.950> given<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:40.220> something<00:01:40.460> like

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
should have given you something like

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.690 
should have given you something like
Auto<00:01:40.940> inject<00:01:41.390> or<00:01:41.540> whatever<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.770> my<00:01:43.100> things<00:01:43.580> a

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
Auto inject or whatever so my things a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.040 
Auto inject or whatever so my things a
bit<00:01:43.850> slow<00:01:44.030> should<00:01:44.540> have<00:01:44.630> given<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:44.870> something

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
bit slow should have given you something

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.320 
bit slow should have given you something
like<00:01:45.200> auto<00:01:45.440> injector<00:01:45.920> whatever<00:01:46.130> like<00:01:46.310> here<00:01:46.610> to

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
like auto injector whatever like here to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.310 
like auto injector whatever like here to
inject<00:01:48.260> into<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.590> system<00:01:48.920> now<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.930> was<00:01:50.930> doing

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
inject into the system now I was doing

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.660 
inject into the system now I was doing
this<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:51.680> I<00:01:51.770> was<00:01:51.890> here<00:01:52.040> getting<00:01:52.400> help<00:01:52.550> from

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
this and I was here getting help from

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.330 
this and I was here getting help from
map<00:01:52.940> 232<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.810> do<00:01:53.930> this<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:54.410> credits<00:01:54.980> to<00:01:55.070> him<00:01:55.190> as

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
map 232 to do this so credits to him as

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.730 
map 232 to do this so credits to him as
well<00:01:55.490> because<00:01:55.820> he<00:01:55.940> was<00:01:56.060> helping<00:01:56.420> me<00:01:56.570> out<00:01:57.130> and

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
well because he was helping me out and

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.260 
well because he was helping me out and
basically<00:02:00.740> what<00:02:00.920> I<00:02:00.950> all<00:02:01.520> I'm<00:02:01.700> trying<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.060> tell

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
basically what I all I'm trying to tell

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.090 
basically what I all I'm trying to tell
you<00:02:02.420> was<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.080> code<00:02:03.440> was<00:02:03.590> fine<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.980> code

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
you was that the code was fine the code

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.550 
you was that the code was fine the code
it<00:02:04.220> we<00:02:04.310> did<00:02:04.430> was<00:02:04.580> fine<00:02:04.820> right<00:02:05.320> but<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.440> problem

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
it we did was fine right but the problem

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.249 
it we did was fine right but the problem
was<00:02:06.980> that<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.370> injector<00:02:08.110> wouldn't<00:02:09.110> work<00:02:09.229> for

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
was that the injector wouldn't work for

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.530 
was that the injector wouldn't work for
64<00:02:09.950> bits<00:02:10.159> so<00:02:10.429> what<00:02:10.789> I'm<00:02:10.909> probably<00:02:11.120> going<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.420> do

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
64 bits so what I'm probably going to do

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.449 
64 bits so what I'm probably going to do
is<00:02:11.629> I'm<00:02:11.720> gonna<00:02:11.810> make<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:12.050> new<00:02:12.260> tutorial<00:02:12.650> where

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
is I'm gonna make a new tutorial where

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.790 
is I'm gonna make a new tutorial where
we'll<00:02:13.760> I'll<00:02:14.750> probably<00:02:14.960> remake<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.590> whole

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
we'll I'll probably remake the whole

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.790 
we'll I'll probably remake the whole
there<00:02:16.670> X<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.360> Warhawks<00:02:17.690> tutorial<00:02:18.200> probably

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
there X the Warhawks tutorial probably

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.960 
there X the Warhawks tutorial probably
make<00:02:19.130> that<00:02:19.280> hole

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
make that hole

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.520 
make that hole
I<00:02:20.000> mean<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.600> don't<00:02:20.660> really<00:02:20.900> didn't<00:02:21.170> really<00:02:21.350> want

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
I mean I don't really didn't really want

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.080 
I mean I don't really didn't really want
to<00:02:21.560> but<00:02:21.830> obviously<00:02:22.340> I'll<00:02:22.460> do<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.760> because<00:02:22.850> I'm

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
to but obviously I'll do it because I'm

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.550 
to but obviously I'll do it because I'm
gonna<00:02:23.180> get<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.420> lot<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.660> questions<00:02:23.990> even<00:02:24.170> after

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
gonna get a lot of questions even after

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.380 
gonna get a lot of questions even after
I<00:02:24.620> provide<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.160> solution<00:02:25.940> on<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.209> other

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
I provide the solution on the other

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.070 
I provide the solution on the other
thing<00:02:26.870> NR<00:02:27.110> some<00:02:27.350> people<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.650> like<00:02:27.860> but<00:02:28.700> I

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
thing NR some people I like but I

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.350 
thing NR some people I like but I
probably<00:02:30.080> redo<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.970> know<00:02:32.090> take<00:02:32.270> you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
probably redo that and you know take you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.210 
probably redo that and you know take you
guys<00:02:32.510> through<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.110> obviously<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:33.950> won't<00:02:34.160> to

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
guys through it and obviously I won't to

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.190 
guys through it and obviously I won't to
do<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.430> earlier<00:02:34.760> tutorials<00:02:35.270> because<00:02:35.840> I'll

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
do the earlier tutorials because I'll

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.770 
do the earlier tutorials because I'll
have<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.470> I'll<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.190> tell<00:02:37.670> people<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:38.060> use

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
have to I'll just tell people to use

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.570 
have to I'll just tell people to use
another<00:02:39.320> injector<00:02:39.890> because<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.280> one<00:02:40.430> isn't

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
another injector because that one isn't

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.370 
another injector because that one isn't
good<00:02:40.790> enough<00:02:41.110> for<00:02:42.110> 64-bit<00:02:42.790> anyways<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.450> what

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
good enough for 64-bit anyways so what

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.290 
good enough for 64-bit anyways so what
I'm<00:02:45.470> gonna<00:02:45.590> put<00:02:45.739> in<00:02:45.890> your<00:02:45.980> description<00:02:46.760> is

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
I'm gonna put in your description is

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.590 
I'm gonna put in your description is
this<00:02:47.540> three<00:02:48.500> three<00:02:49.280> files<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:49.940> be<00:02:50.180> all<00:02:50.360> in<00:02:50.480> one

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
this three three files so be all in one

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.150 
this three three files so be all in one
file<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:50.989> just<00:02:51.170> download<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:51.620> extract<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.130> to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
file so just download and extract it to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.590 
file so just download and extract it to
whatever<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.610> test<00:02:52.820> this<00:02:52.940> out<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.390> if<00:02:53.510> you

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
whatever and test this out so if you

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.670 
whatever and test this out so if you
want<00:02:53.780> those<00:02:53.959> people<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.380> were<00:02:54.470> having

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
want those people that were having

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.310 
want those people that were having
problems<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.130> 64-bit<00:02:55.850> system<00:02:56.630> you'll<00:02:57.050> see

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
problems the 64-bit system you'll see

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.759 
problems the 64-bit system you'll see
that<00:02:57.440> this<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.680> fixed<00:02:58.070> immediately<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:59.200> if<00:03:00.200> if

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
that this is fixed immediately so if if

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.420 
that this is fixed immediately so if if
you<00:03:01.130> guys<00:03:01.310> did<00:03:01.550> my<00:03:01.730> dll<00:03:02.630> how<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.080> hack<00:03:03.320> any<00:03:03.530> game

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
you guys did my dll how to hack any game

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.150 
you guys did my dll how to hack any game
tutorial<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:05.420> dll<00:03:05.840> part<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.230> actually<00:03:06.380> wrote

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
tutorial the dll part I actually wrote

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.190 
tutorial the dll part I actually wrote
an<00:03:07.550> injector<00:03:08.060> there<00:03:08.209> with<00:03:08.300> you<00:03:08.420> guys<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:09.080> if

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
an injector there with you guys so if

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.500 
an injector there with you guys so if
you<00:03:09.320> can<00:03:09.500> just<00:03:09.650> cater<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.940> whatever<00:03:11.150> game

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
you can just cater that to whatever game

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.610 
you can just cater that to whatever game
you<00:03:11.690> want<00:03:11.870> because<00:03:12.080> you<00:03:12.170> can<00:03:12.380> it's<00:03:12.560> really

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
you want because you can it's really

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.979 
you want because you can it's really
simple<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.970> can<00:03:14.120> use<00:03:14.269> that<00:03:14.420> one<00:03:14.570> if<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.720> like

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
simple you can use that one if you like

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.840 
simple you can use that one if you like
that's<00:03:15.260> fine<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:16.010> we'd<00:03:16.160> have<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.459> download

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
that's fine that we'd have to download

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.880 
that's fine that we'd have to download
this<00:03:16.970> one<00:03:17.180> if<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:17.870> want<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.110> do<00:03:18.230> that<00:03:18.410> use<00:03:18.680> that

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
this one if you want to do that use that

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.590 
this one if you want to do that use that
one<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.280> that's<00:03:20.030> not<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.209> problem<00:03:20.300> at<00:03:20.540> all

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
one and that's not a problem at all

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.970 
one and that's not a problem at all
because<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.810> works<00:03:21.140> pretty<00:03:21.320> well<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.800> it

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
because that works pretty well and it

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.880 
because that works pretty well and it
worked<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:22.459> fine<00:03:22.750> as<00:03:23.750> an<00:03:23.900> alternative<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.440> GX

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
worked just fine as an alternative to GX

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.640 
worked just fine as an alternative to GX
inject<00:03:25.310> now<00:03:25.760> what<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.780> recommend<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.320> do<00:03:27.470> is

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
inject now what I recommend you do is

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.970 
inject now what I recommend you do is
you<00:03:28.190> download<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:29.079> run<00:03:30.079> alter<00:03:30.350> inject<00:03:30.709> and

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
you download this run alter inject and

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.620 
you download this run alter inject and
try<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.220> with<00:03:31.310> your<00:03:31.459> cod4<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.060> that's<00:03:32.420> most

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.300 
try it with your cod4 so that's most
this<00:03:32.930> mostly<00:03:33.410> for<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.860> people<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.250> were

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
this mostly for the people that were

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.340 
this mostly for the people that were
following<00:03:34.459> my<00:03:34.670> tutorial<00:03:35.120> run<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.019> then

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
following my tutorial run it and then

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.600 
following my tutorial run it and then
try<00:03:36.590> in<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.799> game<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.100> you'll<00:03:37.190> see<00:03:37.340> that<00:03:37.459> it

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
try in the game and you'll see that it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.860 
try in the game and you'll see that it
works<00:03:37.790> just<00:03:37.970> fine<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.360> it<00:03:38.510> should<00:03:38.660> work<00:03:38.690> just

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
works just fine and it should work just

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.250 
works just fine and it should work just
fine<00:03:39.280> if<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.489> doesn't<00:03:40.820> let<00:03:40.910> me<00:03:41.000> know<00:03:41.150> but<00:03:41.570> I'm

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
fine if it doesn't let me know but I'm

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.030 
fine if it doesn't let me know but I'm
pretty<00:03:42.530> sure<00:03:42.620> Toby<00:03:42.950> s1<00:03:43.549> was<00:03:43.730> right<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:45.040> that's

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
pretty sure Toby s1 was right so that's

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.470 
pretty sure Toby s1 was right so that's
the<00:03:46.250> fix<00:03:46.430> for<00:03:46.519> that<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:46.940> I'll<00:03:47.030> probably<00:03:47.180> make
