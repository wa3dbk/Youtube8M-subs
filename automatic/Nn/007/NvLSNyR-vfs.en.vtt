00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
to get into it with purgatory mode I I

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.509 
to get into it with purgatory mode I I
don't<00:00:25.380> really<00:00:25.619> understand<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.250> fully

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
don't really understand this fully

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.650 
don't really understand this fully
because<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.880> haven't<00:00:27.150> done<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> Easter<00:00:27.570> Egg

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
because I haven't done the Easter Egg

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.259 
because I haven't done the Easter Egg
myself<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.830> basically<00:00:29.640> that's<00:00:29.849> pretty<00:00:30.150> much

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
myself but basically that's pretty much

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.900 
myself but basically that's pretty much
how<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.080> guess<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:31.980> anyways<00:00:32.340> this

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
how you do I guess but anyways this

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.950 
how you do I guess but anyways this
poster<00:00:33.450> has<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.170> lot<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.739> stuff<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.460> has<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
poster has a lot of stuff and it has a

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.209 
poster has a lot of stuff and it has a
castle<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.140> background<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> says

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
castle in the background and it says

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.660 
castle in the background and it says
escape<00:00:38.760> from<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.480> tomb<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:40.530> has<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.100> guy<00:00:41.370> with

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
escape from the tomb it has a guy with

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.330 
escape from the tomb it has a guy with
an<00:00:41.820> ex<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.780> lady<00:00:43.079> holding<00:00:43.649> his<00:00:43.800> arm<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
an ex and I lady holding his arm and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.900 
an ex and I lady holding his arm and
there<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.930> dog<00:00:46.680> head<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.370> think<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> dog

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
there is a dog head and I think the dog

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.270 
there is a dog head and I think the dog
head<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.360> kind<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.690> resembles<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:50.039> kind

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
head just kind of resembles the the kind

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.000 
head just kind of resembles the the kind
of<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.610> demon<00:00:50.969> thing<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.449> we've<00:00:51.629> been

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
of the demon thing that we've been

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.139 
of the demon thing that we've been
feeding<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.610> get<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.969> hell's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
feeding so you can get the hell's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.119 
feeding so you can get the hell's
retriever<00:00:54.710> here<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.890> mob<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.280> dead<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
retriever here in mob of the dead but I

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.529 
retriever here in mob of the dead but I
don't<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.489> significant<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> what

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
don't think that's significant to what

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.939 
don't think that's significant to what
I'm<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.809> be<00:01:00.899> talking<00:01:01.079> about<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.649> think

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
I'm going to be talking about I think

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399 
I'm going to be talking about I think
that<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.280> might<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.969> clue<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.140> next

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that this might be a clue to the next

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.560 
that this might be a clue to the next
map<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.860> think<00:01:05.189> they<00:01:05.640> might<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.150> hinting

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
map and I think they might be hinting

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.359 
map and I think they might be hinting
towards<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.229> castle<00:01:07.770> map<00:01:09.049> this<00:01:10.049> would<00:01:11.010> kind<00:01:11.280> of

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
towards a castle map this would kind of

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.270 
towards a castle map this would kind of
seemed<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.510> could<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.840> real<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:13.320> we

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
seemed like you could be real because we

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.780 
seemed like you could be real because we
haven't<00:01:14.700> had<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.090> castle<00:01:15.570> map<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.170> um<00:01:16.830> that

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
haven't had a castle map so um that

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
haven't had a castle map so um that
would<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.939> pretty<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.270> think<00:01:18.299> it'd<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.600> pretty

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
would be pretty I think it'd be pretty

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.770 
would be pretty I think it'd be pretty
cool<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.640> map<00:01:21.049> but<00:01:23.150> but<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.479> says

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
cool to have this map but but it says

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.340 
cool to have this map but but it says
escape<00:01:25.320> from<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> tomb<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:27.020> don't<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
escape from the tomb so I don't think a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.410 
escape from the tomb so I don't think a
tomb<00:01:28.590> would<00:01:28.829> kind<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.280> relate<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> castle<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
tomb would kind of relate to a castle I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
tomb would kind of relate to a castle I
mean<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.689> could<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.530> tomb<00:01:31.770> could<00:01:32.009> be

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
mean you could the tomb could be

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.020 
mean you could the tomb could be
underground<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.829> maybe<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.820> like

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
underground so maybe it can be like

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.910 
underground so maybe it can be like
catacombs<00:01:36.750> under<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> ground<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.680> something

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
catacombs under the ground or something

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.060 
catacombs under the ground or something
like<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:39.140> I'm<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.350> sure<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> would<00:01:40.950> be

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
like that I'm not sure if that would be

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.719 
like that I'm not sure if that would be
really<00:01:41.220> fun<00:01:41.520> because<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:43.259> kind<00:01:43.439> of

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
really fun because that that kind of

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.550 
really fun because that that kind of
envisions<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.630> me<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> envisions<00:01:46.380> like

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
envisions like for me it envisions like

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.830 
envisions like for me it envisions like
really<00:01:46.860> tight<00:01:47.070> spaces<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:47.729> little<00:01:48.390> tunnels

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
really tight spaces like little tunnels

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.399 
really tight spaces like little tunnels
and<00:01:49.020> stuff<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:50.700> never<00:01:50.909> know

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
and stuff like that but you never know

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.450 
and stuff like that but you never know
Treyarch<00:01:52.409> always<00:01:52.740> does<00:01:52.950> good<00:01:53.159> with<00:01:53.310> their

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
Treyarch always does good with their

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.179 
Treyarch always does good with their
maps<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.299> think<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.799> could<00:01:55.860> possibly

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
maps so I think that this could possibly

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.270 
maps so I think that this could possibly
be<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> next<00:01:57.270> map<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:58.380> not<00:01:58.680> sure<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
be the next map I'm not sure what the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.450 
be the next map I'm not sure what the
that<00:01:59.579> axe<00:01:59.939> has<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.140> maybe<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:02.189> like<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
that axe has to do maybe that's like a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.200 
that axe has to do maybe that's like a
new<00:02:02.729> weapon<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.360> new<00:02:03.750> melle<00:02:04.079> weapon<00:02:04.560> hopefully

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
new weapon a new melle weapon hopefully

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.580 
new weapon a new melle weapon hopefully
hopefully<00:02:06.210> maybe<00:02:06.719> that's<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.079> hint<00:02:07.290> that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
hopefully maybe that's a hint that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.870 
hopefully maybe that's a hint that
Abraham<00:02:08.039> Lincoln<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.459> Kenny<00:02:09.470> no<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.739> uh
