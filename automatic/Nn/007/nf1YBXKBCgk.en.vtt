00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.100
 wind 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.730
 life inside 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.970
 no no 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.049
 yes 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.970
 all right 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.050
 but no 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.710
 i 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.600
 for those of us who live here 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.960
 but not 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.020
 I do not know 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.850
 two 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.900
 but only those macanas 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.900
 [Applause] 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.430
 so first 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.329
 [Music] 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.329
 what happened 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.079
 with the goalkeeper 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.079
 do not 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:09.810
 but the plague of 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:16.609
 but we not filmed 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:19.609
 The truth is that I do not care 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.609
 all right 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.130
 but no 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.850
 now that we are 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.850
 but no 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.480
 and since fewer school places 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.509
 but not 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.029
 why not 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.320
 they came ashore with him 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.610
 ah 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.419
 go 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.419
 because it entails 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.410
 but it's the information 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.410
 [Applause] 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.860
 thematically 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.110
 like nothing 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.870
 [Applause] 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.310
 in other management functions it 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.310
 discounted that back 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.310
 sorry
