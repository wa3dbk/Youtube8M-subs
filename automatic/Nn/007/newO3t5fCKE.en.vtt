00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.100
 laughter 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:12.530
 all living things 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.530
 they need to feed themselves to live 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:23.629
 living beings need food to form different parts of the body 

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:26.380
 during growth 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.319
 and through food 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:32.639
 replenish the energy consumed in the functioning of their organs and tissues 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.320
 both within the animal kingdom and the plant kingdom 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.320
 the diversity of species is very large 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.890
 this allows to exploit to the maximum all the food resources that offer 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.890
 the different environments of the planet 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.290
 it can be said that most of the organic matter after serving as 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.659
 hawkins food in usa 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.539
 is the case of wood pulp, decaying materials 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.219
 or the organic matter dissolved in the water that are used as sources to efe 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:16.270
 by different types of living beings 1 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.689
 nature 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.390
 the plant kingdom assumes an essential role because it is capable of capturing the energy 

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:26.020
 coming from the sun 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.160
 and transform it together with water carbon dioxide and mineral salts 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.070
 in organic matter that serves as Tibetan food or indirectly 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 for the vast majority of living beings 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.790
 this organic matter goes through the different levels of food 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.140
 in each of them the species use the organic matter from which 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.869
 available to extract the necessary energy for your vital processes 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.480
 the different links form the food pyramid 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.040
 Plant organisms are primary producers 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.100
 herbivorous animals are primary consumers and animals 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.070
 carnivores 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.879
 secondary consumers 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.090
 in addition there is a series of organisms like bacteria and fungi although they decompose 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.920
 the organic remains of the different links and transform the material 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:23.049
 organic in inorganic matter that will then be used by the 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.009
 primary producers ie plants like war 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.479
 is calculated 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.079
 that only 10% of what you eat 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.909
 It is used by fabrics 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.909
 the rest is discarded 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.150
 the remaining materials of each level is used by other organisms that 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:49.249
 use the energy that may contain
