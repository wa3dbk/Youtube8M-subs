Milwaukee has been and neighborhood by

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.469 
Milwaukee has been and neighborhood by
neighborhood<00:01:29.840> block<00:01:30.710> by<00:01:31.040> block<00:01:31.280> let's<00:01:32.210> see

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
neighborhood block by block let's see

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.290 
neighborhood block by block let's see
how<00:01:32.690> much<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.260> old<00:01:33.440> city<00:01:33.890> we<00:01:34.820> can<00:01:35.000> bring

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
how much of the old city we can bring

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.550 
how much of the old city we can bring
back<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.570> life<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:37.479> think<00:01:38.479> urban<00:01:38.570> agriculture

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
back to life I think urban agriculture

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.320 
back to life I think urban agriculture
is<00:01:39.650> it's<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.520> big<00:01:40.700> movement<00:01:40.880> right<00:01:41.150> now

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
is it's a big movement right now

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.840 
is it's a big movement right now
I<00:01:41.510> think<00:01:41.750> obviously<00:01:41.990> Will<00:01:42.440> Allen<00:01:43.100> is<00:01:43.460> the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
I think obviously Will Allen is the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.180 
I think obviously Will Allen is the
pioneer<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.810> we're<00:01:44.900> kind<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.140> disciples<00:01:45.950> of

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
pioneer and we're kind of disciples of

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.800 
pioneer and we're kind of disciples of
will<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:47.150> know<00:01:47.240> for<00:01:47.390> people<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.600> be<00:01:47.660> able<00:01:47.720> to

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
will you know for people to be able to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.140 
will you know for people to be able to
grow<00:01:47.930> their<00:01:48.110> own<00:01:48.140> food<00:01:48.229> it's<00:01:49.040> huge<00:01:49.340> especially

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
grow their own food it's huge especially

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.090 
grow their own food it's huge especially
in<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.570> city<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:50.990> think<00:01:51.320> one<00:01:51.650> percent<00:01:52.009> of

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
in the city I think one percent of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.910 
in the city I think one percent of
everything<00:01:52.820> we<00:01:52.910> get<00:01:53.060> in<00:01:53.180> Wisconsin<00:01:53.780> is<00:01:54.229> from

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
everything we get in Wisconsin is from

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.859 
everything we get in Wisconsin is from
homegrown<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.330> everything<00:01:56.600> else<00:01:56.720> is

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
homegrown and everything else is

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.190 
homegrown and everything else is
important<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.649> I<00:01:57.679> think<00:01:57.890> there's<00:01:58.039> a

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
important so I think there's a

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.270 
important so I think there's a
you<00:01:59.380> know<00:01:59.469> a<00:01:59.619> lot<00:01:59.829> of<00:01:59.860> potential<00:02:00.399> there<00:02:01.350> bro<00:02:02.350> so

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
you know a lot of potential there bro so

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.359 
you know a lot of potential there bro so
this<00:02:03.460> is<00:02:03.640> watercress<00:02:04.329> mm-hmm<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.770> watercress

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
this is watercress mm-hmm the watercress

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.380 
this is watercress mm-hmm the watercress
grows<00:02:06.939> in<00:02:07.240> water<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:09.220> recently<00:02:09.610> were<00:02:10.090> told

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
grows in water and we recently were told

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.320 
grows in water and we recently were told
that<00:02:10.810> it's<00:02:11.110> time<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.470> put<00:02:11.800> some<00:02:12.069> worm<00:02:12.519> castings

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
that it's time to put some worm castings

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.350 
that it's time to put some worm castings
to<00:02:13.629> give<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.379> watercress<00:02:14.950> some<00:02:15.250> nutrients<00:02:15.910> so

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
to give the watercress some nutrients so

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.820 
to give the watercress some nutrients so
that's<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.720> dirt<00:02:16.959> that<00:02:17.200> I've<00:02:17.319> seen<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.650> top

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
just recently began to begun to feed the

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.920 
just recently began to begun to feed the
watercress<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:24.370> will<00:02:24.910> Alan<00:02:25.269> said<00:02:25.540> it's<00:02:25.720> not

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
watercress that will Alan said it's not

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.199 
watercress that will Alan said it's not
how<00:02:26.410> green<00:02:26.830> your<00:02:27.160> thumb<00:02:27.489> is<00:02:27.730> it's<00:02:28.060> how

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
how green your thumb is it's how

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.500 
how green your thumb is it's how
nutrient-rich<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.410> your<00:02:30.010> soil<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:31.180> fish

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
nutrient-rich is your soil and the fish

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.949 
nutrient-rich is your soil and the fish
make<00:02:32.290> rich<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.950> soil<00:02:33.280> for<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.730> plants<00:02:33.959> the

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
make rich the soil for the plants the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.130 
make rich the soil for the plants the
watercress<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.489> plants<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.299> roots

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
watercress and the plants and the roots

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.740 
watercress and the plants and the roots
and<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.530> billions<00:02:39.099> of<00:02:39.220> bacteria<00:02:39.569> make<00:02:40.569> the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
and the billions of bacteria make the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.589 
and the billions of bacteria make the
water<00:02:40.989> clean<00:02:41.500> for<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:41.920> fish<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.459> feed<00:02:43.390> the

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
water clean for the fish and feed the

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.380 
water clean for the fish and feed the
fish<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:44.769> just<00:02:44.920> about<00:02:45.220> feeding<00:02:45.579> time<00:02:46.000> for

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
fish so it's just about feeding time for

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.100 
fish so it's just about feeding time for
the<00:02:46.709> idea<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.849> nobody<00:02:49.120> told<00:02:49.480> me<00:02:49.630> lunch<00:02:49.870> would

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
the idea and nobody told me lunch would

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.550 
the idea and nobody told me lunch would
be<00:02:50.230> provided<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.459> more<00:02:52.209> than<00:02:52.390> lunch<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:53.110> is

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
be provided it is more than lunch it is

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.229 
be provided it is more than lunch it is
I<00:02:53.970> think<00:02:54.970> it's<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.630> it's<00:02:56.400> as<00:02:57.400> close<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:57.910> sacred

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
I think it's a it's as close to a sacred

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.199 
I think it's a it's as close to a sacred
moment<00:02:58.690> as<00:02:59.049> you<00:02:59.230> can<00:02:59.440> get<00:02:59.680> in<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.160> secular<00:03:00.790> city

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
moment as you can get in a secular city

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.420 
moment as you can get in a secular city

realizes<00:03:37.540> right<00:03:38.519> this<00:03:39.519> treasure<00:03:39.880> we've<00:03:40.389> got

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
realizes right this treasure we've got

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.360 
realizes right this treasure we've got
the<00:03:41.950> goal

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
the goal

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.940 
the goal
I<00:03:42.400> really<00:03:42.670> think<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:43.239> mean<00:03:43.470> next<00:03:44.470> year<00:03:44.709> we'd<00:03:44.830> be

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
I really think I mean next year we'd be

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.130 
I really think I mean next year we'd be
hopefully<00:03:45.430> up<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.640> around<00:03:45.819> 300,000<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:47.019> year

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
hopefully up to around 300,000 the year

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.660 
hopefully up to around 300,000 the year
after<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.379> hopefully<00:03:47.680> up<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.159> about<00:03:48.310> 600

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
after that hopefully up to about 600

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.170 
after that hopefully up to about 600
where<00:03:49.150> we<00:03:49.299> can<00:03:49.450> be<00:03:49.569> harvesting<00:03:50.409> fish<00:03:51.180> by

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
where we can be harvesting fish by

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.850 
where we can be harvesting fish by
weekly<00:03:52.720> if<00:03:52.989> not<00:03:53.110> weekly<00:03:53.709> at<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.489> point<00:03:55.860> as

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
weekly if not weekly at that point as

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.170 
weekly if not weekly at that point as
well<00:03:56.890> as<00:03:57.190> obviously<00:03:57.519> all<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.849> other

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
well as obviously all the other

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
well as obviously all the other
vegetables<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.659> everything<00:03:58.959> else<00:03:59.049> that

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
vegetables and everything else that

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.839 
vegetables and everything else that
we're<00:03:59.319> gonna<00:03:59.409> be<00:03:59.500> doing<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:00.670> more<00:04:00.819> we

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
we're gonna be doing so the more we

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.759 
we're gonna be doing so the more we
expand<00:04:01.269> I<00:04:01.299> think<00:04:01.659> to<00:04:01.810> make<00:04:01.930> Milwaukee<00:04:02.440> the

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
expand I think to make Milwaukee the

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.259 
expand I think to make Milwaukee the
largest<00:04:03.129> in<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.250> country<00:04:03.280> far<00:04:03.970> as<00:04:04.090> the

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
largest in the country far as the

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.280 
largest in the country far as the
aquaponic<00:04:05.140> systems<00:04:05.500> is<00:04:05.950> kind<00:04:06.159> of<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.280> goal<00:04:07.290> so

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
aquaponic systems is kind of the goal so

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.509 
aquaponic systems is kind of the goal so
this<00:04:08.590> is<00:04:09.370> fish<00:04:09.909> food<00:04:10.150> correct<00:04:10.739> yes<00:04:11.739> this<00:04:12.129> is

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
this is fish food correct yes this is

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.089 
this is fish food correct yes this is
the<00:04:12.819> fish<00:04:13.030> food<00:04:13.390> we<00:04:13.690> are<00:04:13.720> using<00:04:14.290> right<00:04:14.470> now<00:04:14.530> to

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
the fish food we are using right now to

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.180 
the fish food we are using right now to
feed<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.970> tilapia<00:04:16.299> each<00:04:17.199> of<00:04:17.470> these<00:04:17.590> first<00:04:17.919> two

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
feed the tilapia each of these first two

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.710 
feed the tilapia each of these first two
raceways<00:04:18.729> have<00:04:19.239> about<00:04:20.430> 16,000<00:04:21.430> tilapia<00:04:21.940> so

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
raceways have about 16,000 tilapia so

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.740 
raceways have about 16,000 tilapia so
we're<00:04:22.990> gonna<00:04:23.080> give<00:04:23.350> them<00:04:23.530> 24<00:04:24.280> ounces<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.330> I'm

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
we're gonna give them 24 ounces and I'm

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.090 
we're gonna give them 24 ounces and I'm
gonna<00:04:25.900> show<00:04:26.139> you<00:04:26.199> how<00:04:26.380> to<00:04:26.410> do<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:26.979> then

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
gonna show you how to do it and then

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.159 
gonna show you how to do it and then
I'll<00:04:27.250> let<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:27.460> do<00:04:27.729> it<00:04:27.760> now<00:04:28.330> when<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:28.900> first

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
I'll let you do it now when I first

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.950 
I'll let you do it now when I first
started<00:04:29.590> out<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:30.130> took<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:31.000> time<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.570> do<00:04:31.720> this

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
started out I took the time to do this

it's<00:05:06.370> just<00:05:06.849> wonderful<00:05:07.300> it's<00:05:07.900> that<00:05:08.200> and<00:05:08.410> more

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
it's just wonderful it's that and more

the<00:05:09.789> theory<00:05:10.270> tells<00:05:10.539> us<00:05:10.900> if<00:05:11.139> our<00:05:11.470> conditions

the theory tells us if our conditions

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.070 
the theory tells us if our conditions

are optimal if we reach the the level of

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.719 
are optimal if we reach the the level of
a<00:05:17.199> black<00:05:17.470> belt<00:05:17.830> in<00:05:18.160> karate

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
a black belt in karate

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.610 
a black belt in karate
in<00:05:19.330> terms<00:05:19.810> of<00:05:20.080> aquaponic<00:05:21.039> systems<00:05:22.620> 16,000

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
in terms of aquaponic systems 16,000

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.040 
in terms of aquaponic systems 16,000
fish<00:05:24.180> will<00:05:25.180> equal<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.229> pound<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:27.010> a<00:05:27.070> half<00:05:27.099> in

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
fish will equal a pound and a half in

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.950 
fish will equal a pound and a half in
six<00:05:29.050> months<00:05:29.789> okay<00:05:30.789> that<00:05:31.150> pound<00:05:31.449> and<00:05:31.690> a<00:05:31.750> half

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
six months okay that pound and a half

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.140 
six months okay that pound and a half
will<00:05:32.320> yield<00:05:32.680> about<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.370> pound<00:05:33.729> yeah<00:05:34.419> of<00:05:35.370> protein

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
will yield about a pound yeah of protein

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.120 
will yield about a pound yeah of protein
so<00:05:37.810> that's<00:05:38.970> 16,000<00:05:39.970> pounds<00:05:40.570> of<00:05:40.780> protein<00:05:41.590> in

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
so that's 16,000 pounds of protein in

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.379 
so that's 16,000 pounds of protein in
six<00:05:42.490> months<00:05:43.800> 32,000<00:05:44.800> pounds<00:05:45.040> of<00:05:45.520> protein<00:05:46.030> in<00:05:46.270> a

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
six months 32,000 pounds of protein in a

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.530 
six months 32,000 pounds of protein in a
year<00:05:46.810> and<00:05:47.139> the<00:05:47.650> simple<00:05:48.070> numbers<00:05:48.490> across<00:05:49.120> one

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
year and the simple numbers across one

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.860 
year and the simple numbers across one
or<00:05:49.690> two<00:05:49.960> days<00:05:50.260> you<00:05:50.290> could<00:05:50.979> feed<00:05:51.630> 16,000<00:05:52.630> people

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
or two days you could feed 16,000 people

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.620 
or two days you could feed 16,000 people
between<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:53.800> greens<00:05:54.070> oh<00:05:54.340> my<00:05:54.520> goodness<00:05:54.940> well<00:05:55.210> I

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
between the greens oh my goodness well I

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.620 
between the greens oh my goodness well I
think<00:05:56.050> really<00:05:56.350> if<00:05:56.500> you<00:05:56.620> look<00:05:56.800> at<00:05:57.000> Detroit<00:05:58.000> and

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
think really if you look at Detroit and

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.350 
think really if you look at Detroit and
Chicago<00:05:58.660> and<00:05:59.639> Ohio<00:06:00.639> we've<00:06:00.910> been<00:06:01.030> up<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.270> up

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
Chicago and Ohio we've been up the up

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.090 
Chicago and Ohio we've been up the up
connecting<00:06:01.570> with<00:06:01.750> New<00:06:01.870> Orleans<00:06:02.100> there's

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
connecting with New Orleans there's

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.300 
connecting with New Orleans there's
there's<00:06:03.490> tons<00:06:03.880> of<00:06:04.030> these<00:06:04.090> buildings<00:06:04.570> that<00:06:05.310> the

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
there's tons of these buildings that the

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.800 
there's tons of these buildings that the
city<00:06:06.550> doesn't<00:06:06.729> know<00:06:06.880> what<00:06:07.000> to<00:06:07.090> do<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.389> I<00:06:07.600> think

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
city doesn't know what to do it I think

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.830 
city doesn't know what to do it I think
the<00:06:08.020> potential<00:06:08.350> for<00:06:08.770> duplicating<00:06:09.729> this<00:06:09.850> in<00:06:10.300> in

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
the potential for duplicating this in in

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.950 
the potential for duplicating this in in
blighted<00:06:11.680> areas<00:06:12.010> where<00:06:12.510> the<00:06:13.510> neighborhoods

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
blighted areas where the neighborhoods

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.719 
blighted areas where the neighborhoods
and<00:06:14.080> what<00:06:14.169> not<00:06:14.260> even<00:06:14.470> sick<00:06:14.800> could<00:06:14.919> be<00:06:15.039> huge<00:06:15.370> a

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
and what not even sick could be huge a

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.810 
and what not even sick could be huge a
huge<00:06:16.120> movement
