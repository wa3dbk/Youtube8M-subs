you guys get into it and it can be
slightly<00:04:50.800> confusing<00:04:51.340> at<00:04:51.520> first<00:04:51.720> some<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:52.840> the

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
slightly confusing at first some of the

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.170 
slightly confusing at first some of the
systems<00:04:53.440> in<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.680> game<00:04:53.949> so<00:04:54.400> i<00:04:54.430> imagine<00:04:54.880> it's

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
systems in the game so i imagine it's

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.760 
systems in the game so i imagine it's
all<00:04:55.300> going<00:04:55.479> to<00:04:55.539> carry<00:04:55.720> over<00:04:55.900> pretty<00:04:56.229> directly

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
all going to carry over pretty directly

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.670 
all going to carry over pretty directly
