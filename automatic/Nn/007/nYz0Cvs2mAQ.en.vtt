00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.900
 and also taking advantage of the kitchen the day 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.320
 Today I 'm going to show you how I do the 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.410
 green salsita for flutes salsita 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.410
 green with delicious avocado 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.350
 good 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.599
 a few tomatoes 2 467 have to 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.430
 make the peeled tomatoes and always 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.250
 when they go to the stores I grabbed the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.870
 tomatoes that are already well out of the 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.550
 shell because those that are still 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.040
 inside that means that those 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.780
 tomatoes are still green though 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.410
 green tomatoes but I mean no 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.300
 they are harder he needs time so that 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.970
 they were at their point they were 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.210
 ready to cook but then in the 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.530
 field as they want they cut the city 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.150
 I tell them because I am one of my first 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.600
 jobs that I had was precisely 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.600
 cutting this type of tomato in the field 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.360
 we cut it and for kilos they paid us 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.979
 according to what we would like of kilos per day 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.979
 It was the amount they paid us 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.440
 to peel the last 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.080
 and the Mayans 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.080
 what's going on 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.120
 but 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.330
 here are the chiles that put all 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.820
 your 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.160
 and the bird remove this because then when 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.980
 battling with the station 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.860
 the nice voltage to put a tooth 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.360
 of garlic 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.120
 and I'm going to put half of this 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.860
 the fourth part of an onion if it is the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.970
 half I will not remove the shell 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.530
 all 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.530
 I do not know what I'm going to use 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.430
 he grabbed this one and this one took off the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.750
 shell above and is the one that I'm going to 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.420
 put 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.930
 and I'm going to put enough water 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.930
 that also not 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.709
 and over the phone 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.300
 although also a little bit more and 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.959
 they can put a little bit of being but I 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.290
 I put it in the blender I'll put 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.290
 to bake 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:19.290
 here is already I'm going to put it on fire 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:22.450
 next to the chicken and I'll cover it 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.599
 with ventilation and I hope it boils 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.599
 plus 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.440

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.560

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.360
 3 minutes let's leave it for 3 minutes 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.140
 more and that will be ready to 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.140
 pass it to the blender 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.310

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.910
 That is already NomÃ¡s and I will let 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:14.240
 cool a little bit and I'm going to liquefy 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:16.760

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.000

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.950
 I'm going to make kids eat so spicy 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.950
 I'm going to use all the tomatoes 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.520

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:50.600
 just low where hiding between 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:53.750
 garlic cloves and there it is and what you 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.280
 I'm going to do is throw a glass not much 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:03.450
 of coriander 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.450
 more or less this to give it a touch 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.000
 and it is already 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:21.670

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.550
 3 avocados your family breakfast 2 us 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.540
 we made more familiar 3 avocados for 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.540
 render 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.170
 and I'm going to do it 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.690
 Y 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.690
 Y 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:47.059
 two 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.660
 there are people who do not cream 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.230
 that 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.840
 there are people that we cream that 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.610
 depends when when they do not throw the 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.460
 to the professional sauce in half for 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.890
 to see when when is a quantity 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.140
 if you put it on it is more, but if you throw it 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.360
 here they do not throw him aside when 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.860
 they serve and if they do not injure here they throw 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.330
 when it is nothing else what is going to 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.330
 cast is salt 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:42.920
 and then they say that many of which 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.920
 they are many that looks like a little more 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.280
 and liquefy 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.490
 let's go 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.539

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.539
 little finger to fly 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:31.780
