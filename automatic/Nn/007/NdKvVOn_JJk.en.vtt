00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
thick wake function you can see that

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.280 
thick wake function you can see that
this<00:02:04.950> case<00:02:05.490> certainly<00:02:05.790> does<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.079> as

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
this case certainly does do that and as

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.050 
this case certainly does do that and as
I<00:02:07.439> mentioned<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.009> prop<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.700> into<00:02:09.030> a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
I mentioned you can prop this up into a

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.449 
I mentioned you can prop this up into a
variety<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.690> stand<00:02:10.020> positions<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:11.129> like<00:02:11.340> you

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
variety of stand positions just like you

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.120 
variety of stand positions just like you
can<00:02:11.640> with

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
can with

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.130 
can with
our<00:02:12.190> cover<00:02:12.490> by<00:02:13.060> making<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.450> little<00:02:13.600> triangle

out<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> front<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.100> then<00:02:15.460> propping<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:15.970> up

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
out of the front and then propping it up

out of the front and then propping it up
this<00:02:16.630> case<00:02:16.930> does<00:02:17.200> three<00:02:17.530> different<00:02:17.860> angles

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
this case does three different angles

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.630 
this case does three different angles
this<00:02:18.550> one<00:02:18.760> for<00:02:18.970> video<00:02:19.240> this<00:02:20.200> one<00:02:20.410> for<00:02:20.740> typing

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
this one for video this one for typing

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.270 
this one for video this one for typing
and<00:02:21.910> again<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.570> so<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.290> they<00:02:23.770> actually<00:02:24.100> show

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
and again like so and they actually show

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.300 
and again like so and they actually show
another<00:02:24.640> one<00:02:24.880> on<00:02:24.910> here<00:02:25.330> for<00:02:26.130> kind<00:02:27.130> of<00:02:27.190> a

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
another one on here for kind of a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.090 
another one on here for kind of a
steeper<00:02:27.850> or<00:02:28.180> less<00:02:28.630> shallow<00:02:28.930> view<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.710> the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
steeper or less shallow view of the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.970 
steeper or less shallow view of the
video<00:02:31.000> angle<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.810> I'm<00:02:32.380> not<00:02:32.560> really<00:02:32.770> even<00:02:32.950> sure

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
video angle and I'm not really even sure

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.800 
video angle and I'm not really even sure
how<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.310> make<00:02:33.520> that<00:02:33.730> one<00:02:33.940> as<00:02:34.390> i<00:02:34.570> pull<00:02:34.780> the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
how to make that one as i pull the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.280 
how to make that one as i pull the
packaging<00:02:35.440> back<00:02:35.620> out<00:02:35.860> kind<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.730> looks<00:02:36.970> like

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
packaging back out kind of looks like

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.350 
packaging back out kind of looks like
this<00:02:38.290> i<00:02:38.530> believe<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.720> maybe<00:02:41.080> let's<00:02:41.650> say

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
this i believe like that maybe let's say

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.660 
this i believe like that maybe let's say
yeah<00:02:43.360> like<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.960> it's<00:02:44.410> kind<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.740> less<00:02:45.070> steep

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
yeah like that it's kind of a less steep

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.420 
yeah like that it's kind of a less steep
angle<00:02:46.180> i<00:02:46.390> guess<00:02:46.690> for<00:02:47.080> like<00:02:47.740> viewing<00:02:48.100> videos

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
angle i guess for like viewing videos

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.780 
angle i guess for like viewing videos
not<00:02:49.270> as<00:02:49.480> steep<00:02:49.750> as<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.920> know<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.280> one<00:02:51.460> that

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
not as steep as you know the one that

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.210 
not as steep as you know the one that
like<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.480> guess<00:02:52.780> not<00:02:53.290> as<00:02:53.470> steep<00:02:53.680> as<00:02:53.920> your

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
like that I guess not as steep as your

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.780 
like that I guess not as steep as your
main<00:02:54.610> video<00:02:54.940> angle<00:02:55.540> but<00:02:55.720> less<00:02:56.320> steep<00:02:57.250> as<00:02:57.520> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
main video angle but less steep as the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.670 
main video angle but less steep as the
typing<00:02:58.270> angle<00:02:58.390> that's<00:02:58.930> right<00:02:59.110> often<00:02:59.320> I<00:02:59.530> would

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
typing angle that's right often I would

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.770 
typing angle that's right often I would
used<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.130> one<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.970> two<00:03:01.150> certainly<00:03:01.600> work

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
used that one but the two certainly work

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.780 
used that one but the two certainly work
now<00:03:02.230> what<00:03:02.410> makes<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.770> case<00:03:03.040> kind<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.490> unique

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
now what makes this case kind of unique

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.360 
now what makes this case kind of unique
is<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.330> hand<00:03:04.660> strap<00:03:04.960> that's<00:03:05.440> integrated<00:03:05.980> into

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
is the hand strap that's integrated into

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.580 
is the hand strap that's integrated into
the<00:03:06.460> back<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.880> can<00:03:06.940> see<00:03:07.060> it's<00:03:07.330> elastic<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:08.440> has

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
the back you can see it's elastic it has

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.530 
the back you can see it's elastic it has
their<00:03:08.830> logo<00:03:09.160> right<00:03:09.340> in<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.520> center<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:09.970> you

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
their logo right in the center and you

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.820 
their logo right in the center and you
just<00:03:10.690> stick<00:03:10.900> your<00:03:11.020> hand<00:03:11.260> all<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.800> way

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
just stick your hand all the way

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.040 
just stick your hand all the way
underneath<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:12.730> then<00:03:13.180> you're<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.960> know

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
underneath it and then you're you know

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.350 
underneath it and then you're you know
iPad<00:03:14.440> is<00:03:14.620> secure<00:03:15.010> now<00:03:15.220> it's<00:03:15.850> kind<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.120> weird

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
iPad is secure now it's kind of weird

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.750 
iPad is secure now it's kind of weird
with<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.660> front<00:03:16.960> flap<00:03:17.350> because<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.670> know

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
with the front flap because you know

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.120 
with the front flap because you know
it's<00:03:18.880> going<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.060> be<00:03:19.150> hanging<00:03:19.450> down<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.950> it

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
it's going to be hanging down but it

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.310 
it's going to be hanging down but it
still<00:03:21.430> does<00:03:21.640> allow<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.270> use<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.810> case<00:03:23.020> one

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
still does allow you to use the case one

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.710 
still does allow you to use the case one
handed<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:24.250> flap<00:03:24.490> is<00:03:24.760> light<00:03:25.090> since<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:25.660> is

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
handed the flap is light since this is

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.930 
handed the flap is light since this is
kind<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.230> thinner<00:03:26.470> Smart<00:03:27.190> Cover<00:03:27.400> like<00:03:27.490> case

it doesn't really seem to get out of the
way<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:29.890> do<00:03:30.250> find<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:30.730> when<00:03:30.970> it's<00:03:31.090> in<00:03:31.270> this

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
way I do find that when it's in this

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.750 
way I do find that when it's in this
position<00:03:31.870> sometimes<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.890> sleep<00:03:33.460> awake

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
position sometimes the sleep awake

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.030 
position sometimes the sleep awake
function<00:03:34.120> will<00:03:34.450> activate<00:03:34.990> when<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.500> don't<00:03:35.800> want

function will activate when I don't want
it<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.910> you're<00:03:37.180> probably<00:03:37.360> only<00:03:37.570> going<00:03:37.690> to

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
it to but you're probably only going to

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.540 
it to but you're probably only going to
keep<00:03:38.020> your<00:03:38.170> iPad<00:03:38.500> in<00:03:38.740> this<00:03:39.010> position<00:03:39.430> when

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
keep your iPad in this position when

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.070 
keep your iPad in this position when
you're<00:03:39.640> actually<00:03:39.790> using<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:40.840> you're<00:03:40.959> going

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
you're actually using it so you're going

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.020 
you're actually using it so you're going
to<00:03:41.140> flip<00:03:41.320> this<00:03:41.380> flap<00:03:41.770> open<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.400> just<00:03:42.730> have<00:03:42.880> to

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
to flip this flap open and just have to

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.970 
to flip this flap open and just have to
deal<00:03:43.209> with<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.720> flap<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.620> know<00:03:44.709> kind<00:03:44.920> of

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
deal with the flap you know kind of

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.400 
deal with the flap you know kind of
flapping<00:03:45.310> around<00:03:45.580> as<00:03:46.090> you're<00:03:46.270> using<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.750> you

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
flapping around as you're using it you

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.440 
flapping around as you're using it you
could<00:03:47.560> fold<00:03:47.800> this<00:03:48.010> up<00:03:48.220> like<00:03:48.670> into<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.120> magnet

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
could fold this up like into the magnet

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.600 
could fold this up like into the magnet
like<00:03:49.600> position<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:50.260> hold<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.860> like<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:51.310> to

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
like position and hold it like so to

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.340 
like position and hold it like so to
kind<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.850> keep<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.090> out<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.270> the<00:03:52.360> way<00:03:52.480> but

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
kind of keep it out of the way but

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.960 
kind of keep it out of the way but
either<00:03:53.800> way<00:03:54.070> you're<00:03:54.280> still<00:03:54.370> dealing<00:03:54.700> with

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
either way you're still dealing with

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.060
