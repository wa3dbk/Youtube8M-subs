I<00:00:25.320> mean<00:00:26.039> compared<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.000> last<00:00:27.210> year<00:00:27.570> they're<00:00:27.930> not

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140

but<00:00:28.670> for<00:00:29.670> me<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:30.029> think<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.810> waste<00:00:31.050> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
but for me I just think it's waste of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.900 
but for me I just think it's waste of
time<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.619> might<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:31.890> well<00:00:31.920> buy<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> new<00:00:32.430> cheap
