00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.949 
but that's usually how the maps are and

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
bring back the red ones but they always

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.740 
bring back the red ones but they always
have<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.830> change<00:02:50.070> things<00:02:50.280> around<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.670> bit<00:02:50.750> so

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
have to change things around a bit so

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.260 
have to change things around a bit so
that<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.950> runs<00:02:53.130> with<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.400> new<00:02:53.700> ones<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.150> know

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
that it runs with the new ones you know

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.610 
that it runs with the new ones you know
maybe<00:02:54.480> our<00:02:54.660> characters<00:02:54.989> water<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.290> don't<00:02:55.560> know

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
maybe our characters water I don't know

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.110 
maybe our characters water I don't know
maybe<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.100> all<00:02:56.250> my<00:02:56.340> head<00:02:56.520> maybe<00:02:56.910> it's<00:02:57.060> just

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
maybe it's all my head maybe it's just

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.670 
maybe it's all my head maybe it's just
because<00:02:57.330> they<00:02:57.600> look<00:02:57.630> different<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.530> they

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
because they look different that they

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.820 
because they look different that they
feel<00:02:58.920> wider<00:02:59.250> but<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.300> like<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.510> artwork<00:03:00.830> some

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
feel wider but I like the artwork some

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.320 
feel wider but I like the artwork some
parts<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.250> map<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.580> feels<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.180> they

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
parts of the map it feels like they

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.540 
parts of the map it feels like they
didn't<00:03:03.630> really<00:03:03.810> do<00:03:03.959> much<00:03:04.200> like<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.010> back<00:03:05.280> part

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
didn't really do much like the back part

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.010 
didn't really do much like the back part
that's<00:03:05.760> pretty<00:03:06.330> empty<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.690> guess<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.989> other

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
that's pretty empty I guess the other

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.570 
that's pretty empty I guess the other
one<00:03:07.260> was<00:03:07.380> empty<00:03:07.650> but<00:03:07.770> they<00:03:08.130> could<00:03:08.280> have<00:03:08.400> done<00:03:08.430> a

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
one was empty but they could have done a

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.970 
one was empty but they could have done a
lot<00:03:08.820> more<00:03:08.880> there<00:03:09.300> but<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.560> don't<00:03:10.860> know<00:03:10.950> if

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
lot more there but I don't know if

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.229 
lot more there but I don't know if
there's<00:03:11.160> any<00:03:11.310> secret<00:03:11.520> on<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.940> on<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
there's any secret on this on the

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.699

a<00:03:53.459> bit<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.730> never<00:03:53.970> really<00:03:54.209> liked<00:03:54.360> him<00:03:54.510> though<00:03:54.570> I

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
a bit I never really liked him though I

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.479 
a bit I never really liked him though I
really<00:03:54.959> thought<00:03:55.230> was<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.440> dumb<00:03:55.680> map<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:56.070> don't

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
really thought was a dumb map I don't

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.030 
really thought was a dumb map I don't
like<00:03:56.640> small<00:03:57.000> small<00:03:57.299> maps<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.810> like<00:03:58.260> medium<00:03:58.860> maps

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
like small small maps I like medium maps

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.069 
like small small maps I like medium maps
I<00:03:59.250> guess<00:03:59.430> the<00:04:00.239> other<00:04:00.269> mats<00:04:00.600> had<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.870> play<00:04:01.019> them

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
I guess the other mats had to play them

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.259 
I guess the other mats had to play them
a<00:04:01.200> bit<00:04:01.380> they<00:04:01.799> seemed<00:04:02.040> kinda<00:04:02.459> big<00:04:02.730> but<00:04:02.760> all

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
a bit they seemed kinda big but all

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.539 
a bit they seemed kinda big but all
crushed<00:04:03.660> together<00:04:03.980> it's<00:04:04.980> like<00:04:05.220> they're<00:04:05.400> like

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
crushed together it's like they're like

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.920 
crushed together it's like they're like
oh<00:04:05.700> well<00:04:05.910> we<00:04:06.060> went<00:04:06.180> back<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.570> bigger<00:04:06.720> maps

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
oh well we went back to the bigger maps

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.630 
oh well we went back to the bigger maps
but<00:04:07.140> we<00:04:07.290> made<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.470> mall<00:04:07.709> crush<00:04:07.950> together<00:04:08.250> so

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
but we made a mall crush together so

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.020 
but we made a mall crush together so
it's<00:04:09.360> like<00:04:09.630> ten<00:04:10.320> tiny<00:04:10.560> maps<00:04:10.950> in<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.459> one<00:04:11.790> I

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
it's like ten tiny maps in in one I

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.970 
it's like ten tiny maps in in one I
don't<00:04:12.690> know<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.900> haven't<00:04:13.230> really<00:04:13.560> played<00:04:13.799> him
