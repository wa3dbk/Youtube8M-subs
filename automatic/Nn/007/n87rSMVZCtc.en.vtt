00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.590 
subsection and you tip the rest of the
hair<00:02:29.380> away<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.890> then<00:02:30.550> now<00:02:30.760> after<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.390> have

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
hair away and then now after you have

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.110 
hair away and then now after you have
this<00:02:32.140> large<00:02:32.410> subsection<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.250> separate<00:02:34.090> it

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
this large subsection you separate it

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.860 
this large subsection you separate it
into<00:02:34.330> two<00:02:34.950> vertical<00:02:35.950> subsections<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.690> like

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
into two vertical subsections and I like

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.670 
into two vertical subsections and I like
to<00:02:37.990> give<00:02:38.140> my<00:02:39.660> pearls<00:02:40.660> while<00:02:41.080> I'm<00:02:41.230> wrapping

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
to give my pearls while I'm wrapping

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.990 
to give my pearls while I'm wrapping
around<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.950> iron<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.310> little<00:02:42.520> bit<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.820> twist

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
around the iron a little bit of a twist

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.730 
around the iron a little bit of a twist
so<00:02:43.210> it<00:02:43.330> gives<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.660> little<00:02:43.900> bit<00:02:44.260> more<00:02:44.440> glue

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
so it gives it a little bit more glue

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.520 
so it gives it a little bit more glue
sir<00:02:44.890> S<00:02:45.040> wave<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.550> remember<00:02:46.270> leave<00:02:46.720> those<00:02:47.050> ends

yes<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.720> go<00:02:53.040> almost<00:02:54.040> like<00:02:54.400> you're<00:02:54.520> going<00:02:54.700> to

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820

yes you go almost like you're going to
wrap<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:54.970> around<00:02:55.120> but<00:02:55.510> he<00:02:55.570> quite<00:02:55.780> down<00:02:55.990> so<00:02:56.200> it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
wrap it around but he quite down so it

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.680

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
has that nice curve to it and make sure

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.850 
has that nice curve to it and make sure
that<00:02:59.500> you<00:03:00.070> don't<00:03:00.430> do<00:03:01.209> this

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.850 

section<00:03:04.860> out<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.670> little<00:03:06.630> piece<00:03:06.960> right<00:03:07.260> next<00:03:07.800> to

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
section out a little piece right next to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.100 
section out a little piece right next to
your<00:03:07.950> part<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.420> don't<00:03:09.420> even<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.720> thought<00:03:09.900> that

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
your part you don't even I thought that

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.820 
your part you don't even I thought that
because<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:10.470> small<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:11.780> then<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:13.709> we

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
because it's so small and then like we

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.430 
because it's so small and then like we
did<00:03:14.010> again<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.569> horizontal<00:03:15.569> section<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.110> then

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
did again a horizontal section and then

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.410 
did again a horizontal section and then
again<00:03:16.740> you<00:03:16.920> split<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.400> into<00:03:17.670> two<00:03:17.790> vertical

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
again you split this into two vertical

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.570 
again you split this into two vertical
subsections<00:03:19.050> it<00:03:19.890> doesn't<00:03:20.160> matter<00:03:20.280> if<00:03:20.490> you

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
subsections it doesn't matter if you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.780 
subsections it doesn't matter if you
start<00:03:20.790> with<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.970> back<00:03:21.120> or<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.360> front<00:03:22.790> I'm

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790
