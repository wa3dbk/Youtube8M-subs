00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
was just absolutely vast and then in

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.920 
was just absolutely vast and then in
sort<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.519> regular<00:00:47.940> sized<00:00:48.180> rivers<00:00:48.660> what<00:00:48.900> we

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
sort of regular sized rivers what we

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.780 
sort of regular sized rivers what we

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
would all think of as rivers and then

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.630 
would all think of as rivers and then
little<00:00:51.330> tiny<00:00:51.720> channels<00:00:52.710> through<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.369> trees

these these berries come off the tree we
process<00:03:54.930> them<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.320> we<00:03:55.560> do<00:03:55.800> that<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.220> we

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
process them and we do that so that we

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.430
