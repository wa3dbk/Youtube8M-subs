00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.820
 Dense design have been made 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:31.930
 Furthermore, it is rare as mine craft 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:34.600
 Operations required to intercept vls and ballistic missiles that can actually launch missiles 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.780

 If it says that, it is out at the time of part 1 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.630
 The structure reproduces the real mixed type as much as possible 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.230
 A product that often gathers data 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:32.500

 please 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:51.500
 Say everyone in unexpected create the strongest air defense system 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.500
 I'm waiting for a lot of birds
