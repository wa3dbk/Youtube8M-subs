consecutive<00:01:41.909> plays<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.590> gotta<00:01:43.770> do

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
consecutive plays so we gotta do

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.280 
consecutive plays so we gotta do
something<00:01:44.250> about<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.930> not<00:01:46.049> gonna

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
