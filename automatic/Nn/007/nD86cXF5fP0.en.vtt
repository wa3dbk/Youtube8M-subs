00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.480
 you want spoilers I advise you not to watch this video because you have 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.869
 chapter 9 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.419
 woman did not show the final boss between this we say that it was euro delle 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.749
 typical ambrams valley really very fun this game 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.649
 this game is it's really cool &amp; lt 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.629
 first home battery before you start writing xena about the comments and this 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:35.879
 just didn't buy this lola game played through atlantis tvb 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.589
 friend who lent it to me for 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.240
 between. try it maybe play a video 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.990
 grillo has tried the cooperative version that I've seen videos of 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.610
 on youtube but it looks really fantastic 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.479
 and those who wanted to tell you this video what to talk about 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.539
 was. a moment of this game but above all paparazzi single baby girl 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.270
 playar del 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.470
 of the convenience - of buying them what of the arc kind 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.810
 I would like to make an introduction 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.210
 I think the price of a game should be directly 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.189
 proportional to the longevity of the game 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.420
 what i mean by more life tattoos 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.960
 meaning how long actually this game will take you away as much as 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.760
 how much you will play for as long as your husband takes care of you 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.740
 I mean that for a game that mike bongiorno I tupac ebay to him 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.980
 too much money perugia the beach like I don't know black ops and that we also play for 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.980
 6 months bar do to make for his 60 euros 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.190
 then where it leads to the cake at 2 costs estimate per pc placed 40 euros per 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.210
 the race to the weight that these other things seem to me the other are up too 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.700
 can make game stop 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.120
 and I had seen portal 2 70 euros for the trap cough they will not know 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.830
 tell me tell me you come in 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.390
 they are only a little in others with a sum of 70 euros a lot 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.930
 because you see say I don't know about you but I this game that oliviero jonathan that 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.039
 they brought then 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.910
 use me well enough 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.640
 I finished it the first time in something like chat 8 renault not so much more 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.799
 bubu i mean is to spend now we press the loreto price of the pc that 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:16.989
 it's 40 euros 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.760
 spend 40 euros for lighthouse days that you discover valentino the whole afternoon d 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.799
 game 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.569
 to me it doesn't look like a little messy face there is also the version 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.229
 cooperative that obviously I didn't try because I didn't want to 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:33.269
 requisitioning lacan, you have to relax for so long 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.709
 leading center we admit that even with the cooperative campaign 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:42.669
 I don't know what I say as long as I could bring you a week 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.849
 two weeks ago we are optimistic 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.160
 help. this is really wonderful 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.459
 I think I think that after having ended up overwhelmed 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.769
 I can say that if one is the best single-player game of the year 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.639
 certainly 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.569
 although we are only at the beginning of my wife I do not think that any game 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.260
 crash operate portal 2 from the genius of the dialogues above all because if 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:07.650
 you want dates in english 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.520
 maybe to help with English subtitles it's all another game really 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:15.789
 shit allergy 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.699
 where where of the fortress remained 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.109
 sister 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.139
 here I used to say longevity longevity the Kazakh portal 2 costs 40 euros 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.559
 sincerely 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:31.820
 to why is it that you are not enough 40 euros for rojo cake 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.689
 however it lasts 2 weeks 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.029
 ipadevice can buy it shawn battelfild 1 to ford added matter 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.369
 skater 15 euros 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:44.859
 instead of appearing even six months until when batterfly comes out between 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:45.670
 or anyway 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.309
 also also beyond 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:51.989
 riders actually condoning is a bit excessive price I mean myself 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.319
 compared to many on the swamp I really think they are the best developers 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.449
 of games though 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.789
 weight I think you also like the developers to understand that 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.149
 if they 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:04.969
 they give such a high price 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:09.339
 to a game that lasts so little they have to I must also up that that people 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:13.210
 expert let's say i didn't cristino the purchase is not much less though 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.579
 I'm sure that portal 2 wax 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.139
 will succeed the pasta room lot of palace sales will also be a lot of people 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.190
 that eighteenth-century night download had been via torrent or as an icon 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.630
 made of lollo share it with friends a 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.139
 because in the end it is located between the days 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.249
 3 days - I can lend lac. someone can senses honor playing days 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:34.140
 in the meantime 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.689
 obviously he I'm mine 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.069
 anyway 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.219
 and what to say then I heard that the version of ps3 maybe for what 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.189
 it cost a good 70 euros 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.189
 and anyway, correct me if I'm wrong 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.840
 I said the version of the expectations between you and this rain decided 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.990
 in between you can also play on the pc 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.560
 sasuke the system you can logarithm with the institute account that monster countess 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.509

 and walking among three people these days there were caravaggi 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.949

 that Charterhouse Genoa 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.949
 I have been celebrated as bearers of sharing we say 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:25.400
 efficiency to be shared on all platforms here 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.360
 because in the end everything is becoming increasingly digital when you when 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.460
 I buy a chin shop when you buy one a game at the store what it says piolti 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.629

 place try said what appears the license to play it cd cover in cd 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.580
 in one now you are not worth anything imdb red edge indexes of why is that the 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.580
 split weights at home 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:03.879

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.020

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:30.669
 which is causing that 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.069
 now estimate hosting the flap yes but I have a pie yourself the first time it does a 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:37.059

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:41.409

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.709
 maybe or I buy a game that's what I can play on xbox line up 

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:46.889

 on the way out of the terraces those of the console also with the estimated masses 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.189
 however cooperative games as a portal are not sure but I think a 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:10.270
 door you can play or a little person who gave us his 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.480

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.020
 since he has the course I'm completely ignorant in any case it is 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.229
 this we are atc giving to the final part that obviously 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:28.870
