00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.670
 Hello 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.550
 pescasub water containing a greeting from 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:39.710
 daniele i take care of what i am going to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.780
 show you today is the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.610
 the method I use to avoid 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.769
 that the nylon of our bola 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.840
 sinking in cuts more easily 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.199
 in the cross during our actions of 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.269
 country I do nothing but use gods 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.690
 float in fact with gods 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:02.809
 pieces of elastic that will be taken 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 with easy data and with a pair of scissors is 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:10.149
 inserted into the world up to 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:13.940
 this case a 140 try to make that 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:17.600
 the latter floats and I do n't 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.649
 sink into nylon then to begin with 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.060
 much with us our little 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.159
 piece of 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.960
 of elastic to make it 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.759
 slightly more dro and dynamic than me 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.149
 not having a use spring 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:38.439
 scissors and I do exactly 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:43.490
 this way, cut out the burgundy 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:49.000
 so two very coarse husband and then 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:57.130
 obliquely with cuts 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:01.060
 quite slow from a minting shape 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.060
 wearing a piece of alassio 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.989
 well so in this way but same 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.989
 it was the other part always board 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.770
 for fault 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.770
 oblique cut 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.330
 on 30 there is no need to do it much 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.180
 long and just don't make it of this 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.599
 long and with 33 cm maximum done 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.599
 recent 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:03.130
 once created this we will go to 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:09.120
 take our monofilament insert it 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:12.160
 inside the hole and make a double knot 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:17.640
 that first end so this one 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.640
 double new him 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:29.549
 ok the reason is pretty big I said 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:29.549
 I help myself with pliers like this 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:45.069
 and let's get over by pulling the limit 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.460
 of elasticity of the magician in the north after 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:54.770
 have an attractor of the return and therefore 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:56.210
 a hub can do the same 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.880
 thing 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.650
 from the other end of ours 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.880
 torpedo with a lot of hand anyway 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.880
 being an example 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.690
 we have to 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.669
 we blame ourselves 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:37.370
 it is possible perhaps that as you see the 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.169
 knot enter into my intervention 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.490
 in the axis this only happens 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.830
 when we are just about to go to 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.509
 creating in water there is no danger 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.400
 we risk making your 22 knots more 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.789
 possible at the extremes in the extremities 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.620
 of the correct and we repeat 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:59.020
 the operation therefore with each other 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:02.360
 stick for each of the 4 meters of nylon 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.220
 thread then to the more mature final lean than 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.639
 will be related to the pe langa the 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:11.419
 gun or whatever we want where we go 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:14.169
 us from a very pretty pain 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.550
 hydrodynamics will of course be later 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.680
 Apparently cones say maybe a little bit more 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.870
 perfect using a mole but 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.699
 trust that it is an easy method but 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.220
 cheap enough to always keep 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.190
 random inspections the most thing 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.940
 simple of the world that will solve a 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.450
 several 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:37.330
 not a few problems during 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.860
 fishing actions from the festival yes 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.770
 get tangled up take the middle of the 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.539
 rocks with that is all 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.539
 a salute to the whole forum ciao
