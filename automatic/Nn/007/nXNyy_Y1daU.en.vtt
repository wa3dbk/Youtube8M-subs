00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
out some of the systems what we do on

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
impressed by the by our team I think

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.460 
impressed by the by our team I think
obviously<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.650 

we<00:02:05.470> played<00:02:05.680> really<00:02:06.100> good<00:02:06.550> last<00:02:07.180> game<00:02:07.450> was<00:02:07.630> a

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
we played really good last game was a

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.530 
we played really good last game was a
tough<00:02:07.930> game<00:02:08.140> against<00:02:09.030> arguably<00:02:10.030> one<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
tough game against arguably one of the

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.470 
tough game against arguably one of the
best<00:02:10.780> teams<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.400> not<00:02:12.400> only<00:02:12.580> in<00:02:12.820> Europe<00:02:13.060> but<00:02:13.090> in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
best teams and not only in Europe but in

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.860 
best teams and not only in Europe but in
probably<00:02:13.990> in<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> world<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.060> was<00:02:16.210> it

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
probably in the world so so it was it

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.930 
probably in the world so so it was it
was<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:17.020> tough<00:02:17.290> test<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.890> obviously<00:02:18.220> we<00:02:18.400> didn't

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
was a tough test and obviously we didn't

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.820 
was a tough test and obviously we didn't
win<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.270> game<00:02:19.420> but<00:02:19.480> but<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.470> thought<00:02:20.680> we

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
win that game but but I thought we

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.410 
win that game but but I thought we
looked<00:02:21.040> at<00:02:21.190> at<00:02:21.340> times<00:02:21.580> especially<00:02:21.820> at<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.360> end

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
looked at at times especially at the end

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.330 
looked at at times especially at the end
of<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.660> game<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.740> been<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.920> while<00:02:24.130> since

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
of the game it's been a while since

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.920 
of the game it's been a while since
you're<00:02:24.550> played<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.090> Europe<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.510> think<00:02:25.720> that's

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
you're played in Europe you think that's

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.570 
you're played in Europe you think that's
gonna<00:02:26.050> be<00:02:26.170> easy<00:02:26.350> adjustment<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.490> the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
gonna be easy adjustment to the to the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.090 
gonna be easy adjustment to the to the
bigger<00:02:27.790> ice<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.500> don't<00:02:29.500> know<00:02:29.560> if<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:29.800> gonna<00:02:29.950> be

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
bigger ice I don't know if it's gonna be

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.790 
bigger ice I don't know if it's gonna be
easy<00:02:30.280> but<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:31.270> think<00:02:31.840> you'll<00:02:32.200> help<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.680> I'm

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
easy but I think you'll help that I'm

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.530 
easy but I think you'll help that I'm
European<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.730> grew<00:02:33.910> up<00:02:34.030> playing<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.450> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
European and I grew up playing on the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.960 
European and I grew up playing on the
big<00:02:34.720> ice<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.830> took<00:02:35.980> me<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.370> took<00:02:36.520> me<00:02:36.790> time

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
big ice so it took me it took me time

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.750 
big ice so it took me it took me time
when<00:02:37.210> I<00:02:37.240> went<00:02:37.420> from<00:02:37.600> North<00:02:37.960> America<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
when I went from North America and and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.480 
when I went from North America and and
hopefully<00:02:40.620> coming<00:02:41.620> back<00:02:41.800> here<00:02:42.010> won't<00:02:42.190> be<00:02:42.370> as

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
hopefully coming back here won't be as

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.890 
hopefully coming back here won't be as
big<00:02:42.670> as<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:43.660> an<00:02:43.840> adjustment<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:45.880> don't<00:02:46.630> think

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
big as of an adjustment so I don't think

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.890 
big as of an adjustment so I don't think
that<00:02:47.340> that's<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.610> huge<00:02:48.640> issue<00:02:49.540> it's<00:02:49.810> not

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
that that's a huge issue it's not

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.350 
that that's a huge issue it's not
something<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.410> think<00:02:50.560> about<00:02:50.680> anyways<00:02:51.360> finally

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
something I think about anyways finally

you well it's obviously it's an exodus
exhibition<00:03:01.180> game<00:03:01.330> but<00:03:01.570> still<00:03:02.190> there's<00:03:03.190> only

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
exhibition game but still there's only

exhibition game but still there's only
four<00:03:03.730> left<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.320> kind<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.680> want<00:03:05.860> to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
four left and and so I kind of want to

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.530 
four left and and so I kind of want to
get<00:03:06.070> going<00:03:06.250> here<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.760> want<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.030> get<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.180> get

get going here and I want to get a get
off<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.870> good<00:03:08.020> start<00:03:08.080> personally<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.070> as<00:03:09.220> a

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
off to a good start personally and as a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.880 
off to a good start personally and as a
team<00:03:09.550> I<00:03:09.580> think<00:03:09.760> we<00:03:10.000> wanted<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.140> take<00:03:11.560> your<00:03:11.650> step

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
team I think we wanted to take your step

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.710 
team I think we wanted to take your step
here<00:03:12.040> every<00:03:12.340> game<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:14.280> it's<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.760> think<00:03:16.209> just

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
here every game so it's I think just

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.140 
here every game so it's I think just
kind<00:03:16.840> of<00:03:17.020> fill<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.350> out<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.950> try<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:19.000> get

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
kind of fill it out and try to to get

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.570 
kind of fill it out and try to to get
into<00:03:19.450> things<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:20.200> get<00:03:20.980> into<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.340> flow<00:03:21.550> of

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
into things and get into the flow of

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.940 
into things and get into the flow of
things<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.270> then<00:03:22.450> kind<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.350> figure<00:03:23.680> out<00:03:23.739> how

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
things and then kind of figure out how

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.650 
things and then kind of figure out how
we<00:03:24.010> play<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.340> it's<00:03:24.760> easier<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.120> learn<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:25.540> in

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
we play and it's easier to learn it in

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.530 
we play and it's easier to learn it in
games<00:03:25.959> than<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.590> practice<00:03:26.770> too<00:03:27.540> because

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
games than it is in practice too because

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.390 
games than it is in practice too because
you<00:03:28.690> make<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.560> mistake<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:30.130> can<00:03:30.280> usually

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
you make a mistake you can usually
