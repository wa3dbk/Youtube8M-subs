00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.150
 Robert Schumann 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.320
 So how do you stop a refugee camp 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.610
 on the Syrian border must say it 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.820
 was pretty impressive as many 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.440
 people live their lives in such a space and 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.550
 how great it all works out anyway 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.650
 believe the employees are here 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.140
 great job 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.300
 Girls Day I never went through with 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.890
 was a totally committed and even if 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.910
 they rule-not really what belongs 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.140
 great fun 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.910
 the position brave to show that 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.930
 sport what is good and I hope we 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.020
 can help a bit 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.200
 I 'm warning wapiti camp right 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.050
 impress 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.240
 it is pulled in the television of the newspaper 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.700
 but he does not live that as a truth 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.100
 and when we were there, it was because I was you 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.340
 at opening that we look at everything 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.229
 can and speak with the people 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.229
 that's what moved me most of the time 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.220
 i think what i am most into 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.840
 Remembrance is the visit 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.190
 in the refugee camp yesterday in safari 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.580
 because it just so deeply 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.080
 human history is it is 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.610
 humanitarian catastrophe the political 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.220
 situation is still very complicated 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.950
 just what happened here now 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.990
 and goes on and on every day 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.880
 how 100,000 people handle it 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.460
 have to have lost everything and 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.320
 nevertheless the Lebensmut so 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.400
 maintain and carry on and 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.100
 lures the best of your situation 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.840
 But it was impressive 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.490
 interesting to see how worked 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.209
 actually in such areas what can 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.280
 You can help people and because they do 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.080
 just nice that we are with the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.900
 Girls could train because of that 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.820
 But natural life does not change 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.430
 you had at least for two hours 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.410
 to divert some of it the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.060
 somehow bombs twelve kilometers further 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.959
 explode and yes probably 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.430
 most of the camp still family friends 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.280
 you own whatever you can in syria 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.140
 have and yes that was really extreme in 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.250
 any aspect yes in the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.019
 refugee camp have course today 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.760
 also with those with a few young girls 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.980
 there can play football so our 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.240
 actresses 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.640
 it's just amazing to see how 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.160
 especially the young jews with joy am 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.600
 football games are and I have there came 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.950
 we realize that the sport is that 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.580
 movement and the bracket just that 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.740
 Soccer 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.420
 because actually as a game pretty much 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.570
 Everybody knows the rules 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.370
 are just that football one 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.540
 has special meaning and that we 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.160
 Today our team will be on site 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.750
 could be and help a bit 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.370
 could just that girls summer 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.000
 maybe more hours carefree against 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.490
 could 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.260
 that pleases us very much and I hope in 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.430
 august that sport in the 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.680
 refugee camp continues to be a solid 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.780
 I think that part remains 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.890
 are really the hours where you get the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.890
 can turn upside times completely
