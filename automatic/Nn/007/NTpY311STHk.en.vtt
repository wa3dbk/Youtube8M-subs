very different images are pretty much

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.800 
very different images are pretty much
made<00:02:28.019> out<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.230> plastic<00:02:29.209> it's<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.299> plastic

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
made out of plastic it's a plastic

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.440 
made out of plastic it's a plastic
substrate<00:02:31.049> checklist<00:02:32.120> p<00:02:33.120> boy<00:02:33.859> marcus<00:02:34.859> camby

substrate checklist p boy marcus camby

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.960 
substrate checklist p boy marcus camby
so<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:37.049> a<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.530> basically<00:02:38.310> like<00:02:38.819> I
