everything but she just sleeps heck a
while<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.860> let<00:02:02.009> her<00:02:02.100> sleep<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.430> her

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
hair out on the satin pillowcase

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.679 
hair out on the satin pillowcase
I<00:02:04.110> used<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> detangler<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.969> support<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
I used the detangler to support the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.900 
I used the detangler to support the
perimeter<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.500> her<00:02:07.649> hair<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:08.489> three<00:02:08.729> reasons

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
perimeter of her hair for three reasons

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.820 
perimeter of her hair for three reasons
one<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.629> easier<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.200> comb<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.440> glide

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
one is easier for the comb to glide

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.710 
one is easier for the comb to glide
through<00:02:11.160> if<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.700> use<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> brush<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.390> easier<00:02:12.599> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
through if I use a brush it's easier to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.880 
through if I use a brush it's easier to
brush<00:02:12.840> up

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
brush up

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.280 
brush up
and<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:14.760> helps<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.150> smooth<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.750> sides<00:02:15.959> as

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and it just helps to smooth the sides as

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.619 
and it just helps to smooth the sides as
