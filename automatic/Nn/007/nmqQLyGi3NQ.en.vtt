00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.950
 dotcom social today I want to talk to you 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.840
 the tea tree oil that is this 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.260
 small that I have here is an oil 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.210
 essential very concentrated that's why with 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.460
 inflammatory properties 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.110
 anti-inflammatory, forgiveness and bactericides 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.350
 so that's why it's recommended for 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.530
 our case of roses and I use it 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.809
 simply for granites or 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.790
 pustules or papules never for redness 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.190
 I have also read that it was used in 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.170
 acne cases so good these have 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.299
 very good properties for this and I have 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.769
 noticed its results and that's why I 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.049
 love and I wanted to recommend what 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.840
 then I'm going to teach you simply 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.170
 how I use it is very simple I 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.970
 I do with my clean hands 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.170
 I use a droplet as they are 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.700
 concentrated then is I apply 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.040
 just a droplet on the finger in the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.110
 finger tip and I put it with 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.659
 little touches in the part 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.909
 affected never giving massage ever 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.500
 rubbing nothing of that is very carefully 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.539
 other people use a swab 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.399
 of cotton but good I used 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.200
 the fingers because I like more in these 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.570
 people who say that they also 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.560
 they work to mix it with other oils 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.450
 exporters such as for example 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.890
 the jojoba oil the hemp oil 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.470
 or some oil that suits you 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.560
 I also give other utilities because 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.570
 is that it is change I love I use it 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.150

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.440

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.390
 I use if I have an infection 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.100
 urinary I put some droplets in the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.229
 salva is lip and this helps me a lot 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.000
 also or even if I get bitten 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.759
 mosquito then to remove the itch 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.479

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.459
