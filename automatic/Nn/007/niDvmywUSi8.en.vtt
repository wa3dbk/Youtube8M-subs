00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.860

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.500
 I raised many crepe and pasta but good 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.860
 let's start this is from minecraft x of the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.650

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.950
 vacation and I decided to play a little bit in the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.840
 game minecraft had installed about 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.150
 mods a couple of days ago but I did not 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.070
 they worked the screen went black and 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.200
 the mini craft disappeared one day 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.180
 I discovered that minecraft mods only 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.250
 they worked when you had the version 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.440
 correct I had installed in eternal 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.539
 craft they take intense and rain and I the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.879
 piqueria more one day discover a mod that 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.039
 it was called mod secret I saw it in a forum 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.440
 that I never got to find what I was going 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.239
 to report I downloaded it and installed it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.489
 I needed mutuals I put it in the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.649
 mini craft file a touch and between the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.660
 mini craft first mini craft did what 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.670
 that always happened but after 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.530
 try it four more times I got 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.540
 enter I entered my world called 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 infinity and I searched for the much secret but 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.860
 I did not find anything wait and so 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.020
 I started going into some caves that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.909
 they were watching everything was normal until 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.310
 listen 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.530
 what looked like a ghost laughing I 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.259
 I scared but I thought it was my imagination 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.299
 continue beeping until I found another 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.549
 cave that looked like a very long hall 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.380
 the hallway was so long that I did not get 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.450
 see the end of it I went into the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.700
 hallway and I put some torches but what 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.770
 that I saw in the end scared me a lot in the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.020
 part that had not yet put torches 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.060
 there was a twisted and tall silhouette with 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.189
 eyes that shone I stopped myself from 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.619
 fear and the eyes were approaching from 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.020
 my character then I heard the laughter 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.090
 maleficent and she said my name then 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.030
 I did something that I regretted I put a 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.099
 torch where a bug was immobile 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.619
 twisted with dark colors and with the 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:56.899
 mouth bleeding the scream you do not have 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.270
 enough guts to kill me you're a 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.489
 cowardly I will kill you the bug raised its 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.129
 arm that he was not square and pierced 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:06.500
 my character I put f5 to see my 

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:08.750
 character and I saw how his guts were 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.910
 falling behind his back then 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.030
 feel a very big belly pain and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.859
 that 's the only thing I remember I woke up in 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.780
 the hospital and my parents told me that 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:20.660
 I had a big wound in my belly but 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.640
 they fixed it after I went home 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.040
 on my computer and I saw that there was a notepad 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.770
 of notes on the main screen press 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.050
