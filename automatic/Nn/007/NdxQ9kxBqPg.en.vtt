which<00:00:00.420> explains<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.350> difference<00:00:01.860> between

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
which explains the difference between

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.180 
which explains the difference between
fish<00:00:02.820> oil<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.449> krill<00:00:03.899> oil<00:00:04.140> okay<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.040> question

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
fish oil and krill oil okay the question

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.720 
fish oil and krill oil okay the question
between<00:00:05.490> fish<00:00:06.029> oil<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.509> krill<00:00:07.200> oil<00:00:10.219> well<00:00:11.219> fish

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
between fish oil and krill oil well fish

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.530 
between fish oil and krill oil well fish
oil<00:00:11.969> comes<00:00:12.150> from<00:00:12.300> fish<00:00:12.450> that's<00:00:13.440> easy<00:00:13.679> one<00:00:13.920> so

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
oil comes from fish that's easy one so

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.109 
oil comes from fish that's easy one so
Creole<00:00:15.540> say<00:00:15.690> well<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.170> sounds<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.650> so

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
Creole say well this sounds so so

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.370 
Creole say well this sounds so so
interesting<00:00:18.119> like<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.750> came<00:00:18.960> from<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> planet

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
interesting like it came from the planet

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.150 
interesting like it came from the planet
Uranus

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
Uranus

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.910 
Uranus
well<00:00:20.580> krill<00:00:20.910> grill<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:22.140> simply<00:00:22.590> little

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
well krill grill are simply little

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.980 
well krill grill are simply little
shrimp

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
shrimp

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.420 
shrimp
very<00:00:25.439> well<00:00:25.619> shrimp<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.010> these<00:00:26.160> are<00:00:26.279> what

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
very well shrimp and these are what

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.609 
very well shrimp and these are what
whales<00:00:26.939> feed<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.630> they're<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.109> richest

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
whales feed on that they're the richest

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.200 
whales feed on that they're the richest
abundance<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.250> food<00:00:29.970> products<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:31.940> fish<00:00:32.940> oil

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
abundance of food products but fish oil

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.590 
abundance of food products but fish oil
is<00:00:34.160> when<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.250> pull<00:00:35.550> out<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.790> fish<00:00:36.000> oil<00:00:36.210> it's

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
is when you pull out the fish oil it's

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.110 
is when you pull out the fish oil it's
in<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> form<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.230> triglyceride<00:00:38.000> when<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
in the form of a triglyceride when you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.869 
in the form of a triglyceride when you
basically<00:00:39.480> take<00:00:39.870> krill<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> form<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
basically take krill it's in the form of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.590 
basically take krill it's in the form of
a<00:00:42.030> phospholipid<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.820> extract<00:00:45.059> out<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
a phospholipid and to extract out the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.510 
a phospholipid and to extract out the
fish<00:00:45.750> oil<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.050> pretty<00:00:46.200> easy<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.710> take<00:00:47.250> fish

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
fish oil is pretty easy you take fish

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.790 
fish oil is pretty easy you take fish
and<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.059> boil<00:00:48.329> them<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.719> all<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> fish<00:00:49.530> oil

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and you boil them and all the fish oil

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.369 
and you boil them and all the fish oil
floats<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> top<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:51.449> nice<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:52.050> as

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
floats to the top that's nice that's as

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.959 
floats to the top that's nice that's as
you<00:00:52.860> know<00:00:52.949> that's<00:00:53.280> green<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
you know that's green to get out the

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.810 
you know that's green to get out the
krill<00:00:56.969> oil<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.780> take<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.140> krill<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
krill oil you have to take the krill and

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.750 
krill oil you have to take the krill and
extract<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.530> methanol<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.829> chloroform

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
extract it with methanol and chloroform

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.800 
extract it with methanol and chloroform
-<00:01:03.719> very<00:01:04.049> very<00:01:04.110> toxic<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:05.180> solvents<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.270> then

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
- very very toxic of solvents and then

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.510 
- very very toxic of solvents and then
hope<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.320> get<00:01:07.470> rid<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:07.920> those<00:01:08.070> toxic

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
hope you get rid of all those toxic

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.230 
hope you get rid of all those toxic
solvents<00:01:09.380> now<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:11.280> need<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.520> get<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.850> krill

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
solvents now we need to get out krill

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.469 
solvents now we need to get out krill
oil<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:13.020> fish<00:01:13.380> oil<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.920> still<00:01:14.700> contaminated

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
oil or fish oil it's still contaminated

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.380 
oil or fish oil it's still contaminated
all<00:01:16.200> sorts<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.100> nasty<00:01:17.490> things<00:01:17.970> like

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
all sorts of really nasty things like

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.080 
all sorts of really nasty things like
PCBs<00:01:19.049> are<00:01:19.080> still<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.619> there<00:01:19.770> now<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.880> rid

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
PCBs are still in there now to get rid

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
PCBs are still in there now to get rid
of<00:01:21.150> those<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> fish<00:01:21.900> oil<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.409> break<00:01:23.100> down

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
of those in the fish oil you break down

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.330 
of those in the fish oil you break down
the<00:01:23.490> triglycerides<00:01:24.210> into<00:01:24.540> what<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.200> called

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
the triglycerides into what are called

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.010 
the triglycerides into what are called
methyl<00:01:26.340> esters<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.360> distill<00:01:27.780> them

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
methyl esters and you can distill them

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.679 
methyl esters and you can distill them
over<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.740> leave<00:01:29.400> all<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.119> bad<00:01:30.329> stuff

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
over and leave all the really bad stuff

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.060 
over and leave all the really bad stuff
in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> pot<00:01:31.909> because<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.240> phospholipids<00:01:34.070> they

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
in the pot because of phospholipids they

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.200 
in the pot because of phospholipids they
can't<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.520> stilled<00:01:35.759> over

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
can't be as stilled over

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.170 
can't be as stilled over
you<00:01:36.930> can't<00:01:37.200> purify<00:01:37.590> them<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.640> when<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.030> now

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you can't purify them so when you now

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.550 
you can't purify them so when you now
look<00:01:39.630> at<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.970> purity<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.450> an<00:01:42.630> oil<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.500> you

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
look at the purity of an oil what do you

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
look at the purity of an oil what do you
want<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.770> looking<00:01:44.040> at<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.360> levels

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
want we looking at is really the levels

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.800 
want we looking at is really the levels
of<00:01:45.979> PCBs<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:47.939> that's<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> marker

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
of PCBs because that's that's the marker

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.420 
of PCBs because that's that's the marker
of<00:01:49.020> how<00:01:50.000> pure<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> oil<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.350> more<00:01:52.560> PCBs<00:01:53.159> and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
of how pure the oil is the more PCBs and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.899 
of how pure the oil is the more PCBs and
all<00:01:54.270> oils<00:01:54.720> krill<00:01:55.140> oil<00:01:55.170> fish<00:01:55.920> oil<00:01:56.070> will<00:01:56.610> contain

all oils krill oil fish oil will contain

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.980 
all oils krill oil fish oil will contain
them<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:58.049> less<00:01:58.200> pure<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.630> to<00:02:00.630> look<00:02:00.840> at

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
them the less pure it is and to look at

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.730 
them the less pure it is and to look at
a<00:02:01.110> PCBs<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> use<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> very<00:02:02.520> very

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
a PCBs you have to use a very very

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.639 
a PCBs you have to use a very very
sophisticated<00:02:04.740> test<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:06.140> using<00:02:07.140> electron

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
sophisticated test of using electron

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.850 
sophisticated test of using electron
beam<00:02:07.920> capture<00:02:08.459> technology<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.530> what<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.649> see

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
beam capture technology and what you see

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.760 
beam capture technology and what you see
that<00:02:11.129> anytime<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.520> see<00:02:11.700> something<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that anytime you see something that is
