is<00:01:33.090> we're<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> set<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.240> arena<00:01:36.240> high<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
is we're going to set the arena high and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.840 
is we're going to set the arena high and
low<00:01:37.170> points<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.950> these<00:01:38.070> are<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> boundaries

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
low points so these are the boundaries

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
low points so these are the boundaries
the<00:01:39.119> battery's<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.900> player's<00:01:40.409> can't<00:01:40.740> go

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the battery's a player's can't go

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.249 
the battery's a player's can't go
outside<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.400> boundaries<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.030> set<00:01:42.360> so

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
outside the boundaries that we set so

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.990 
outside the boundaries that we set so
I'm<00:01:43.590> trying<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.890> keep<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.189> line<00:01:44.399> with<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I'm trying to keep in line with that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.460 
I'm trying to keep in line with that
fence<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:45.570> there<00:01:45.630> because<00:01:46.049> that's<00:01:46.170> pretty

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
fence right there because that's pretty

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.760 
fence right there because that's pretty
much<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.829> last<00:01:47.460> part<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> arena<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.899> what

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
much the last part of the arena and what

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.929 
much the last part of the arena and what
we<00:01:49.860> want<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.340> want<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.490> set<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.759> high

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
we want to do is we want to set the high

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.520 
we want to do is we want to set the high
corner<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.509> our<00:01:51.630> arena<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> low

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
corner of our arena and then the low

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.020 
corner of our arena and then the low
corner<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.100> low<00:01:53.250> corner<00:01:53.549> would<00:01:53.700> obviously

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
corner so the low corner would obviously

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.179 
corner so the low corner would obviously
be<00:01:54.180> over<00:01:54.509> there<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.110> I'm<00:01:55.439> at<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> high<00:01:55.860> corner

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
everything in between those two corners

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.110 
everything in between those two corners
and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
just have the grand /o ITC set bounds

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.090 
just have the grand /o ITC set bounds

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
instead of high you're gonna type in low

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
that both points and yeah so we're done

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.600 
that both points and yeah so we're done
with<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.350> part<00:02:35.530> now<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.040> next<00:02:36.310> part<00:02:36.460> that<00:02:36.490> we

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
with that part now the next part that we

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.800 
with that part now the next part that we
want<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.820> do<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:36.970> want<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.210> set<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.390> max<00:02:37.660> amount

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
want to do is want to set the max amount

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.960 
want to do is want to set the max amount
of<00:02:37.990> players<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:38.650> be<00:02:38.800> on<00:02:39.070> this<00:02:39.340> game<00:02:39.610> so

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
of players that can be on this game so

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.150 
of players that can be on this game so
obviously<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.420> max<00:02:40.660> wants<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.080> be<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.920> amount

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
obviously the max wants to be the amount

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.890 
obviously the max wants to be the amount
of<00:02:42.190> spawn<00:02:42.580> points<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.060> set<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.480> most

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
of spawn points that you set the most

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.210 
of spawn points that you set the most
amount<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.230> spawn<00:02:44.440> points<00:02:44.710> that<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:44.860> set<00:02:45.100> so

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
amount of spawn points that you set so

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.070 
amount of spawn points that you set so
if<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.400> set<00:02:45.580> 20<00:02:45.910> then<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.180> max<00:02:46.360> would<00:02:46.510> be<00:02:46.600> 20

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
if you set 20 then the max would be 20

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.770 
if you set 20 then the max would be 20
I<00:02:47.110> set<00:02:47.710> 4<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.100> I'm<00:02:48.160> going<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.370> make<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.760> 4<00:02:49.360> so

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
I set 4 so I'm going to make that 4 so

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.070 
I set 4 so I'm going to make that 4 so
/i<00:02:50.110> ytc<00:02:50.620> set<00:02:51.270> max<00:02:52.270> oh<00:02:52.750> yeah<00:02:53.700> set<00:02:54.700> max<00:02:55.270> players

/i ytc set max oh yeah set max players

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.450 
/i ytc set max oh yeah set max players
the<00:02:57.070> arena<00:02:57.340> name<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.880> then<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.450> number<00:02:59.070> so<00:03:00.070> 4

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
the arena name and then the number so 4

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.730 
the arena name and then the number so 4
and<00:03:01.450> then<00:03:01.690> there<00:03:01.810> we<00:03:01.870> go<00:03:01.990> so<00:03:02.170> we<00:03:02.350> want<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.620> set

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
and then there we go so we want to set

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.400 
and then there we go so we want to set
the<00:03:02.800> minimum<00:03:03.070> now<00:03:03.370> so<00:03:03.790> it's<00:03:04.090> pretty<00:03:04.270> easy<00:03:04.510> same

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
the minimum now so it's pretty easy same

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.990 
the minimum now so it's pretty easy same
command<00:03:05.739> except<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.190> won't<00:03:06.340> change<00:03:06.459> max<00:03:06.790> 2

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
command except you won't change max 2

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.180 
command except you won't change max 2
min<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:07.540> then<00:03:07.840> change<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.830> whatever<00:03:09.010> you

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
min and then change it to whatever you

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.350 
min and then change it to whatever you
want<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.520> I'm<00:03:09.580> gonna<00:03:09.670> have<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.970> minimum

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
want so I'm gonna have the minimum

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.620 
want so I'm gonna have the minimum
minimum<00:03:11.140> as<00:03:11.380> -<00:03:12.120> there<00:03:13.120> we<00:03:13.239> go

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
minimum as - there we go

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.350 
minimum as - there we go
so<00:03:14.440> if<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.739> have<00:03:14.920> like<00:03:15.190> VIP<00:03:15.550> or<00:03:15.910> donator

pretty<00:05:11.530> much<00:05:11.650> how<00:05:11.770> this<00:05:11.860> works<00:05:12.220> is<00:05:12.490> on<00:05:12.759> the

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
pretty much how this works is on the

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.790 
pretty much how this works is on the
first<00:05:13.150> line<00:05:13.360> this<00:05:13.690> is<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.930> actual<00:05:14.320> command

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
first line this is the actual command

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.890 
first line this is the actual command
and<00:05:15.130> there's<00:05:15.400> no<00:05:15.520> slashes<00:05:16.000> needed<00:05:16.330> but<00:05:16.539> every

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
and there's no slashes needed but every

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.890 
and there's no slashes needed but every
line<00:05:17.139> is<00:05:17.349> an<00:05:17.620> additional<00:05:18.340> space<00:05:18.699> so<00:05:19.120> since<00:05:19.750> we

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
line is an additional space so since we

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.360 
line is an additional space so since we
have<00:05:19.990> three<00:05:20.289> words<00:05:20.530> it's<00:05:20.919> gonna<00:05:21.039> take<00:05:21.280> up

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
have three words it's gonna take up

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.589 
have three words it's gonna take up
three<00:05:21.669> lines<00:05:21.909> so<00:05:22.530> ITC<00:05:23.530> join<00:05:24.070> nuketown<00:05:24.789> done

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
three lines so ITC join nuketown done

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.450 
three lines so ITC join nuketown done
and<00:05:25.900> then<00:05:26.110> there<00:05:26.259> we<00:05:26.349> go<00:05:26.530> so<00:05:26.889> if<00:05:26.979> we<00:05:27.130> actually

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
and then there we go so if we actually

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.310 
and then there we go so if we actually
test<00:05:27.699> this<00:05:27.820> command<00:05:28.150> now<00:05:28.360> alright<00:05:29.020> clicking

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
test this command now alright clicking

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.810 
test this command now alright clicking

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
we are sent here and the command sign

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.409 
we are sent here and the command sign
