00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.060
 very good kids we made a video 

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:05.740
 I bring a video of why they have 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.900
 banned people to people to 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.180
 gta 5 online players have them 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.320
 shot because I've seen many theories and 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.400
 asked also by twitter that if 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.410
 you want me to have them because they have 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.660
 said yes he is telling us 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.580
 stories and then I decide to upload it 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.710
 because I've seen several theories for 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.720
 twitter that did not get in my head 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.100
 they seemed very childish because I did not 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.420
 being to think that such a company 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.590
 great as you can watch videos of 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.859
 youtube but good I will explain the 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.990
 seen videos that say that rockstar's 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.479
 YouTube videos ers and then it 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.390
 take the air just those 

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:40.089
 see in the video and take it and for and with 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.889
 that they put the computer and take the one 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.690
 It seems an outrageous thing 

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:45.309
 logic that does not come to my head like 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.780
 I had thought that I do not know if it will be a child 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.940
 some of this but they are looking 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.010
 videos and almost all day the same way 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.269
 that I thought was very weird so you look 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.059
 I one thing that they have been teaching me 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.010
 several colleagues how good is I have several 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.199
 friends are banned no and we've gone 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.670
 looking at things and how well we have 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.159
 what to do to know if we are going to be 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.940
 banned or if they have handled us because 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.100
 such good 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.380
 here we are social club you have to 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.119
 be registered let's go to it as you see 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.470
 let's go to games we are in social 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.869
 pro homepage you have everything in the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.240
 description we go to games we know the 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.590
 game that gets gta 5 and when we are 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.840
 in management 5 here we appear michael 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.000
 franklin trevor and your online player is 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.860
 the most important thing here you see all 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.619
 your stats the rp that you've 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.540
 won all the things you've won 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.100
 but very important let's go to this 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.299
 I've lost money, I do not know how 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.210
 you are watching I am recording with the 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.710
 action money earned as you see here what 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.330
 more important here because it puts here thousand 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.729
 activity bet statistics 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.369
 of I do not know what the most important thing is the 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.979
 because car sales leads Masters 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.450
 the grays of money are made with even if 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.740
 earning a lot of money are made with the 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.229
 car sale can not do another 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.880
 way if I do not confuse the new background 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.220
 you correct me I think it's with the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.720
 car sales so what's up I 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.460
 almost never made a money click 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.539
 just to teach you because not 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.700
 it catches my attention more than anything 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.929
 bored and there are many people who abuse 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.640
 this starts making money money 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.960
 money money I do not know what they want 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.090
 So much money because with a million and a 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.560
 it's enough for you I think one million two million 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.450
 of coarse 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.300
 they make so much money that they abuse and have 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.310
 here I had 50 million 50 million 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.900
 dollars sold in sainz cars 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.060
 awesome that's a lot of money 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.370
 so what's up I think rockstar 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.319
 has caught said come come we have a couple 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.510
 of people who have more than 50 million or 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.760
 of 30 million and we have realized 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.220
 that is impossible and is illegal and less 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.269
 The sale of cars is very because every 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.370
 half an hour you have to sell one 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.160
 legally then with the clichÃ©s what 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.599
 you take away is that time because that there 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.340
 many people who have banned them because 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.660
 have abused one hundred percent liked 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.640
 but from the host I have people who 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.890
 he had 250 million and of course they have 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.989
 here you are caught on a month and play 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.220
 take for ass as a thing of these 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.680
 It can happen to you if you have 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.030
 here more than that 20 million 20 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.830
 million I think it's a bit unreal 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.599
 I have four with four million no 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.769
 we're going to knock on wood because 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.750
 they have not changed me and I do not want 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.040
 they put me on and so I do not expect anything 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.140
 have liked this video is a 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.580
 information a theory of mine I do not say 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.110
 that is real and nothing like that but 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.610
 good che more stable in reality I 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.530
 I think you have noticed these in the 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.580
 statistics and nothing else would be that I hope 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.680
 that you liked that you liked about this 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.359
 information please give me love and 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.030
 share it with your friends 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.860
 because a lot of people ask this question 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.720
 because it can be a reason this one does not 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.069
 know I hope you liked it and we 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.069
