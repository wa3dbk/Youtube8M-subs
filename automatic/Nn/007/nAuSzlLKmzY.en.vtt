he's<00:02:20.670> also<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:21.000> really<00:02:21.300> demanding<00:02:21.780> conductor

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
he's also a really demanding conductor

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.280 
he's also a really demanding conductor

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
and he won't let go of anything if it's

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.670 
and he won't let go of anything if it's
not<00:02:25.470> right<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:25.890> him<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:27.680> very

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
not right for him and that's very

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.250 
not right for him and that's very
difficult<00:02:29.190> because<00:02:29.730> if<00:02:30.300> you're<00:02:30.930> not<00:02:31.050> getting

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
difficult because if you're not getting

something right it's very frustrating

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.370 
something right it's very frustrating
because<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.600> feel<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.080> can't<00:02:34.230> get

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
because you just feel like you can't get

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.020 
because you just feel like you can't get
it<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:34.980> at<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.130> same<00:02:35.370> time<00:02:35.580> it's<00:02:35.790> really

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
it but at the same time it's really

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.750 
it but at the same time it's really
great<00:02:36.180> because<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:37.680> feel<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:37.890> once<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.640> do
