the completed look so there's a light

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.339 
the completed look so there's a light
color<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> corner<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.810> darker<00:00:28.140> shade

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
color on a corner and the darker shade

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.019 
color on a corner and the darker shade
and<00:00:28.619> I've<00:00:28.830> actually<00:00:28.949> unused<00:00:29.490> three<00:00:29.699> colors

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and I've actually unused three colors

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.229 
and I've actually unused three colors
from<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.390> mix<00:00:30.779> palette<00:00:31.260> right<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.279> I

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
from this mix palette right here and I

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.720 
from this mix palette right here and I
actually<00:00:33.809> think<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.500> bit<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.070> dupe<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
actually think it's a bit of a dupe of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.940 
actually think it's a bit of a dupe of
three<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> colors<00:00:36.899> from<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.500> Naked

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
three of the colors from the Naked

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.180 
three of the colors from the Naked
palette<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:39.540> think<00:00:40.200> I've<00:00:40.320> explained<00:00:40.739> or<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
palette and I think I've explained or I

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.430 
palette and I think I've explained or I
will<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.760> explaining<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.360> couple<00:00:43.170> seconds

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
will be explaining a couple seconds

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.619 
will be explaining a couple seconds
later<00:00:43.670> but<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.910> reminds<00:00:45.390> me<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:46.190> sin<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.629> naked

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
later but it reminds me of sin and naked

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.860 
later but it reminds me of sin and naked

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870

palette<00:00:55.289> colors<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:57.050> Naked

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
