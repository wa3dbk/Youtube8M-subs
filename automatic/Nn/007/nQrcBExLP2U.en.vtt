is<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.480> prefer<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.629> river<00:00:48.840> over<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> lakes

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
is I prefer the river over all the lakes

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.639 
is I prefer the river over all the lakes
because<00:00:51.449> every<00:00:51.719> time<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.050> come<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> river

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
because every time you come to the river

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.100 
because every time you come to the river
the<00:00:53.399> efficient<00:00:53.789> structure<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.539> lot<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.899> times

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the efficient structure a lot of times

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.830 
the efficient structure a lot of times
that<00:00:55.230> you've<00:00:55.410> never<00:00:55.590> fished<00:00:55.860> before<00:00:56.840> because

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that you've never fished before because

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.029 
that you've never fished before because
of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.800> rain<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.480> flooding<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:01.039> puts

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
of the rain and the flooding and it puts

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.929 
of the rain and the flooding and it puts
new<00:01:02.190> logs<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.820> takes<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.359> old<00:01:03.539> logs<00:01:03.750> out<00:01:04.939> so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
new logs in takes the old logs out so

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
new logs in takes the old logs out so
it's<00:01:06.119> different<00:01:06.750> every<00:01:07.110> time<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.680> come

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it's different every time that you come

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
it's different every time that you come
when<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:09.080> come<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> river<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.830> never

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
three three and a half pounds and we

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.790 
three three and a half pounds and we
lost<00:02:17.970> him<00:02:18.150> three<00:02:18.989> three<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.380> half<00:02:19.500> pound

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
lost him three three and a half pound

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.030 
lost him three three and a half pound
apiece<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:21.230> we've<00:02:22.230> done<00:02:22.440> pretty<00:02:22.620> good<00:02:22.890> today

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
apiece so we've done pretty good today

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.300 
apiece so we've done pretty good today
but<00:02:23.519> I<00:02:24.290> would<00:02:25.290> say<00:02:25.590> today<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:25.950> not<00:02:26.040> an

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
but I would say today is not an

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.030 
but I would say today is not an
exceptional<00:02:26.940> day<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.390> river<00:02:27.890> it's<00:02:28.890> just

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
exceptional day on the river it's just

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.940 
exceptional day on the river it's just
an<00:02:29.190> average<00:02:29.370> day<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.090> we<00:02:30.989> had<00:02:31.140> five<00:02:31.440> fish<00:02:31.739> that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
an average day and we had five fish that

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.320 
an average day and we had five fish that
weighed<00:02:32.100> over<00:02:32.250> 17<00:02:32.850> pounds<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:35.120> know<00:02:36.120> we

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
weighed over 17 pounds so you know we

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.100 
weighed over 17 pounds so you know we
did<00:02:36.480> okay<00:02:37.760> I'd<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.150> 17<00:02:39.720> pounds

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110
