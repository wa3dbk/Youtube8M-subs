you want to pronounce it and if you want
a<00:01:16.979> close<00:01:17.189> why<00:01:17.640> why<00:01:18.270> don't<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.600> for

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
a close why why don't we know for

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.120 
a close why why don't we know for
example<00:01:18.930> right<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.549> press<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
example right one you just press it and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.660 
example right one you just press it and
it<00:01:23.130> goes<00:01:23.880> back<00:01:24.210> here<00:01:24.600> making<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.439> wall<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.159> mean<00:01:26.520> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it goes back here making a wall I mean a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.880 
it goes back here making a wall I mean a
hole<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> wall<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.799> you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
hole in the wall and then you

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.469 
hole in the wall and then you
switch<00:01:30.670> this<00:01:31.000> lever<00:01:31.890> which<00:01:33.120> fills<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.300> hole

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
switch this lever which fills the hole

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.859 
switch this lever which fills the hole
and<00:01:34.800> it's<00:01:35.800> all<00:01:36.360> how<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:37.540> works<00:01:37.810> better<00:01:39.869> now

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
and it's all how it works better now

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.640 
and it's all how it works better now
let's<00:01:41.170> close<00:01:41.619> all<00:01:42.040> on<00:01:42.550> them<00:01:43.050> like<00:01:44.050> this<00:01:44.260> and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
let's close all on them like this and

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.810 
let's close all on them like this and
let's<00:01:45.369> go<00:01:45.520> outside<00:01:45.910> here<00:01:46.830> so<00:01:47.830> here<00:01:48.550> is<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
let's go outside here so here is the

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.370 
let's go outside here so here is the
lever<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:50.009> those<00:01:51.009> are<00:01:51.220> sticky<00:01:51.940> pistons

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
lever and those are sticky pistons

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.399 
lever and those are sticky pistons
person<00:01:53.380> modest<00:01:53.800> as<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:55.030> may<00:01:55.420> have<00:01:55.450> seen<00:01:56.020> in<00:01:56.350> my

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
person modest as you may have seen in my

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.359 
person modest as you may have seen in my
previous<00:01:57.159> video<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:58.420> just<00:01:58.869> mod<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.440> gives

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
previous video it's just mod that gives

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.779 
previous video it's just mod that gives
you<00:02:00.640> items<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:01.479> push<00:02:01.840> blocks<00:02:02.789> normal

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
you items that push blocks normal

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.540 
you items that push blocks normal
pistons<00:02:04.000> just<00:02:04.450> pushed<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.229> block<00:02:05.500> but<00:02:05.890> sticky

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
pistons just pushed the block but sticky

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.370 
pistons just pushed the block but sticky
piston<00:02:06.940> as<00:02:07.119> it<00:02:08.019> goes<00:02:08.289> back<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:09.160> also<00:02:09.869> takes<00:02:10.869> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
piston as it goes back it also takes the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.520 
piston as it goes back it also takes the
block<00:02:11.650> back<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:13.360> i<00:02:13.660> will<00:02:13.930> show<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.200> how<00:02:14.320> it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
block back so i will show you how it

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.220 
block back so i will show you how it
works<00:02:14.560> tape<00:02:15.160> step<00:02:15.610> by<00:02:15.790> step<00:02:16.030> first<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.900> all<00:02:16.989> i

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
works tape step by step first of all i

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.750 
works tape step by step first of all i
push<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.910> yes<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:23.130> there's<00:02:24.130> there's

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
push it this yes and it there's there's

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.070 
push it this yes and it there's there's
torch<00:02:25.180> right<00:02:25.720> here<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.200> mean<00:02:26.760> switch<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.080> it

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
torch right here I mean switch and it

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.040 
torch right here I mean switch and it
pours<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:29.680> redstone<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.610> goes<00:02:31.000> here<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.600> it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
pours this redstone it goes here and it

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.350 
pours this redstone it goes here and it
reverts<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.940> wood<00:02:34.620> goes<00:02:35.620> back<00:02:36.459> here<00:02:37.060> to

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
reverts and the wood goes back here to

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.650 
reverts and the wood goes back here to
this<00:02:37.510> place<00:02:37.780> where<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.860> should<00:02:39.100> be<00:02:39.660> because

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
this place where it should be because

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.199 
this place where it should be because
this<00:02:41.200> piston<00:02:41.769> did<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:43.920> then<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.730> have<00:02:46.060> to

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
this piston did it then you have to

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.410 
this piston did it then you have to
choose<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.780> window<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:48.010> it's<00:02:48.850> pretty<00:02:49.180> simple
