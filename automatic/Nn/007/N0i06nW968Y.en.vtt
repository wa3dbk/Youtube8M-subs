a<00:00:09.780> nice<00:00:09.990> change<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.440> pace<00:00:10.500> from<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.040> first<00:00:11.280> one

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
a nice change of pace from the first one

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.690 
a nice change of pace from the first one
that<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.840> kind<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.830> gained<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.309> ability<00:00:14.400> to

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
that I kind of gained the ability to

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.210 
that I kind of gained the ability to
play<00:00:15.000> through<00:00:15.509> all<00:00:15.900> three<00:00:16.470> characters<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
play through all three characters in the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.189 
play through all three characters in the
second<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:17.699> versus<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.779> playing<00:00:19.050> this

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
second one versus just playing this

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.689 
second one versus just playing this
slide<00:00:19.470> from<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> first<00:00:19.980> one<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.279> kind<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.520> gave

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
slide from the first one it kind of gave

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.380 
slide from the first one it kind of gave
a<00:00:20.760> different<00:00:21.660> dynamic<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.320> game<00:00:22.500> which

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
a different dynamic to the game which

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.339 
a different dynamic to the game which
although<00:00:24.390> I'm<00:00:24.750> Marie<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.750> power<00:00:27.750> down<00:00:28.080> those

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
although I'm Marie and power down those

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.950 
although I'm Marie and power down those
searchlights<00:00:28.619> Marie<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.550> Bentley<00:00:29.960> are

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
searchlights Marie and Bentley are

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.700 
searchlights Marie and Bentley are
definitely<00:00:31.830> power<00:00:32.520> challenging<00:00:33.450> of

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
definitely power challenging of

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.110 
definitely power challenging of
characters<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> play<00:00:34.890> since<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.700> can't<00:00:35.940> jump

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
characters to play since you can't jump

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.869 
characters to play since you can't jump
around<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.630> easily<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.260> do<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.399> do<00:00:38.610> like

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
around as easily I do like it I do like

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.520 
around as easily I do like it I do like
the<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.660> different<00:00:39.930> dynamic<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.350> they

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the the different dynamic that they

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:51.770 
the the different dynamic that they
bring<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> game

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.430 

I<00:00:52.399> hope<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.699> general<00:00:54.300> guy<00:00:54.539> told<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.110> truth

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
I hope that general guy told the truth
