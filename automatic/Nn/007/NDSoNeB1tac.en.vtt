00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:23.950
 Good game is just a 750 cb head 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:37.610
 cb even that cb 750 is not cbx and it 75 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:42.100
 76 and a head according to the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:45.820
 Owner already done, it's new, right? 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.820
 I dismounted to clean it 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:56.600
 see the following night note here 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:01.080
 as tarsus and arise and the valves 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.530
 they are all spent on their heads already 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.150
 O 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.640
 all crush all crumpled and CONSEG 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.770
 from regulation back to f hurting hurting 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.770
 knocking noise gets around 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.290
 the worst admission sessions 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 and down here you know it is based on thin 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.280
 to immerse the tank, use the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.140
 that more at the end of the useful life already launch 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.539
 money then what they did then 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.110
 in their heads probably what they 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:54.360
 dismantled mark all the laps 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:56.850
 or 3214 tie had put a retainer 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.569
 and nothing more 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.890
 This is it, guys, do head swapping 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:06.330
 repainting and it is no use dismantling a 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.730
 disassemble to change the 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.680
 heads is dead in the 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.340
 guide arrived in milan that there are good 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.580
 days a year 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.370
 - is it not that Jesus had such then what 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.459
 the process will return to grinding is a 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.130
 book what ever happens I had 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.190
 I committed myself with him to dismount 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.890
 a poor cleaning and take a look at what 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.440
 I had to do it if it was just cleaning. 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.400
 to change around the head had 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.900
 I was going to do it here but in this 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.630
 situation here this has to stop the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.959
 Cute centralia machine do the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.620
 angle here gives the valve to rectify the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.620
 head 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.230
 to rectify valve seat did not seat 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.160
 alves mariano she identified from 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.410
 to adjust the angle it verifies the 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.040
 to build the settlement 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.519
 final or not and that go to the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.980
 really doing real with no way 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:19.599
 to function well in this way if they take the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.569
 People usually sit with that folder. 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:27.549
 just dive it goes from the fence 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:33.940
 engine will work more one gets the 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:36.599
 way it should be and not counting the 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.599
 cylinder right 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:49.010
 separate reading is another thing they did 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:52.930
 has also been identified and is 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.750
 As aero stander 62 e mail 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.390
 native is so poorly made so badly made 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:08.570
 You can see the sign of David and he has opened a hole. 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:11.600
 there those risks there 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.580
 tool that goes right here opened a 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:20.540
 hole very poorly made that clearing the 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:23.660
 measure and leave this way overused 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.350
 and walked ahead you quoted some 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.530
 thing of the year already asked and the sides and 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.260
 give it a little bit off now 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.160
 We do not know how to quote a displaced hole. 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.180
 so do not 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.610
 or if it is out of square 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.720
 there only in the grindstone to know then also 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:49.810
 You're going to have to go there right there. 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.810
 already knows since dedicates to make 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:04.100
 I went into one that had a lot of use. 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:08.470
 long time and did not run this engine does not have 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.389
 in calulo or nothing was done and I do not walk 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.280
 on foot for what the customer said 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.760
 really the guy who sold the bike to 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.410
 he made and sold believe that it has been 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.220
 done a good service, right? 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:25.070
 is really the poison is that this hole 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.199
 here a measure of this note does not 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.229
 It's 61 and mail error 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:34.789
 There they opened for 62 and mail is 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:37.760
 thus winning the normal air is 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.979
 cool it has to be well done it 's not just him 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.610
 enter now before you do not know if the hole was 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:48.080
 moved from the run if you have 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:50.289
 so there is love 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.289
 my 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.650
 I took some of the acim team but 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:59.330
 He's just hanging out, no problem. 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:02.780
 none now this way right there is 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.270
 send everything right 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.050
 but the balls of the 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:12.230
 he thinks of another is the death of alexandre 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:15.830
 is being restored by making the route 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:22.840
 whole close simple wheel system 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:22.840
 electric entire interest rate 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:30.590
 the off duty command or already a story 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.330
 of the week the Flemish again there year of 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.160
 back one thing when they ride already 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.270
 I said, can you buy another one because you do not 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:41.050
 he had no rebound but he did not have as much 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.050
 totally spent 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.770
 his gear 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.820
 he arrived with his teeth is falling 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.780
 balance also had none 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.969
 they arranged he managed to 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:59.569
 provide balance sheets lopes 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:01.639
 it's a know but it's not good 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:05.059
 the video is because he had to switch 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:08.300
 money also showed a video 

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:11.089
 previous his life was all forced 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.619
 already was already done filling was 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:15.499
 all out of measure 

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:18.619
 full of holes 

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:20.679
 He bought a crankshaft. 

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:24.589
 imagining that he would stop there 

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:30.069
 and obviously what to buy 

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:32.779
 and she comes now he's going to have to do 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:39.909
 now only had one cylinder and also 

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:39.909
 do with a while there
