00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.599
 I use the photograph of myself for 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.020
 this tutorial not for narcissism but 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.350
 to avoid trouble after seeing the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.029
 result that will jump out of the windows 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.080
 open levels less window levels 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.150
 thank you I take this opportunity to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.099
 thank jacopo melchiorri who has 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.890
 took this picture and that me 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.420
 I'm going to brutally ruin the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.539
 difference in 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.809
 photoshop is yes that the filter that I go 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:44.079
 to apply the fluidify filter already 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.269
 existing for a long time on photoshop 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.399
 now you can apply it as 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.369
 advanced object then a click with the 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.469
 right button on the level convert to 

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:55.809
 advanced object gives me the opportunity to 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.449
 apply the filter to recover it 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.430
 subsequently to add and do 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.979
 other processes and to be able to reopen 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.830
 this filter without being destructive 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:09.539
 and in any case also applicable with the 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:13.270
 previous versions therefore less filter 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:15.340
 We have fluidization in this management 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.560
 window where different tools there 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.350
 allow you to make different 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.959
 interventions with different effects 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.270
 lockley cohen e 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:27.880
 what I'm going to use and that 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.330
 which is generally used most of all 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.209
 it must be sized according to need 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.659
 that we have to the area we have from to 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:42.130
 edit held in the center and clicked 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:47.740
 we see that it tends to enlarge curtains 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:52.270
 just to inflate based on the name that 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.149
 door moving with and clicking a little 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.630
 at a time, therefore, no continuous clicks 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.640
 but several repeated also allow me 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.020
 to recover certain areas so if I have 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.780
 I was wrong something too 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.600
 insistent I can move to recover 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.160
 a bit for caricatures and normal that yes 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.800
 goes looking for something that already 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.380
 it's a bit obvious how mine can be 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.680
 nose in this case you go to play 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.800
 on the eyes then those parts that if 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.550
 they are a little over the top 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:34.300
 feeling of caricature here 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:38.960
 wanting to enlarge the tool is too much 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.540
 I can play a little messing up 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.520
 grow your hair a little bit 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.010
 everyone will have their own messy 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.930
 photographs your needs 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.840
 be careful not to use them on people 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.390
 that they do not have the spirit that 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.260
 well that not that they might not 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.690
 accept jokes of this type and 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.810
 we see that we can distort of 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.760
 a lot of things this with it 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.290
 tool almost exclusively with lo 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.730
 inflation tool allows us to 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.300
 practically doing everything we can 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:22.520
 change features see how 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:24.590
 I change my forehead I can change my chin 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.110
 taking me outside and doing one 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.070
 series of clicks that really don't 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:34.840
 I keep pressed in continuity but for 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.440
 prevent me from playing the trick of 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.020
 apply the thing in an exaggerated way 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:46.910
 I do repeated clicks with this other one 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.220
 that the fold we can stretch things 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.450
 so wanting to make a mouth a little 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.630
 joker 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.450
 I click and hold and then drag 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.020
 let's see if I can get it a little 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.400
 more on you can also try on 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.840
 ears 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.079
 it is normal that we will play on the 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.430
 parts of the face that mount deformed 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:16.489
 they can make you smile maybe I don't 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:22.060
 I am very expert at doing what I am 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.380
 explaining, however, is a nice trick for 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.840
 literally upset those who 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.580
 are the features of a person who 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.090
 they can raise this brow 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:37.389
 clicking from the center to the outside 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:41.030
 then we'll see some frankenstein 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.760
 we will see once confirmed with ok how 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:49.610
 things have changed, here I am 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.169
 once removed we see how much 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.580
 I hurt myself, that's why I got it 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.210
 present use one of my photographs 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.789
 rather than that of a person who 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.820
 could maybe in the future complain about 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:04.099
 this I repeat is not mandatory to have 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.190
 the latest version of photoshop 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:10.760
 the fluidifying filter also existed 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.520
 first the only not indifferent limit 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.000
 was that it could not be converted into 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.060
 advanced filter and then give us the 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.210
 possibility both to eliminate it after having 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.210
 made further other interventions than of 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:35.009
 reopen it later to open for 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.009
 apply further changes 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.250
 here I am in version two caricature 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:45.220
 minutes to run or 5 to run 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:48.070
 this trick wishing we could also 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.070
 make a series about a series of friends of 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.620
 relatives make a whole family one 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.410
 group photo and change all of them 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:00.240
 faces and see how they can pop out 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.240
 and then laugh at it together
