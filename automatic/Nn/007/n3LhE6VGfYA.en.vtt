00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.630
 María Suarez is one of the pieces 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.000
 unmovable in the eleven holder of the cholo 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.860
 Simeone after playing in Valladolid on 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.440
 Celta and Majorca Suarez returned in 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.940
 2010 at the athletic of madrid club with the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.940
 that had debuted in the first division 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.309
 in 2005 his return to the mattress club 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.989
 could be more positive that year he won the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.239
 supercopa of europe against the inter 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.580
 milan in the last two years has 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.710
 conquered a europa league its second 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.780
 supercopa of europe and the cup of the king 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.080
 against Real Madrid in the final of the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.790
 bernabéu last season at 26 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.710
 years mario suárez is in his 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.140
 best time and promises to give many more 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.850
 joys to the rojiblanca hobby in the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.160
 league world we have enjoyed your 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.670
 company and he has explained to us that figures 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.110
 footballs inspire you then 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.110
 answer our soccer test 10 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.020
 a porter 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.020
 of sedano 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.150
 I do not go for everything because of its projection 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.590
 because he left here for his 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.630
 the profession that has what it is 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.400
 already doing in the Manchester that 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.800
 We initially put him cane has 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.330
 demonstrated with how the actions that 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.740
 it's enough that it can be the best 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.740
 ports of the world and I'm convinced 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:50.250
 a defense sergio ramos I think what 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.170
 has everything that has strength powers to 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.330
 letting the ball go well goes up 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.460
 strong to the cut I think he has it 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.460
 everything and good is a reference of Spanish 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:09.470
 a forward up here has given us 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.000
 many joys and I can see what it is 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.800
 that for me inside the area is the best 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.800
 forward of the world and does not stop to improve 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.470
 i 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.450
 a coach apart from the central 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.210
 that are a little away from football 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.400
 pretty as little as pepi and I think 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.020
 that rafa benítez in which that is what goes 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.030
 do very well too and I think they are 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.120
 The four best coaches of the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.120
 world 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.010
 a stadium the bernabéu I think it is 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.020
 one of the best fields in the world by 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.720
 as it is and above we have a good 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.060
 memory of having won the cup of 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.780
 king last year and where I always like 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.780
 play the big sections 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:02.450
 a national hobby is always so much 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.889
 good as bad and good are 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.989
 very important to us is when 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.819
 things are not going well the field we 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.469
 animal without stopping and they make us go back to 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.340
 reborn in that same game and I think 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.340
 that are only drawers 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.680
 a game I'm left with the finals that 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.720
 I believe that we have always won 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.580
 all shelves except that of the 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.370
 supercopa I think we have always 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.080
 rendered at a high level in the finals and 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.250
 for playing champions games that 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.250
 grace this season life why 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.940
 a title with players exceeds wants 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.390
 win the Champions League but as well there 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.390
 to go match to match
