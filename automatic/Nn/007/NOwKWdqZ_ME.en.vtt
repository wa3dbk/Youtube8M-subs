00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
same technique you just fold it in half

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.380 
same technique you just fold it in half
and<00:02:37.480> then<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.110> fold<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.800> half<00:02:38.860> again<00:02:39.790> and

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and then you fold it in half again and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.540 
and then you fold it in half again and
now<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.570> have<00:02:40.780> this<00:02:40.900> pointy<00:02:41.290> corner<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.890> the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
now you have this pointy corner and the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:53.030 
now you have this pointy corner and the
raw<00:02:42.790> edge<00:02:43.120> you're<00:02:43.390> going<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.690> cut<00:02:43.990> my<00:02:44.260> cut<00:02:44.530> sir

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.390 

now<00:02:54.040> remember<00:02:54.520> we're<00:02:55.080> measuring<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:56.710> if<00:02:57.280> I

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
now remember we're measuring so if I

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.550 
now remember we're measuring so if I
open<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:57.910> up<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.390> will<00:02:58.510> be<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.660> big<00:02:58.930> circle<00:02:59.410> so

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
open this up it will be a big circle so

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.930 
open this up it will be a big circle so

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
comes first almost like a mermaid style

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.870 
comes first almost like a mermaid style
but<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.650> has<00:03:53.830> more<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.250> flare<00:03:54.549> at<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.760> bottom

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
but it has more of a flare at the bottom

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.500 
but it has more of a flare at the bottom
so<00:03:55.840> I'm<00:03:56.049> going<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.320> pin<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:57.519> ends<00:03:57.970> together

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
so I'm going to pin the ends together

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.920 
so I'm going to pin the ends together
I<00:03:58.720> always<00:03:59.110> start<00:03:59.380> from<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.650> back<00:04:00.090> then<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.570> do

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
I always start from the back then I do

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.110 
I always start from the back then I do
the<00:04:02.320> front

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.020 

then<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:05.959> do<00:04:06.080> both<00:04:06.680> I<00:04:07.010> tried<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.489> this<00:04:07.610> way<00:04:07.819> like

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
then I do both I tried it this way like

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.059 
then I do both I tried it this way like
this<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.840> sometime<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.380> pull<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:09.770> to<00:04:09.890> make<00:04:10.040> sure

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
this and sometime I pull it to make sure

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.890 
this and sometime I pull it to make sure
it's<00:04:10.310> even<00:04:10.540> then<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.569> use<00:04:11.870> this<00:04:12.080> part<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:14.030> don't

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900
