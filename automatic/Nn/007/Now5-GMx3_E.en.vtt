jailbroken iphone and you're going to
want<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.090> go<00:00:12.120> if<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:13.019> have<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> jailbroken

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
iphone you're going to want to get the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.650 
iphone you're going to want to get the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
download that first and that lets you

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.599 
download that first and that lets you
run<00:00:21.960> applications<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> background

you'll<00:00:23.789> need<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.210> for<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.660> trick<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.080> work

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
you'll need that for this trick to work

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.450 
you'll need that for this trick to work
if<00:00:26.250> your<00:00:26.460> iphone<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.910> not<00:00:27.269> jailbroken<00:00:27.570> then

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
if your iphone is not jailbroken then

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.769 
if your iphone is not jailbroken then
this<00:00:29.460> trick<00:00:29.910> isn't<00:00:30.119> really<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.689> work

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
this trick isn't really going to work

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.420 
this trick isn't really going to work
for<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.349> you'll<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> jailbreak<00:00:32.040> to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
for you so you'll have to jailbreak to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.790 
for you so you'll have to jailbreak to
get<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.759> work<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.090> anyway<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:34.320> lot<00:00:34.770> of

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
get it to work but anyway a lot of

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.799 
get it to work but anyway a lot of
people<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.250> show<00:00:35.820> screencasts<00:00:36.690> on

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
people like to show screencasts on

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
people like to show screencasts on
youtube<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:38.010> what<00:00:38.340> they're<00:00:38.520> doing<00:00:38.790> on

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
youtube of what what they're doing on

youtube of what what they're doing on
their<00:00:39.090> iPhone<00:00:39.480> or<00:00:39.510> or<00:00:40.200> maybe<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.500> just<00:00:40.559> want

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
their iPhone or or maybe you just want

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.130 
their iPhone or or maybe you just want
to<00:00:40.980> show<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> friend<00:00:41.370> how<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.480> something

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
to show a friend how to do something

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.860 
to show a friend how to do something
that<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.469> figured<00:00:43.920> out<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> iphone<00:00:44.870> how

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
that you figured out on the iphone how

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.380 
that you figured out on the iphone how
does<00:00:46.079> forward<00:00:46.710> an<00:00:46.829> email<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.430> example<00:00:47.550> or<00:00:48.180> how

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
does forward an email for example or how

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.020 
does forward an email for example or how
to<00:00:48.680> send<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.800> photo<00:00:50.219> via<00:00:50.610> email<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.820> can

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
to send a photo via email and so you can

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.680 
to send a photo via email and so you can
you<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.050> use<00:00:55.289> apps<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.730> screencast<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.539> then

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you can use apps to screencast but then

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.119 
you can use apps to screencast but then
you're<00:00:57.809> kind<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.140> tied<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.440> your<00:00:58.559> computer<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
you're kind of tied to your computer and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.990 
you're kind of tied to your computer and
this<00:00:59.940> actually<00:01:00.329> allows<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.199> do<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.879> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
this actually allows you to do a kind of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.820 
this actually allows you to do a kind of
screencast<00:01:04.070> merged<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:05.460> video<00:01:05.880> o<00:01:06.470> is<00:01:07.470> all

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
screencast merged with video o is all

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.859 
screencast merged with video o is all
going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.220> uploaded<00:01:08.640> from<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:09.000> iphone<00:01:09.540> it's

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
going to be uploaded from my iphone it's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.420 
going to be uploaded from my iphone it's
never<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> hit<00:01:10.530> my<00:01:10.680> computer<00:01:11.189> at<00:01:11.280> all

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
never going to hit my computer at all

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.000 
never going to hit my computer at all
and<00:01:11.700> i'm<00:01:12.630> only<00:01:13.229> plugged<00:01:13.619> into<00:01:13.799> my<00:01:13.920> computer

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010

and i'm only plugged into my computer
right<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:14.880> i'm<00:01:15.000> charging<00:01:15.479> my<00:01:15.509> phone

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
right now because i'm charging my phone

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.660 
right now because i'm charging my phone
but<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.380> don't<00:01:16.560> need<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.950> plugged<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.430> at

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
but you don't need to be plugged in at

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.310 
but you don't need to be plugged in at
all<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.360> from<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> car<00:01:18.900> from

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
all you can do this from the car from

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.840 
all you can do this from the car from
wherever<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.369> i'll<00:01:20.700> show<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.939> how<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.180> works

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
wherever so i'll show you how this works

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.850 
wherever so i'll show you how this works
with<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> background<00:01:24.360> or<00:01:24.509> app<00:01:25.020> installed<00:01:25.619> i

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
with the background or app installed i

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.390 
with the background or app installed i
just<00:01:26.729> put<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> background<00:01:28.400> while

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
just put this in the background while

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.539 
just put this in the background while
I'm<00:01:29.610> still<00:01:29.850> recording<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.650> it<00:01:31.650> still<00:01:32.159> wants

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
I'm still recording and it still wants

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.240 
I'm still recording and it still wants
to<00:01:32.610> record<00:01:33.030> what's<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> screen<00:01:34.189> now<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to record what's on the screen now the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030 
to record what's on the screen now the
way<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.579> works<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.170> certain<00:01:37.170> video<00:01:37.590> camera

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
way this works is certain video camera

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.060 
way this works is certain video camera
apps<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.479> record<00:01:39.479> they<00:01:39.990> access<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.650> video

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
apps just record they access the video

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.190 
apps just record they access the video
camera<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.270> record<00:01:42.720> what's<00:01:42.990> being

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
camera but then they record what's being

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.060 
camera but then they record what's being
displayed<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> screen<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:46.070> typically

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
displayed on the screen so typically

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.940 
displayed on the screen so typically
you'll<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.540> output<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.530> actual

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
you'll have the output of the actual

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.380 
you'll have the output of the actual
video<00:01:50.220> camera<00:01:50.579> being<00:01:50.790> displayed<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
video camera being displayed on the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.719 
video camera being displayed on the
screen<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.290> case<00:01:52.560> since<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.610> in

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
screen but in this case since it's in
