00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.710
 today we are going to make a recipe 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.980
 truly spectacular 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.049
 let's make a green curry chicken with 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.119
 eggplant a dish I ate in 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.760
 an asian restaurant in rome a wok 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:27.449
 oil and let's hurry up a little 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.630
 of leek and we go and put it 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.380
 directly on the fire to stew in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.079
 this pot 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.809
 I'm making light chicken broth 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.649
 with all the parts that remained of the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.760
 chicken and this instead of cooking 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.640
 very simple it succeeds in absorption 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.710
 where I put three leaves of carrie e 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.710
 we are going to prepare the aubergine and ne 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.710
 we take goal which is more than enough 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.629
 I'm going to remove the outer skin 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.130
 and we go to add the leek 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.140
 while the leek and eggplant are 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.880
 I cook and prepare chicken 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.550
 then this is the chicken we have 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.270
 boned we see here are part of it 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.979
 of the thigh 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.200
 the chest naturally overshadows you 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.810
 you can already take boneless chicken 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.790
 the chicken breast you choose the part 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.500
 which is what you prefer the important thing is 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.140
 what I'll show you now that the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.090
 chicken is sliced â€‹â€‹quite small 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.970
 then in strips because 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:56.050
 of course the cooking must be will be 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:59.080
 very very fast it goes to add a 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.770
 little bit of broth with aubergines that goes 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.770
 to cover the work 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.800
 at this point the aubergines are ready 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.110
 we continue to always use it 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.930
 same ogg 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.260
 then add oil and turn on one 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.260
 flame 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:41.660
 rice is ready we can also push 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:43.910
 we leave the heat when the chicken is well 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.160
 made the browned well at this point a 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.010
 continue to recipe by adding them 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.170
 other elements from that then in reality 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.000
 most important given that it takes its name 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.190
 the curry is the green curry 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.880
 green in paste that is already prepared 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.620
 quantity 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.710
 you have to stay where to test on how much you 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.270
 read 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.520
 chili because it is a pasta 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.840
 I put it extremely spicy 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.400
 practically a spoon sees a 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.370
 very abundant foreign teaspoon 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.920
 so it's a spoon 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.900
 I add at this point a little bit of 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.220
 broth in such a way that this will serve me 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.140
 to melt the curry as well 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.740
 see I never added salt 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.780
 because why the meat pasta is very much 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:36.480
 very even savory so it pays off 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.640
 always wait to reach the salt 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.430
 once the dough is completely 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.340
 dissolved at this point we go 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:50.120
 add the eggplant, the leek and then 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:53.670
 coconut milk 23 leaflets of 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.020
 carrie and a couple of leaves of goes 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.530
 understand and I will add a small piece 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.530
 of lemon grass 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.770
 should be tasted on the percentile 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.000
 amount of salt as I told you is 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.420
 correct a bit of salt is missing a beautiful one 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.420
 spicy 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.900
 and at this point we cover and leave 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:29.140
 go on cooking for at least 45 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.820
 minutes of chicken is ready perfume is is a 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.470
 what truly amazing we serve it 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.610
 in this it is beautiful show torino so 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:43.390
 such that we also carry all the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:45.280
 our aforementioned with the rice alongside 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:50.350
 of course we serve all this with 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:54.940
 of white rice I as of this 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.370
 I'm literally crazy about it 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.760
 I take my bowl and wish you good 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.760
 appetite
