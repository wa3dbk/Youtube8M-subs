is full of surprises but they aren't all

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.730 
is full of surprises but they aren't all
good<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.540> go<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> front<00:01:46.259> panel<00:01:46.590> off

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.679 
good as we go to get the front panel off
we<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.430> adhered<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> mid

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.450 
we see that it is adhered to the mid

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
we lift up the front panel we see that

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.300 
we lift up the front panel we see that
it<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.659> still<00:01:58.020> attached<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> mid<00:01:58.950> frame<00:01:59.130> by

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
it is still attached to the mid frame by
