a<00:00:20.000> couple<00:00:20.150> of<00:00:20.270> questions<00:00:20.390> asking<00:00:21.079> about<00:00:21.200> how

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
a couple of questions asking about how

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.760 
a couple of questions asking about how
to<00:00:21.740> add<00:00:22.039> custom<00:00:22.340> HTML<00:00:22.730> CSS<00:00:23.360> to<00:00:23.960> a<00:00:23.990> new<00:00:24.349> website

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
to add custom HTML CSS to a new website

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.170 
to add custom HTML CSS to a new website
a<00:00:25.070> lot<00:00:25.369> of<00:00:25.460> people<00:00:25.669> didn't<00:00:25.849> know<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:26.059> could

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
a lot of people didn't know you could

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.999 
a lot of people didn't know you could
actually<00:00:26.300> do<00:00:26.570> this<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.439> I<00:00:27.469> thought<00:00:27.890> I<00:00:27.919> would

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
actually do this so I thought I would

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.950 
actually do this so I thought I would
show<00:00:28.250> you<00:00:28.279> two<00:00:29.119> ways<00:00:29.149> to<00:00:29.390> do<00:00:29.509> it<00:00:29.570> really<00:00:29.689> quick

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
show you two ways to do it really quick

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.499 
show you two ways to do it really quick
and<00:00:30.169> the<00:00:31.130> two<00:00:31.279> different<00:00:31.520> places<00:00:31.669> if<00:00:31.910> we<00:00:32.090> can't

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
and the two different places if we can't

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.750 
and the two different places if we can't
access<00:00:32.809> all<00:00:33.140> of<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:33.410> so<00:00:33.920> for<00:00:34.250> example<00:00:34.610> this

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
access all of that so for example this

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.970 
access all of that so for example this
right<00:00:34.850> here<00:00:35.360> this<00:00:35.719> is<00:00:35.899> actually<00:00:36.050> an<00:00:36.440> ad<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:36.890> I

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
right here this is actually an ad that I

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.889 
right here this is actually an ad that I
have<00:00:37.129> set<00:00:37.340> up<00:00:37.399> through<00:00:37.610> Google<00:00:37.879> Adsense<00:00:38.030> now

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
have set up through Google Adsense now

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:39.910 
have set up through Google Adsense now
there's<00:00:39.079> two<00:00:39.200> different<00:00:39.230> ways<00:00:39.500> you<00:00:39.559> can<00:00:39.800> add

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
there's two different ways you can add

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.530 
there's two different ways you can add
that<00:00:40.100> but<00:00:40.309> that's<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.760> example<00:00:41.270> we're<00:00:41.420> going

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
that but that's the example we're going

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.620 
that but that's the example we're going
to<00:00:41.600> be<00:00:41.690> using<00:00:41.840> today<00:00:42.130> so<00:00:43.130> option<00:00:43.940> number<00:00:44.150> one

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
to be using today so option number one

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.620 
to be using today so option number one
is<00:00:45.020> to<00:00:45.290> come<00:00:45.500> we're<00:00:45.620> here<00:00:45.829> to<00:00:45.980> design<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:47.480> you

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
is to come we're here to design and you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.010 
is to come we're here to design and you
can<00:00:47.780> edit<00:00:47.989> your<00:00:48.140> HTML<00:00:48.800> your<00:00:48.829> CSS<00:00:49.270> directly<00:00:50.270> now

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
can edit your HTML your CSS directly now

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.330 
can edit your HTML your CSS directly now
I'm<00:00:51.170> going<00:00:51.350> this<00:00:51.530> is<00:00:51.680> a<00:00:51.710> little<00:00:52.010> bit<00:00:52.100> more

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
I'm going this is a little bit more

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.040 
I'm going this is a little bit more
advanced<00:00:52.790> and<00:00:52.970> so<00:00:53.360> I<00:00:53.390> could<00:00:53.600> not<00:00:53.780> do<00:00:54.020> this

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
advanced and so I could not do this

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.100 
advanced and so I could not do this
stuff<00:00:54.410> good<00:00:55.280> for<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:55.780> this<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:56.930> how<00:00:56.989> you

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
stuff good for you and this is how you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.920 
stuff good for you and this is how you
do<00:00:57.290> it<00:00:58.060> so<00:00:59.200> you<00:01:00.200> know<00:01:00.829> are<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.220> files<00:01:01.930> very

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
do it so you know are the files very

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.429 
do it so you know are the files very
different<00:01:03.350> layouts<00:01:03.800> and<00:01:04.489> your<00:01:04.759> means

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
everything else anything that this is

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.749 
everything else anything that this is
you<00:01:08.299> can<00:01:08.450> actually<00:01:08.600> create<00:01:09.219> your<00:01:10.219> on

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
you can actually create your on

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.370 
you can actually create your on
individual<00:01:11.299> things<00:01:11.509> if<00:01:11.719> you<00:01:11.840> want<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.200> do

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
have you you can do that as well just

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.340 
have you you can do that as well just
copy<00:01:28.729> me<00:01:28.970> do<00:01:29.119> it<00:01:29.270> here<00:01:29.720> in<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.900> show<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:30.110> don't

that's<00:01:36.320> why<00:01:36.440> I'm<00:01:36.619> number<00:01:36.799> one<00:01:37.010> pretty<00:01:37.250> much

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
that's why I'm number one pretty much

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.929 
that's why I'm number one pretty much
past<00:01:37.670> users<00:01:37.970> now<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.570> last<00:01:38.869> simple<00:01:39.290> folk

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
past users now the last simple folk

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.130 
past users now the last simple folk
would<00:01:40.939> you<00:01:41.060> have<00:01:41.240> another<00:01:41.360> option<00:01:41.869> as<00:01:41.960> well

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
would you have another option as well

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.080 
would you have another option as well
that<00:01:42.560> lets<00:01:42.680> us<00:01:42.799> just<00:01:42.830> embed<00:01:43.700> will<00:01:43.880> give<00:01:44.000> us

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
that lets us just embed will give us

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.940 
that lets us just embed will give us
snippets<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.510> code<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.439> I<00:01:45.470> don't<00:01:45.650> think<00:01:45.799> like

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
snippets of code so I don't think like

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.969 
snippets of code so I don't think like
widgets<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.790> ads<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.479> things<00:01:47.659> like<00:01:47.780> that<00:01:47.979> and

widgets and ads and things like that and

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.280 
widgets and ads and things like that and
right<00:01:49.220> under<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.760> basic<00:01:49.970> embed<00:01:50.960> code<00:01:53.140> drag<00:01:54.140> it

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
right under the basic embed code drag it
