00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 welcome guys to a new episode 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.270
 on the world of sound but let's not take it 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:20.100
 that is, we are not going to talk about 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:22.170
 you would be battle film hard wine 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.180
 dedicate an entire episode right on 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.400
 what the world of battlefield is and 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.650
 what battle fidal made for the world of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.880
 soil because it represented a true e 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.570
 own evolution 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.570
 ok 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.059
 already from the time of the first to appear 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.550
 in fact the production company has 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.620
 dedicated to the sound sector the same 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.390
 power the same experience as far as 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.850
 regards the battlefields video department 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.739
 hardline practically came out yesterday not 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.989
 I could just avoid talking to you about 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.430
 what the whole sector is exactly e 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.140
 incredible work they did 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.420
 developers to gear up 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.309
 more to what was already perfect as 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.290
 you have probably already seen the same 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.909
 production house from visceral games has 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.770
 published a video dedicated to the 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.930
 world of audio bat friedman if it 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.429
 you are lost I try to summarize you in 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.200
 this episode less bad points 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:13.820
 highlights the work that made the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.190
 the password is a seminar 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.500
 speed who played the beta or better 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.390
 the second beta will have realized that 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.250
 how to short circuit in fact are 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.810
 totally based on the races and 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.500
 own movie-style shootings 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.500
 American detective story 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.240
 battlefield hardline defines them a bit 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.770
 the concept of what the sound in a 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.320
 game creating what is one 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.220
 situation that they themselves define 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.590
 modular because of its nature 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.300
 extremely open because the game is 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.740
 obviously plays in one of its points 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.600
 of strength that is the battlefields 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.670
 huge and therefore in the presence of 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 city ​​structures really complex 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.510
 and of developers I had to rebuild 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.160
 the sound of weapons sound let's say of 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.080
 all that is the environment and of 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.940
 what is happening in such a way 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.160
 that is confronted with a reality that is 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.800
 precisely that town or spaces 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.920
 open but different from the typical fields of 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.920
 battle 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.739
 it's been a while since they were even 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.440
 rented studies of love prost a 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.660
 burbank in california to rebuild e 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.440
 re record the sounds of weapons in a 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.209
 anti- sampling city ​​environment 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.980
 of weapons were carried out on 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.920
 piece by piece then by spring 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.480
 to the shutter to the trigger shot 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.120
 practically the weapons were 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.800
 reconstructed from a sound point of view in 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.569
 such a way that one could have in 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.180
 study in total control over 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.620
 development and stratification of that 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.620
 that the sound of a mouth of fire 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.489
 an obsessive care has been placed 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.409
 because after the outdoor recordings 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.360
 therefore with all the levels of all 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.860
 sounds that are generated have been 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.420
 also with study skills of 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.590
 studio recordings 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.000
 let's say the team could do that 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.000
 recreate situations 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.930
 a spatula of the buildings I will have kind of 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.850
 sound and shooting inside a 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.350
 parking another and maybe in one 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.570
 situation where it presents cement 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.550
 sound or sound proofing 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.040
 will change we could witness shootings 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.260
 in open field with food returns 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.910
 of the euro of firearms and also in 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.620
 based on the caliber we will have a return 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.720
 the same applies to cars 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.760
 because the team if you remember has 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.620
 also worked in the past for speed 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.690
 therefore I took the sounds they have 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.820
 cataloged and created for which the title 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.290
 they put everything back into play creating 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.820
 so a situation especially for the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.800
 interior of the cockpits if you have played 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.209
 to the extremely realistic title and how 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.310
 if you were from inside the machine 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.020
 so the roar of the engine we have the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.730
 sound also had the same radio as the 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.650
 very cool because it actually passes 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.090
 songs that are inherent and thematic with 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.500
 what's happening on screen 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.180
 let's say they certainly didn't skimp 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.650
 the care as regards precisely the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.970
 situations on two or four wheels 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.970
 the race expects things 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.220
 sap is that study therefore consider 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.440
 madrid arline the right evolution of 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.360
 what is the world of debates 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.610
 and I'll tell you I played the first beta 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.550
 when it was launched during e3 of the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.410
 2014 and we are not totally left 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.850
 hit while the last thing is up to me 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.140
 really liked it so much I'll try to 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.140
 also try the final game 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.110
 I thank you for being here with 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.150
 I remind you if you want to support the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.069
 project I ask you to reach maybe 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.960
 in a thousand I like this video 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.669
 because I want to see how it goes I invite you to 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.560
 write a comment with your ideas 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.270
 and your opinions and we'll see you at 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.389
