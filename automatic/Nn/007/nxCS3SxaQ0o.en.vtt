00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello in this video we will unpack 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.540
 box with new ipad air to start with 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.460
 let's look at this design 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.090
 boxes and compare it with the previous one 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.500
 by generation 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.590
 iPad 4, that is, with a box of PD-4 and 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.800
 as in see that the box t-54 is much 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.170
 more than a box from ipad air and 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.340
 much thicker that is even judging by 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.340
 box we can understand what it is 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.590
 the device has decreased and it became easier and 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.960
 now let's look at the design itself 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.780
 boxes and so on top is the most pdr 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.670
 already preloaded with ios 7 and on the sides 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.520
 and us ipad air inscriptions 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.780
 from the other sides we have two silver 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.030
 apple and so let's open the box 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.500
 remove the film and see what we have 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.610
 inside and so we take off the film and lick 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.899
 above we have the iPad itself 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.550
 which we now put aside and 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.460
 let's see what else we have in 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.040
 box and so this is an envelope in which 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.670
 we can find ipad instructions 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.260
 air and two ordinary sticker also in our 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.640
 the box is already the lightning cable which 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.560
 allows you to sync your 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.439
 device and adapter to 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.200
 through this white in cable to charge your 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.820
 device principle that all content 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.400
 boxes let's take my side too 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.920
 take ipad air and take it off 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.049
 and here is this protective film and when you 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.970
 take arm in your hands immediately see that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.979
 diminished granny that it became easier this 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.869
 really cool feeling 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.960
 know the feeling of lightness if again 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.659
 comparing its design 754 then it's a shame that 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.240
 faces have become smaller and it has become lighter and 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.970
 thinner and with new ipad air I write 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.229
 ipad air smart cover which it is not in 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.090
 principle is no different from 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.590
 smart cover that we saw in 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.159
 ipad mini but it became natural for 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.469
 ipad air that is, it has become more and 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.240
 expanded in general it was the video of the first 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.399
 look at this tablet and a small 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.890
 such unpacking and a full review of this 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.200
 the tablet will be quite soon on the channel we 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.850
 compare it with ipad 4 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.140
 and here 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.610
 and basically it was all i wanted 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.260
 do not forget to tell in this video 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.410

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.450
 ipad will still be a lot of interesting things in 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.450
