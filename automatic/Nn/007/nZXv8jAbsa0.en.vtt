00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.719
 [Music] 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.080
 I'm not imposing a new 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.869
 video to have the menus on gta like 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.140
 the modders exactly the same so 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.080
 be already disconnected from the psn to the helper 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.680
 format the system storage mettewie 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.130
 fast formatting a utility of fort 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.340
 in age maths so here you will have 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.899
 lehmann menu as the moddeurs be 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.450
 many friends because you can 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.120
 to banish you but crosses there 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.320
 you can banish but you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.070
 can still go there is a 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.480
 risk 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.980
 simon stayed solo that's good too 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:56.430
 you will have the hands of menus and 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.350
 back up your files well 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.190
 game saves because for the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.600
 to remove it will be necessary 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.770
 reformat to your wii console that's it 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.020
 I believe finally you can do them 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.650
 so if you do you can them 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.720
 remove you put back formatted for 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.759
 remove the menu modes only by hearing 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 this year so be well all the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:30.420
 offline time after you go in 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:33.270
 the settings system settings I 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.770
 believe alas I am looking for 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.770
 you will go to his allies in 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.250
 wait yes here are utility settings 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.850
 backup you put restore so 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.050
 put the usb key file that which 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.990
 is in the description so 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:04.920
 peripherals shake gta5 ok but you 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.610
 put yes and the the usb key wanted 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.280
 insert well in the right port side 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:15.180
 everything to the right of the ps3 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.160
 without it going no market here so if 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.640
 is calling you you will see from the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.740
 snow is not serious it's done on purpose 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:32.730
 here you see it so it's not 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:35.160
 serious there will be menu modes in 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:44.010
 the eure the words of menus in the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:46.800
 description also so there his copy the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.910
 safeguard in peace is in the key 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.030
 usb that you have put right 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.970
 put cross to restart and that's it 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.120
 so for this way you will need 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:05.970
 well a computer and a usb key 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.590
 so it's not that it's still a whole 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.590
 time I think everyone in the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.850
 you put hockey once that 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.620
 restarts and if the database on 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.190
 the system storage is going to be built 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.680
 it does not matter you're waiting for that 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.680
 takes 10 not even that's it's my 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:39.570
 and and it worked on a console even 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.250
 a ps3 even ultra slim ultra slim on 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.060
 all the consoles so that 's it 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.950
 well it's an advantage but on the other hand 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.190
 if you remove the menu modes on 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.850
 GTA 5 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.340
 in mini stories must think well of 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.830
 back up all your jumps all your 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.600
 backups yes of all the games on 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.580
 your computer key so once there 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.120
 always disconnected you to erase them 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.890
 2 storage data that's for 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.549
 you go to the teeth that were 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:20.290
 in the games you go go on 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:23.000
 the ps3 saved data utility 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.650
 finally coming back there you do not have to 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.820
 but that's if you want to deliver a 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.060
 backup of gta me I have one 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.850
 kim to avoid me to redo the prologue 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.100
 so it's not obligatory job it's a 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.610
 advice me I have a 100% backup 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.190
 you find on the internet 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.100
 fashion backups and so it's always 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.660
 a benefit that's fine here you are 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.750
 go run gta 5 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.390
 so he will resettle so it takes 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.669
 15 minutes and it's not very naughty 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.000
 and once connected brown you will 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.880
 that online 1 and solo I you 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.450
 advises against going online of course and 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.620
 you have the hands of menu so if you 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.050
 see that there are friezes it's not 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.880
 serious but if you see as at 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.490
 many did not force there are some who 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.310
 are suitable only for the online and 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.200
 that's why it's bug 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.660
 so feel free to share the video 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.610
