ribs<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:58.140> more<00:00:58.350> buoyant<00:00:58.860> and<00:00:59.070> significantly

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
ribs are more buoyant and significantly

lighter than comparable fiberglass boats

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.280 
lighter than comparable fiberglass boats
so<00:01:02.670> they<00:01:02.700> require<00:01:03.149> less<00:01:03.420> horsepower<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
so they require less horsepower and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.620 
so they require less horsepower and
smaller<00:01:04.710> engines<00:01:05.250> ribs<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:06.149> also<00:01:06.300> popular

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
smaller engines ribs are also popular

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.749 
smaller engines ribs are also popular
because<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.320> their<00:01:07.440> greater<00:01:07.830> weight<00:01:08.280> carrying

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.030 
because of their greater weight carrying
capacities<00:01:09.420> improve<00:01:10.229> stability<00:01:10.440> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
capacities improve stability and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.030 
capacities improve stability and
remarkable<00:01:11.850> seakeeping<00:01:12.330> characteristics<00:01:13.229> so

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
remarkable seakeeping characteristics so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.380 
remarkable seakeeping characteristics so
people<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.399> beginning<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.759> think<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.210> them<00:01:15.360> as

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
people are beginning to think of them as
