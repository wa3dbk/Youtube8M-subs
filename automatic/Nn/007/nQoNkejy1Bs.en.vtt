00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.139
 Microphones microphone speaks that does not have 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.940
 does not speak this and what is going to be diego 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.280
 now because I tell you in the cup 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.920
 america unicef ​​has been designated as the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.080
 charity that sponsor the cup 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.240
 America and what is being done so much 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.359
 in argentina in uruguay and I guess in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.220
 other countries is also in that sign a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.289
 commitment that says there commitment to 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 for children against 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.759
 discrimination because against 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.750
 discrimination because everyone thinks every 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.030
 one of us once we went 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.390
 discriminated for any reason by 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.059
 social reasons for reasons this speed 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.500
 of religion for reasons this command is 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.300
 there are a thousand ways to discriminate one 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.100
 person over all the most dramatic 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.450
 when a boy is discriminated because 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.460
 when one discriminates a boy takes away 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.500
 the possibility of studying to learn 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.719
 progress to develop 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.489
 express yourself and before you sign it says 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.980
 with representation of the selection that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.289
 later they will sign it more more this in 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.329
 another moment all the players some 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.030
 Once you felt discriminated against 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.729
 What can you tell me? 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.110
 that all petisos get to dance a 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.850
 girl and tell me not to dance because you're 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.710
 petiso but there is magic discriminates the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.390
 questions of taste seems to me a matter of 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.299
 criminal but I think that sometime 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.979
 we were all discriminated against that you do not 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.479
 have left the other already told me some 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.490
 soccer players I went to try and 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.530
 They said it was useless dresses 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.720
 as acts that do not really contribute 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.890
 to nothing that throughout life always 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.899
 there are times where where there 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.509
 situations where yes obviously you 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.200
 they discriminate but they are good things 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.970
 that one is carrying it is going over and 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.590
 you're trying to channel it from the best 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.030
 way but good because the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.500
 we also have the possibility 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.690
 to face discrimination and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.369
 defend ourselves but the guys do not 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.649
 kids are goats that are discriminated 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.840
 he is quiet he low the head and he does not know 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.549
 what to do why I ask you to stand firm 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.310
 this commitment to love the papers like this 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.579
 quiet signatures 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.840
 and it's the first firm in Uruguay the most 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.670
 important because he is the ambassador of 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.579
 unicef ​​in Uruguay and then they will continue 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.330
 all the boys at another time the 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.250
 removed from the celestial 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.900

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.610
