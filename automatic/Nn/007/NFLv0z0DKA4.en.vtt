grapefruit
let's<00:00:12.269> get<00:00:12.950> your<00:00:13.950> graphic<00:00:14.429> we'll<00:00:14.610> have<00:00:14.790> where

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
let's get your graphic we'll have where

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.939 
let's get your graphic we'll have where
the<00:00:15.150> stem<00:00:15.509> came<00:00:15.809> from<00:00:16.139> where<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.770> was

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the stem came from where this was

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.769 
the stem came from where this was
attached<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> stem<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> tree<00:00:18.270> and

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
attached to the stem of the tree and

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.660 
attached to the stem of the tree and
it's<00:00:19.320> sort<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.619> dimple<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.130> bar<00:00:20.430> while

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
it's sort of a dimple on the bar while

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.580 
it's sort of a dimple on the bar while
the<00:00:21.390> top<00:00:21.630> or<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.840> bottom<00:00:21.900> whichever<00:00:22.439> way

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the top or the bottom whichever way

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.540 
the top or the bottom whichever way
you're<00:00:22.769> holding<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.850> if<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.480> were<00:00:24.630> to

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
you're holding it so if you were to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.040 
you're holding it so if you were to
think<00:00:26.550> about<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.880> as<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> dope<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.779> would<00:00:27.930> be

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
think about it as a dope this would be

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.599 
think about it as a dope this would be
like<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> South<00:00:28.680> Pole<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.310> North<00:00:29.369> Pole

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
like the South Pole and the North Pole

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.569 
like the South Pole and the North Pole
or<00:00:30.000> whatever<00:00:30.510> what<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.949> need<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.460> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
or whatever what what we need to do is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.959 
or whatever what what we need to do is
first<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:33.030> all<00:00:33.210> cut<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:37.460> generous<00:00:38.460> piece<00:00:38.730> down

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
first of all cut a generous piece down

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.209 
first of all cut a generous piece down
until<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.020> sort<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> flesh

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
until you have that sort of flesh

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.590 
until you have that sort of flesh
exposed<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.000> reason<00:00:42.239> why<00:00:42.360> we're<00:00:42.570> doing

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
exposed and the reason why we're doing

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.470 
exposed and the reason why we're doing
this<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> flat<00:00:44.370> surface<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.090> work

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
this is to have a flat surface to work

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.110 
this is to have a flat surface to work
with<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.440> doesn't<00:00:46.710> rock<00:00:46.890> no<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.730> didn't

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
with so it doesn't rock no if I didn't

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.000 
with so it doesn't rock no if I didn't
do<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.300> when<00:00:49.170> I'm<00:00:49.289> working<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.829> it's

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
do that when I'm working with it it's

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.700 
do that when I'm working with it it's
