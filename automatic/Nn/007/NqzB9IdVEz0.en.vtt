00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:21.030
 the final assembly as well 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.880
 now we are going to the final assembly that 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:29.040
 tries to get the parts together 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:34.850
 in this case the earring in what has to do 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.850
 with foot placement and fitting 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:45.830
 the suit and its base is clear because everything 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.170
 the foot should not have a base where it is 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.660
 secure or welded as in this case 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.530
 we have a triangular basis that we have 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.530
 screw 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.050
 we have a triangular base where 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 I'm giving the suit and now with the same 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.470
 system with the same system with which 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.820
 we will link the bracelet cells together 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.430
 in this case what is the earring with a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.530
 screw system let's do it with 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.219
 two loops well put one of the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.420
 rings and we'll put a 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.420
 second ball 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:37.280
 This line is already open and we 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.280
 the pliers and we passed through the earring 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.750
 we have to go over and under it is 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.170
 clear 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.020
 we closed the ring tightly closed 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.840
 remember that when closing the ring we must 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:58.150
 leave it well aligned so that 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:02.680
 there is no jump or jump there and 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.980
 there is already the earring mounted one of the two 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.980
 chickens
