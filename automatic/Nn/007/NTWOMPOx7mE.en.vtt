advice<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.890> should<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.280> Ospital<00:01:17.700> by<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> way

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
advice one should be Ospital by the way

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
advice one should be Ospital by the way
because<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.110> now<00:01:19.290> hospitals<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> most

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
because right now hospitals are the most

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.289 
because right now hospitals are the most
dangerous<00:01:20.490> places<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.650> think

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
dangerous places to be in I think

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.670 
dangerous places to be in I think
hospitals<00:01:24.299> should<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.600> adopting<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.229> faster

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
hospitals should be adopting this faster

let's<00:02:50.200> talk<00:02:50.380> now<00:02:50.560> about<00:02:50.590> healthcare<00:02:51.280> you

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
let's talk now about healthcare you

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.580 
let's talk now about healthcare you
mentioned<00:02:51.880> hospitals<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.840> it's<00:02:53.140> not<00:02:53.319> as<00:02:53.440> if

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
mentioned hospitals and it's not as if

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.110 
mentioned hospitals and it's not as if
hospitals<00:02:54.160> are<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.459> place<00:02:54.670> where<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:54.970> ever

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
hospitals are the place where you ever

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.600 
hospitals are the place where you ever
want<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.480> be<00:02:55.709> yeah<00:02:56.709> as<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:56.920> patient<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.580> course

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
want to be yeah as a patient of course

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.270 
want to be yeah as a patient of course
but<00:02:58.299> they<00:02:58.840> do<00:02:59.290> not<00:02:59.530> seem<00:02:59.799> to<00:02:59.950> be<00:03:00.069> at<00:03:00.160> the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
but they do not seem to be at the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.890 
but they do not seem to be at the
cutting<00:03:00.519> edge<00:03:00.910> when<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.239> when<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:01.690> think

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
cutting edge when it when you think

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.410 
cutting edge when it when you think
about<00:03:02.140> there's<00:03:02.799> B<00:03:03.069> because<00:03:03.580> now<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.880> research

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
about there's B because now the research

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.009 
about there's B because now the research
shows<00:03:04.810> very<00:03:05.170> clearly<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.920> only<00:03:06.099> 5%<00:03:06.580> only<00:03:07.540> 5%

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
shows very clearly that only 5% only 5%

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.949 
shows very clearly that only 5% only 5%

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.590 
of disease related gene mutations are
fully<00:03:11.560> penetrant<00:03:12.280> which<00:03:12.489> means<00:03:12.760> we<00:03:13.420> can

fully penetrant which means we can

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.740 
fully penetrant which means we can
