00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
biotech mom yeah I think so definitely I

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.190 
biotech mom yeah I think so definitely I
think<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:19.070> should<00:03:19.250> wait<00:03:19.430> he<00:03:20.420> probably<00:03:20.630> ninety

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
four of the day and I think we would

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.570 
four of the day and I think we would
have<00:03:24.200> an<00:03:24.440> older<00:03:24.680> horse<00:03:24.860> against<00:03:25.130> Reitz<00:03:25.340> it's

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
have an older horse against Reitz it's

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.110 
have an older horse against Reitz it's
wide<00:03:25.790> open<00:03:25.820> okay<00:03:26.630> right
