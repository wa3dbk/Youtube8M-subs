great seed to soil contact especially if

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.690 
great seed to soil contact especially if
you<00:02:30.900> increase<00:02:31.900> your<00:02:32.170> seeding<00:02:32.590> rate<00:02:32.860> now<00:02:33.670> a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
you increase your seeding rate now a

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.820 
you increase your seeding rate now a
small<00:02:34.060> pot<00:02:34.330> like<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.810> I'll<00:02:35.470> put

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
small pot like this I'll put

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.000 
small pot like this I'll put
approximately<00:02:36.070> 300<00:02:37.030> pounds<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.750> acre<00:02:38.010> so

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
approximately 300 pounds to the acre so

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.090 
approximately 300 pounds to the acre so
that<00:02:39.760> would<00:02:39.910> be<00:02:40.030> about<00:02:40.239> 50<00:02:40.870> pounds<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:41.290> seed<00:02:41.560> on

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
that would be about 50 pounds of seed on

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.350 
that would be about 50 pounds of seed on
a<00:02:42.190> small<00:02:42.489> plot<00:02:42.700> like<00:02:42.940> this

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
a small plot like this

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.250 
a small plot like this
so<00:02:44.080> after<00:02:44.320> you've<00:02:44.470> broadcast<00:02:45.070> your<00:02:45.370> seed<00:02:46.260> it's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
so after you've broadcast your seed it's

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.610 
so after you've broadcast your seed it's
time<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.650> get<00:02:47.739> your<00:02:47.890> rake<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:49.110> rake<00:02:50.110> in<00:02:50.590> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
time to get your rake and rake in the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.580 
time to get your rake and rake in the
seat<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.970> get<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:52.989> underneath<00:02:53.260> some

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
seat just to get it underneath some

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.550 
seat just to get it underneath some
leaves<00:02:53.830> anything<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.640> help<00:02:55.380> germinate<00:02:56.380> that

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
leaves anything to help germinate that

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.190 
leaves anything to help germinate that
seat<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:57.010> know<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.250> can<00:02:57.370> be<00:02:57.459> under<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.730> layer<00:02:58.030> of

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
seat you know it can be under a layer of

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.960 
seat you know it can be under a layer of
leaves<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.920> should<00:03:00.160> sprout<00:03:00.430> right<00:03:00.640> up<00:03:00.760> through

it but just to recap this is the way we

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.030 
it but just to recap this is the way we

do our micro plots there's lots of

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.220 
do our micro plots there's lots of
variations<00:03:06.670> there's<00:03:07.390> lots<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:07.720> ways<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:07.930> can

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230
