against<00:05:18.620> them<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.010> it's<00:05:19.580> it's<00:05:20.240> exactly<00:05:20.780> what

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
against them and it's it's exactly what

you think it would be a BAM yang you can

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.100 
you think it would be a BAM yang you can
just<00:05:24.169> run<00:05:24.530> and<00:05:24.830> run<00:05:25.520> and<00:05:25.550> there<00:05:26.389> is<00:05:26.539> no<00:05:26.780> sense

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
just run and run and there is no sense

he's<00:05:29.210> just<00:05:29.479> too<00:05:29.780> fast<00:05:30.229> and<00:05:30.470> just<00:05:30.710> spot<00:05:30.919> at<00:05:31.099> home

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
he's just too fast and just spot at home

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.650 
he's just too fast and just spot at home
and<00:05:31.610> it<00:05:31.910> is<00:05:31.940> too<00:05:32.360> easy<00:05:32.389> it<00:05:32.900> is<00:05:32.930> a<00:05:33.440> perfect<00:05:34.160> team

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
and it is too easy it is a perfect team

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.300 
and it is too easy it is a perfect team
there<00:05:35.660> is<00:05:35.810> no<00:05:36.050> fault<00:05:36.380> in<00:05:36.560> this<00:05:36.650> whatsoever<00:05:36.830> I

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
there is no fault in this whatsoever I

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.730 
there is no fault in this whatsoever I
reckon<00:05:37.849> if<00:05:37.940> you<00:05:38.060> upgrade<00:05:38.449> Joe<00:05:38.690> Hart<00:05:38.960> it<00:05:39.410> could

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
reckon if you upgrade Joe Hart it could

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.129 
reckon if you upgrade Joe Hart it could
be<00:05:39.889> even<00:05:40.130> better<00:05:40.370> but<00:05:40.699> saying<00:05:41.000> that<00:05:41.360> in<00:05:41.570> one<00:05:42.110> of

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
be even better but saying that in one of

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.480 
be even better but saying that in one of
the<00:05:42.289> games<00:05:42.470> he<00:05:42.860> made<00:05:43.099> 20<00:05:44.030> saves<00:05:44.770> 20<00:05:45.770> it<00:05:46.220> was

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
the games he made 20 saves 20 it was

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.909 
the games he made 20 saves 20 it was
unreal<00:05:46.820> so<00:05:47.389> you<00:05:47.870> probably<00:05:48.199> don't<00:05:48.530> even<00:05:48.740> need

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
unreal so you probably don't even need

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.279 
unreal so you probably don't even need
to<00:05:49.699> upgrade<00:05:49.820> the<00:05:50.270> joe<00:05:50.449> hart<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:50.810> defense<00:05:51.139> was

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
to upgrade the joe hart the defense was

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.050 
to upgrade the joe hart the defense was
great<00:05:51.590> the<00:05:51.740> midfield<00:05:52.130> was<00:05:52.340> really<00:05:52.699> sort<00:05:52.909> of<00:05:52.970> a
