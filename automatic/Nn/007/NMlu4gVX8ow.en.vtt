00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.149
 this is the top 100 of video games 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.149
 spector's favorites 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.900
 number 76 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.789
 I lived with racing 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.099
 when diddy kong racing came to light 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.500
 everyone believed that it would be a 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.099
 copy of mario kart but incredible 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.960
 surprise was not this way indeed this game 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.329
 he won the position to the best game of 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.090
 races to the millenium mario kart in the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.340
 year it came out which is amazing 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.470
 but at the same time I think it's the same 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.720
 of deserved the experience I had 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.269
 go out and with racing to date has not 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.489
 could be replicated is a game that 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.280
 it went far beyond giving you a 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.739
 simple career and got a whole story 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.170
 within the game hundreds of clues to 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.840
 play missions to complete within the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.020
 game bosses three different vehicles to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.300
 select wow this game was too much 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.310
 content even for your time the 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.190
 I really enjoyed myself for hours and hours 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.649
 with this game both the hovercraft and 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.930
 the plane fascinated me and the multiplayer 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.899
 of this game is perhaps the best that I have 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.700
 seen in a racing game 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.039
 just do me the favor of playing the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.710
 mission of when you steal the eggs of your 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.659
 rivals and they will see what I tell them is 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.329
 too little time to talk about 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.359
