00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
nine five inch screen almost a five inch

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.769 
nine five inch screen almost a five inch
screen<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.470> 1080<00:00:29.130> display<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.720> you

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
screen and it's a 1080 display so you

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.540 
screen and it's a 1080 display so you
get<00:00:31.019> nineteen<00:00:31.710> hundred<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.099> twenty<00:00:32.340> pixels

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
get nineteen hundred and twenty pixels

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.479 
get nineteen hundred and twenty pixels
by<00:00:33.239> ten<00:00:33.780> hundred<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.440> eighty<00:00:34.770> pixels<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
by ten hundred and eighty pixels and

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.220 
by ten hundred and eighty pixels and
that's<00:00:36.000> actually<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.660> give<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.930> four

that's actually going to give you four
hundred<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.649> forty<00:00:37.980> five<00:00:38.160> pixels<00:00:38.820> per<00:00:39.149> inch

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
hundred and forty five pixels per inch

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.209 
hundred and forty five pixels per inch
so<00:00:39.570> you've<00:00:40.050> got<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> lot<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.500> pixels<00:00:40.829> packed

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
so you've got a lot of pixels packed

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.369 
so you've got a lot of pixels packed
into<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> screen<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.390> also<00:00:42.600> an<00:00:42.870> IPS<00:00:43.350> panel

here so you should get decent viewing

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.560 
here so you should get decent viewing
angles<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:52.039> now<00:00:53.039> screen<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.550> covered<00:00:53.940> in

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
angles on it now screen is covered in

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.010 
angles on it now screen is covered in
Corning<00:00:55.440> Gorilla<00:00:55.890> Glass<00:00:56.340> 3<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.690> that's<00:00:57.840> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
now that camera has optical image

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.820 
now that camera has optical image
stabilization<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:19.049> actually<00:01:19.380> try<00:01:19.619> that
