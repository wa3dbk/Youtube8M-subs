mushroom<00:00:18.070> biome<00:00:18.250> but<00:00:18.850> that<00:00:19.030> is<00:00:19.180> not<00:00:19.420> the<00:00:19.480> best

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
mushroom biome but that is not the best

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.510 
mushroom biome but that is not the best
part<00:00:19.990> of<00:00:20.110> this<00:00:20.200> map<00:00:20.440> what<00:00:21.100> we're<00:00:21.220> going<00:00:21.310> to<00:00:21.400> do

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
part of this map what we're going to do

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.130 
part of this map what we're going to do
is<00:00:21.640> going<00:00:21.820> to<00:00:21.880> shoot<00:00:22.090> right<00:00:22.420> over<00:00:22.450> to<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:22.930> best

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
is going to shoot right over to the best

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.660 
is going to shoot right over to the best
part<00:00:23.380> so<00:00:23.500> you<00:00:23.590> can<00:00:23.710> see<00:00:23.830> exactly<00:00:24.220> what<00:00:24.520> it<00:00:24.610> is

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
part so you can see exactly what it is

in<00:00:27.670> a<00:00:27.850> way<00:00:27.880> we<00:00:28.660> go<00:00:29.220> when<00:00:30.220> I<00:00:30.250> saw<00:00:30.520> this<00:00:30.700> at<00:00:30.910> first

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.120 
in a way we go when I saw this at first

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.880 
in a way we go when I saw this at first
I<00:00:31.330> couldn't<00:00:31.390> believe<00:00:31.930> it<00:00:32.079> I've<00:00:32.290> noticed<00:00:32.680> that

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
I couldn't believe it I've noticed that

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.069 
I couldn't believe it I've noticed that
you<00:00:33.160> know<00:00:33.309> since<00:00:33.520> title<00:00:33.910> take<00:00:34.120> 12<00:00:34.660> came<00:00:34.929> out

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
you know since title take 12 came out

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.259 
you know since title take 12 came out
there<00:00:35.410> you<00:00:36.160> don't<00:00:36.339> get<00:00:36.429> a<00:00:36.489> lot<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:36.789> things<00:00:37.059> on

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
there you don't get a lot of things on

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.000 
there you don't get a lot of things on
the<00:00:37.390> surface<00:00:37.780> like<00:00:37.929> you<00:00:38.079> used<00:00:38.379> to<00:00:38.589> so<00:00:38.859> when<00:00:38.980> I

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
the surface like you used to so when I

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.610 
the surface like you used to so when I
saw<00:00:39.249> this<00:00:39.399> I<00:00:39.460> was<00:00:39.640> pretty<00:00:40.390> shocked<00:00:40.780> we<00:00:41.440> should

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
saw this I was pretty shocked we should

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.040 
saw this I was pretty shocked we should
be<00:00:41.769> coming<00:00:42.100> up<00:00:42.190> on<00:00:42.339> it<00:00:42.519> any<00:00:42.940> second<00:00:43.359> there<00:00:43.899> it

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
be coming up on it any second there it

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.099 
be coming up on it any second there it
is<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:45.370> you<00:00:45.609> can<00:00:45.730> see<00:00:45.999> there<00:00:46.300> is<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.449> giant

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
is as you can see there is a giant

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.079 
is as you can see there is a giant
crater<00:00:47.679> in<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:47.920> ground<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.730> will<00:00:48.879> go<00:00:48.999> ahead

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
crater in the ground and I will go ahead

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.729 
crater in the ground and I will go ahead
and<00:00:49.329> show<00:00:49.420> you<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.899> map<00:00:50.109> so<00:00:50.319> you<00:00:50.379> can<00:00:50.559> see

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
and show you the map so you can see

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.130 
and show you the map so you can see
where<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.010> is<00:00:51.159> it's<00:00:52.089> right<00:00:52.449> there<00:00:52.749> at<00:00:52.960> these

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
where it is it's right there at these

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.599 
where it is it's right there at these
coordinates<00:00:53.379> right<00:00:53.920> where<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.280> Mountain

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
coordinates right where the Mountain

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.180 
coordinates right where the Mountain
biome<00:00:54.969> meets<00:00:55.749> the<00:00:55.929> forest<00:00:56.319> biome<00:00:56.649> in<00:00:56.769> jungle

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
biome meets the forest biome in jungle

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.910 
biome meets the forest biome in jungle
and<00:00:57.370> what<00:00:58.179> happens<00:00:58.600> is<00:00:58.839> when<00:00:59.289> you<00:00:59.379> go<00:00:59.559> down

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
and what happens is when you go down

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.529 
and what happens is when you go down
into<00:01:00.219> this<00:01:00.399> giant<00:01:00.670> hole<00:01:00.940> there's<00:01:01.179> something

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
into this giant hole there's something

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.280 
into this giant hole there's something
even<00:01:02.440> better<00:01:02.999> look<00:01:03.999> at<00:01:04.120> that<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.930> surface

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
even better look at that the surface

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.310 
even better look at that the surface
stronghold<00:01:06.070> right<00:01:06.460> here<00:01:06.850> I<00:01:07.030> haven't<00:01:07.930> seen<00:01:08.140> a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
stronghold right here I haven't seen a

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.990 
stronghold right here I haven't seen a
lot<00:01:08.680> of<00:01:08.710> these<00:01:08.950> since<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.310> new<00:01:09.460> update<00:01:09.640> came

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
lot of these since the new update came

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.670 
lot of these since the new update came
out<00:01:10.149> so<00:01:10.329> i'm<00:01:10.450> not<00:01:10.689> sure<00:01:10.930> if<00:01:11.020> they<00:01:11.140> change<00:01:11.380> the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
out so i'm not sure if they change the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.130 
out so i'm not sure if they change the
code<00:01:11.979> but<00:01:12.520> if<00:01:12.729> there<00:01:12.909> is<00:01:13.000> definitely<00:01:13.540> one<00:01:13.689> here

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
code but if there is definitely one here

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.690 
code but if there is definitely one here
and<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.860> fact<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.189> it's<00:01:15.369> in<00:01:15.460> one<00:01:15.610> of<00:01:15.640> these

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
and the fact that it's in one of these

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.760 
and the fact that it's in one of these
massive<00:01:16.270> craters<00:01:16.719> which<00:01:16.840> i<00:01:17.049> don't<00:01:17.110> see<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.560> lot

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
massive craters which i don't see a lot

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.459 
massive craters which i don't see a lot
of<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:18.039> begin<00:01:18.310> with<00:01:18.520> made<00:01:19.270> me<00:01:19.450> really<00:01:20.020> happy<00:01:20.200> to

be able to find this one so as you can

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.450 
be able to find this one so as you can
see<00:01:22.630> once<00:01:22.990> you<00:01:23.079> go<00:01:23.200> down<00:01:23.229> here<00:01:23.560> it<00:01:23.680> is<00:01:23.799> directly

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
here completely visible from the surface

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.880 
here completely visible from the surface
you<00:01:28.180> can<00:01:28.360> go<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.689> you<00:01:28.810> see<00:01:29.020> right<00:01:29.380> there<00:01:29.619> you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
around here you could set up a base camp

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.050 
around here you could set up a base camp
here<00:01:35.439> and<00:01:35.469> just<00:01:35.859> have<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.159> hell<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.670> start<00:01:36.939> to

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.620 
it from the surface but if you're in the
stronghold<00:01:42.549> you<00:01:42.670> can<00:01:42.789> find<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.210> pretty<00:01:43.329> easy

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
stronghold you can find it pretty easy

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.880 
stronghold you can find it pretty easy

right<00:02:00.820> here<00:02:00.850> with<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.570> stronghold<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.469> it<00:02:02.740> is

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
right here with the stronghold so it is

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.950 
right here with the stronghold so it is
almost<00:02:03.280> attached<00:02:03.909> I<00:02:04.179> mean<00:02:04.390> obviously<00:02:04.570> not

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
almost attached I mean obviously not

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.660 
almost attached I mean obviously not
completely<00:02:05.499> it's<00:02:05.679> just<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.130> side<00:02:06.310> but

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
completely it's just to the side but

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.419 
completely it's just to the side but
it's<00:02:07.270> close<00:02:07.689> enough<00:02:07.719> to<00:02:08.080> where<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:09.280> could

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
it's close enough to where you could

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.949 
it's close enough to where you could
take<00:02:09.610> care<00:02:09.820> of<00:02:09.850> all<00:02:10.030> these<00:02:10.179> things<00:02:10.450> all<00:02:10.659> at<00:02:10.690> the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
one I do have another surface stronghold

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.440 
one I do have another surface stronghold
map<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:29.860> will<00:02:30.040> be<00:02:30.160> bringing<00:02:30.340> out<00:02:30.610> but<00:02:31.420> I

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
map that I will be bringing out but I

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.120 
map that I will be bringing out but I
don't<00:02:31.720> think<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.050> nearly<00:02:32.470> as<00:02:32.650> unique<00:02:32.980> as

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
don't think it's nearly as unique as

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.500 
don't think it's nearly as unique as
this<00:02:33.280> one<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.670> where<00:02:33.820> it's<00:02:34.000> inside<00:02:34.300> of<00:02:34.420> this

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
this one to where it's inside of this

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.410 
this one to where it's inside of this
big<00:02:34.900> old<00:02:35.080> crater<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.740> mean<00:02:36.490> just<00:02:36.880> just<00:02:37.150> looking

big old crater I mean just just looking

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.860 
big old crater I mean just just looking
I<00:02:37.480> think<00:02:37.690> it's<00:02:37.930> ridiculous<00:02:38.820> but<00:02:39.820> anyway<00:02:40.540> you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
I think it's ridiculous but anyway you

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.780 
I think it's ridiculous but anyway you
can<00:02:41.020> see<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> nice<00:02:41.680> jungle<00:02:42.100> biome<00:02:42.490> here
