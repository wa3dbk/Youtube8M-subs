filling the body up with air the more

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.160 
filling the body up with air the more
you<00:02:14.160> fill<00:02:14.340> up<00:02:14.490> with<00:02:14.610> air<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.660> tighter<00:02:15.959> your

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
you fill up with air the tighter your

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.270 
you fill up with air the tighter your
body's<00:02:16.470> gonna<00:02:16.620> stay

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
body's gonna stay

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.020 
body's gonna stay
so<00:02:18.030> therefore<00:02:19.100> if<00:02:20.100> Richard<00:02:20.520> unrack<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.940> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
so therefore if Richard unrack to the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.199 
so therefore if Richard unrack to the
bar<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.630> gives<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.110> me<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.500> go<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.920> two

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
bar and gives it to me and I go one two

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.410 
bar and gives it to me and I go one two
three

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
three

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.080 
three
give<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.930> me<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:26.970> take<00:02:27.180> my<00:02:27.239> breast<00:02:27.600> now

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
give it to me and I take my breast now

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.910 
give it to me and I take my breast now
my<00:02:30.090> whole<00:02:30.300> body<00:02:30.570> mechanics<00:02:30.840> changed<00:02:31.650> again

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
my whole body mechanics changed again

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.470 
my whole body mechanics changed again
because<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:34.370> refilling<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.489> with<00:02:35.640> air<00:02:35.850> you

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.330 

want<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.540> stay<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:39.840> tight<00:02:40.110> as<00:02:40.230> possible<00:02:40.340> on

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
want to stay as tight as possible on

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.000 
want to stay as tight as possible on
that<00:02:42.030> bench<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.780> when<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.930> give<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> one-two<00:02:43.800> and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
that bench so when I give a one-two and

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.460 
that bench so when I give a one-two and
you<00:02:44.250> take<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.459> breath<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.880> air<00:02:45.110> my<00:02:46.110> body's

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
you take a breath of air my body's

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.290 
you take a breath of air my body's
staying<00:02:46.650> super<00:02:47.130> tight<00:02:47.370> I'm<00:02:47.580> not<00:02:47.730> changing<00:02:48.000> any

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
staying super tight I'm not changing any

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.120 
staying super tight I'm not changing any
of<00:02:48.420> my<00:02:48.510> mechanics<00:02:48.959> at<00:02:49.170> all<00:02:49.350> you're<00:02:49.680> doing<00:02:49.920> one

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
of my mechanics at all you're doing one

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.310 
of my mechanics at all you're doing one
rep<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.780> powerlifting<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:51.930> not<00:02:52.080> for

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
rep in powerlifting it's not for

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.250 
rep in powerlifting it's not for
multiple<00:02:52.680> reps<00:02:52.860> uh-huh<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:54.989> my<00:02:55.110> opinion

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
multiple reps uh-huh so in my opinion

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.500 
multiple reps uh-huh so in my opinion
there's<00:02:55.650> no<00:02:55.709> need<00:02:56.010> for<00:02:56.239> taking<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.330> breath

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
there's no need for taking the breath

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.210 
there's no need for taking the breath
after<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.019> liftoff<00:02:58.380> it's<00:02:58.620> loosening<00:02:59.070> your

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
after the liftoff it's loosening your

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.640 
after the liftoff it's loosening your
body<00:02:59.370> back<00:02:59.580> up<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.000> retightening<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.959> to

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
body back up and retightening in and to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.250 
body back up and retightening in and to
me<00:03:01.739> that's<00:03:01.860> no<00:03:02.070> good<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:03.120> I'm<00:03:03.959> gonna<00:03:04.110> go

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
me that's no good so I'm gonna go

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.740 
me that's no good so I'm gonna go
through<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> set<00:03:04.709> up<00:03:04.830> again<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.239> full<00:03:06.480> range

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
through a set up again in a full range

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.330 
through a set up again in a full range
and<00:03:07.080> I'll<00:03:07.320> hit<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> couple<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.860> reps<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.250> to

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
and I'll hit a couple of reps just to

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.800 
and I'll hit a couple of reps just to
show<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.549> guys<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.060> groove<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:09.450> want<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.690> be

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
show you guys the groove you want to be

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.000 
show you guys the groove you want to be
in<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.290> how<00:03:10.470> it's<00:03:10.650> set<00:03:10.830> up

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
in and how it's set up

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.920 
in and how it's set up
okay<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:11.640> touched<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.060> little<00:03:12.299> one<00:03:12.480> set<00:03:12.750> up

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
okay so I touched a little one set up

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.320 
okay so I touched a little one set up
and<00:03:13.140> tightness<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.130> now<00:03:14.970> I'm<00:03:15.060> going<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.209> show

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
and tightness so now I'm going to show

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.140 
and tightness so now I'm going to show
you<00:03:15.360> guys<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:16.320> proper<00:03:16.560> bar<00:03:16.890> path<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.459> where

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
you guys the proper bar path and where

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.150 
you guys the proper bar path and where
to<00:03:18.269> hit<00:03:18.299> on<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.600> chest<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.080> how<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.860> keep<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
to hit on the chest and how to keep the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.770 
to hit on the chest and how to keep the
arms<00:03:20.430> tight<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.820> stuff<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.150> I'll<00:03:21.209> reset<00:03:21.630> up

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
arms tight and stuff so I'll reset up

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.350 
arms tight and stuff so I'll reset up
and<00:03:22.070> talk<00:03:23.070> about<00:03:23.190> power<00:03:23.549> path<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.150> tightness

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.990 

got<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.290> remember

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
got a remember

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.560 
got a remember
you<00:03:31.720> got<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.960> remember<00:03:32.110> at<00:03:32.350> all<00:03:32.380> times<00:03:33.570> once

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
you got to remember at all times once

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.340 
you got to remember at all times once
you're<00:03:34.720> set<00:03:34.990> up<00:03:35.020> and<00:03:35.440> you're<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.400> position<00:03:36.790> to

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
you're set up and you're in position to

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.680 
you're set up and you're in position to
bench<00:03:39.420> your<00:03:40.420> grip<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:40.960> important<00:03:42.480> what<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.510> like

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
bench your grip is important what I like

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.110 
bench your grip is important what I like
to<00:03:43.840> do<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:44.080> mimic<00:03:44.340> trying<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.460> take<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.850> bar

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
to do is mimic trying to take the bar

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.090 
to do is mimic trying to take the bar
and<00:03:46.650> actually<00:03:47.650> snap<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.580> this<00:03:49.180> way<00:03:49.420> in<00:03:49.690> half<00:03:50.100> so

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
and actually snap it this way in half so

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.740 
and actually snap it this way in half so
therefore<00:03:51.460> your<00:03:51.640> grip<00:03:51.820> is<00:03:51.970> it's<00:03:52.450> just<00:03:52.540> really

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
therefore your grip is it's just really

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.100 
therefore your grip is it's just really
really<00:03:53.140> tight<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.650> pulling<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:55.720> on<00:03:55.780> Richards

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
really tight and pulling so on Richards

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.690 
really tight and pulling so on Richards
gonna<00:03:56.260> give<00:03:56.410> me<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.560> bar<00:03:56.740> one<00:03:57.220> two<00:03:59.670> what<00:04:00.670> I

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
gonna give me the bar one two what I

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.720 
gonna give me the bar one two what I

everyone bench press is a little bit

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.920 
everyone bench press is a little bit
different<00:05:16.099> depending<00:05:16.219> on<00:05:16.490> body<00:05:16.669> mechanics

this is the way I like to bench I

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.490 
this is the way I like to bench I
wouldn't<00:05:20.750> say<00:05:20.840> it's<00:05:20.960> specific<00:05:21.440> for<00:05:21.469> me<00:05:21.740> but<00:05:22.389> in

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
wouldn't say it's specific for me but in

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.629 
wouldn't say it's specific for me but in
general<00:05:24.500> most<00:05:24.620> people<00:05:25.009> could<00:05:25.129> get<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.250> lot<00:05:25.460> out

of<00:05:25.930> this<00:05:26.930> type<00:05:27.169> of<00:05:27.199> technique<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:27.770> setup<00:05:28.039> when

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
of this type of technique and setup when

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.010 
of this type of technique and setup when
it<00:05:28.729> comes<00:05:28.909> to<00:05:29.030> powerlifting<00:05:29.629> and<00:05:29.780> strength

it comes to powerlifting and strength

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.959 
it comes to powerlifting and strength
training<00:05:30.169> you<00:05:31.099> want<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.310> shorten<00:05:31.669> your<00:05:31.759> range

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
training you want to shorten your range

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.140 
training you want to shorten your range
of<00:05:32.090> motion<00:05:32.150> as<00:05:32.740> much<00:05:33.740> as<00:05:33.889> possible<00:05:34.150> therefore

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
of motion as much as possible therefore

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.830 
of motion as much as possible therefore
setting<00:05:35.449> up<00:05:35.719> in<00:05:36.199> the<00:05:37.069> tightest<00:05:37.550> best<00:05:38.389> position

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.529 
setting up in the tightest best position
possible<00:05:38.870> with<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.590> arch<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:41.000> shorten<00:05:41.449> your

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
possible with the arch to shorten your

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.899 
possible with the arch to shorten your
range<00:05:41.779> of<00:05:41.930> motion<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.529> that<00:05:42.590> range<00:05:43.400> from<00:05:43.729> the

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
range of motion and that range from the

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.240 
range of motion and that range from the
bar<00:05:44.120> from<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.449> chest<00:05:44.750> to<00:05:45.020> lock<00:05:45.830> out<00:05:46.039> and

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
bar from the chest to lock out and

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.379 
bar from the chest to lock out and
that's<00:05:46.370> all<00:05:46.520> we<00:05:46.639> worried<00:05:46.909> about<00:05:47.090> it's<00:05:47.270> not

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
that's all we worried about it's not

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.080 
that's all we worried about it's not
really<00:05:47.689> about<00:05:47.779> the<00:05:48.289> size<00:05:49.250> of<00:05:49.400> your<00:05:49.550> pecs<00:05:49.819> when

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
really about the size of your pecs when

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.430 
really about the size of your pecs when
it<00:05:50.180> comes<00:05:50.360> to<00:05:50.509> benching<00:05:50.840> and<00:05:50.990> powerlifting

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
it comes to benching and powerlifting

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.200 
it comes to benching and powerlifting
training<00:05:51.860> um<00:05:52.039> so<00:05:52.370> therefore<00:05:52.699> your<00:05:52.849> technique

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
training um so therefore your technique

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.769 
training um so therefore your technique
setup<00:05:53.479> is<00:05:53.539> gonna<00:05:53.690> be<00:05:53.810> totally<00:05:54.110> different<00:05:54.319> and

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:55.779 
setup is gonna be totally different and

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:57.879 
setup is gonna be totally different and
what<00:05:56.779> you<00:05:56.900> focus<00:05:57.349> on<00:05:57.469> is<00:05:57.590> going<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:57.740> be

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
what you focus on is going to be

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.589 
what you focus on is going to be
different<00:05:58.330> staying<00:05:59.330> tight<00:05:59.659> and<00:06:01.599> shortening

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
different staying tight and shortening

the<00:06:02.690> range<00:06:02.870> of<00:06:03.020> motion<00:06:03.319> is<00:06:03.409> going<00:06:03.440> to<00:06:03.589> be<00:06:03.710> key

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
the range of motion is going to be key

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.700 
the range of motion is going to be key
