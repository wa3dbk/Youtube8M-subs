00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.740
 a geriatrician is that specialist 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.559
 in medicine that is dedicated to care 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.810
 of the health of the elderly 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.349
 geriatric doctor as such is the one who 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.860
 dedicates to the study and management of 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.530
 diseases of the elderly 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.330
 so in very simple terms 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.710
 a geriatrician is a doctor 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.880
 specialized in health care 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.490
 of the elderly 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.650
 is a doctor who has a training 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.840
 previous as a general practitioner of course 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.210
 and then as an internist and 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.620
 subsequently makes a specialization 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.620
 in pediatrics 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.300
 for my taste it is the most human of all 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.770
 the specialties is the most humane of 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.740
 all specialties because no 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.620
 we are seeing only one kidney or one eye or 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.570
 a liver but we are seeing everything 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.790
 the human being as a whole and there from 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.190
 beginning to end is to say since he was born 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.890
 until the last stage of his life to 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.110
 being able to treat it in an optimal way is 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.120
 say we take into account the human being in 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.190
 set what you develop in 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.490
 information as an internist 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.750
 what we see most is the part of 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.030
 pediatrics to older adults especially 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.740
 of type hospitalization or type of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.500
 external consultation a bone of the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.540
 population is older adult then 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.400
 when he starts having contact with 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.720
 these patients is developing that 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.480
 affinity and that that sense of passion 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.540
 towards the geriatric part and maybe 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.240
 that's where the 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.220
 why choose the specialty in 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.930
 pediatrics subsequently since childhood 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.910
 I'm used to dealing with people 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.340
 older adults and dealing with 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.220
 old I find it natural simple and 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.600
 also satisfactory later 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.100
 during information as a doctor 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.410
 I also had the opportunity to work 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.800
 closely with older adults and 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.470
 That helped me define my choice 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.760
 specialty 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.760
 towards geriatrics 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.690
 be able to help a problem that is 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.459
 presents today in the world that is the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.310
 aging and health care 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.790
 of older adults and to give another 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.349
 face medicine give a face 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.690
 friendly a humanitarian face where 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.790
 not all are surgeries, not all are 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.540
 procedures are not all medicines 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.390
 expensive retake what it is medicine and 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.640
 the accompaniment of the chronically ill is 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.590
 What I like the most in my work 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.540
 context of which a patient is 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.450
 totally different from the next you see 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.860
 and in the field that developed it in the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.049
 that moves that patient is the same 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.370
 totally different 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.410
 and interventions that do not go 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.690
 developing are very different one from 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.480
 another one depending on those contexts 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.739
 particular of patient or family 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.810
 which is where we are 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.300
 generally involved patient and 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.610
 family 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.950
 maybe what I'm passionate about in the sense 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.930
 of the older adult patient what more 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.150
 I enjoy without a doubt it is the contact 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.680
 everyday with older adults is 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.330
 people from whom you can learn 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.850
 very much fills the experience of 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.150
 wisdom and also very interesting 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.550
 always every encounter with a patient 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.540
 it's different to each patient you 're 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.040
 find at different times of his 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:34.400
 health or your illness 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.400
 the exchange with them is enriching 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.090
 the population is aging and as 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.470
 such will require this qualified and 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.590
 have the necessary skills 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.410
 for the attention of this kind of 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:55.099
 patients with their particularities and with 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.800
 his specialized management approach is a 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.050
 very promising labor field still in 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.099
 our country we have few geriatricians and 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.319
 our aging prospects 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.360
 population indicate that 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.950
 we will need a growing number 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.510
 but even for those who are not 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.610
 interested in dedicating themselves fully to the 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.950
 Older adults is important 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.530
 to become familiar with the concepts 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.900
 of aging and old age 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.329
 since with the exception of pediatrics 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.210
 to any branch of medicine to which 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.710
 they dedicate themselves will have contact every time 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.419
 more with older adults are needed 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.810
 many carnies in this country but 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.880
 also think that it does not necessarily go 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.250
 to be to treat patients that's what 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.870
 interesting and beautiful of geriatrics is 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.570
 say you can dedicate yourself to 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.700
 administer gerontological centers 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.580
 they can 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.340
 devote to research can be devoted to 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.620
 teaching is greatly diversified the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.910
 specialty of geriatrics that's why they 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.350
 I say do it by programming with a 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.770
 open mentality to the for a 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.960
 mentality where your practice as 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.460
 clinical doctor is going to diversify as 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.460
 they would never have expected it before
