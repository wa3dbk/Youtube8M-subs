00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.500
 Ingredients 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.380
 we'll put a spoonful of sweetener 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.130
 I use the sedac as it is outside and the stove 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:05.490
 it is used to carry on the hangs of the site 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:08.130
 own for the defendant, right? 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.679
 here in the recipe says a woman I want 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.120
 so I'm going to put a spoon 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:19.350
 and a half 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:24.830

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:33.390
 that is my doll what else she is 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:44.760
 admitted three spoons one two three 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:49.130
 spoons and then you will put 12 tablespoon 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.019
 this skim milk powder I use from here 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:03:09.420
 today that you have at home but if you have 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:15.019
 at home 3 5 7 8 12 twelve spoon and then you 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.019
 will see again its mass 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:27.050
 Okay, I changed the container because it's soap. 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.560
 little baby has seen this before then 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.560
 Saturday 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.720
 Okay, now you're going to add a woman. 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.290
 and baking powder 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.650
 this noncompliance that you issue uses the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.650
 job 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.430
 hit your mark you'll put in a 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.030
 I will use this form of 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.019
 silicone is because it does not stick but 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:20.580
 you do not have your silicone form 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:24.300
 you can put in a form of aluminum 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.610
 even lined with butter-paper is just 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.920
 there is a slight gross and all 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.600
 times I've done can with paper 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.910
 butter on paper 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:39.030
 so I went to get the silica form 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:43.140
 Are you going to put it here in your form? 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.660
 you'll let the dough rest for 15 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:50.490
 to 10 minutes 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.970
 It's there and there, the phone is more or 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.530
 least 1 180 degrees 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.630
 keep an eye okay because more and more or 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.480
 less than 15 minutes but it may be that 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.160
 be before they went to electric sheet 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.800
 with my colleague a temperature one 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.680
 slightly lower because generally the 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.050
 championship income 180graus but 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.760
 when I put 180graus the bread goes raw 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.970
 inside then I'll put in the range of 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.710
 1 160 more or less and keep an eye on it 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.610
 More or less, what they minister is 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.890

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.970
 in the meantime the steering wheel is and is 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.080
 very tasty 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.000
 It looks very soft, it's just that 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.600
 business is what i said take 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.290
 beware cvg 15 minutes the bread I almost 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.330

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.090
 if you want i will trust myself 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.220
 so I do not know if you observe 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.710
 my form is deep 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.840
 who is big so if you have a 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.540
 your people will surely 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.660
 stay over to the team to fight but if you 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.560
 have a shape like mine. 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.760
 try to make two recipes for this bread 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.950
 it's him 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.880
 By now your people will be fine. 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:17.370
 well of the two sizes imagined to stay 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.830
 two sizes and if it is only here I 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.730
 I also tried with coffee now it 's 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.520
 very tasty bread that okay I remember 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:30.810
 tell you what the ingredients are 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:34.590
 are four whites in snow point 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.080
 sigh two egg yolks a spoon and a half 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.930
 sweetener soup oven and stove three 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.540
 women of honey soup and jenna 12 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:46.170
 women with skimmed milk powder and a 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.270
 Organic yeast spoon is for cake 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:52.980
 leave it for about 15 minutes 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.990
 in the oven and let it rest is also more 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.400
 a little before for 15 minutes 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.030
 then puts more or less about 15 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.340
 minutes but careful to electric iphone 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.140
 so he has to be careful even if 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.310
 for unconventional problem of 15 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.070
 minutes will go 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:12.120
 I put my bread in the 60 degree 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:14.970
 recipe until 180 but I put 161 only 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.120
 almost half in and you can eat this 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.590
 bread up to four slices per day from 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.690
