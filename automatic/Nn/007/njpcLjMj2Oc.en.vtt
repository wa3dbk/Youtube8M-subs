out of the case I was have to say I was
really<00:01:56.450> pleasantly<00:01:57.020> surprised<00:01:57.880> how<00:01:58.880> easily

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
really pleasantly surprised how easily

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.620 
really pleasantly surprised how easily
it<00:01:59.450> played<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.080> how<00:02:01.039> it<00:02:01.160> sounded<00:02:01.580> it's<00:02:02.330> really

even all the way up and down the neck

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.770 
even all the way up and down the neck
every<00:02:06.110> note<00:02:06.290> is<00:02:06.500> really<00:02:06.740> crystal<00:02:07.430> clear<00:02:07.780> the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
every note is really crystal clear the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.120 
every note is really crystal clear the
frets<00:02:09.049> seem<00:02:09.259> perfect<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:09.920> know<00:02:10.009> absolutely

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130

no<00:02:10.489> buzzing<00:02:10.880> or

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.550 

and<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.090> seems<00:02:18.299> like<00:02:18.360> there's<00:02:18.689> maybe<00:02:19.319> it's

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
and it seems like there's maybe it's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.960 
and it seems like there's maybe it's
because<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.069> any<00:02:20.250> fingerboard<00:02:20.730> there's

because you have any fingerboard there's

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.660 
because you have any fingerboard there's
there's<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.360> natural<00:02:21.659> sustain<00:02:22.260> that's<00:02:22.769> maybe<00:02:23.519> a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
there's a natural sustain that's maybe a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.000 
there's a natural sustain that's maybe a
little<00:02:23.700> bit<00:02:23.970> greater<00:02:24.209> than<00:02:24.769> most<00:02:25.769> other
