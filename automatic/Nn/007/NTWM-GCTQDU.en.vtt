00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
can't steer what we have just done is

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.810 
can't steer what we have just done is
release<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.870> steer<00:00:10.110> just<00:00:10.679> using<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.070> photo<00:00:11.340> to

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
release the steer just using a photo to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.140 
release the steer just using a photo to
control<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.480> car<00:00:12.719> movement<00:00:13.639> now<00:00:14.639> look<00:00:14.940> at<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
control the car movement now look at the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.109 
control the car movement now look at the
different<00:00:15.540> okay<00:00:16.130> now<00:00:17.130> i'm<00:00:17.369> doing<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.699> second

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
different okay now i'm doing a second

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:32.030 
different okay now i'm doing a second
step<00:00:18.330> first<00:00:25.550> now<00:00:26.550> add<00:00:26.789> something<00:00:27.150> more<00:00:31.040> notice

step first now add something more notice
what's<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.489> difference<00:00:32.880> oh<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.360> crash<00:00:38.120> can

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
what's the difference oh I'm a crash can

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.160 
what's the difference oh I'm a crash can
you<00:00:39.210> see<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> donor<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.870> getting<00:00:40.440> really<00:00:41.280> big

bega big okay I got a bit far so you can
see<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.120> large<00:00:56.330> circle<00:00:56.840> of<00:00:56.990> the<00:00:57.440> scheme<00:00:57.710> at

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
see the large circle of the scheme at

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.180 
see the large circle of the scheme at
China<00:01:00.080> steer<00:01:00.760> kick<00:01:01.760> on<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:01.940> pedal<00:01:03.040> now<00:01:04.040> I'm

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
China steer kick on the pedal now I'm

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:13.190 
China steer kick on the pedal now I'm
kind<00:01:04.460> of<00:01:04.699> steering

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.920 

can<00:01:13.799> see<00:01:14.009> a<00:01:14.039> circle<00:01:14.579> fair<00:01:15.509> steady<00:01:16.880> speaker<00:01:17.930> so

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
can see a circle fair steady speaker so

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.450 
can see a circle fair steady speaker so
we<00:01:19.110> go<00:01:19.259> back<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.469> look<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> scheme<00:01:20.280> out

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
we go back to look at the scheme out

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.370 
we go back to look at the scheme out
here<00:01:23.299> okay<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:25.950> you're<00:01:26.100> doing<00:01:26.369> step<00:01:26.610> 2<00:01:27.380> 3

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
here okay so when you're doing step 2 3

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.319 
here okay so when you're doing step 2 3
free<00:01:28.530> file<00:01:28.740> any<00:01:28.950> steer<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.789> see<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
free file any steer you can see the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.200 
free file any steer you can see the
circle<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.960> much<00:01:31.229> smaller<00:01:34.969> that's<00:01:35.969> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
circle is much smaller that's the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.940 
circle is much smaller that's the
difference<00:01:36.420> that's<00:01:36.929> a<00:01:37.079> frame<00:01:37.350> important

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
difference that's a frame important

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.010 
difference that's a frame important
point<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:40.380> use<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:41.240> steer<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.420> control

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
point so you can use to steer to control

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.039 
point so you can use to steer to control
the<00:01:43.679> size<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> doughnut<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.759> also<00:01:45.599> you

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the size of the doughnut and also you

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.699 
the size of the doughnut and also you
can<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:49.789> acceleration<00:01:50.789> I'll<00:01:51.149> carry<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.709> to

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
can use acceleration I'll carry it to

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.770 
can use acceleration I'll carry it to
make<00:01:52.920> sure<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.789> can<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> very<00:01:54.599> good

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
make sure you can have a very good

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.339 
make sure you can have a very good
control<00:01:55.319> of<00:01:55.349> the<00:01:55.530> donut<00:01:55.890> we'll<00:01:56.849> just<00:01:57.349> come

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
control of the donut we'll just come

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:06.410 
control of the donut we'll just come
here<00:02:00.500> push<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:02.030> keep<00:02:03.030> pushing<00:02:05.239> into<00:02:06.239> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
here push it keep pushing into the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.900 
here push it keep pushing into the
center<00:02:06.959> of<00:02:06.989> the<00:02:07.259> track<00:02:07.770> remember<00:02:08.549> is<00:02:08.610> tricky

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
center of the track remember is tricky

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.190 
center of the track remember is tricky
okay<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.890> we<00:02:14.010> got<00:02:14.160> come<00:02:14.549> here<00:02:14.790> okay<00:02:15.150> what<00:02:16.049> we

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
okay so we got come here okay what we

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.979 
okay so we got come here okay what we
are<00:02:16.290> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> do<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:17.940> very<00:02:18.389> very

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
are going to do is to do a very very

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.330 
are going to do is to do a very very
steady<00:02:19.980> donut<00:02:20.609> and<00:02:21.019> not<00:02:22.019> crashing<00:02:22.739> come<00:02:23.010> let's

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
steady donut and not crashing come let's

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:34.540 
steady donut and not crashing come let's
see

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.940 

now<00:02:35.090> I'm<00:02:35.240> getting<00:02:35.450> very<00:02:35.930> close<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.530> cone

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
now I'm getting very close to the cone

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.400 
now I'm getting very close to the cone
very<00:02:37.580> very<00:02:38.000> close<00:02:38.270> but<00:02:38.600> he<00:02:38.660> didn't<00:02:39.020> touch<00:02:39.200> it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
very very close but he didn't touch it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.800 
very very close but he didn't touch it
at<00:02:39.530> all<00:02:39.680> now<00:02:40.520> i'm<00:02:40.700> going<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.000> make<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.330> circle

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
at all now i'm going to make the circle

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.210 
at all now i'm going to make the circle
be<00:02:41.990> larger<00:02:43.870> can<00:02:44.870> see<00:02:45.110> I'm<00:02:45.230> far<00:02:45.710> away<00:02:45.860> from<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
be larger can see I'm far away from the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:58.810 
be larger can see I'm far away from the
comb<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.900> can<00:02:57.080> also<00:02:57.260> practice<00:02:57.680> using<00:02:58.280> ahem

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
comb you can also practice using ahem

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.740 
comb you can also practice using ahem
break<00:02:59.150> into<00:02:59.570> entering<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:01.360> doughnut<00:03:02.360> corner

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
break into entering the doughnut corner

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.880 
break into entering the doughnut corner
let's<00:03:03.050> see<00:03:03.260> first<00:03:03.770> gear<00:03:04.600> Hambrick<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:09.440> can<00:03:09.680> do

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
let's see first gear Hambrick you can do

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.500 
let's see first gear Hambrick you can do
you<00:03:10.160> turn<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.820> license<00:03:11.480> bambrick<00:03:13.450> also<00:03:14.450> you

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
you turn the license bambrick also you

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.140 
you turn the license bambrick also you
can<00:03:14.840> use<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:15.020> hand<00:03:15.380> brake<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.740> do<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.040> nice<00:03:16.730> donut

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
can use a hand brake to do it nice donut

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.470 
can use a hand brake to do it nice donut
to<00:03:17.750> keep<00:03:17.990> turning<00:03:18.380> turning<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.160> break<00:03:19.480> all

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
to keep turning turning and break all

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:28.960 
to keep turning turning and break all
photo

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.590 

so<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:30.050> go<00:03:30.290> out<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.740> track<00:03:31.670> get<00:03:32.030> very

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
so you can go out to the track get very

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.350 
so you can go out to the track get very
steady<00:03:36.430> that's<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.640> first<00:03:37.880> part<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.180> my

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
steady that's the first part of my

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.960 
steady that's the first part of my
