let's<00:00:01.949> go<00:00:02.070> ahead<00:00:02.190> and<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.429> swing<00:00:02.790> your<00:00:02.909> upper

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
let's go ahead and a swing your upper

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.230 
let's go ahead and a swing your upper
arm<00:00:03.330> forward<00:00:03.929> and<00:00:04.700> just<00:00:05.700> like<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:05.940> did<00:00:06.120> with

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
arm forward and just like we did with

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.490 
arm forward and just like we did with
the<00:00:06.390> other<00:00:06.509> parts<00:00:06.930> right<00:00:07.109> let's<00:00:07.350> keep

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the other parts right let's keep

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:24.259 
the other parts right let's keep
everything<00:00:07.919> else<00:00:08.250> quietly<00:00:09.120> frozen<00:00:21.949> I<00:00:23.269> notice

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
everything else quietly frozen I notice

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.870 
everything else quietly frozen I notice
here<00:00:24.449> for<00:00:24.840> arms<00:00:25.289> hands<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.070> fingers<00:00:26.160> go<00:00:26.670> along

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
here for arms hands and fingers go along

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.529 
here for arms hands and fingers go along
for<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> ride<00:00:29.029> let's<00:00:30.029> take<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> look<00:00:30.420> at

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
for the ride let's take a look at

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.380 
for the ride let's take a look at
another<00:00:30.720> motion<00:00:31.019> our<00:00:31.380> arms<00:00:31.679> are<00:00:31.800> capable

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
another motion our arms are capable

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:46.430 
another motion our arms are capable
let's<00:00:33.390> go<00:00:33.480> ahead<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.719> flap<00:00:34.050> our<00:00:34.260> wings

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.630 

tuck<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.989> return<00:00:49.160> now<00:00:50.160> there's<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.610> more

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
tuck and return now there's one more

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.880 
tuck and return now there's one more
motion<00:00:51.420> our<00:00:51.690> box<00:00:52.080> capable<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.620> writing<00:00:52.800> that's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
motion our box capable of writing that's

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.200 
motion our box capable of writing that's
rotation<00:00:53.690> in<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> shoulders<00:00:55.230> let's<00:00:55.470> try

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.020 

now<00:01:01.750> one<00:01:02.440> thing<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.860> notice<00:01:03.070> here<00:01:03.220> is<00:01:03.460> that<00:01:03.760> if

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
now one thing to notice here is that if

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.180 
now one thing to notice here is that if
we<00:01:04.239> use<00:01:04.269> any<00:01:04.750> one<00:01:05.019> of<00:01:05.050> those<00:01:05.260> motions<00:01:05.980> in

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
we use any one of those motions in

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.280 
we use any one of those motions in
isolation<00:01:06.790> looks<00:01:07.180> very<00:01:07.390> stiff<00:01:07.810> in<00:01:07.840> robot

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
isolation looks very stiff in robot

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.180 
isolation looks very stiff in robot
doesn't<00:01:08.890> it<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:10.230> so<00:01:11.230> here<00:01:11.380> let's<00:01:11.560> let's<00:01:11.950> do

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
doesn't it right so here let's let's do

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.010 
doesn't it right so here let's let's do
stick<00:01:12.520> in<00:01:12.670> robotic

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.280 

right<00:01:19.650> well<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.670> solution<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
right well the solution to that and the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.050 
right well the solution to that and the
way<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.530> free<00:01:22.860> per<00:01:23.100> technique<00:01:23.579> is<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.909> make

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
way to free per technique is to make

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
way to free per technique is to make
sure<00:01:24.090> none<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.720> those<00:01:24.990> motions<00:01:25.619> ever<00:01:25.860> becomes

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
sure none of those motions ever becomes

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.109 
sure none of those motions ever becomes
rigid<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.210> fixed<00:01:27.840> right<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.229> solution<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
rigid or fixed right the solution is to

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.539 
rigid or fixed right the solution is to
make<00:01:30.240> sure<00:01:30.299> all<00:01:31.110> three<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.710> those<00:01:31.799> motions<00:01:32.430> are

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
make sure all three of those motions are

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.210 
make sure all three of those motions are
operating<00:01:33.590> simultaneous<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.979> very

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
operating simultaneous in a very

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.219 
operating simultaneous in a very
free-flowing<00:01:41.390> let's<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> look<00:01:42.899> now<00:01:42.929> at

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
free-flowing let's take a look now at

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.109 
free-flowing let's take a look now at
how<00:01:43.259> our<00:01:43.439> forms<00:01:43.979> move<00:01:44.250> independently<00:01:44.939> from

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
how our forms move independently from

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.109 
how our forms move independently from
all<00:01:45.299> our<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.570> body<00:01:45.869> parts<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.000> we

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
all our other body parts so just like we

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.260 
all our other body parts so just like we
did<00:01:48.149> before<00:01:49.580> pretend<00:01:50.580> that<00:01:50.670> all<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:51.149> other

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
did before pretend that all the other

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.690 
did before pretend that all the other
parts<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:52.319> now<00:01:52.500> participating<00:01:52.770> are

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
parts that are now participating are

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.039 
parts that are now participating are
just<00:01:54.659> kind<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.899> quietly<00:01:55.319> frozen<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:57.720> let's<00:01:57.929> go

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
just kind of quietly frozen so let's go

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.139 
just kind of quietly frozen so let's go
ahead<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.409> let's<00:01:58.560> move<00:01:58.740> our<00:01:58.920> forearms<00:01:59.580> up<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
ahead and let's move our forearms up and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.830 
ahead and let's move our forearms up and
down<00:02:00.360> from<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.380> elbow<00:02:05.119> all<00:02:06.119> right<00:02:06.209> I<00:02:06.390> notice

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
down from the elbow all right I notice

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.539 
down from the elbow all right I notice
that<00:02:06.959> your<00:02:07.170> hands<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.709> your<00:02:07.830> fingers<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.369> go

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
that your hands and your fingers just go

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.509 
that your hands and your fingers just go
along<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.940> ride<00:02:09.209> right<00:02:10.250> let's<00:02:11.250> take<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
along for the ride right let's take a

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.920 
along for the ride right let's take a
look<00:02:11.700> at<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.880> other<00:02:12.000> motion<00:02:12.450> their<00:02:12.569> forms

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
look at the other motion their forms

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.080 
look at the other motion their forms
capable<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.739> that's<00:02:13.830> rotation<00:02:14.610> from<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
capable of and that's rotation from the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.729 
capable of and that's rotation from the
elbow<00:02:15.500> that's<00:02:16.500> good<00:02:17.010> clockwise<00:02:18.739> counter

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
elbow that's good clockwise counter

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:26.810 
elbow that's good clockwise counter
clockwise<00:02:23.810> tucked<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:24.989> here<00:02:25.640> with<00:02:26.640> time

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
clockwise tucked in here with time

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.319 
clockwise tucked in here with time
making<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.390> rotation<00:02:28.019> rights<00:02:29.000> c3po<00:02:30.000> arms

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
making this rotation rights c3po arms

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.949 
making this rotation rights c3po arms
don't<00:02:30.540> forget<00:02:30.980> right<00:02:32.030> now<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.299> just<00:02:33.720> want<00:02:33.900> to

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
don't forget right now I just want to

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.300 
don't forget right now I just want to
make<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.079> point<00:02:34.350> here<00:02:34.500> about<00:02:34.620> freeing<00:02:35.040> up<00:02:35.130> your

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
make a point here about freeing up your

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.490 
make a point here about freeing up your
technique<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.820> that's<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.239> any<00:02:37.200> one<00:02:37.470> of

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
technique and that's this any one of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.979 
technique and that's this any one of
these<00:02:37.680> two<00:02:38.040> motions<00:02:38.489> used<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.880> isolation<00:02:39.540> is

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
these two motions used in isolation is

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.780 
these two motions used in isolation is
going<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.440> look<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.890> feel<00:02:41.299> stiff<00:02:42.739> right<00:02:43.790> just

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
going to look and feel stiff right just

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.690 
going to look and feel stiff right just
up<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.150> down<00:02:46.579> just<00:02:47.579> rotation<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:50.220> key<00:02:50.519> to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
up and down just rotation the key to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.430 
up and down just rotation the key to
freeing<00:02:51.030> up<00:02:51.150> your<00:02:51.329> technique<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.260> make

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
freeing up your technique is to make

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.500 
freeing up your technique is to make
sure<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.890> simultaneously<00:02:53.489> free<00:02:54.390> up

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
sure that you simultaneously free up

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.550 
sure that you simultaneously free up
both<00:02:55.109> of<00:02:55.440> these<00:02:55.560> motions

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.440 

one<00:03:01.130> last<00:03:01.340> point<00:03:01.610> well<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:01.940> truck<00:03:02.270> we're

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
one last point well the truck we're

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.000 
one last point well the truck we're
talking<00:03:02.870> about<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.170> forearms<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:03.800> that's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
talking about the forearms and that's

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.720 
talking about the forearms and that's
this<00:03:05.470> let's<00:03:06.470> go<00:03:06.590> ahead<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:07.250> take<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.460> look<00:03:07.670> at

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
this let's go ahead and take a look at

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.400 
this let's go ahead and take a look at
those<00:03:07.820> two<00:03:08.120> degrees<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.510> freedom<00:03:08.630> again<00:03:09.170> right

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
those two degrees of freedom again right

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.710 
those two degrees of freedom again right
up<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.220> down<00:03:10.370> motion<00:03:10.610> except<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:11.510> time

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
up and down motion except this time

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.340 
up and down motion except this time
let's<00:03:11.930> try<00:03:12.050> moving<00:03:12.410> as<00:03:12.530> fast<00:03:12.860> as<00:03:13.070> we<00:03:13.190> can<00:03:13.460> not<00:03:14.180> a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
let's try moving as fast as we can not a

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.260 
let's try moving as fast as we can not a
you<00:03:15.350> know<00:03:15.410> big<00:03:15.920> distance<00:03:16.370> but<00:03:16.550> just<00:03:16.730> fast<00:03:17.000> and

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
you know big distance but just fast and

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.880 
you know big distance but just fast and
kind<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.480> over<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.780> small<00:03:18.140> distance<00:03:18.170> right

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
kind of over a small distance right

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.960 
kind of over a small distance right
because<00:03:19.100> if<00:03:19.160> you're<00:03:19.280> moving<00:03:19.400> over<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.790> big

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
because if you're moving over a big

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.490 
because if you're moving over a big
distance<00:03:20.450> we're<00:03:20.570> gonna<00:03:20.690> make<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.870> lot<00:03:21.140> of<00:03:21.170> mess

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
distance we're gonna make a lot of mess

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.620 
distance we're gonna make a lot of mess
with<00:03:21.740> our<00:03:21.860> whole<00:03:22.640> body's<00:03:23.060> shaking<00:03:23.090> and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
with our whole body's shaking and

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.050 
with our whole body's shaking and
whatnot<00:03:23.990> so<00:03:24.680> here<00:03:24.860> just<00:03:25.370> kind<00:03:25.580> of<00:03:25.610> move<00:03:25.820> it

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
whatnot so here just kind of move it

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.540 
whatnot so here just kind of move it
cyclic<00:03:26.660> back<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.080> forth<00:03:27.380> as<00:03:27.560> fast<00:03:27.950> as<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.310> can

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
cyclic back and forth as fast as you can

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.940 
cyclic back and forth as fast as you can
kind<00:03:28.940> of<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.510> know<00:03:29.570> small<00:03:30.200> distance<00:03:30.680> for

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
kind of a you know small distance for

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.640 
kind of a you know small distance for
him<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.730> see<00:03:32.060> how<00:03:32.209> fast<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.930> can<00:03:33.140> cycle<00:03:33.350> back

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
him and see how fast you can cycle back

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
him and see how fast you can cycle back
and<00:03:33.680> forth<00:03:34.959> now<00:03:35.959> let's<00:03:36.320> compare<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.310> the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
and forth now let's compare that to the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.090 
and forth now let's compare that to the
rotary<00:03:38.120> motion<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:39.110> rotary<00:03:39.500> motion<00:03:39.890> back

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
rotary motion of the rotary motion back

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.300 
rotary motion of the rotary motion back
and<00:03:40.130> forth<00:03:42.400> yeah<00:03:44.739> if<00:03:45.739> you're<00:03:45.890> like<00:03:46.010> me<00:03:46.190> you're

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
and forth yeah if you're like me you're

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.400 
and forth yeah if you're like me you're
gonna<00:03:46.430> notice<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.970> this<00:03:47.390> motion<00:03:47.750> can<00:03:48.170> be

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
gonna notice that this motion can be

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.920 
gonna notice that this motion can be
accomplished<00:03:49.070> so<00:03:49.550> much<00:03:49.790> more<00:03:50.120> freer<00:03:50.630> and

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
accomplished so much more freer and

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.550 
accomplished so much more freer and
faster<00:03:51.620> than<00:03:52.459> this<00:03:52.700> motion<00:03:53.209> just<00:03:54.110> put<00:03:54.350> that<00:03:54.500> in

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
faster than this motion just put that in

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.050 
faster than this motion just put that in
your<00:03:54.650> back<00:03:54.860> pocket<00:03:55.459> for<00:03:55.489> now<00:03:55.730> that's<00:03:55.910> gonna

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
your back pocket for now that's gonna

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.390 
your back pocket for now that's gonna
pay<00:03:56.330> enormous<00:03:56.900> dividends<00:03:57.680> when<00:03:57.890> we<00:03:58.010> take<00:03:58.220> our

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
pay enormous dividends when we take our

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.900 
pay enormous dividends when we take our
body<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.120> piano<00:03:59.480> later<00:04:00.290> on<00:04:00.500> in<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.709> video

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.520 

time<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:05.060> take<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.299> look<00:04:05.480> at<00:04:05.630> our<00:04:05.840> hands<00:04:06.170> move

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
time to take a look at our hands move

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.820 
time to take a look at our hands move
independent<00:04:07.370> of<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:08.000> other<00:04:08.120> body<00:04:08.390> parts<00:04:08.840> so

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
independent of the other body parts so

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.640 
independent of the other body parts so
just<00:04:10.190> like<00:04:10.310> we<00:04:10.430> did<00:04:10.580> before<00:04:11.290> let<00:04:12.290> all<00:04:12.530> those

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
just like we did before let all those

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.680 
just like we did before let all those
parts<00:04:13.070> that<00:04:13.130> are<00:04:13.340> participating<00:04:13.820> just<00:04:14.510> kind

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
parts that are participating just kind

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.240 
parts that are participating just kind
of<00:04:14.720> be<00:04:14.810> quietly<00:04:15.350> frozen<00:04:17.350> so<00:04:18.350> let's<00:04:19.040> go<00:04:19.190> ahead

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
of be quietly frozen so let's go ahead

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.800 
of be quietly frozen so let's go ahead
and<00:04:19.430> let's<00:04:19.580> move<00:04:19.700> our<00:04:19.910> hands<00:04:20.330> up<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:20.570> down

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
and let's move our hands up and down

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.030 
and let's move our hands up and down
from<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.890> wrists

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.620 

you<00:04:28.040> notice<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.430> our<00:04:28.550> fingers<00:04:28.940> go<00:04:29.150> along<00:04:29.390> for

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
you notice that our fingers go along for

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.320 
you notice that our fingers go along for
the<00:04:29.690> ride<00:04:29.840> right<00:04:30.230> now<00:04:31.160> by<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.760> way<00:04:32.090> don't

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
the ride right now by the way don't

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.150 
the ride right now by the way don't
forget<00:04:32.480> this<00:04:33.080> right<00:04:33.140> make<00:04:33.590> sure<00:04:33.620> your<00:04:33.950> fingers

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
forget this right make sure your fingers

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.680 
forget this right make sure your fingers
are<00:04:34.400> foam<00:04:34.760> this<00:04:35.000> -<00:04:35.510> natural<00:04:35.990> curvature<00:04:36.290> right

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
are foam this - natural curvature right

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.560 
are foam this - natural curvature right
working<00:04:38.690> harder<00:04:39.080> than<00:04:39.140> we<00:04:39.380> need<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.710> here

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
working harder than we need to here

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.850 
working harder than we need to here
let's<00:04:41.570> take<00:04:41.720> a<00:04:41.750> look<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.080> other<00:04:42.200> motion<00:04:42.740> our

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
let's take a look the other motion our

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.720 
let's take a look the other motion our
hand<00:04:43.040> is<00:04:43.190> capable<00:04:43.730> of<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:45.050> that's<00:04:45.730> this

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
hand is capable of and that's this

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.540 
hand is capable of and that's this
lateral<00:04:47.300> motion<00:04:47.980> outside<00:04:49.060> inside<00:04:50.060> outside

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
lateral motion outside inside outside

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.720 
lateral motion outside inside outside
inside<00:04:53.110> inside<00:04:55.990> now<00:04:56.990> just<00:04:57.860> like<00:04:58.040> before<00:04:58.280> the

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
inside inside now just like before the

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.910 
inside inside now just like before the
way<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.000> free<00:04:59.510> up<00:04:59.630> your<00:04:59.840> technique<00:05:00.380> is<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.770> make

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
way to free up your technique is to make

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.220 
way to free up your technique is to make
sure<00:05:00.950> that<00:05:01.130> neither<00:05:01.670> one<00:05:02.210> of<00:05:02.240> these<00:05:02.720> motions

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
sure that neither one of these motions

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.400 
sure that neither one of these motions
is<00:05:04.010> used<00:05:04.880> in<00:05:05.120> isolation<00:05:05.690> that<00:05:05.870> they're<00:05:06.170> both

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
is used in isolation that they're both

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.130 
is used in isolation that they're both
operative<00:05:07.420> simultaneously<00:05:08.420> in<00:05:08.480> a<00:05:08.540> very<00:05:08.780> free

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
operative simultaneously in a very free

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:16.210 
operative simultaneously in a very free
and<00:05:09.350> flowing<00:05:09.950> manner<00:05:14.890> finally<00:05:15.890> we<00:05:15.980> get<00:05:16.070> to

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
and flowing manner finally we get to

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.720 
and flowing manner finally we get to
talk<00:05:16.370> about<00:05:16.520> our<00:05:16.700> fingers<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.120> little<00:05:17.270> bit<00:05:17.390> more

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
talk about our fingers a little bit more

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.890 
talk about our fingers a little bit more
what<00:05:19.730> we<00:05:19.820> want<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.090> do<00:05:20.240> is<00:05:20.390> we<00:05:20.570> want<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.720> do<00:05:20.870> a

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
what we want to do is we want to do a

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.780 
what we want to do is we want to do a
real<00:05:21.200> quick<00:05:21.230> review<00:05:21.710> of<00:05:21.980> how<00:05:22.250> our<00:05:22.370> fingers

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
real quick review of how our fingers

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.200 
real quick review of how our fingers
need<00:05:23.090> to<00:05:23.210> operate<00:05:23.720> at<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.470> piano<00:05:24.890> before<00:05:25.850> we

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
need to operate at the piano before we

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.480 
need to operate at the piano before we
do<00:05:26.420> that<00:05:26.720> don't<00:05:27.320> forget<00:05:27.860> right<00:05:28.690> nice<00:05:29.690> natural

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
do that don't forget right nice natural

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.600 
do that don't forget right nice natural
curvature<00:05:31.490> here<00:05:32.180> right<00:05:32.570> none<00:05:32.960> of<00:05:33.140> this<00:05:33.610> none

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
curvature here right none of this none

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.300 
curvature here right none of this none
of<00:05:34.760> this<00:05:34.910> this<00:05:35.450> is<00:05:35.810> our<00:05:36.050> starting<00:05:36.530> point<00:05:36.860> nice

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
of this this is our starting point nice

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.890 
of this this is our starting point nice
and<00:05:37.700> natural<00:05:38.290> so<00:05:39.290> with<00:05:39.410> that<00:05:39.530> in<00:05:39.650> mind<00:05:40.900> let's

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
and natural so with that in mind let's

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.300 
and natural so with that in mind let's
go<00:05:42.050> ahead<00:05:42.320> let's<00:05:42.740> take<00:05:42.950> a<00:05:42.980> look<00:05:43.160> at<00:05:43.220> the

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
go ahead let's take a look at the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.400 
go ahead let's take a look at the
various<00:05:43.610> motions<00:05:44.330> our<00:05:44.450> fingers<00:05:44.810> are<00:05:44.960> capable

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
various motions our fingers are capable

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.840 
various motions our fingers are capable
of<00:05:45.580> independently<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:47.480> rest<00:05:47.690> of<00:05:47.810> our<00:05:47.930> body<00:05:48.850> go

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
of independently the rest of our body go

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.640 
of independently the rest of our body go
ahead<00:05:50.000> and<00:05:50.120> move<00:05:50.180> our<00:05:50.570> fingers<00:05:50.930> down<00:05:51.140> starting

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
ahead and move our fingers down starting

00:05:51.650 --> 00:06:03.490 
ahead and move our fingers down starting
with<00:05:51.770> our<00:05:51.860> thumb<00:05:55.510> two<00:05:57.160> three<00:05:58.540> four<00:05:59.950> five

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.400 

now<00:06:04.160> don't<00:06:04.940> forget<00:06:05.210> there's<00:06:05.630> never<00:06:05.870> any<00:06:06.200> need

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
now don't forget there's never any need

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.520 
now don't forget there's never any need
to<00:06:06.650> lift<00:06:07.400> our<00:06:07.820> fingers<00:06:08.480> from<00:06:08.720> this<00:06:08.900> natural

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
to lift our fingers from this natural

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.110 
to lift our fingers from this natural
starting<00:06:09.890> point<00:06:10.100> right<00:06:10.490> in<00:06:10.550> fact<00:06:10.790> this<00:06:10.910> is<00:06:11.030> a

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
starting point right in fact this is a

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.850 
starting point right in fact this is a
very<00:06:11.150> unnatural<00:06:11.840> act<00:06:12.290> as<00:06:12.470> we<00:06:12.620> wondered

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
very unnatural act as we wondered

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.790 
very unnatural act as we wondered
earlier<00:06:13.280> so<00:06:13.490> there's<00:06:14.210> gonna<00:06:14.530> remind<00:06:15.530> you<00:06:15.740> that

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
earlier so there's gonna remind you that

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.220 
earlier so there's gonna remind you that
for<00:06:16.190> now<00:06:16.360> our<00:06:17.360> fingers<00:06:17.690> can<00:06:17.840> also<00:06:18.020> move

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
for now our fingers can also move

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.560 
for now our fingers can also move
laterally<00:06:18.710> right<00:06:19.100> so<00:06:19.850> it's<00:06:20.000> been<00:06:20.030> worth<00:06:20.300> thumb

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
laterally right so it's been worth thumb

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.060 
laterally right so it's been worth thumb
left<00:06:21.670> and<00:06:22.670> right<00:06:23.320> pretty<00:06:24.320> easy<00:06:24.470> right

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
left and right pretty easy right

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.850 
left and right pretty easy right
so<00:06:25.460> the<00:06:25.580> four<00:06:26.210> fingers<00:06:26.570> not<00:06:26.750> so<00:06:26.990> easy<00:06:27.230> right

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
so the four fingers not so easy right

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.130 
so the four fingers not so easy right
index<00:06:28.280> finger<00:06:28.810> right

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
index finger right

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.050 
index finger right
middle<00:06:30.770> left<00:06:31.160> right<00:06:31.780> ring<00:06:32.780> left<00:06:33.470> right<00:06:34.060> pinky

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
left right now for the next motion we

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.480 
left right now for the next motion we
have<00:06:41.420> two<00:06:41.570> unthaw<00:06:42.050> hand<00:06:42.560> right<00:06:42.950> because<00:06:43.280> it's

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
have two unthaw hand right because it's

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.520 
have two unthaw hand right because it's
so<00:06:44.450> well<00:06:44.570> as<00:06:44.660> curious<00:06:44.960> things<00:06:45.200> about<00:06:45.260> our

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
so well as curious things about our

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.410 
so well as curious things about our
Anatomy<00:06:45.950> right<00:06:46.130> it's<00:06:46.370> it's<00:06:46.880> not<00:06:47.060> clear<00:06:47.300> where

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
Anatomy right it's it's not clear where

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.300 
Anatomy right it's it's not clear where
our<00:06:47.540> fingers<00:06:47.930> enter<00:06:48.410> and<00:06:48.560> our<00:06:48.680> hand<00:06:48.950> begins

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
our fingers enter and our hand begins

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.640 
our fingers enter and our hand begins
and<00:06:49.580> vice<00:06:49.820> versa<00:06:50.470> right<00:06:51.670> you<00:06:52.670> want<00:06:52.940> to

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
and vice versa right you want to

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.330 
and vice versa right you want to
accomplish<00:06:54.650> this<00:06:54.800> very<00:06:55.250> easy<00:06:55.940> and<00:06:56.900> gentle

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
accomplish this very easy and gentle

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.770 
accomplish this very easy and gentle
expansion<00:06:58.340> and<00:06:58.460> contraction<00:06:58.640> of<00:06:59.270> our<00:06:59.390> hand

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
expansion and contraction of our hand

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:06.400 
expansion and contraction of our hand
and<00:07:00.200> fingers<00:07:04.240> no<00:07:05.240> one<00:07:05.419> distress<00:07:05.930> there's<00:07:06.230> just

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
and fingers no one distress there's just

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.560 
and fingers no one distress there's just
a<00:07:06.500> nice<00:07:06.740> gentle<00:07:08.080> expansion<00:07:09.080> contraction<00:07:10.570> all

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
a nice gentle expansion contraction all

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.970 
a nice gentle expansion contraction all
I'm<00:07:11.750> going<00:07:11.870> to<00:07:11.930> say<00:07:12.140> about<00:07:12.290> the<00:07:12.440> fingers<00:07:12.800> is

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:12.980 
I'm going to say about the fingers is

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.790 
I'm going to say about the fingers is
this<00:07:13.190> is<00:07:13.580> in<00:07:14.030> general<00:07:14.480> right<00:07:15.110> we're<00:07:15.530> never

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
this is in general right we're never

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.570 
this is in general right we're never
just<00:07:16.250> using<00:07:16.790> a<00:07:17.030> single<00:07:17.960> isolated<00:07:18.710> motion<00:07:19.460> in

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580 
just using a single isolated motion in

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.050 
just using a single isolated motion in
general<00:07:20.030> all<00:07:20.540> these<00:07:20.990> motions<00:07:21.620> are<00:07:22.060> operative

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.060 
general all these motions are operative

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.390 
general all these motions are operative
and<00:07:23.330> so<00:07:24.020> if<00:07:24.110> you<00:07:24.200> want<00:07:24.440> to<00:07:24.500> cult<00:07:24.740> the<00:07:24.890> feeling

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400 
and so if you want to cult the feeling

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.219 
and so if you want to cult the feeling
of<00:07:25.520> freedom<00:07:25.940> and<00:07:26.270> stay<00:07:26.479> away<00:07:26.720> from<00:07:26.750> all<00:07:27.110> the

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:27.229 
of freedom and stay away from all the

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:30.130 
of freedom and stay away from all the
rigidity<00:07:27.620> and<00:07:28.310> stiffness<00:07:28.760> and<00:07:29.240> robotic<00:07:29.930> type

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.140 
rigidity and stiffness and robotic type

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.560 
rigidity and stiffness and robotic type
playing<00:07:30.550> all<00:07:31.550> these<00:07:31.910> degrees<00:07:32.150> of<00:07:32.390> freedom

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:32.570 
playing all these degrees of freedom

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.280 
playing all these degrees of freedom
need<00:07:33.080> to<00:07:33.200> be<00:07:33.320> simultaneously<00:07:33.770> free<00:07:34.700> and

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:35.290 
need to be simultaneously free and

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.290 
need to be simultaneously free and
flowing
