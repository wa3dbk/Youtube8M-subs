00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 This is a very rich and simple recipe 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.470
 of potatoes with prawns made with ends 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.260
 we will put about 4 potatoes in size 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.509
 medium this is for two people and 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.630
 we peel the short of many 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.610
 as seen in the picture 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.200
 what does it mean that a part is cut 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.180
 and the cake that breaks 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.550
 and once we have them peeled 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.460
 We peel the prawns by putting the head and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.190
 the shells in a saucepan that we will put 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.230
 to cook after it is important not to lose 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:36.840
 this the heads have a lot 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.700
 a lot of flavors that you do not want to throw away 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.110
 we fill it with water up and what 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.390
 we cook 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.550
 we take the glass of the thermomix and what 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410
 we fill with a little oil of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.290
 olive oil is always better 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.320
 extra virgin olive we will put 3 garlic 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.120
 large and as seen in the picture 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.090
 I prefer to always spur them on 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.930
 way because the oils come out and the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.780
 flavor is better and we will do it with 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.970
 3 garlic I already have little strength as it looks 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.990
 but you have to squeeze a lot but I 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.040
 they love these you are churras dores de ajo 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.040
 and this is the third garlic 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.200
 we will also put a little parsley 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.530
 chopped as seen in the image to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.909
 receive them a little bit we will put three 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.380
 minutes over 90 degrees and at speed 1 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.930
 when they are already how they look there minced 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.340
 we will put the butterfly to the blades 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.180
 so that the potatoes are not written if 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.170
 we are not left for him 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.970
 with the butterfly we receive it about 4 to 5 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.460
 minutes 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.290
 also at the same temperature once 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.030
 that have already cooked the head of what 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.100
 it looks like one of the prawns so what 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.810
 crush with a blender and strain it 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.240
 we will be this broth is going to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.010
 be a little thick that is what 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.750
 what it is about because it ends us then 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.480
 all the all the flavor of the heads of 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.430
 the prawns or the Chinese data of what 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.560
 well the potatoes are left once 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.040
 have described the sun is a little bit 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.810
 starch and we throw the broth of the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.120
 prawns and I added a little bit of 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.250
 turmeric but also as seen in the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.080
 image then I'm going to put paprika 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.040
 will see it 22 minutes 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.770
 90 and speed 1 you have to be careful 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.140
 with this because every potato is a world 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.520
 and there are potatoes that are cooked before 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.520
 others since there is the result
