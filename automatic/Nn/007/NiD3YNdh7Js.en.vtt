those<00:01:25.850> now<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.909> are<00:01:27.240> getting<00:01:27.390> somewhere<00:01:28.009> let's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
those now we are getting somewhere let's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.660 
those now we are getting somewhere let's
delete<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> diagonal<00:01:30.030> edge<00:01:30.180> across<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.780> top

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
delete the diagonal edge across the top

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:40.039 
delete the diagonal edge across the top
well<00:01:36.740> what<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.040> know<00:01:38.810> looks<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
well what do you know looks like a

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.800 
well what do you know looks like a
Chinese<00:01:40.500> takeout<00:01:40.860> box<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.729> empty<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.630> let's

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
Chinese takeout box it's empty so let's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.910 
Chinese takeout box it's empty so let's
throw<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.200> away<00:01:44.930> bring<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> mug<00:01:46.259> object<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
throw it away bring the mug object to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100 
throw it away bring the mug object to
the<00:01:47.040> grid<00:01:47.280> although<00:01:48.060> simple<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> add<00:01:48.810> edges

tool<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> very<00:01:50.220> powerful<00:01:50.399> tool<00:01:50.990> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
tool can be a very powerful tool the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.380 
tool can be a very powerful tool the
handle<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.399> cup<00:01:53.610> are<00:01:53.850> two<00:01:54.030> separate

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
handle and the cup are two separate

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.600 
handle and the cup are two separate
pieces<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.500> will<00:01:55.649> boolean<00:01:56.100> add<00:01:56.340> them

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
pieces so we will boolean add them

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.180 
pieces so we will boolean add them
together

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190

the handle is still not connected to the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.460 
the handle is still not connected to the
cup<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.790> with<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.120> end<00:02:05.300> edges<00:02:05.660> tool<00:02:06.020> we<00:02:06.290> will

cup so with the end edges tool we will
close<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.070> gaps<00:02:08.950> by<00:02:09.950> connecting<00:02:10.490> the

close the gaps by connecting the

we<00:04:17.540> will<00:04:17.690> add<00:04:17.870> an<00:04:18.079> edge<00:04:18.320> here<00:04:18.859> by<00:04:19.010> selecting<00:04:19.549> a

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
we will add an edge here by selecting a

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.510 
we will add an edge here by selecting a
parallel<00:04:20.299> edge<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:20.930> using<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.950> slice<00:04:22.250> tool

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
parallel edge and using the slice tool

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.640

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
to move a new edge to here next we will

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:37.920 
to move a new edge to here next we will
sweep<00:04:27.920> out<00:04:28.130> these<00:04:28.400> two<00:04:28.610> faces<00:04:29.090> on<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.360> handle

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.770 

then<00:04:38.560> we<00:04:39.039> will<00:04:39.190> create<00:04:39.520> a<00:04:39.550> new<00:04:39.729> edge<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.449> little

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
then we will create a new edge a little

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.150 
then we will create a new edge a little
from<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.080> top<00:04:41.350> on<00:04:41.880> each<00:04:43.440> again<00:04:44.440> using<00:04:44.889> a

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
selected edge and the slice tool now we

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.640 
selected edge and the slice tool now we
can<00:04:57.070> connect<00:04:57.430> these<00:04:57.639> two<00:04:57.910> faces<00:04:58.449> with<00:04:59.139> edges

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
can connect these two faces with edges

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.249 
can connect these two faces with edges
to<00:05:00.400> create<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:01.000> solid<00:05:01.330> span<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:03.660> is<00:05:04.660> important

to work from the outside in when
creating<00:05:07.810> such<00:05:08.229> spans<00:05:14.699> we<00:05:15.699> now<00:05:15.880> have<00:05:16.210> a<00:05:16.240> solid
