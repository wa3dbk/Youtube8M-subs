00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:05.589
 so we enter step 3 and proceed with the insertion of the contents 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.939
 let's look at the window that we are given we have a grid 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.009
 a list of objects is a preview window 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.909
 the mullet represents the page on which we are working 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.919
 each cell can host a content 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.099
 select the text object from the list of available objects and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.489
 let's drag him to the last supper 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.459
 then we select the images object and drag it into the next cell 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.670
 we thus obtain classical layout contests image side by side 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.890
 of course we can keep the layout more refined 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.210
 we can in fact add rows and columns to the grid 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.130
 and exploit the possibility of having sufficient content side by side 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.700
 dragging it today and directly on the selection anchors 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.460
 double-click on the inserted text object 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.220
 we have so web text editor through which we can type the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.010
 format the text itself 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.660
 obviously for greater convenience we can also paste copied text 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.830
 from an external file more natural requirement on the texts and to have to insert 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.860
 a hyperlink 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.050
 it is a task that we can solve in a very simple way 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.200
 we select the words to activate and the more I love you on the insert button 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.910
 connection 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.030
 in the call window we choose country we need we can for 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.110
 example connect another page of the site a file to download I have a site 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.340
 external 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.310
 we choose to display an image in a window overlaid with respect 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.950
 on the page we select the graphic file we insert a text as you stage it 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.260
 before closing the connection window we open the station 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.470
 Description 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.930
 here we can set a text is an image for the turkey or for the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.250
 note that it is displayed on mouse over and on the link 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.090
 at this point we just have to confirm 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.020
 we call you the browser preview and try to position ourselves on the cartene 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.360
 realized 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.050
 here is the tour tips displayed 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.320
 we click on the link that the image is displayed in 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.479
 overlay with a pleasant appearance effect 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.449
 well now we can return to a development environment and take care of the object 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:15.799
 image 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.290
 we double click on the image object that we have already inserted in the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.870
 layout grid 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.350
 and we import the file we want to use we can resume 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.430
 directly a high resolution photo we made with the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.050
 digital camera sketches 5 will automatically save me a pair with 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.420
 the correct dimensions 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.870
 avoiding considerable loss of time, we can click on the change button 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.989
 here a functional graphic editor is opened for us to work 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.549
 on the image we have all the functions for cutting and mounting 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.289
 the image but we can do much more 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:51.759
 for example we can add a filter 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.759
 protect it by applying a watermark 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.539
 or apply a mask 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.059
 a frame 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.509
 and effects 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:32.689
 we confirm everything and click on preview to see the result here 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.689
 our page that is taking shape 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.359
 It is important to note that any changes on the art of the pages on 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.779
 on the structure of the site 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:46.249
 they have no repercussions on the contents that setlist 5 simply 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:49.249
 will recreate the pages based on the new choices made 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.249
 let's position ourselves now on a different page and try to create a gallery 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.599
 following the same mechanism just seen for text and image 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:02.079
 drag the gallery object to the desired position and double click 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.319
 to access the properties 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.549
 among the available types we choose the horizontal tunnel 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:13.439
 in the list section we create the list of images we want to display 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.509
 we note that besides the images we can also insert videos if necessary 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.509
 taken from youtube 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.169
 we select the images on which we want to act 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.289
 choose which transition slices to apply 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.690
 we can still choose the graphics of the thumbnails you want set x5 will create 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.080
 automatically 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.080
 and click on preview 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.469
 here is our presentation ready 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.649
 - 7x5 puts at your disposal different types of galleries 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.240
 we return to the style section and this time we choose the thumbnail gallery 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.469
 superski 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.469
 we confirm and try 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.449
 here is our image gallery 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:34.610
 we note that in this case it is possible to scroll through the thumbnails 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:40.959
 click on ds to display the corresponding enlarged images e 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:44.269
 switch between enlarged images without having to go back to them 

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:47.269
 miniatures 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.129
 the list of available objects includes very interesting objects from 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.779
 which object html codes widgets very important because who is more experienced 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.479
 the form object sends e-mail useful for creating for example the page of 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:04.770
 contacts 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.619
 product list object 

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:10.949
 essential if you want to create an online store at this point 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.019
 we can proceed to the creation of all the pages of our site 

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:18.559
 configuring from time to time from the best pagination tickets by entering 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:20.550
 the necessary contents 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.510
 having done this we can still define a series of advanced settings
