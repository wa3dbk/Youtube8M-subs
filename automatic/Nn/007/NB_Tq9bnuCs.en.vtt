 we are 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.600
 welcome this is the milking parlor of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.090
 carranco at the san carlos ranch

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.080
 potosí 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.230
 we have a ship divided in two 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.470
 This allows us to rooms our 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.230
 cattle change procedures 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.700
 notification vaccination and records 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.500
 We have more than 1500 cows in production 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.690
 about 200 cows in state of 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.990
 gestation more than 1400 calves in breeding 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.150
 cattle heads the record of our 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.190
 xey jr high of seats is recognized 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.670
 as the largest in mexico and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.710
 latin america but because the jersey race 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.340
 because it gives us the best milk 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.690
 quality a milk with 3.5 percent of 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.420
 fat and 10% solids higher than 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.420
 provides any other breed of cows 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.960
 Planet 70 percent of our 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.570
 cattle are artificially inseminated 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.510
 using sexed semen from the highest 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.500
 pre-qualified quality so that they are born 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.710
 females the other 30 percent is riding 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.720
 direct with a stallion in corral all 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.420
 our cattle have a diet 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.130
 balanced for each lactation which 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.130
 It is rich in minerals 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.440
 next we describe our 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.460
 milking process that is done three 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.899
 times a day applies a disinfectant 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.259
 foamy on the cow's udder for 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.380
 remove impurities and blunt the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.950
 blunting is important because during it 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.320
 you get three things get the first 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.500
 jets of milk that are contaminated 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.110
 and that have the highest bacterial load 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.630
 stimulate the cow by massage and 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.470
 check carefully that the nipples 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.959
 do not bring an infection milking it 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.300
 performed by suction with air and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.060
 automatically after having 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.269
 obtained the milk the equipment stops 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.600
 work what allows not to hurt 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.480
 animals 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.750
 to finalize the process we seal the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.990
 teats with iodine to point 5 percent and 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.200
 some emollients after milk passes 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.780
 by three filters at a temperature of 28 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.400
 degrees centigrade and stored in 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.610
 tanks of 16,000 19,000 and 40,000 liters 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.360
 that have a temperature of 3 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.340
 degrees centigrade later this 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.980
 milk moves to the production area 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.590
 where the studies of 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.320
 corresponding laboratory to have 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.510
 the assurance that all 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.819
 the quality requirements that mark the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.340
 company 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.859
 This is how the process of 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.310
 transformation of our milk to 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:11.460
 get the yogurt cream cheeses and 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.880
 butter that you already know 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:19.670
 we are carranque tradition of freshness and 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.670
 quality since 1885
