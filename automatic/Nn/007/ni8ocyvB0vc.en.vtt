00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:15.480
 Hi, what girls have we got for today? 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:17.369
 Roast chicken in oven 1 is super 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.900
 easy to make girls then let's go 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.859
 need for this three legs of chicken 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:31.199
 more or less 300 grams each of two to 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:37.350
 three tablespoons of half oil 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:44.520
 spoon of salt and pepper to taste and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:48.870
 a sweet paprika teaspoon of powder 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.410
 To start with, I'm not going to take the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.050
 Feather skin on the right chicken 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.690

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.600
 This part inside that I do not know 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.570

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.510
 Okay, another one plays to show how it was. 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:21.299
 good after you have taken the fat off 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.850

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:29.670

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.990
 I took the excess fat right yet 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.079

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.860
