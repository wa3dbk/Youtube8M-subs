00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 now we must also see how it is 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.400
 will bring his opponents to toga 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.010
 he defined the journey and then we say it 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.019
 especially patrick chan who will be 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.030
 the last to descend studied the sample 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.190
 of the world and twice world champion 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.020
 which however started the season in 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.760
 really disastrous way to japan 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.340
 open where only free skate is presented 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.650
 but he fell four times and arrived 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.460
 last we will see how it will react but 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.359
 immediately 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.050
 let's see what artists prepared 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:37.200
 because it comes with a new short of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.059
 highlander we will also see here comes 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.980
 presented as a Spanish music with 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.190
 an oriental touch we will discover together with 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.649
 you if this representation just a 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.780
 ski gazzi who worked a lot 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.270
 during the summer among other things always in the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.230
 field that is made with pinzolo with alexei 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.230
 mishin and above all 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.970
 quadruple toe loop with the error 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.500
 slow axel also here on landing 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.690
 small mistake because he failed to 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.490
 to end 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.270
 the exit is necessarily due to support 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.270
 the left canvas 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:51.770
 in particular it will be summer tourists not 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.260
 has made a good program gasisti lo 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.110
 let's remember he took the medal 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.300
 silver to the European and I will remember 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.700
 provided that the press conference of the 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.810
 Europeans when he friction in first 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.060
 position 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.740
 the short was extraordinary because 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.240
 it seemed he had made a touch with the 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.420
 x mark that was naturally had 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.310
 beaten in the shop of shane fox and le 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.020
 all questions were for him 6 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.420
 no one almost to say sorry me 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.130
 sorry if I was better and then 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.310
 obviously more if also went to win 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.830
 the 0 and the tsar and he got however a 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.390
 great second place but then to 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.220
 world where we all waited 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.570
 also because it was a world bronze 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.220
 of the previous year he had gods 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.130
 problems with silicosis dress shoes 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.030
 those problems with the fake xviii then 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.780
 this they said he prepared 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.610
 several children because he needed to 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.920
 should change in the race are already 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.160
 ready how important the skates are 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.610
 powerful are so many very important 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.919
 because they are our tool is like 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.629
 is part of us is not a certain point not 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.729
 we realize more when it ends 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:58.400
 together when the blade leaves so 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.620
 just sense a millimeter difference 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.930
 a little something is not working 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.340
 you realize it immediately and it seems to me a lot 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.500
 difficult to do those things that 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.870
 they are absolutely so natural 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.090
 then change the shoe as successful 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.099
 to him near an event like this 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.419
 important is not easy is not easy 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.030
 because then when you strike again 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.729
 then rightly so for a look 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.979
 completely different purity of the 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.330
 he definitely didn't take a skate 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.860
 so new did not take the form of 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.319
 your ankle is not used to movement 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.939
 that your ankle does for which you feel 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.189
 these different resistances and not 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:33.050
 feel part of so many students you don't 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:34.580
 fits perfectly and they are all 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.180
 feeling that until you have to do a 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.099
 lap 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.650
 of course it is not a problem when 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.930
 instead of presenting programs 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.490
 heavy and long where there are also 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.439
 of difficult technical elements like the 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.689
 framework sequence of steps more precisely 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:49.490
 where is the sensitivity of the 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.289
 foot that makes the difference maybe 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.889
 may not be the solution 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.990
 best 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.180
 thanks to tips for called doing the 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:03.969
 point of the first of his name with i 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:03.969
 started at the perfect start 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.789
 May 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.919
 many instead on the discs what you think and 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.539
 I have to be honest for when the 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.860
 quantum had impressed by the 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.870
 I didn't like it so much last time 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.939
 I see this program this year 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.879
 just the tone of the music choice 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.080
 it's not engaging or maybe it stays in 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.819
 this way with all these errors 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.879
 it didn't involve me that much but 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:30.229
 look at the technical score in the water 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.879
 are and 4 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.689
 unfortunately the errors committed them on 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:37.550
 of himself and unfortunately also this work of 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:39.169
 components I have definitely seen of 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.810
 wider movements 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.129
 at the level of choreography however still 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.919
 maybe a little empty for what 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:49.009
 regards transitions, that is many 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:52.779
 chased where we see that he is going to 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.779
 prepare a purely technical one
