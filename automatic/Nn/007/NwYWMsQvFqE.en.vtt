there's there was also mushroom and you
have<00:05:19.760> to<00:05:19.880> find<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.240> but<00:05:20.680> this<00:05:21.680> map<00:05:21.890> pretty<00:05:22.190> much

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
have to find it but this map pretty much

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.219 
have to find it but this map pretty much
has<00:05:22.580> everything<00:05:22.790> as<00:05:23.600> you<00:05:23.720> can<00:05:23.840> see<00:05:23.960> there's<00:05:24.169> a

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
has everything as you can see there's a

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:30.340 
has everything as you can see there's a
weird<00:05:24.680> legit<00:05:26.050> part<00:05:27.050> of<00:05:27.290> sand<00:05:27.740> at<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:28.940> end<00:05:29.350> and

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
weird legit part of sand at the end and

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.480 
weird legit part of sand at the end and
we<00:05:30.770> are<00:05:30.800> back<00:05:31.310> to<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.669> beginning<00:05:32.540> so<00:05:33.490> that's

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
we are back to the beginning so that's

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.390 
we are back to the beginning so that's
pretty<00:05:34.970> much<00:05:35.090> it<00:05:35.450> if<00:05:35.810> you<00:05:36.169> love<00:05:36.440> floating

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
pretty much it if you love floating

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.719 
pretty much it if you love floating
islands<00:05:38.150> such<00:05:38.330> as<00:05:38.510> this<00:05:38.720> marvelous<00:05:39.729> floating

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729
