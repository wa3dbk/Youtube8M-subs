00:00:16.826 --> 00:00:18.125
 The world is too big, mom. 

00:00:21.297 --> 00:00:22.436
 It's up to you to reduce it. 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.787
 Concentrate on my voice. 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.773
 Imagine it's an island, 

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:32.265
 lost in the middle of the ocean. 

00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:34.562
 Can you see her? 

00:00:36.877 --> 00:00:37.644
 I see her. 

00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:43.323
 My son was in the bus. 

00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:48.171
 He saw what Clark did. 

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:54.294
 This part of you must remain secret. 

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.080
 What was I supposed to do? 

00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:58.016
 Let them die? 

00:01:01.747 --> 00:01:02.372
 Perhaps. 

00:01:07.952 --> 00:01:09.234
 I have so many questions. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.725
 Where do I come from? 

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:23.167
 You have to decide what kind of man you want to become, Clark. 

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:27.311
 No matter what this man will be, 

00:01:31.704 --> 00:01:33.247
 he will change the world. 

00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:08.116
 My father believed that if the world discovered who I really was 

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:09.332
 he would reject me. 

00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:14.664
 He was convinced that the world was not ready. 

00:02:16.338 --> 00:02:17.339
 What do you think ?
