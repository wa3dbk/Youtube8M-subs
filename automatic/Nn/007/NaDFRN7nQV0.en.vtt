00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.009
 how long do two go for it 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.009
 since about 2004 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.450

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:46.660
 bounce you two by the rules bar wallpaper 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:50.199
 only between the bosses the bartender would 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 steeper wand wand lightsaber 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.530
 much more elegant weapon of course 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.699
 very elegant no more good fights 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.210
 oh well a stranger was motley i respect 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.149
 no motley I mean real fights 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.880
 not the scum of science fiction battle 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.460
 between arnas they are formidable enemies like the old 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.009
 time movement that make people 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.590
 tremble the sky darken the hearts of children 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:27.340

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.690

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.880
 and so Khan 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.729
 that who can not be called says that 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.610
 no more good battles like you 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.399
 think but was once during the battle 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.679
 Cap vs Kronos Wait, that's all 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.560
 this time you just stood fu tech this 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:48.250
 it was so boring but before that i 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.989
 only won about 50 Klingon wars 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.610
 i like this explosions 

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:57.130
 nicely done but you let him 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.440
 hit you because I'm better off with any 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.929
 parties but it's not a battle 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.750
 i will never let a hero beat myself i 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.970
 would say i'm going to destroy you and 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.369
 then I would point my wand at him 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.530
 and shoot a green beam at him 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.660
 here I agree with Khan much 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.130
 fun to be defeated hero 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.380

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.600
