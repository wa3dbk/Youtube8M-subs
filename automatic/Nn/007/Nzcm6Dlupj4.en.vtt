00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
real thing you can see run along the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.509 
real thing you can see run along the
side<00:00:44.930> these<00:00:45.199> parts<00:00:45.559> are<00:00:45.710> thick<00:00:46.190> durable

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
side these parts are thick durable

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.590 
side these parts are thick durable
plastic<00:00:46.910> I've<00:00:47.809> I'm<00:00:48.460> squeezing<00:00:49.460> them<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:49.850> they

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
plastic I've I'm squeezing them and they

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.319 
plastic I've I'm squeezing them and they
are<00:00:50.750> hollow<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.320> now<00:00:51.500> not<00:00:51.739> breaking<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:52.789> not

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
are hollow and now not breaking so not

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.029 
are hollow and now not breaking so not
cracking<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.199> these<00:00:54.500> are<00:00:54.649> really<00:00:54.800> really

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
cracking so these are really really

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.910 
cracking so these are really really
sweet<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:55.460> see<00:00:55.640> here<00:00:55.850> figures<00:00:56.359> copter<00:00:56.920> that

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
sweet you see here figures copter that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.970 
sweet you see here figures copter that
it's<00:00:58.070> not<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.250> brand<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:58.699> is<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.859> what<00:01:00.859> it's

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
it's not the brand that is the what it's

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.770 
it's not the brand that is the what it's
called<00:01:01.129> group<00:01:01.429> of<00:01:01.640> these<00:01:01.760> helicopters<00:01:02.210> you

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
called group of these helicopters you

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.860 
called group of these helicopters you
can<00:01:02.899> collect<00:01:03.170> them<00:01:03.350> obviously<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:05.449> brand<00:01:05.690> is

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
can collect them obviously the brand is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.840 
can collect them obviously the brand is
actually<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.530> bro<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.190> you<00:01:07.280> can<00:01:07.460> see<00:01:07.700> it's

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
actually a bro so you can see it's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.540 
actually a bro so you can see it's
printed<00:01:08.240> on<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.420> side<00:01:08.630> sweet<00:01:09.140> now<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.130> blades

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
printed on the side sweet now the blades

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.200 
printed on the side sweet now the blades
here<00:01:11.440> are<00:01:12.440> plastic<00:01:13.250> ones<00:01:13.460> as<00:01:13.700> I<00:01:13.820> mentioned

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
here are plastic ones as I mentioned

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.880 
here are plastic ones as I mentioned
earlier<00:01:14.510> in<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.870> other<00:01:14.990> video<00:01:15.350> these<00:01:15.620> ones

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
earlier in the other video these ones

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.740 
earlier in the other video these ones
plastic<00:01:16.370> blades<00:01:16.640> these<00:01:17.270> want<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.540> better

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
plastic blades these want to better

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.150 
plastic blades these want to better
because<00:01:18.140> although<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.590> blades<00:01:18.800> themselves

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
because although the blades themselves

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.430 
because although the blades themselves
honest<00:01:19.910> durable<00:01:20.300> is<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.570> wooden<00:01:20.870> or<00:01:21.080> hardened

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
honest durable is the wooden or hardened

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.470 
honest durable is the wooden or hardened
plastic<00:01:21.650> ones<00:01:22.040> actually<00:01:22.640> if<00:01:23.000> these<00:01:23.150> ones<00:01:23.390> just

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
plastic ones actually if these ones just

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.390 
plastic ones actually if these ones just
snap<00:01:23.930> that<00:01:24.230> is<00:01:24.560> better<00:01:24.770> than<00:01:24.980> having<00:01:25.160> these

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
snap that is better than having these

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.320 
snap that is better than having these
swash<00:01:25.760> plates

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
swash plates

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.160 
swash plates
snap<00:01:27.340> actually<00:01:28.340> these<00:01:28.930> obviously<00:01:29.930> they're

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
snap actually these obviously they're

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.500 
snap actually these obviously they're
not<00:01:30.320> on<00:01:30.470> now<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:30.950> we've<00:01:31.100> got<00:01:31.220> two<00:01:31.460> LEDs<00:01:32.090> one

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
not on now but we've got two LEDs one

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.640 
not on now but we've got two LEDs one
here<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.230> one<00:01:33.650> at<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.860> other<00:01:34.040> side<00:01:34.340> here<00:01:34.370> so

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
here and one at the other side here so

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.160 
here and one at the other side here so
the<00:01:36.650> two<00:01:36.830> LEDs<00:01:37.120> actually<00:01:38.120> are<00:01:38.390> great<00:01:38.750> because

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
the two LEDs actually are great because

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.780 
the two LEDs actually are great because
I'm<00:01:40.240> like<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.600> real<00:01:41.780> thing<00:01:42.550> last<00:01:43.550> thing<00:01:43.730> I

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
I'm like the real thing last thing I

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.660 
I'm like the real thing last thing I
want<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:43.970> show<00:01:44.180> you<00:01:44.240> is<00:01:45.220> their<00:01:46.220> battery

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
want to show you is their battery

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.140 
want to show you is their battery
compartment<00:01:47.540> somebody<00:01:47.900> said<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.170> wire<00:01:48.410> is<00:01:48.590> it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
compartment somebody said a wire is it

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.630 
compartment somebody said a wire is it
all<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.270> need<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.510> do<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.810> just<00:01:51.310> pull<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.460> one

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
all you need to do is just pull this one

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.700 
all you need to do is just pull this one
down<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.780> then<00:01:53.900> there<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.200> your<00:01:54.290> battery

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
down and then there is your battery

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.190 
down and then there is your battery
compartment<00:01:55.480> connector<00:01:56.480> for<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.660> battery<00:01:57.080> is

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
compartment connector for the battery is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.320 
compartment connector for the battery is
there<00:01:57.410> it's<00:01:57.560> not<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.740> Deans<00:01:58.010> connector<00:01:58.160> is<00:01:59.030> that

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
there it's not a Deans connector is that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.940 
there it's not a Deans connector is that
like<00:01:59.540> a<00:01:59.570> Traxxas<00:02:00.170> connector<00:02:00.620> but<00:02:00.740> it's<00:02:00.860> a

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
like a Traxxas connector but it's a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.780 
like a Traxxas connector but it's a
different<00:02:01.310> very<00:02:01.720> variation<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:04.430> there's<00:02:04.610> nice

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
different very variation so there's nice

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.450 
different very variation so there's nice
because<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.090> got<00:02:05.210> like<00:02:05.360> your<00:02:05.480> own<00:02:05.630> little

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
because you got like your own little

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.339 
because you got like your own little
compartment<00:02:07.460> there<00:02:08.030> then<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:08.989> one<00:02:09.140> just

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
compartment there then that one just

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.030 
compartment there then that one just
