00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:08.840
 it is drover this Lake Geneva the 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:12.230
 beautiful the incredible setting in the 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.700
 bars and like us they could then 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.559
 awesome choparlas because I have this 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.449
 a little iv capcom after kills 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:23.119
 suzuki sx4 big fat and 6.4 that we 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.130
 learn simple tired of the size of a 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.810
 a bit like a square cover if you 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.669
 want except that suzuki is terrible 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.160
 because it's a little good there 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.750
 girlfriend but who is not very pretty 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.020
 whereas never then is it actually 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.730
 super bagnols I did I do more than 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:44.330
 500 terminals with you had read the the 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.670
 left from Patrice VergÃ¨s 2500 km and 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.460
 it is true that it is a good company 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.920
 who lack a lot of charm and that 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.870
 it's terrible for a fund because 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.950
 finally it would not matter if she 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.030
 is not other cars on the 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.530
 but there are plenty of them that have 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.820
 character 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.580
 I do not say she is healed she 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.770
 is ugly but the fade and fair and 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.110
 it's a shame all the more 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.110
 once when you lead her listens 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.700
 many terminals you enjoy his 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.920
 sweetness his calm his economist 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.070
 incredibly it consumes 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.020
 incredibly can absolutely it's 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.950
 very very very frugal of crafted a 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.300
 four-wheel drive version so that's it 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.440
 actually decides it's most of the time 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.010
 and two- wheel drive 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.900
 it is he who decides not to go into 4 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.220
 offers but really really 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.710
 do not appreciate what this kind of 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.020
 car without history kiki this is the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.880
 good companion so it's cheaper 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.100
 necessarily that the competitors and when 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.240
 I did not know if I click is little 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.440
 known to us the eighth 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.770
 builder in the world that actually 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.240
 that's it or all of them big 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.060
 marks like alpha and I'm recovering or 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.390
 I do not know what cg who got a lot 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.710
 more powerful in motorcycle than in 4 4 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.760
 So that's good if if you like that it deserves 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.060
 to be put in your shopping list what 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.190
 little fun detail sent this morning I 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.360
 came looking for suzuki sx4 and without 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.520
 be careful I approached 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.660
 I would have accepted that actually it's a 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.400
 qashqai does it is there but it's very 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.160
 significant this little anecdote he 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.990
 bothered me in a car and I'm getting on my nerves 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.400
 thinking that's what it is 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.430
 which is what I told you 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.739
 very good car but but but design 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.739
 too innocuous too much in the mass
