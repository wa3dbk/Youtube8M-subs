and unfortunately the last 10 years I
have<00:00:26.789> consumed<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.420> lot<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.140> coffee<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:29.090> lot<00:00:30.090> of

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
have consumed a lot of coffee a lot of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.560 
have consumed a lot of coffee a lot of
diet<00:00:30.660> coke<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.140> old<00:00:31.859> red<00:00:32.550> wine<00:00:32.759> probably<00:00:33.420> too

diet coke and old red wine probably too

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.729 
diet coke and old red wine probably too
much<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:35.030> my<00:00:36.030> teeth<00:00:36.329> are<00:00:36.600> looking<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.469> little

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
much so my teeth are looking a little

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.340 
much so my teeth are looking a little
yellow<00:00:38.250> um<00:00:38.660> you<00:00:39.660> probably<00:00:39.750> can't<00:00:40.110> tell<00:00:40.320> right

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
yellow um you probably can't tell right

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.610 
yellow um you probably can't tell right
now<00:00:40.590> because<00:00:41.550> I'm<00:00:41.879> Tanner<00:00:42.600> than<00:00:42.870> normal<00:00:43.290> so

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
now because I'm Tanner than normal so

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.900 
now because I'm Tanner than normal so
they<00:00:43.920> might<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.219> whiter<00:00:44.489> than<00:00:44.789> they

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
they might look whiter than they

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.770 
they might look whiter than they
actually<00:00:45.090> are<00:00:45.800> but<00:00:46.800> there<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:47.750> looking<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
actually are but there are looking a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.860 
actually are but there are looking a
little<00:00:48.930> dingy<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.629> unfortunately<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.719> think

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
little dingy and unfortunately I think

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.770 
little dingy and unfortunately I think
that<00:00:52.170> makes<00:00:52.350> me<00:00:52.710> look<00:00:52.890> older<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.789> I'm

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
that makes me look older so I'm

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.029 
that makes me look older so I'm
interested<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.710> making<00:00:56.610> them<00:00:56.730> whiter<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
interested in making them whiter and

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.950 
interested in making them whiter and
doing<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.129> quickly<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.730> not<00:01:00.000> hurting<00:01:00.809> them

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
doing it quickly and not hurting them

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.429 
doing it quickly and not hurting them
because<00:01:01.350> they're<00:01:01.770> really<00:01:02.219> sensitive<00:01:03.229> from<00:01:04.229> my

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
because they're really sensitive from my

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.390 
because they're really sensitive from my
years<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.309> bleaching<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:07.400> someone

really tiny looks like looks like this

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.979 
really tiny looks like looks like this
so<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.709> take<00:03:21.160> um<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.850> clear<00:03:22.120> plastic<00:03:22.390> part

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
so you take um the clear plastic part

out of its tube and still hold it down
and<00:03:29.280> squeeze<00:03:30.280> until<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:30.850> actually<00:03:30.880> cracks<00:03:31.510> the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
and squeeze until it actually cracks the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.740 
and squeeze until it actually cracks the
first<00:03:32.079> time<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.290> did<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.940> got<00:03:33.940> worried<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.720> I

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
first time I did it I got worried that I

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.349 
first time I did it I got worried that I
just<00:03:35.350> broke<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.829> and<00:03:35.859> had<00:03:36.430> no<00:03:36.609> idea<00:03:36.640> was<00:03:37.060> doing

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650
