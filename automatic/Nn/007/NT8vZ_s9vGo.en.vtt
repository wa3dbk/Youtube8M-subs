00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
Xbox controller that takes batteries or

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.480 
Xbox controller that takes batteries or
rechargeable<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:11.090> I<00:00:12.090> always<00:00:13.049> like<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.650> hated

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
rechargeable and I always like I hated

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.730 
rechargeable and I always like I hated
when<00:00:14.759> my<00:00:14.940> batteries<00:00:15.330> would<00:00:15.450> run<00:00:15.630> out<00:00:15.740> these

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
when my batteries would run out these

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.000 
when my batteries would run out these
ones<00:00:16.949> are<00:00:17.160> like<00:00:17.940> halfway<00:00:18.240> down<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.830> I

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
ones are like halfway down but like I

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.650 
ones are like halfway down but like I
barely<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.640> any<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.939> got<00:00:21.210> these<00:00:21.300> from<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
barely have any I got these from like a

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
barely have any I got these from like a
remote<00:00:22.289> control<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.460> I'm<00:00:24.320> like<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
remote control so I'm like it's just a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.009 
remote control so I'm like it's just a
waste<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.070> money<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.000> was<00:00:27.510> thinking<00:00:27.869> of

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
waste of money so I was thinking of

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.710 
waste of money so I was thinking of
trying<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.150> like<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.269> could<00:00:30.420> go<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
trying this like you could go to the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.630 
trying this like you could go to the
storm<00:00:30.990> buy<00:00:31.920> them<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> cord<00:00:34.070> but<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.100> was

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
storm buy them with the cord but I was

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.660 
storm buy them with the cord but I was
thinking<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:36.000> connecting<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.800> cord<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
thinking of connecting the cord to the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.930 
thinking of connecting the cord to the
Xbox<00:00:39.120> controller<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:41.460> really<00:00:41.640> need<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
Xbox controller so you really need is a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.290 
Xbox controller so you really need is a
USB<00:00:42.570> cord<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.920> cut<00:00:44.129> off<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> end<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.850> got<00:00:45.180> as

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
USB cord you cut off the end so I got as

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.290 
USB cord you cut off the end so I got as
USB<00:00:45.690> 3<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.960> wires<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.680> need<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.149> write<00:00:51.149> on

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
USB 3 and the wires you need to write on

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.569 
USB 3 and the wires you need to write on
black<00:00:51.539> wires<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.320> what<00:00:53.129> you're<00:00:53.250> going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> do

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
black wires and what you're going to do

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.110 
black wires and what you're going to do
is<00:00:53.760> you're<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.539> thing<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
is you're going to get your thing and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.490 
is you're going to get your thing and
you<00:00:57.120> look<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.690> says<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.109> sides

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
you look on it it says that sides

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.220 
you look on it it says that sides
negative<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.340> sides<00:00:59.609> positive<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.690> that

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
negative that sides positive so that

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.900 
negative that sides positive so that
must<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.649> positive<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.370> that's<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.760> negative

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
must be positive and that's the negative

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.929 
must be positive and that's the negative
so<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> left<00:01:04.589> its<00:01:04.799> positive<00:01:05.280> that's

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
so on the left its positive that's

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
so on the left its positive that's
negative<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.260> knees<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.770> get

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
negative so your knees are going to get

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
negative so your knees are going to get
your<00:01:07.979> wires<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:10.159> get<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.430> red<00:01:11.610> one<00:01:11.850> put<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.689> on

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
your wires and get the red one put it on

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.740 
your wires and get the red one put it on
the<00:01:13.590> left<00:01:13.830> side<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.460> positive<00:01:14.670> side<00:01:15.180> black

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the left side the positive side black

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.810 
the left side the positive side black
one<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.710> negative<00:01:17.070> side<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.460> gonna<00:01:17.729> do

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
one on that negative side I'm gonna do

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.310 
one on that negative side I'm gonna do
that<00:01:17.970> now<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.450> can't<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.750> only<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.110> one
