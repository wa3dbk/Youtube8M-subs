this<00:01:29.579> guns<00:01:29.790> kind<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> more<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.509> not<00:01:31.170> like

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
this guns kind of more like not like

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.109 
this guns kind of more like not like
that<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> more<00:01:31.890> closer<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.579> an<00:01:32.729> assault

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
that is more closer to like an assault

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.210 
that is more closer to like an assault
rifle<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:34.200> some<00:01:34.380> ways<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.890> about<00:01:35.040> why

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
rifle in some ways which one about why

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.350 
rifle in some ways which one about why
you<00:01:35.280> reminded<00:01:35.670> me<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> Ripper<00:01:36.210> from

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you reminded me of the Ripper from

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.399 
you reminded me of the Ripper from
called<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.630> he<00:01:36.720> goes<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.079> remember<00:01:37.259> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
called you he goes because remember I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.899 
called you he goes because remember I
had<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.710> kind<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.890> assault<00:01:38.250> rifle<00:01:38.640> layout

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
had that kind of assault rifle layout

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.730 
had that kind of assault rifle layout
where<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.150> could<00:01:39.299> kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.540> us<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.869> have

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
where you could kind of us like have

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.530 
where you could kind of us like have
increased<00:01:41.159> range<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:41.970> reduction

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
increased range and have like reduction

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.149 
increased range and have like reduction
and<00:01:42.689> fire<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.020> stuff<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> gets<00:01:43.950> an

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and fire and stuff but it gets an

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.240 
and fire and stuff but it gets an
increased<00:01:44.579> one<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.000> damage<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> increase<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
increased one in damage and increase to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
increased one in damage and increase to
in<00:01:47.490> range<00:01:47.850> which<00:01:48.420> makes<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.720> more<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.990> an

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
in range which makes it more like an

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
in range which makes it more like an
assault<00:01:49.380> rifle<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:49.979> it's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
assault rifle because it's like it's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.920 
assault rifle because it's like it's
really<00:01:50.670> good<00:01:50.850> over<00:01:51.119> long<00:01:51.270> distance<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:51.810> got

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
really good over long distance it's got

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.899 
really good over long distance it's got
a<00:01:51.960> slow<00:01:52.200> fire<00:01:52.439> rate<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.040> quite<00:01:53.369> majority

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
a slow fire rate like a quite majority

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.929 
a slow fire rate like a quite majority
of<00:01:54.799> assault<00:01:55.799> rifles<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.729> was<00:01:56.850> just

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
of assault rifles do and I was just

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.580 
of assault rifles do and I was just
managing<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.360> pick<00:01:57.570> people<00:01:57.689> across<00:01:58.079> map<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
managing to pick people across map and

managing to pick people across map and
stuff<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.250> every<00:01:59.909> time<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.149> was

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
stuff like that and every time I was

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
ASM one or np11 at close range I just

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.720 
ASM one or np11 at close range I just
got<00:02:10.170> absolutely<00:02:10.770> melted<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.310> could<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.550> him<00:02:11.640> how

got absolutely melted I could be him how
about<00:02:11.910> medium<00:02:12.330> range

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
about medium range

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.660

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
I'd rather use like the speakeasy ASM

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.860 
I'd rather use like the speakeasy ASM
one<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.110> magnitude<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.360> or<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:30.750> a

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
rightfully this doesn't make sense I

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.120 
rightfully this doesn't make sense I
just<00:02:41.670> don't<00:02:41.790> think<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.270> SMG<00:02:42.989> but<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:43.950> did

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
just don't think it's a SMG but I did

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.590 
just don't think it's a SMG but I did
manage<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.459> get<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.610> DNA<00:02:44.910> bomb<00:02:45.180> which<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.480> was

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
manage to get the DNA bomb which I was

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.030 
manage to get the DNA bomb which I was
really<00:02:45.780> really<00:02:46.080> happy<00:02:46.380> with<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.769> it's<00:02:46.920> just

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
really really happy with and it's just

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.020 
really really happy with and it's just
one<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.220> those<00:02:47.280> things<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.670> want<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.940> get

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
one of those things that want to get

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.250 
one of those things that want to get
used<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.390> using<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.750> you're<00:02:48.870> able<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.140> make

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
used to using it you're able to make

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.410 
used to using it you're able to make
those<00:02:49.410> kills<00:02:49.709> up<00:02:49.860> quite<00:02:50.040> quickly<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.390> a

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
those kills up quite quickly and it is a

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.150 
those kills up quite quickly and it is a
good<00:02:51.660> gun<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.019> not<00:02:52.080> bad<00:02:52.170> gun<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:53.130> I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
good gun it's not bad gun but I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.320 
good gun it's not bad gun but I
definitely<00:02:53.340> wouldn't<00:02:53.880> use<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.239> regular

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
definitely wouldn't use on a regular
