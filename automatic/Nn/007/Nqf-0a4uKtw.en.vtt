00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
their bitches now we've had experiences

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.009 
their bitches now we've had experiences
with<00:03:03.160> babies<00:03:03.579> to<00:03:03.760> where<00:03:03.970> we'd<00:03:04.239> start<00:03:04.540> their

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
with babies to where we'd start their

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.710 
with babies to where we'd start their
veggies<00:03:05.410> off<00:03:05.620> later<00:03:06.519> in<00:03:06.790> their<00:03:06.940> life<00:03:07.150> cycle

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
veggies off later in their life cycle

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.729 
veggies off later in their life cycle
say<00:03:07.959> four<00:03:08.829> weeks<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.549> six<00:03:09.820> weeks<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.530> they<00:03:11.530> had

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
say four weeks to six weeks and they had

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.050 
say four weeks to six weeks and they had
to<00:03:12.030> basically<00:03:13.530> get<00:03:14.530> used<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.190> idea<00:03:15.220> of

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
to basically get used to the idea of

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.690 
to basically get used to the idea of
eating<00:03:16.630> veggies

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
eating veggies

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.809 
eating veggies
their<00:03:17.879> proteins<00:03:18.980> there's<00:03:19.980> no<00:03:20.190> movement<00:03:20.730> in

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
their proteins there's no movement in

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.059 
their proteins there's no movement in
veggies<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.920> if<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:24.540> good<00:03:25.050> idea<00:03:25.379> would<00:03:25.620> be<00:03:25.650> to

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
veggies so if a good idea would be to

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.790 
veggies so if a good idea would be to
put<00:03:26.099> veggies<00:03:26.640> in<00:03:27.000> first<00:03:27.420> basically<00:03:28.170> and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
put veggies in first basically and

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.259 
put veggies in first basically and
they'll<00:03:28.950> see<00:03:29.160> something<00:03:29.670> different<00:03:29.819> in<00:03:30.120> their

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
they'll see something different in their

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.930 
they'll see something different in their
cage<00:03:30.860> for<00:03:31.860> some<00:03:32.040> reason<00:03:32.340> they<00:03:32.430> like<00:03:32.610> greens

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
cage for some reason they like greens

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.330 
cage for some reason they like greens
more<00:03:33.239> than<00:03:33.390> like<00:03:33.650> they'll<00:03:34.650> eat<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.069> greens

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
more than like they'll eat the greens

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.040 
more than like they'll eat the greens
they'll<00:03:35.730> eat<00:03:35.910> around<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.360> squash<00:03:36.660> the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
they'll eat around the squash the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.290 
they'll eat around the squash the
zucchini<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.010> carrots<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.940> they'll<00:03:39.120> eat

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
zucchini and the carrots and they'll eat

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.089 
zucchini and the carrots and they'll eat
their<00:03:39.450> greens<00:03:39.480> first<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.380> then<00:03:40.890> they'll

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
their greens first and then they'll

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.670 
their greens first and then they'll
start<00:03:41.370> picking<00:03:42.269> up<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.569> other<00:03:42.720> stuff<00:03:42.989> but

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
start picking up the other stuff but

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.970 
start picking up the other stuff but
will<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.640> introduce<00:03:44.849> vegetables<00:03:45.810> real<00:03:46.709> early

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
will you introduce vegetables real early

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.390 
will you introduce vegetables real early
on<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.519> yes<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.959> if<00:03:49.200> if<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.680> don't<00:03:49.920> do<00:03:50.160> that

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
on to yes and if if you don't do that

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.059 
on to yes and if if you don't do that
what<00:03:50.610> happens<00:03:51.290> they<00:03:52.290> have<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.650> go<00:03:52.769> through<00:03:53.040> a

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
what happens they have to go through a

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.000 
what happens they have to go through a
stage<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:54.360> know<00:03:54.510> basically<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:55.110> mocking

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
stage of you know basically a mocking

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.490 
stage of you know basically a mocking
and<00:03:56.160> just<00:03:56.340> what<00:03:56.549> is<00:03:56.579> that<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:57.599> know<00:03:57.750> they

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
and just what is that you know they

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.710 
and just what is that you know they
don't<00:03:58.530> move<00:03:59.010> it's<00:03:59.640> something<00:03:59.910> new<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.299> my<00:04:00.329> cage

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
don't move it's something new in my cage

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.160 
don't move it's something new in my cage
let<00:04:01.620> me<00:04:01.739> go<00:04:01.860> check<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.280> out<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.780> it<00:04:03.780> just<00:04:03.959> takes

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
let me go check it out and it just takes

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.710 
let me go check it out and it just takes
them<00:04:04.349> longer<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:05.010> get<00:04:05.190> acclimated<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:06.239> eating

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
them longer to get acclimated to eating

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.809 
them longer to get acclimated to eating
okay<00:04:07.170> but<00:04:07.319> estable<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:08.130> if<00:04:08.250> somebody<00:04:08.579> buys<00:04:08.760> a

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
okay but estable so if somebody buys a

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.759 
okay but estable so if somebody buys a
bearded<00:04:09.299> dragon<00:04:09.360> from<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.959> Robert<00:04:10.380> Johnson

its<00:04:10.950> origin<00:04:11.430> on<00:04:11.579> vegetables<00:04:12.150> for<00:04:12.360> three<00:04:12.599> we

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
its origin on vegetables for three we

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.319 
its origin on vegetables for three we
hit<00:04:13.019> it's<00:04:13.560> already<00:04:14.040> been<00:04:14.160> introduced<00:04:14.640> yet<00:04:14.880> no

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
hit it's already been introduced yet no
