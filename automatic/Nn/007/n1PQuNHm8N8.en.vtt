part about my belly piercing was the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.479

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
body it's really weird but it makes it a

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.410 
body it's really weird but it makes it a
little<00:03:40.260> bit<00:03:40.470> more<00:03:40.650> uncomfortable<00:03:41.130> um<00:03:41.760> but

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
little bit more uncomfortable um but

like that at school that usually did

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.089

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
of the curves so it's pretty inevitable

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.590 
for you to cry not because it hurts but
just<00:05:43.840> because<00:05:44.370> it's<00:05:45.370> meant<00:05:45.850> to<00:05:46.030> happen<00:05:46.060> I

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
just because it's meant to happen I

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.780 
just because it's meant to happen I
don't<00:05:46.840> really<00:05:46.960> know<00:05:47.290> but<00:05:47.620> I<00:05:47.890> did<00:05:48.460> crawl<00:05:48.760> a

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
don't really know but I did crawl a

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.450 
don't really know but I did crawl a
little<00:05:48.970> bit<00:05:49.330> I<00:05:49.630> hated<00:05:50.170> the<00:05:50.530> healing<00:05:51.100> screw

that<00:05:51.580> they<00:05:51.700> put<00:05:51.910> on<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.450> nose<00:05:53.050> ring<00:05:53.290> because

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
that they put on the nose ring because

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.910 
that they put on the nose ring because
it<00:05:53.950> was<00:05:54.040> so<00:05:54.310> big<00:05:54.880> and<00:05:55.390> it<00:05:55.930> wasn't<00:05:56.260> really<00:05:56.470> shiny

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
it was so big and it wasn't really shiny

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.130 
it was so big and it wasn't really shiny
but<00:05:57.340> I<00:05:57.370> wanted<00:05:57.790> it<00:05:57.940> to<00:05:58.090> be<00:05:58.300> and<00:05:58.570> I<00:05:58.660> didn't<00:05:58.960> like

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
but I wanted it to be and I didn't like

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.650 
but I wanted it to be and I didn't like
it<00:05:59.200> but<00:05:59.560> I<00:05:59.620> had<00:05:59.800> to<00:05:59.980> wear<00:06:00.160> it<00:06:00.250> for<00:06:00.550> about<00:06:00.700> 4-6

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
it but I had to wear it for about 4-6

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.530 
it but I had to wear it for about 4-6
weeks<00:06:02.140> before<00:06:02.470> I<00:06:02.530> could<00:06:02.710> change<00:06:02.950> it<00:06:03.300> and<00:06:04.300> then

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
weeks before I could change it and then

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.620 
weeks before I could change it and then
I<00:06:04.570> changed<00:06:04.900> it<00:06:05.200> to<00:06:05.530> a<00:06:05.830> smaller<00:06:06.610> diamond<00:06:07.300> which

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
I changed it to a smaller diamond which
