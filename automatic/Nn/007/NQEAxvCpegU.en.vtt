00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hi everyone, how are you? I'm here for today. 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.850
 give some tips to you from websites and 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.230
 channels to study physics 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.120
 The first channel site I want 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.800
 to pass on to you is total physics 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.840
 it not only has a website called 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.910
 physics total.com as well as 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.230
 there's a channel on youtube where you have 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.449
 access to various video lessons 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.100
 the site is having the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.140
 special operation only for medicine 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.109
 and I think it's a cost you can 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.599
 make a monthly biannual and annual package 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.570
 and the advantages of the course offered in 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.830
 site are fans of the weekly list of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.170
 weekly exercises 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.790
 this year the journals the platform is 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.500
 very cool, I already watched some video 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.510
 That's why I took a while. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.520
 to make this video for you guys because 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.739
 I really wanted to watch some 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.110
 video-classes try to study for them to 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.610
 to know if they would be the ones I would like 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.170
 it is logical that you are sharing with 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.180
 You and I did what I was recording. 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.399
 others are very dynamic and the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.629
 platform is superinteresting other 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.820
 Do you think I want to pass on to you? 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.350
 a single physical dot com 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.420
 in it you can register in a way 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.609
 and you will have access to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.739
 content physics dictionaries and 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.090
 solved exercises and even played more 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.580
 website I want to pass on to you I 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.439
 physical point that it's like it's a 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.049
 blog and the great advantage that it has a 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.520
 section of applied physics is fine. 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.259
 For you who want to prepare 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.180
 for the reason that in the majority of 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.460
 issues that are addressed there is a 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.920
 knowledge of theoretical art but 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.420
 applied something of our daily life 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.430
 I found a great site when people 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.350
 want to do a very quick search 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.759
 You not only find curious data but 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.439
 also the theory of all matter of the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.390
 physics and finally I want to present the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.820
 you a channel that I fell in love with reading 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.100
 everything is called factory physics and the site 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.220
 it's physical manufacturing dot com 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.780
 people an incredible platform on how to 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.040
 register for free 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.170
 but you will not have access to content 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.180
 that has several advantages you 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.649
 You're paying there making a plan. I liked it. 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.610
 much of his plan because he is super 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.960
 custom 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.780
 you can choose your level of 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.610
 physical difficulty and also the focus then 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.229
 If you say high school you want 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.299
 give to high school you can choose 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.090
 between choosing content for teaching 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.560
 medium enem you choose the content if it is 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.630
 you also have the option of 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.550
 choosing then it's super cool plus 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.259
 it has a super- customized timeline 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.750
 that you set the date and when you 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.280
 go 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.890
 your study even when you intend 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.510
 study and logically complete the program and 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.760
 besides all this has a lot of exercise 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.710
 solved handouts list of exercises 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.640
 and simulated for you too 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.830
 to enjoy 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.110
 it is very similar to total biology 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.000
 but for physics I brought sites and channels 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.950
 in order to help you that is given by 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.630
 Because I know I study alone. 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.490
 sometimes feel the need for some 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.380
 thing to be able to organize some 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.780
 schedule to be able to follow many 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.370
 You ask me to schedule the course if 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.020
 I can send it to you guys 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.940
 can track however is a 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.560
 notion of how to organize in such a nice way 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.600
 of these video signatures is 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.459
 precisely that you have a way to 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.200
 be able to organize a platform for 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.170
 to use you have the opportunity 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.880
 to have exercise booklet reviews 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.890
 things that usually do who with whom 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.690
 access on the platforms of the courses 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.430
 what do you think then super valid 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.380
 are much more affordable than a 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.660
 In fact, I think so if you 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.310
 veteran are you thinking of starting 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.780
 study alone it's nice of you to evaluate 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.880
 matters that you have more difficulty 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.709
 that matter you observe you do 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.780
 a monthly subscription and those you 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.940
 already has a notion a very good faith base 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.530
 your textbooks or another 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.450
 Class on YouTube for you 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.890
 strengthen your knowledge 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.780
 good people, I hope you have 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.950
 do not forget to evaluate the tips 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.780
 the video because it is super important 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.250
 to have feedback knowing that you 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.260
 like to watch here on the channel 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.090
 If you just arrived, like the video. 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.830
 that accompanying the next is only 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.989
 register below to receive 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.880
 sinus tube when I can see again if 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.739
 Do you want to talk to me or suggest? 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.640
 other serious issues is only to follow the 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.769
 social networks 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.920
 the page carolina araújo and instagram 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:49.560
 clothes araújo car I stay here one 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.560
 kiss on for you until tomorrow and plate
