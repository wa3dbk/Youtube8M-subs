00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hello to everything today a new 

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.410
 video makeup the make up I'm doing 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.330
 really everyday so at each 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.830
 times at each stage I will specify what 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.510
 I use as product I will give them 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.900
 under this video so do not hesitate to 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.519
 view 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.840
 and of course you can reproduce this 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.089
 makeup with your favorite products 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.470
 so that's gone first thing I 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.029
 start by moisturizing my letters as 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.289
 that I know they will be well hydrated 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.060
 to receive the lipstick while 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.680
 the time because otherwise at home it's 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.939
 the cat then right now I have some 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.470
 small traces on the forehead they are 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.090
 very small but I had pimples 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.260
 several months ago and it left me 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.849
 traces so if you have any 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.740
 tips to get rid of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.660
 traces of buttons I listen to you in everything 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.960
 case at the moment i 'm using crowd cover 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 make up for his job 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.570
 Foolproof and wake me up born two 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.739
 darling products for the complexion then 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.489
 I will use but there was 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.739
 still a lot right now 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.510
 I use a brush always I am 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.070
 would see more meters of the background dyed with 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.329
 my fingers is just a little pump 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.649
 I use only fountains and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.570
 plants like that i'm sure not to 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.340
 put too much and I tap it must 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.449
 especially not spread the foundation there 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.370
 do not need shooting and that's a lot 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.320
 less natural I know it's slow 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.399
 take a minute here are these 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.410
 moments a little slow of makeup 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.239
 but try to really see the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.100
 result is more natural and do not forget 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.060
 not the neck the cleavage and even the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.590
 ears we do not always think about 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.820
 ears but that's what can betray 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.180
 a little in any case this is what 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.460
 can do 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.600
 not very pretty so here is the moment a 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.890
 little bit of make-up that I'm going 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.970
 cut otherwise because otherwise it's going 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.670
 to be a bit too long but in any case 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.320
 case we tap knicks and hourglass but 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.570
 two favorite products but two anti 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.680
 dark circles preferred the jelly take mix 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.850
 because young people brought us back states 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.530
 united then obviously I want 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.060
 to use all the time and I do 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.530
 heat the material in the pot it's this 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.780
 who is very good with them what kind of 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.040
 small small concealer pots one can 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.560
 heat the material directly 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.780
 in and that's perfect I tap like 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.549
 the bottom late I tap and I forget 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.049
 not the inner corner of the eye 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.990
 and then good bath the second 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.740
 way does take if you follow the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.630
 beam is something quite 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.710
 again in my routine this just 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.600
 a few months it's true that now 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.399
 I can no longer do pa pou Draymond 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.200
 make up which I even by sow to powder 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.579
 now and I powder my bottom of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.860
 dyed and my dark circles then there in 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.540
 plus I have a huge light on the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.040
 face I'm sorry if I shine it's 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.630
 really not the make up but this 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.920
 big light I apologize is in 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.110
 any case you can see as like 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.939
 this mac powder perfectly unifies me 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.590
 I love them and that's it for the complexion so 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.330
 I finally look like something I'm doing 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.860
 a little less afraid in any case for 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.970
 the blush me I use the blush of 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.270
 l'oréal paris there are plenty of small 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.410
 colors they are nice 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.480
 I do not like at all this point what 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.410
 I had helped everything so I'm painting it 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.390
 for him to have a little bit more 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.830
 brush shape to blutch but actually 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.870
 the regulation we buy another 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.630
 in short anyway a little blush 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.090
 pink on each cheek he then my 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.490
 little my little trick and reuse 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.140
 the brush reached and the brush to 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.970
 powder actually there is still a small 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.160
 little background futile stamp it to melt 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.800
 a little bit the materials together is 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.090
 the same with the the powder brush I 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.010
 fest a little bit of all this and the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.390
 result is very very natural and well 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.620
 moment to mark my eyebrows and that's 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.880
 what I prefer to do which I 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.380
 brush above all up and 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.300
 by the way I made a special video 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.770
 eyebrows with my three favorite ways 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.480
 of mac and my eyebrows so I you 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.700
 invite to go see her if like me you 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.530
 like to make up your eyebrows anyway 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.310
 I'll use a pencil again 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.840
 faster 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.310
 I use a revlon and in fact this 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.690
 part of wax it is zero this 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.640
 mascaraàs grain if they really had 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.060
 no one is against I love the pencil of 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.320
 the other side 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.940
 so it's stupid but I find the 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.710
 pencil alone he actually wrote 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.090
 dark blond and covered as I am 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.740
 blonde we know it's really perfect 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.150
 because I really like it 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.800
 the color for her and she is 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.030
 perfect for me and then we move on to 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.860
 second eyebrows yes because 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.420
 finally make up both eyebrows 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.100
 it's always better than putting on makeup 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.560
 that a good I say anything and 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.150
 then to finish we will iron a 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.160
 little brush stroke in the sources 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.250
 they know how to blur makeup the 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.750
 pencil and are very natural good mascara 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.010
 there I concentrate thoroughly because 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.570
 it is she comes a moment where I can 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.660
 to miss in a make up is this one 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.220
 so I focus on zigzag challenge 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.080
 but if I avoid packets like that 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.430
 it's good technique and but I'm 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.320
 go out pretty well actually a game tells you 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.850
 loose concentrated I try to fuck myself 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.920
 shame in front of you it looks like there is a 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.200
 critical step like that in make-up whew 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.820
 you are always afraid to miss what 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.220
 you have already made a product that 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.570
 never forgive a product that I like 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.130
 a lot it's this illuminator of 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.750
 at clinic so I do not know if you 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.250
 you use it but I like 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.930
 put a lot on my cheekbones that 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.640
 really gives the upstream glo makeup 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.990
 I really like the result so the agent 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.340
 did not really need it because 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.590
 that with the big light they had 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.060
 on me during this shoot I shone 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.440
 enough but really everything in the life of 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.720
 every day it's really pretty 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.670
 so gespunsart on the finger or so with 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.230
 my brush is hungry it's still a 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.310
 little more serious and that's it 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.750
 illuminate make up me I find 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.190
 really that changes everything anyway 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.260
 a little trick for you is really 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.120
 cheaper is use it otherwise 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.310
 very clear stone flag and you can 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.260
 use it as an illuminator on 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.460
 cheekbones and like me here under my 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.410
 eyebrows then it's not bad for 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.300
 to hide the little hairs that we would have 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.590
 could forget batteries and but if not 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.870
 like that under the eyebrows I find 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.370
 really that it enlarges the look and 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.690
 finally we finish with the student I hope 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.980
 I you are then lost two 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.630
 favorite chili stick from home 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.060
 web clinic often use this 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.770
 see and I also love my gloss 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.090
 matt 2 at nyx such a color 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.800
 raspberry and it is super nice 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.390
 adopted in addition but there I have the lips 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.910
 bromont too dry so in these cases 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.950
 there julie stx and 1 is a balm hyper 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.750
 moisturizing but in addition tinted I like 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.370
 I really like this congo look like 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.470
 it's like these pigmented ones 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.970
 almost 3 applications is very beautiful 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.590
 and it's all day long 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.940
 and finally last step which I do not 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.140
 could no longer pass me two three 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.540
 figures of mont mau fixer of 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.860
 make-up and that's the end result so 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.180
