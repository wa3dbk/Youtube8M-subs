 Welcome to our network to our 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.980
 channel of each world japan today we're going 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.200
 to teach how to activate the grid of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.580
 the camera the procedure is very easy 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.650
 Many people have already asked us the question 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.289
 since every time we open our 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.180
 camera as you can see it from the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.150
 grid we have a grid in 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.279
 our camera viewer and by default 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.840
 when I bought the phone I try it 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.910
 we turn it on for the first time or we give it 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.130
 to the first use that grid comes 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.900
 deactivated and that's what we're going to 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.180
 teach how to activate it 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.800

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.629
 then to change or activate the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.980
 simply grid the camera 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.190
 we enter here by adjustments 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.760
 both second we go down we look for the option 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.860
 15 camera here this says photos and camera 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.760
 that is on top of game center and below 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.729
 of videos let's see here photos and cameras and 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.130
 we just go down again here is 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.840
 the option says camera grid 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.220
 remember that right now I showed you is the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.070
 grid is to say that it is active in 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.050
 green if you put it in the passed to gray it 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.860
 it deactivates as it goes out to the camera 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:27.340
 we quickly started the camera and as 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.500
 you will see this is how normally the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.070
 camera without the grid the grid 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.950
 an aid that helps us to level the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.720
 camera with the horizontal well so that 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.880
 we left the horizontal photo and also 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.830
 It also helps us to help 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.229
 reference so that not always the photos 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.759
 or the people who take the photos that 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:52.119
 in the center they will say it is on one side 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.550
 of the camera either in the middle of some 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.289
 of the third parts of the photo 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.509
 then as we said before we are going to be 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.500
 quickly a process we enter what 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.350
 settings 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.290
 we go down and look for the option 15 photos and 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.600
 camera we go down and look for the option that 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.550
 it says grid and just the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.160
 we went to green there it was again 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.020
 activated the grid let's enter 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.990
 again the camera 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.010
 and as you will see there was the grid 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.600
