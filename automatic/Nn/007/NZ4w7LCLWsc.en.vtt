hey it's coach tief here to tell you how
long<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.929> 5k<00:00:03.929> is<00:00:04.230> it's<00:00:05.899> 3.1<00:00:06.899> miles<00:00:07.880> that's<00:00:08.880> it

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
long a 5k is it's 3.1 miles that's it

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:21.620 
long a 5k is it's 3.1 miles that's it
it's<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.650> video<00:00:20.000> kilometers<00:00:21.000> that's<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
it's the video kilometers that's the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.900 
it's the video kilometers that's the
metric<00:00:21.869> system<00:00:22.380> they<00:00:22.859> use<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.400> pretty<00:00:23.730> much

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
metric system they use that pretty much

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.950 
metric system they use that pretty much
all<00:00:24.150> around<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> world

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
all around the world

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.800 
all around the world
miles<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:26.369> use<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> United<00:00:27.510> States

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
miles we use that in the United States

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.650 
miles we use that in the United States
chances<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:28.560> you're<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.699> me<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.480> you're

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
from the United States and we measure

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.740 
from the United States and we measure
things<00:00:33.420> differently<00:00:34.230> because<00:00:34.680> we're<00:00:35.750> special

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
things differently because we're special

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.510

a<00:00:37.170> mile<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:39.379> 5,280<00:00:40.379> feet<00:00:40.500> don't<00:00:41.370> ask

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
a mile is actually 5,280 feet don't ask

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.280 
a mile is actually 5,280 feet don't ask
me<00:00:41.730> how<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.879> made<00:00:42.239> up<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.570> measurement<00:00:43.140> they

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
me how I made up that measurement they

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.100 
me how I made up that measurement they
just<00:00:43.649> did<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.329> kilometer<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.660> other<00:00:45.780> hand

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
just did a kilometer on the other hand

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.279 
just did a kilometer on the other hand
is<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> thousand<00:00:47.070> meters<00:00:47.539> the<00:00:48.539> metric<00:00:48.930> system

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
is a thousand meters the metric system

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.900 
is a thousand meters the metric system
is<00:00:49.440> organized<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:52.070> tens<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
is organized like that in tens and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.630 
is organized like that in tens and
hundreds<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> thousands<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.559> run<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:56.280> mile

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
hundreds and thousands you run one mile

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520 
hundreds and thousands you run one mile
you've<00:00:56.969> actually<00:00:57.210> run<00:00:57.629> much<00:00:57.960> more<00:00:58.260> than<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you've actually run much more than a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.510 
you've actually run much more than a
kilometer<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.879> 1.6<00:01:00.809> kilometers<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:02.010> exact
