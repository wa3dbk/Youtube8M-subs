so I just don't end it quickly a wide
variety<00:02:30.620> like<00:02:31.010> maybe<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:32.300> timer<00:02:32.630> first<00:02:32.989> then

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
variety like maybe the timer first then

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.580 
variety like maybe the timer first then
you<00:02:34.370> know<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.640> one<00:02:34.820> in<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.120> robbery<00:02:35.780> arena<00:02:36.320> and

to get up oxy level 29 took me a day to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.979 
to get up oxy level 29 took me a day to
get<00:02:43.910> up<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:45.280> well<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.360> same<00:02:47.570> night<00:02:47.750> really

get up to well in the same night really

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.440 
get up to well in the same night really
it's<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.350> first<00:02:48.560> video<00:02:48.709> about<00:02:49.370> one<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.820> got<00:02:50.360> it

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
it's the first video about one I got it

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.720 
it's the first video about one I got it
to<00:02:50.570> level<00:02:50.690> 20<00:02:51.050> same<00:02:51.320> night<00:02:51.530> but<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.190> just<00:02:52.459> hadn't

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
to level 20 same night but I just hadn't

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.750 
to level 20 same night but I just hadn't
done<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.030> jigsaw<00:02:53.390> which<00:02:53.570> I'll<00:02:53.750> show<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.019> know

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
done the jigsaw which I'll show you know

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.820 
done the jigsaw which I'll show you know
and<00:02:55.760> that's<00:02:56.600> see<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:56.870> was<00:02:57.080> wrong<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.440> wasn't<00:02:57.590> the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
and that's see I was wrong it wasn't the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.080 
and that's see I was wrong it wasn't the
Stegosaurus<00:02:58.780> Triceratops<00:02:59.780> so<00:03:00.350> it's

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
Stegosaurus Triceratops so it's

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.340 
Stegosaurus Triceratops so it's
increased<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.269> quantity<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.750> em<00:03:02.930> have<00:03:03.110> sold

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
increased the quantity of em have sold

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.960 
increased the quantity of em have sold
in<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.590> armory<00:03:03.890> by<00:03:04.040> one<00:03:04.220> hundred<00:03:04.519> percent<00:03:04.549> now

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
in the armory by one hundred percent now

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.080 
in the armory by one hundred percent now
and<00:03:05.590> it's<00:03:06.590> can<00:03:07.190> only<00:03:07.340> be<00:03:07.519> finished<00:03:07.820> by<00:03:08.030> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
and it's can only be finished by the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.509 
and it's can only be finished by the
soldier<00:03:10.269> said<00:03:11.269> these<00:03:11.540> um<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.560> I've<00:03:13.310> also

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
soldier said these um and I've also

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.479 
soldier said these um and I've also
created<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.299> quite<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.630> bit<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.250> my<00:03:16.250> friend

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.770 
it's 500 for this and when it's actually
cheaper<00:03:50.239> for<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.690> laser<00:03:50.900> gun<00:03:51.640> see<00:03:52.640> ya<00:03:52.780> that's
