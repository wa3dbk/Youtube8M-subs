 in the material you want to work with 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.480
 I'm going to use eva rubber in color 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.460

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.530
 You can use materials in different 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.290
 colors copy the pieces of the 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.690
 template on the piece of rubber eva copio 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.420
 the body of the camera twice sideways 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.970
 on the side and the smallest lens on the rubber 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.760
 eva of the same color copies the lens more 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.570
 big and the flash in the rubber eva 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.280
 silver color trims then trims a 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.050
 small square rubber eva color 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.720
 red to make the record button 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.690
 then cut out a small piece of rubber 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.180
 eva or gray paper is going to be 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.390
 the display screen cuts a 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.310
 piece of ribbon or thin thread doubles and 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.100
 makes a knot in the corner of the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.380
 body of the camera and doubles now we go 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.750
 to assemble the rest of the camera to do 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.600
 the main lens I put a little bit of 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.460
 glue on the strip for the lens 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.690
 roll up and compare the size of the circle 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.750
 for the lens 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.560
 cut out 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.649
 Stick to the body of the camera 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.110
 then paste the lens circle over 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.160
 this sticks the lens cover 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.160
 and then the flash 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.850
 have the record button 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.120

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.120
 back and if you want to decorate 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.030
 You can also add details 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.160
 additional to your camera as a panel 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.230
 control on the back using 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.630
 eva rubber shapes as circles 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.030
 squares and triangles change the color 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.060
 from the camera and even use gems 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.590
