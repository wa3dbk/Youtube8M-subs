close together all right and then one
last<00:01:54.310> thing<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.790> note<00:01:54.820> if<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.600> defense<00:01:55.990> you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
last thing to note if the defense you

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.840 
last thing to note if the defense you
are<00:01:56.200> targeting<00:01:56.680> is<00:01:56.800> a<00:01:56.830> much<00:01:57.190> higher<00:01:57.460> level

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
are targeting is a much higher level

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.190 
are targeting is a much higher level
than<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.120> lightning<00:01:58.450> spell<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:58.930> have
