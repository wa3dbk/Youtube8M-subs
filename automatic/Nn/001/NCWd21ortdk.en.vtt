the waves it's just basically all
reflected<00:00:38.010> waves<00:00:38.219> down<00:00:39.530> but<00:00:41.300> see<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.420> still

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
reflected waves down but see it's still

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.119 
reflected waves down but see it's still
going<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.320> higher<00:00:43.500> than<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.980> know

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
going up but higher than that you know

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.959 
going up but higher than that you know
the<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.370> crashing<00:00:45.980> that's<00:00:46.980> that's<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.670> it's

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the the crashing that's that's just it's

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.010 
the the crashing that's that's just it's
already<00:00:48.300> been<00:00:48.620> they've<00:00:49.620> already<00:00:49.739> been<00:00:49.950> bigger

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
already been they've already been bigger

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.389 
already been they've already been bigger
they're<00:00:52.020> probably<00:00:52.199> crashing<00:00:52.649> into<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> hotel

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
they're probably crashing into the hotel

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.819 
they're probably crashing into the hotel
itself<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.879> reckon<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> there's<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.770> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
itself I reckon so there's going to be a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.049 
itself I reckon so there's going to be a
lot<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.100> water<00:00:56.280> running<00:00:56.550> down<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> street

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
lot of water running down the street

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.619 
lot of water running down the street
down<00:00:57.210> there<00:00:57.420> I'd<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.930> lot<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.590> damage<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.629> shops

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
down there I'd a lot of damage to shops

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.320 
down there I'd a lot of damage to shops
and<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:02.010> front<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.340> Penang<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:05.790> know<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.150> see

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.760 
and the front of Penang you know to see
how<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> ferries<00:01:06.900> handle<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.590> around

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
how the ferries handle it going around

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.660 
how the ferries handle it going around
the<00:01:07.890> other<00:01:07.979> side<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.830> theories<00:01:11.189> theories

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the other side the theories theories

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.780 
the other side the theories theories
just<00:01:12.030> around<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> corner<00:01:12.659> there

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.450 

that'll<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.850> get<00:01:21.000> lucky<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.480> is<00:01:21.630> low<00:01:21.780> tide<00:01:22.050> so

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
that'll be get lucky this is low tide so

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:31.430 
that'll be get lucky this is low tide so
these<00:01:23.460> are<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.700> small<00:01:23.970> ones<00:01:29.750> when<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.900> see
