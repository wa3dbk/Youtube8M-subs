00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
our mothers would prepare it okay in

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.250 
our mothers would prepare it okay in
them<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:54.410> everybody<00:02:55.070> then<00:02:55.340> can<00:02:56.260> preserve

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
them and everybody then can preserve

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.220

we're<00:03:04.040> gonna<00:03:04.130> be<00:03:04.400> testing<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:05.000> pretty<00:03:05.239> soon<00:03:05.480> to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
we're gonna be testing it pretty soon to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.870 
we're gonna be testing it pretty soon to
see<00:03:05.900> where<00:03:06.140> we<00:03:06.290> are<00:03:06.500> we<00:03:06.980> use<00:03:07.010> frozen<00:03:07.459> plates

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
see where we are we use frozen plates

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.060 
see where we are we use frozen plates
because<00:03:08.239> we<00:03:08.390> want<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.840> gym<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.560> immediately

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
because we want the gym to immediately

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.970 
because we want the gym to immediately
get<00:03:10.610> cool<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.330> that<00:03:11.840> way<00:03:12.080> we<00:03:12.290> get<00:03:12.410> an<00:03:12.530> idea<00:03:12.920> of

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
get cool and that way we get an idea of

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.190 
get cool and that way we get an idea of
what<00:03:13.370> its<00:03:13.520> gonna<00:03:13.640> be<00:03:13.760> like<00:03:13.940> when<00:03:14.600> it's<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:15.080> the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
what its gonna be like when it's in the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.240 
what its gonna be like when it's in the
jar<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:16.489> doing<00:03:16.880> pretty<00:03:17.120> darn<00:03:17.360> good<00:03:17.660> actually

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250
