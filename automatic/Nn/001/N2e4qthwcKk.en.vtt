00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
be playing CCC and we start by putting

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.030 
be playing CCC and we start by putting
our<00:01:12.900> infrastructure<00:01:13.320> guys<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.770> yellow

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
our infrastructure guys the yellow

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.480 
our infrastructure guys the yellow
corners<00:01:14.670> will<00:01:14.850> determine<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.189> dice<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.369> get

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
corners will determine the dice you get

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.010 
corners will determine the dice you get
at<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> beginning<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.299> put<00:01:18.509> them<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> slice

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
at the beginning you put them in a slice

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.450 
at the beginning you put them in a slice
like<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:21.500> obviously<00:01:22.500> each<00:01:22.710> corporation<00:01:23.340> has

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
like so obviously each corporation has

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
like so obviously each corporation has
pretty<00:01:23.700> unique<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.780> need<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.170> kind<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
pretty unique so you need to kind of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.859 
pretty unique so you need to kind of
learn<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:25.950> company<00:01:26.600> put<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> white

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
learn your company put a white

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.550 
learn your company put a white
leadership<00:01:28.650> die<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> corner<00:01:30.560> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
leadership die up here in the corner and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.179 
leadership die up here in the corner and
then<00:01:31.770> each<00:01:32.040> company<00:01:32.549> gets<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:34.070> unique<00:01:35.070> die<00:01:35.759> for

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
then each company gets a unique die for

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.890 
then each company gets a unique die for
them<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.640> we'll<00:01:39.060> set<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.570> then

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
them and then we'll set up and then

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.730 
them and then we'll set up and then
we'll<00:01:40.020> talk<00:01:40.140> about<00:01:40.200> gameplay<00:01:40.799> okay

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
we'll talk about gameplay okay

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.179 
we'll talk about gameplay okay
alright<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:43.909> we're<00:01:44.119> set<00:01:44.299> up<00:01:44.329> now<00:01:44.920> each<00:01:45.920> of

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
alright so we're set up now each of

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.260 
alright so we're set up now each of
these<00:01:46.600> what<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:47.689> call<00:01:47.720> asset<00:01:48.320> DICE<00:01:48.560> has<00:01:48.590> a

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
these what we call asset DICE has a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.149 
these what we call asset DICE has a
reference<00:01:50.270> card<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:50.899> when<00:01:51.649> you<00:01:51.740> end<00:01:52.040> up

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
reference card and so when you end up

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.100 
reference card and so when you end up
rolling<00:01:52.430> or<00:01:52.790> if<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.180> determining<00:01:53.689> which<00:01:53.840> kind

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
rolling or if you determining which kind

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.920 
rolling or if you determining which kind
of<00:01:54.200> dice<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.530> want<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.830> want<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.399> get<00:01:55.930> there's

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
basically one asset die and a bunch of

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.320 
basically one asset die and a bunch of
infrastructure<00:02:04.159> dice<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:05.000> want<00:02:05.179> to

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
infrastructure dice and you want to

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.270 
infrastructure dice and you want to
determine<00:02:06.020> which<00:02:06.350> resources<00:02:06.710> you're<00:02:07.039> going

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
powerful die and that's why a lot of a

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.930 
powerful die and that's why a lot of a
lot<00:05:09.570> of<00:05:09.660> megacon<00:05:10.140> still<00:05:10.410> have<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:11.010> lot<00:05:11.910> of

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
lot of megacon still have a lot of

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.340

espionage<00:05:12.570> right<00:05:12.990> ability<00:05:13.950> okay<00:05:14.670> but<00:05:15.350> there

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
espionage right ability okay but there

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.510 
espionage right ability okay but there

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
are four factions in the box and so the

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.370 
are four factions in the box and so the
terrorist<00:05:20.730> organization<00:05:21.510> FCC<00:05:21.990> house<00:05:22.140> night

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
terrorist organization FCC house night

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.200 
terrorist organization FCC house night
they<00:05:22.500> have<00:05:22.620> a<00:05:22.650> lot<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:22.890> espionage<00:05:23.790> rifle

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
you somehow had to military Dyson you

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.930 
you somehow had to military Dyson you
you<00:06:21.810> roll<00:06:22.740> that<00:06:22.950> and<00:06:23.220> you<00:06:23.280> can<00:06:23.460> pay<00:06:23.640> for<00:06:23.670> it

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
you roll that and you can pay for it

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.880 
you roll that and you can pay for it
right<00:06:24.390> you<00:06:24.720> basically<00:06:24.900> can<00:06:25.200> pick<00:06:25.380> two<00:06:25.560> sectors

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
right you basically can pick two sectors

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.430 
right you basically can pick two sectors
and<00:06:26.070> destroy<00:06:26.370> him<00:06:26.550> gotcha<00:06:26.910> and<00:06:27.690> so<00:06:27.930> oh<00:06:27.960> my<00:06:28.260> gosh

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
and destroy him gotcha and so oh my gosh

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.200 
and destroy him gotcha and so oh my gosh
you<00:06:28.770> know<00:06:28.890> I've<00:06:29.220> been<00:06:29.520> put<00:06:29.880> in<00:06:29.970> a<00:06:30.060> situation

you know I've been put in a situation
the<00:06:31.080> other<00:06:31.250> mechanic<00:06:32.250> is

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
the other mechanic is

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.800 
the other mechanic is
military<00:06:34.580> isn't<00:06:34.760> that<00:06:35.479> I<00:06:36.580> the<00:06:37.720> importance<00:06:38.720> of

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
military isn't that I the importance of
