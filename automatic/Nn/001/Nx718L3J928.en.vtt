00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
you cover the same distance and stop and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.750 
you cover the same distance and stop and
start<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.110> same<00:00:55.350> time<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.400> each

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
start at the same time with each

start at the same time with each
movement<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.910> doing<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.900> correctly<00:01:01.579> now

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
movement this is doing it correctly now

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.310 
movement this is doing it correctly now
doing<00:01:02.790> it<00:01:02.970> incorrectly<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:04.020> look<00:01:04.170> something

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you get this principle down let's just

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.270 
you get this principle down let's just
do<00:01:26.550> them<00:01:26.640> together<00:01:26.789> first<00:01:27.210> okay<00:01:27.570> engage<00:01:28.410> get

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
do them together first okay engage get

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.260 
do them together first okay engage get
that<00:01:29.430> back<00:01:29.610> straight<00:01:30.200> stand<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.380> come<00:01:31.770> on

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
that back straight stand up come on

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.400 
that back straight stand up come on
participate<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.660> weight<00:01:33.929> from<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.110> screen

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
participate up weight from the screen

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:42.730 
participate up weight from the screen

I<00:01:53.030> don't<00:01:53.630> know<00:01:53.690> why<00:01:53.870> I<00:01:53.900> look<00:01:54.200> up<00:01:54.440> that

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
I don't know why I look up that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.900 
I don't know why I look up that
direction<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:56.030> don't<00:01:56.210> have<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:57.140> can<00:01:57.170> just

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
direction you don't have to you can just

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.780 
direction you don't have to you can just
look<00:01:58.910> straight<00:01:59.270> if<00:01:59.720> you<00:01:59.840> want<00:02:00.490> these<00:02:01.490> are<00:02:01.670> just

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
look straight if you want these are just

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.410 
look straight if you want these are just
habits<00:02:02.360> tendencies<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.110> have<00:02:04.150> now<00:02:05.150> once<00:02:05.330> you

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
habits tendencies that have now once you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.060 
habits tendencies that have now once you
get<00:02:05.570> this<00:02:05.690> principle<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:06.290> can<00:02:06.410> apply<00:02:06.620> it<00:02:06.740> to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
get this principle you can apply it to

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.510 
get this principle you can apply it to
other<00:02:07.430> parts<00:02:08.180> of<00:02:08.270> your<00:02:08.479> body<00:02:08.860> for<00:02:09.860> instance<00:02:10.250> we

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
other parts of your body for instance we

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.460 
other parts of your body for instance we
could<00:02:10.729> do<00:02:11.500> let's<00:02:12.500> say<00:02:12.710> the<00:02:12.950> leg<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.520> arm

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
could do let's say the leg and the arm

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:26.100 
could do let's say the leg and the arm
like<00:02:15.470> this<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.690> like<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.350> can<00:02:22.250> really<00:02:22.370> see

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:37.610 

little<00:02:27.110> quiet<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:29.180> other<00:02:29.330> side

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.380 

you<00:02:38.159> really<00:02:38.370> got<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.580> be<00:02:38.640> able<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.849> balance<00:02:39.000> to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
you really got to be able to balance to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.729 
you really got to be able to balance to
get<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.690> one<00:02:39.870> on<00:02:39.900> me<00:02:39.989> I'll<00:02:40.170> see<00:02:40.349> that<00:02:40.530> well

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
get that one on me I'll see that well

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:41.630 
get that one on me I'll see that well
that's<00:02:40.890> going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.069> take<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.280> little<00:02:41.400> practice

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
that's going to take a little practice

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.080 
that's going to take a little practice
and<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:44.720> when<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.840> put<00:02:45.989> them<00:02:46.110> all<00:02:46.200> together

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
and so when you put them all together

00:02:47.090 --> 00:03:02.150 
and so when you put them all together
they<00:02:48.090> look<00:02:48.299> like<00:02:48.420> this

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.850
