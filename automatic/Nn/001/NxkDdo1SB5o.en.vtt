00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.160
 meal at 7:56 thomas sotto when emmanuel 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.720
 little wants to defend his friend thierry 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.430
 henry that they feel unfairly wrong 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.080
 loved in France he does not do things 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.700
 in half hello dany cohn now I 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.710
 you go in the interview he granted 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.609
 at sports.fr the world champion 98 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.619
 loose this sentence 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.910
 sometimes I think that having been 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.439
 invaded by the Germans one would 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.810
 better lead today 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.179
 this is the 2014 golden ball of the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.789
 stupidity no yes okay finally manu paste 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.470
 and little manu was a bit far he was 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.239
 a bit loud but he obviously has a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.320
 problem with France anyway with 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.420
 French elites 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.670
 but let's take the thing now with 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.390
 intelligence even though the sentence is a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.480
 little indecent 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.160
 it actually takes France against the foot 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.260
 because today left and right 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.989
 at the top as well as at the bottom it is good 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.640
 to say that absolute evil in europe which 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.679
 hurts Europe is Germany 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.780
 it's madam merkel and there you see 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.489
 little who has also corrected his shot 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.989
 since he said it's germany that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.550
 I like it's the one today is the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.829
 best politically she is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.960
 better economy by germany 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.150
 angela merkel in fact here it is and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.890
 I believe that when Sarkozy wants 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.509
 absolutely go to the cd congress where 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.640
 he does not think anything else 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.710
 but is he right on the merits 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.659
 thierry 1 by emmanuel little to say that 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.100
 we are a cowardly hypocritical country that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.299
 we are arrogant enough liar 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.890
 and we do not like our champions 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.540
 no I think they're wrong 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.000
 France loves its champions France 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.710
 love the champions who wins is what 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.079
 France is a hypocritical country where 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.520
 countries are a little hypocritical where that I 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.680
 believe it's not it's not very true 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.079
 but regarding thierry henry I 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.240
 is there he touches he touched 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.860
 something because really good what is it 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 that we're going theory was the biggest 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.750
 French footballers who ever 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.850
 exist 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.340
 good then there was this famous hand 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.289
 yes okay good it was ethically 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.479
 was not very good but he has nothing 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.020
 said in south africa very well but 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.360
 still 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.670
 the abe the ball of zidane 1 on 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.979
 forgave him and still 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.030
 when zidane walks on a player 2006 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.729
 the site in 87 98 98 good it of a carton 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.469
 red people it belonged to him so 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.229
 I think there are two weights 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.060
 measures thierry henry is one of the most 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.459
 great and then like every human being 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.160
 he also has his little flaws but he 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.770
 is not you obviously on peaks of 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.480
 france thierry henry against brazil 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.440
 the friendly match March 26, 2015 or the fact 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.900
 to play to honor him or not 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.610
 absolutely I'm getting him into the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.320
 last quarter of an hour at least if this 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.510
 is in the last half hour is 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.920
 really and I give him the armband of 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.620
 captain that would really be a picture 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.590
 extraordinary and the audience of the stadium 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.510
 France for cheer in a decade titi 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.370

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.440
 titi titi titi exciting it is in 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.660
 ch'ti access spell cohn-bendit mood 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.490
