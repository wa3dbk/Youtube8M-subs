00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.720
 hi to all super readers in the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.940
 point it 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.400
 let's go see the protective case 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.469
 universal for the 9.7 inch tablet 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.259
 of mediacom rest to this hatred e 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.940
 official media with originality e 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.789
 the usefulness of this is the fact 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.260
 that in addition to protecting our tablet 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.240
 from many shots 15 hard of 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.820
 protect around without problems too 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.250
 a mini qwerty keyboard that allows us 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.400
 to use it as the sort of netbook 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.590
 let's go see it, it's the first 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.420
 opening that is making the box a 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:43.670
 then you can also give a little 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.670
 unfortunately this was the seal 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.719
 you can 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.580
 they had made it could already be so 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:13.729
 looks like sort of agenda 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.350
 we open what we have the various cables here 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.460
 but to connect the keyboard to the door 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.590
 I micro and mini of our tablet 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.910
 this is the case with the keyboard and face 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.410
 the qwerty keyboard 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.850
 in short, not to the numeric keypad a 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.140
 side but it is not necessary 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.990
 also because the keyboard would become 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.000
 then really too too cumbersome 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.679
 here behind we go the leg that 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.619
 we can wait for the feet so let's try 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:46.220
 now missing our mediacom 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.840
 smartpad 9 sa so much the 29th memory comes out 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.009
 tonight is good for all tablets 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:02:01.610
 by 9.7 inches how they work we must 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:03.739
 let's pull this target finish language 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.000
 now to connect the keyboard to the tablet 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:11.380
 with recesses supplied with I would like 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.940
 point out that there is micro news there 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:20.480
 that the mini in this case we have 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.860
 microsd for months so we will use a 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.950
 friend rome for example in other tablets 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.290
 mid com the mini is present and then in 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.650
 lactation are both put then 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.270
 I insert my the microusb I think 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.310
 compartment 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.040
 and then we link it to jazz news 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.790
 b perfect you saw lights now 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.410
 make it ready let's see 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.820
 selection of keyboards 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.710
 look already been recognized at 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.290
 keyboard as you can have the cup on 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.280
 luca for example works in the north 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.260
 etc 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.180
 we try to write something to expect 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.180
 how the keyboard actually reacts 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:05.780
 you might not know if it is too 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.780
 of whether it is possible to create something 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.000
 let's see for an instant I apologize but I am 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.070
 trying here with you 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.790
 no it is not possible to create a 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.790
 document but let's try it on the internet 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.790
 browser 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.900
 let's try to apologize 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.160
 I will dispel for myself the keyboard in 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.630
 effects another peculiarity is that 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.430
 when connected to the keyboard in the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:41.010
 stop but it is only the keyboard 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:41.730
 we look for www.supermoney.eu we see 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.720
 the results 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.420
 how can you do the keyboard a lot 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.630
 creative 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.459
 this is the smartphone mode 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.709
 smart power to you is seen as it is 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.209
 smartphone from the site is possible 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.489
 request the variety of the desktop site 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.610
 so as to visualize things there 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.150
 we found on the computer 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.920
 we can see 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:13.120
 here it is, go and see the 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:17.530
 navigation is decidedly fluid 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:24.660
 here we try to look for what we are looking for 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.660
 let's try to look for media with perfect 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.360
 obviously for sending in for 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.850
 carry out the research as we do only 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.919
 sea ​​the computer works all in way 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.199
 absolutely perfect sincerely 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.729
 I also find the keyboard very convenient 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:44.620
 you can leave it mounted now vi 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:47.320
 I show how black we close equitably and 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.570
 You can also keep it mounted in a way 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.100
 that is not to disturb from a duty 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.090
 stand each time to mount and reassemble it 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.910
 this here is a calamity that 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.190
 allows the leg not to fall but 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.610
 being attacked go find it kind 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.349
 ips slipping into a suitcase if we had 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.060
 this will be dangerous because we risk it 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.180
 to break the foot the Lazio so stands 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.699
 supported also this is now that time 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.830
 small calamity that as you can see 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.510
 as it approaches but is also closed 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.430
 very portable primary 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.909
 here's how to get around looks like the 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.760
 sort of good agenda I would say is the 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.770
 everything we see, possibly always 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.280
 super enel.it with new videos and 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.280
 insights
