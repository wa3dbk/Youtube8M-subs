works we got ten through a hundred

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.210 
works we got ten through a hundred
percent<00:01:11.840> it's<00:01:12.840> based<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.229> battery<00:01:13.619> voltage<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
percent it's based on battery voltage it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890

reads the battery voltage it gives us a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.929 
reads the battery voltage it gives us a
percentage<00:01:16.310> according<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.640> battery

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939

it<00:01:19.530> does<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.979> some<00:01:20.070> hysteresis<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.240> so

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
it does have some hysteresis in there so

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
it does have some hysteresis in there so
if<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> well<00:01:22.140> pump<00:01:22.439> comes<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.890> whatever<00:01:23.310> that

case may be the gauges don't jump around

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.039 
case may be the gauges don't jump around
they<00:01:27.360> stay<00:01:27.600> steady

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049

the batteries been full and what happens
here<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.220> voltage<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.880> time<00:01:54.090> based

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
here is this is voltage and time based

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.060 
here is this is voltage and time based
according<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> jumper<00:01:55.500> setting<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.950> you

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
according to the jumper setting that you

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.429 
according to the jumper setting that you
programmed<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:57.299> will<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.689> up<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> certain

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
programmed it will go up to a certain

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.560 
programmed it will go up to a certain
voltage<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.219> once<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.820> maintains<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.360> certain

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
voltage and once it maintains a certain

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.749 
voltage and once it maintains a certain
time<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.409> voltage<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.340> green<00:02:02.579> light

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
time at that voltage the green light

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.490 
time at that voltage the green light
will<00:02:02.939> come<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.210> indicating<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> battery<00:02:04.290> is

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
will come on indicating the battery is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.560 
will come on indicating the battery is
full<00:02:04.860> again<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.670> can<00:02:05.790> all<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.060> found<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
full again that can all be found on the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.540 
full again that can all be found on the
table<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> manual<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.340> say<00:02:08.520> very

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
table in the manual and like I say very

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.940 
table in the manual and like I say very
simple<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.420> wire<00:02:09.599> hookup<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.560> I'm<00:02:10.739> sure

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
simple to wire hookup and I'm sure

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.620 
simple to wire hookup and I'm sure
you're<00:02:11.099> wondering<00:02:11.280> why<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.790> threw<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.180> one

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
you're wondering why we threw that one

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.750 
you're wondering why we threw that one
in<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.810> bowl<00:02:12.960> of<00:02:12.990> water<00:02:13.370> okay<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.520> threw<00:02:14.730> that

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
in the bowl of water okay we threw that

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.400 
in the bowl of water okay we threw that
in<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.090> fishbowl<00:02:15.300> because<00:02:15.870> we<00:02:15.960> want<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.200> prove

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
in the fishbowl because we want to prove

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.530 
in the fishbowl because we want to prove
a<00:02:16.440> point<00:02:16.740> when<00:02:17.490> we<00:02:17.610> conformal<00:02:18.150> code<00:02:18.330> our

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
a point when we conformal code our

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.630 
a point when we conformal code our
circuit<00:02:18.960> boards<00:02:19.260> especially<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.860> BCM<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
circuit boards especially the BCM on the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.240 
circuit boards especially the BCM on the
BCM<00:02:21.090> what<00:02:21.390> we<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.810> we<00:02:21.960> dip<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.320> in<00:02:22.590> conformal

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
BCM what we do is we dip it in conformal

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.430 
BCM what we do is we dip it in conformal
coating<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.180> completely<00:02:24.480> sealed<00:02:25.200> in

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
coating so it's completely sealed in

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.010 
coating so it's completely sealed in
conformal<00:02:26.190> coating<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:27.000> dries<00:02:27.360> into<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.750> nice

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
conformal coating that dries into a nice

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.590 
conformal coating that dries into a nice
case<00:02:28.710> or<00:02:29.010> shell<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.640> seals<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.090> whole<00:02:30.300> board

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
case or shell that seals the whole board

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.050

makes<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.680> pervious<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.280> water<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.730> as<00:02:33.030> you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
makes it in pervious to water and as you
