battleship<00:03:35.299> now<00:03:35.510> last<00:03:36.260> week<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.680> made<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:36.920> fury

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
battleship now last week I made a fury

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.680 
battleship now last week I made a fury
and<00:03:37.370> there<00:03:37.489> was<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.640> couple<00:03:37.820> chief<00:03:38.060> attack<00:03:38.359> kept

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
and there was a couple chief attack kept

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.910 
and there was a couple chief attack kept
saying<00:03:38.900> most<00:03:39.079> likely<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.620> was<00:03:39.709> that

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
saying most likely it was that

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.220 
saying most likely it was that
battleship<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:40.519> they<00:03:40.820> sold<00:03:41.120> yes<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.840> course

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
battleship that they sold yes of course

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.110 
battleship that they sold yes of course
that's<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.560> obvious<00:03:42.799> conclusion<00:03:43.489> but<00:03:43.880> last

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
that's the obvious conclusion but last

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.789 
that's the obvious conclusion but last
week<00:03:44.329> I<00:03:44.420> made<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.660> fury<00:03:45.079> staying<00:03:45.440> in<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.620> most

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
week I made a fury staying in it most

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.319 
week I made a fury staying in it most
likely<00:03:46.190> they<00:03:46.310> could<00:03:46.519> have<00:03:46.609> transformed<00:03:47.060> their

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
likely they could have transformed their

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.720 
likely they could have transformed their
broken<00:03:47.930> battleship<00:03:48.530> into<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:49.130> like<00:03:49.340> we

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
broken battleship into that like we

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.940 
broken battleship into that like we
don't<00:03:49.940> know<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.269> full<00:03:50.569> extent<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:51.260> all<00:03:51.620> denote

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
don't know the full extent of all denote

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.380 
don't know the full extent of all denote
we<00:03:52.130> don't<00:03:52.310> know<00:03:52.400> exactly<00:03:52.549> what<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.120> can<00:03:53.239> do<00:03:53.359> to

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
we don't know exactly what it can do to

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.199 
we don't know exactly what it can do to
mechanics<00:03:54.230> or<00:03:54.410> electronical<00:03:55.280> devices<00:03:55.609> and<00:03:56.000> so

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
mechanics or electronical devices and so

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.000 
mechanics or electronical devices and so
I<00:03:56.480> mean<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:56.989> thought<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:57.290> was<00:03:57.380> possible<00:03:57.560> that

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
I mean I thought it was possible that

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.349 
I mean I thought it was possible that
they<00:03:58.100> might<00:03:58.250> have<00:03:58.340> altered<00:03:58.730> their<00:03:58.880> battleship

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
they might have altered their battleship

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:00.430 
they might have altered their battleship
and<00:03:59.510> turn<00:03:59.660> it<00:03:59.780> into<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.109> floating

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
and turn it into that floating

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.660 
and turn it into that floating
battleship<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:00.890> I<00:04:00.980> fought<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.340> stuff<00:04:01.549> they

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
battleship and I fought the stuff they

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.430 
battleship and I fought the stuff they
sold<00:04:01.970> down<00:04:02.180> below<00:04:02.540> was<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.870> olden<00:04:03.350> no

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
sold down below was the olden no

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.229 
sold down below was the olden no
material<00:04:04.010> like<00:04:04.160> though<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.760> material

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
material like though the material

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.670 
material like though the material
minerals<00:04:05.630> or<00:04:05.750> whatever<00:04:05.959> it's<00:04:06.170> called<00:04:06.230> just

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
minerals or whatever it's called just

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.140 
minerals or whatever it's called just
old<00:04:06.889> and<00:04:07.040> I<00:04:07.100> thought<00:04:07.340> they<00:04:07.489> found<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:08.000> down

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
old and I thought they found it down

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.520 
old and I thought they found it down
there<00:04:08.359> when<00:04:08.450> they<00:04:08.510> said<00:04:08.690> what<00:04:08.840> was<00:04:09.049> that<00:04:09.170> so

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
there when they said what was that so

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.470 
there when they said what was that so
just<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:10.340> clear<00:04:10.489> that<00:04:10.670> all<00:04:10.760> up<00:04:10.940> if<00:04:11.120> anyone<00:04:11.299> was

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
just to clear that all up if anyone was

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.059 
just to clear that all up if anyone was
confused<00:04:11.840> my<00:04:11.989> last<00:04:12.230> review<00:04:12.500> when<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.680> mention

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
confused my last review when I mention

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.910 
confused my last review when I mention
that<00:04:13.100> so<00:04:13.790> anyways<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.510> episode<00:04:15.019> really

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
that so anyways the episode really

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.310 
that so anyways the episode really
really<00:04:16.400> impressive

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
really was impressive I enjoyed I mean I

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.780 
really was impressive I enjoyed I mean I
can't<00:04:20.680> believe<00:04:20.830> the<00:04:21.100> way<00:04:21.250> they<00:04:21.400> managed<00:04:21.730> to

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
can't believe the way they managed to

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.210 
can't believe the way they managed to
make<00:04:21.910> me<00:04:22.180> feel<00:04:22.390> bad<00:04:22.600> for<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:23.050> counts<00:04:23.650> in<00:04:23.770> this

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
make me feel bad for the counts in this

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.950 
make me feel bad for the counts in this
one<00:04:24.430> episode<00:04:24.610> I'm<00:04:25.000> starting<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.360> feel<00:04:25.510> bad<00:04:25.750> I

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
one episode I'm starting to feel bad I

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.720 
one episode I'm starting to feel bad I
saw<00:04:26.380> slaying<00:04:26.710> it<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:26.920> shit<00:04:27.130> beat<00:04:27.340> out<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.670> I'm

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
saw slaying it the shit beat out and I'm

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.980 
saw slaying it the shit beat out and I'm
spilling<00:04:28.210> out<00:04:28.300> for<00:04:28.450> him<00:04:28.570> analyst<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:28.930> they

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
spilling out for him analyst and they

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.570 
spilling out for him analyst and they
switch<00:04:29.200> over<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.440> talent<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:29.980> mean<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.400> felt

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
switch over to talent I mean you felt

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.490 
switch over to talent I mean you felt
like<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:30.940> pride<00:04:31.240> in<00:04:31.630> you<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:31.930> he<00:04:31.990> saw<00:04:32.170> you<00:04:32.380> know

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
like to pride in you and he saw you know

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.350 
like to pride in you and he saw you know
slaying<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:33.040> and<00:04:33.130> treated<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.820> then<00:04:34.090> the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
slaying it and treated and then the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.670 
slaying it and treated and then the
count<00:04:34.540> gets<00:04:34.780> killed<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.170> I<00:04:35.230> like<00:04:35.410> what<00:04:35.590> the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
count gets killed and I like what the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.420 
count gets killed and I like what the
fact<00:04:35.920> is<00:04:37.320> because<00:04:38.320> I<00:04:38.590> mean<00:04:38.740> right<00:04:39.010> there<00:04:39.220> at

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
fact is because I mean right there at

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.760 
fact is because I mean right there at
the<00:04:39.550> count<00:04:39.790> would<00:04:39.910> have<00:04:40.030> seceded<00:04:40.690> you<00:04:41.650> would

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
the count would have seceded you would

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.990 
the count would have seceded you would
have<00:04:41.860> had<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.160> toward<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.490> series<00:04:42.760> would<00:04:42.880> be

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
have had it toward the series would be

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.550 
have had it toward the series would be
over<00:04:43.300> think<00:04:43.540> about<00:04:43.690> this<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:43.990> mean<00:04:44.110> if<00:04:44.440> the

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
over think about this I mean if the

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.200 
over think about this I mean if the
count<00:04:44.800> would<00:04:44.980> have<00:04:45.130> succeeded<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:45.880> know

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
count would have succeeded and you know

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.080 
count would have succeeded and you know
told<00:04:46.510> United<00:04:47.140> Nations<00:04:47.530> about<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:48.010> know<00:04:48.160> the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
told United Nations about you know the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.520 
told United Nations about you know the
princess<00:04:49.540> like<00:04:49.870> that<00:04:50.020> let<00:04:50.140> us<00:04:50.260> know<00:04:50.350> where<00:04:50.470> the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
princess like that let us know where the

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.930 
princess like that let us know where the
princess<00:04:50.830> is<00:04:50.980> to<00:04:51.100> get<00:04:51.220> her<00:04:51.280> safe<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.670> all<00:04:51.730> that

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
princess is to get her safe and all that

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.560 
princess is to get her safe and all that
clearly<00:04:52.810> everything<00:04:53.770> worked<00:04:54.130> out<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.880> so

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
clearly everything worked out and so

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.720 
clearly everything worked out and so
from<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.170> episode<00:04:56.650> what<00:04:56.860> we<00:04:57.010> could<00:04:57.190> see<00:04:57.430> is

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
from this episode what we could see is

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.580 
from this episode what we could see is
is<00:04:58.180> that<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.540> count<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:59.080> we<00:04:59.200> fought<00:04:59.410> was

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
is that the count that we fought was

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.800 
is that the count that we fought was
probably<00:04:59.950> working<00:05:00.400> against<00:05:00.730> slain<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.480> the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
probably working against slain and the
