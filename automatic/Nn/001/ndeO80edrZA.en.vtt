all<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.200> potential<00:04:01.829> out<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.489> track<00:04:02.790> the

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
all the potential out of the track the

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.210 
all the potential out of the track the
song<00:04:03.450> could<00:04:03.870> have<00:04:03.959> been<00:04:04.049> my<00:04:04.200> love<00:04:04.470> take<00:04:05.010> that

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220

track<00:04:05.489> for<00:04:05.519> example<00:04:05.790> this<00:04:06.510> song's<00:04:06.900> chorus<00:04:07.440> is

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
track for example this song's chorus is

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.729 
track for example this song's chorus is
so<00:04:08.310> anemic<00:04:08.819> it's<00:04:09.389> like<00:04:09.599> the<00:04:10.019> musical

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
so anemic it's like the musical

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.370 
so anemic it's like the musical

seems<00:05:07.890> like<00:05:08.130> these<00:05:08.250> tracks<00:05:08.670> would<00:05:08.880> complement

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
seems like these tracks would complement

segues<00:05:15.150> between<00:05:15.600> each<00:05:15.870> track<00:05:16.260> are<00:05:16.530> really

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
segues between each track are really

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.500 
segues between each track are really
sloppy<00:05:17.070> and<00:05:17.460> not<00:05:17.490> only<00:05:17.670> that<00:05:17.790> but<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.180> second

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
sloppy and not only that but the second

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.570 
sloppy and not only that but the second
and<00:05:18.630> third<00:05:18.810> parts<00:05:19.110> of<00:05:19.440> this<00:05:19.950> song<00:05:20.190> the

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
and third parts of this song the

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.310 
and third parts of this song the
performances<00:05:21.240> are<00:05:21.360> so<00:05:21.540> loose<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:22.020> band

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
performances are so loose the band

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
doesn't even sound together on these

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.910 
doesn't even sound together on these
tracks<00:05:24.090> it's<00:05:24.300> like<00:05:24.390> listening<00:05:24.720> to<00:05:24.780> a<00:05:25.140> Velvet

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.650 
on this album it's not uncommon for a
band<00:06:01.260> to<00:06:01.800> put<00:06:02.430> out<00:06:02.580> a<00:06:02.610> record<00:06:02.850> that<00:06:03.030> I<00:06:03.090> love<00:06:03.390> or

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
band to put out a record that I love or

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.570 
band to put out a record that I love or
maybe<00:06:03.840> two<00:06:04.050> records<00:06:04.410> that<00:06:04.530> I<00:06:04.590> love<00:06:04.890> and<00:06:05.160> then

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
maybe two records that I love and then

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.460 
maybe two records that I love and then
all<00:06:05.760> of<00:06:05.790> a<00:06:05.970> sudden<00:06:06.240> out<00:06:06.450> of<00:06:06.480> the<00:06:06.690> blue<00:06:06.930> they

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
all of a sudden out of the blue they

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.500 
all of a sudden out of the blue they
drop<00:06:07.740> a<00:06:07.770> full-length<00:06:08.340> that<00:06:08.640> I<00:06:08.790> don't<00:06:09.150> love

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
drop a full-length that I don't love

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.040 
drop a full-length that I don't love
quite<00:06:10.200> as<00:06:10.410> much<00:06:10.860> it<00:06:11.400> happens<00:06:12.120> it's<00:06:12.450> not<00:06:12.750> a<00:06:12.780> big

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
quite as much it happens it's not a big

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.610 
quite as much it happens it's not a big
deal<00:06:13.350> but<00:06:13.920> rarely<00:06:14.730> is<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.620> disappointment

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
deal but rarely is the disappointment

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.240 
deal but rarely is the disappointment
this<00:06:17.570> stunning<00:06:18.570> though<00:06:19.020> not<00:06:19.590> to<00:06:19.800> say<00:06:20.010> this

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
this stunning though not to say this

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.520 
this stunning though not to say this
record<00:06:20.700> was<00:06:20.850> without<00:06:21.240> precedent<00:06:21.870> or<00:06:21.960> that<00:06:22.260> it

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
record was without precedent or that it

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.430 
record was without precedent or that it
couldn't<00:06:22.950> have<00:06:23.160> been<00:06:23.190> seen<00:06:23.760> I<00:06:24.060> mean<00:06:24.570> this<00:06:25.080> LP

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
couldn't have been seen I mean this LP

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.470 
couldn't have been seen I mean this LP
to<00:06:25.560> me<00:06:25.710> kind<00:06:25.950> of<00:06:26.010> feels<00:06:26.190> like<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.610> Jonathan

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
to me kind of feels like the Jonathan

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.310 
to me kind of feels like the Jonathan
Rado<00:06:27.750> album<00:06:28.350> with<00:06:28.980> just<00:06:29.340> way<00:06:29.730> more<00:06:30.020> runtime<00:06:31.020> I

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
Rado album with just way more runtime I

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.520 
Rado album with just way more runtime I
would<00:06:31.590> like<00:06:31.740> to<00:06:31.860> think<00:06:32.010> that<00:06:32.100> somewhere<00:06:32.760> in

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
would like to think that somewhere in

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.590 
would like to think that somewhere in
this<00:06:34.530> track<00:06:34.920> listing<00:06:35.550> there<00:06:35.970> is<00:06:36.150> a<00:06:36.180> pretty

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
this track listing there is a pretty

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.740 
this track listing there is a pretty
good<00:06:37.290> EP<00:06:38.160> something<00:06:38.850> that<00:06:39.000> after<00:06:39.240> I<00:06:39.450> list

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
good EP something that after I list

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.130 
good EP something that after I list
-<00:06:39.900> I<00:06:39.930> would<00:06:40.260> think<00:06:40.290> okay<00:06:40.920> that<00:06:41.490> was<00:06:41.580> alright

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
- I would think okay that was alright

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.140 
- I would think okay that was alright
hopefully<00:06:43.140> there's<00:06:43.800> a<00:06:43.920> better<00:06:44.370> album<00:06:44.700> in<00:06:45.060> the

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
hopefully there's a better album in the

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.610 
hopefully there's a better album in the
future<00:06:45.480> however<00:06:45.870> I<00:06:45.960> can't<00:06:46.320> have<00:06:46.500> that

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
future however I can't have that

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.590 
future however I can't have that
reaction<00:06:46.980> here<00:06:47.280> that<00:06:47.430> would<00:06:47.550> be<00:06:47.640> to<00:06:47.790> ignore

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
reaction here that would be to ignore

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.330 
reaction here that would be to ignore
all<00:06:48.900> of<00:06:49.380> the<00:06:49.530> awful<00:06:50.960> non-essential<00:06:51.960> and

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
all of the awful non-essential and

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.160 
all of the awful non-essential and
completely<00:06:53.340> pointless<00:06:53.790> tracks<00:06:54.420> in<00:06:54.720> this

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.170 
completely pointless tracks in this

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.230 
completely pointless tracks in this
track<00:06:55.530> listing<00:06:55.980> which<00:06:56.160> just<00:06:56.460> really<00:06:56.790> make<00:06:57.000> up

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
track listing which just really make up

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.720 
track listing which just really make up
