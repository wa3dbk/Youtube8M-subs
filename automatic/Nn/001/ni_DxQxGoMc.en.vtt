go we're gonna start on the lowest

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.509 
go we're gonna start on the lowest
string<00:00:12.870> which<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.230> our<00:00:13.440> E<00:00:13.590> string<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
string which is our E string this is the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.000 
string which is our E string this is the
thickest<00:00:15.000> one<00:00:15.179> that's<00:00:15.420> closest<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.900> me<00:00:16.080> and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
thickest one that's closest to me and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.160 
thickest one that's closest to me and
I'm<00:00:17.100> going<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> take<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.490> pick<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.960> on<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
I'm going to take the pick and on the

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.060 
I'm going to take the pick and on the
tip<00:00:19.410> I'm<00:00:20.090> going<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.300> pluck<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.769> going

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
tip I'm going to pluck it and I'm going

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.359 
tip I'm going to pluck it and I'm going
to<00:00:23.100> rest<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.180> next<00:00:24.600> guitar<00:00:25.170> string<00:00:25.529> so

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
to rest on the next guitar string so

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.710 
to rest on the next guitar string so
like<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:28.699> see<00:00:29.699> how<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:29.880> resting<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.570> this

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
like this see how I'm resting on this

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.959 
like this see how I'm resting on this
next<00:00:30.960> string<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:32.130> I'm<00:00:32.219> not<00:00:32.369> playing<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.910> I'm

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
next string but I'm not playing it I'm

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.420 
next string but I'm not playing it I'm
just<00:00:33.090> resting<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.260> allowing<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.250> low<00:00:35.399> E

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
just resting and it's allowing the low E

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
just resting and it's allowing the low E
to<00:00:36.649> keep<00:00:37.649> ringing<00:00:38.480> that's<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.719> best<00:00:39.960> way<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
to keep ringing that's the best way to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:52.620 
to keep ringing that's the best way to
pluck<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.670> keep<00:00:41.790> doing<00:00:42.059> that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.049 

and<00:00:53.630> you'll<00:00:53.989> see<00:00:54.200> beginners<00:00:54.710> sometimes<00:00:55.489> when

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
and you'll see beginners sometimes when

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.569 
and you'll see beginners sometimes when
they<00:00:56.149> pick<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.480> string<00:00:57.220> they're<00:00:58.220> afraid<00:00:58.460> to

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
they pick the string they're afraid to

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.189 
they pick the string they're afraid to
hit<00:00:58.790> this<00:00:58.910> next<00:00:59.210> string<00:00:59.420> so<00:00:59.600> they'll<00:00:59.809> just<00:01:00.050> hit

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
hit this next string so they'll just hit

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.170 
hit this next string so they'll just hit
the<00:01:00.350> very<00:01:00.590> little<00:01:01.070> bit<00:01:01.340> and<00:01:01.760> they'll<00:01:01.970> kind<00:01:02.090> of

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
the very little bit and they'll kind of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.420 
the very little bit and they'll kind of
pull<00:01:02.360> away<00:01:02.470> but<00:01:03.470> it's<00:01:03.590> such<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.710> timid<00:01:04.070> sound

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
pull away but it's such a timid sound

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.030 
pull away but it's such a timid sound
compared<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:05.119> you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.180 

so<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:09.330> okay<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.930> land<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.620> next<00:01:10.830> train

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
so it's okay to land on this next train

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.440 
so it's okay to land on this next train
I'd<00:01:11.280> even<00:01:11.400> think<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> next<00:01:12.060> string<00:01:12.300> as<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
I'd even think of the next string as a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.140 
I'd even think of the next string as a
landing<00:01:12.900> point<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.970> hold<00:01:15.300> it<00:01:15.450> down<00:01:16.070> and

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
landing point so you hold it down and

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.490 
landing point so you hold it down and
then<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.390> lands<00:01:18.660> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> next<00:01:19.260> string

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
then it just lands on the next string

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.580 
then it just lands on the next string
and<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.310> that's<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.580> basic<00:01:20.700> down<00:01:21.090> stroke<00:01:21.590> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and so that's a basic down stroke and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.320 
and so that's a basic down stroke and
I'm<00:01:22.740> letting<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.670> pick<00:01:24.680> given<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.770> little

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
I'm letting the pick given a little

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.810 
I'm letting the pick given a little
little<00:01:27.330> relaxation<00:01:28.160> I'm<00:01:29.160> not<00:01:29.340> too<00:01:29.580> firm

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
little relaxation I'm not too firm

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.660 
little relaxation I'm not too firm
otherwise<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:32.070> don't<00:01:32.130> wanna<00:01:32.310> hit<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.460> too

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
otherwise you don't wanna hit it too

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.340 
otherwise you don't wanna hit it too
hard<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.390> don't<00:01:33.510> want<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> hold<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.050> to<00:01:34.080> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
hard and you don't want to hold on to it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.100 
hard and you don't want to hold on to it
too<00:01:34.530> slightly<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:37.470> somewhere<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.830> between<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
too slightly so somewhere in between a

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
too slightly so somewhere in between a
little<00:01:40.110> tip<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:42.090> tilt<00:01:42.920> tilt<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
little tip is that you can tilt tilt the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.740 
little tip is that you can tilt tilt the
pick<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.090> little<00:01:45.450> bit<00:01:45.660> out<00:01:45.870> of<00:01:45.990> angle<00:01:47.750> it's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
pick just a little bit out of angle it's

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.310 
pick just a little bit out of angle it's
easier<00:01:49.170> rather<00:01:49.560> than<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:50.010> flat<00:01:50.310> on

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
easier rather than going flat on

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.359 
easier rather than going flat on
which<00:01:52.860> still<00:01:53.160> sounds<00:01:53.550> good<00:01:53.840> but

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
which still sounds good but

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.730 
which still sounds good but
do<00:01:55.939> that<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:56.539> that's<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.750> basic<00:01:57.109> downstroke

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
do that so that's the basic downstroke

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.730 
do that so that's the basic downstroke
on<00:01:58.189> picking<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.759> string<00:01:59.090> in<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.840> upstroke<00:02:00.350> is

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
on picking a string in the upstroke is

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.740 
on picking a string in the upstroke is
just<00:02:00.979> going<00:02:01.159> back<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.820> I'm<00:02:02.210> gonna<00:02:02.329> kind<00:02:02.689> of

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
just going back and I'm gonna kind of

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.550 
just going back and I'm gonna kind of
tilt<00:02:02.960> my<00:02:03.109> wrist<00:02:03.409> down<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.130> little<00:02:04.369> bit

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
tilt my wrist down a little bit

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.440 
tilt my wrist down a little bit
same<00:02:06.560> thing<00:02:06.799> where<00:02:06.979> I'm<00:02:07.069> landing<00:02:07.429> on<00:02:07.549> strings

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.899 

and<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.599> is<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.930> basic<00:02:12.439> upstroke<00:02:13.430> and

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
and that is the basic upstroke and

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:39.580 
and that is the basic upstroke and
that's<00:02:14.209> how<00:02:14.359> you<00:02:14.420> pick<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.959> guitar<00:02:15.319> string

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.650 

you
