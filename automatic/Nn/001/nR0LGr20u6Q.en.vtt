00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Guyed speech on the chip fold 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.350
 hence who said felipe and today is day of 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.760
 news then you already know leave your 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.040
 player you to help in the disclosure 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.660
 channel and share on networks 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.360
 so you help me 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.600
 immensely without further ado sits there 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.949
 because it will start one more and the big nils 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.410
 beginning with news that left 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.869
 duelists somewhat confused 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.080
 was a new tournament format released 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.810
 by the konami that will be put in beta no and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.630
 from Chicago of that year and the name 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.850
 format is bad the goal initially this 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.079
 format has almost nothing different 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.870
 of others 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.600
 however its peculiarity is that if the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.510
 list can only make three 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.870
 calls for this same turn three 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.600
 one being their normal or sexual 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.840
 or also taxes normally ulan as 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.420
 has always been made after only one 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.629
 to the moods of the extra deck be it 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.660
 by synchro these yarns of wool or any 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.270
 another thing but only one of the extra deck 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.490
 and finally only one species to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.799
 humans other than the extra deck or 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.740
 whether it be a species above your 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.049
 graveyard from your deck in your hand and it's worth 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.790
 remember to learn your account as 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.610
 vocation 2 and 3 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.920
 at the same time I particularly liked 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.320
 enough of this format I intend to bring 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.570
 some videos explaining it better here 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.860
 in the channel and using it effectively 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.720
 some duels 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.430
 but for those who cared 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.590
 thinking that this new format will 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.579
 dominate the meta game can be 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.560
 tranquil 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.570
 it's just an experiment the konami does not want 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.729
 say that this format will be the official 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.159
 from now on but I thought it was fine 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.470
 interesting this yes then we only have 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.290
 sit and wait what will be your 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.509
 repercussions in the last two years 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.780
 had announced new media for the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.780
 ideals and today is divine was no different 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.560
 as one more support was revealed for 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.530
 cool 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.020
 titled in the return of hadise it is a 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.939
 continuous tripping and has invocation effects 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.640
 especially of normal monsters of the type 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.129
 dragon and radars and talking about 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.940
 other news last week I had 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.160
 announced 9 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.470
 the letters that would appear in the new 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.450
 gold premium collection return dublin and 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.540
 this week another seven of them were 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.740
 announced and they are from unerj magician 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.870
 astro medical team forces kaymakan 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.840
 math is silva wolf in charlotte and 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.600
 copy 6 and by speaking in letters 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.970
 revealed letters from the 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.700
 archetype in having means that seemingly 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.700
 an archetype of the character denis maxwill 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.260
 iof the do not ask me who I 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.780
 I never watched but anyway. 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.230
 and these letters are in having media means 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.530
 grand enter reader month and a rejoinder 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.260
 called click box and the house of the week is the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.530
 newly revealed if a few needle off 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.890
 and water attribute level 3 of the type if the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.500
 Serpent is normal but one more 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.710
 pendulum has an attack of 200 and 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.680
 defense of 2,100 and its scale is 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.810
 7 as I said it is normal or not 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.140
 effect of another but its effect 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.540
 pendulum is simply fantastic see 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.489
 because when the monster is destroyed by 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.459
 battle you can make the invocation 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.890
 special of a normal monster in your hand 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.590
 and you can only use this is done a 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.410
 time per shift seems like a simple effect 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.900
 but that will help a lot of decks as the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.750
 own with it and ancient archetypes 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.030
 like my darling, same as and together 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.610
 with this letter was also announced in 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.800
 playmate from the collection crossetti shows that 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.709
 by the way is pretty much the stamping 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.170
 this clearwire 5 andrÃ© gum and the question 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.930
 of the week the best to have more to order 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.269
 of the week is rafael rodrigues and in his 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.300
 comment he asks me to talk about 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.910
 the effect of soph as it was 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.760
 many players are calling on her to 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.070
 wrong way in the net work and activating 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.350
 its effect erroneously also because of this 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.690
 he says he prefers pro reu also to 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.880
 people go through much less headache 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.360
 but it does not mean that you do not have 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.580
 bugs etc at last we will effect her anyway 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.979
 when he speaks sofia 'I imagine that 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.289
 Be nekrasov silvia well let's go 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.810
 explain then according to the effect of it 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.139
 you can only do the south ritual in this 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.960
 House 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.900
 I have a letter of ritual necrosis and 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.270
 it can only be safe ritual is yours. 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.020
 hand or are using your hand 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.960
 three monsters that you control colt pus 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.629
 different ones or to invoke you alone 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.120
 can tax a monster of the type and 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.650
 kester another type of dragon and another 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.259
 type machine then making the combination 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.999
 of three different types not clear 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.189
 necessarily need to be these 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.529
 three types but they have to be 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:58.110
 necessarily different and it does not 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.580
 can be relied on in particular by 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.900
 other ways 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.629
 now we go to its side effect 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.569
 during the turn of any player in the 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:09.449
 your mother did and 1 you can discard this 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.550
 letter and any other necrosis magic and 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.250
 during this turn your opponent does not 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.879
 can make a special extra song 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.370
 tech 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.930
 In addition we have a tertiary effect that 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.779
 I'll explain now what's next. 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.999
 when this card is invoked by ritual 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:26.759
 You can ban all other cards. 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:28.979
 in the field and in the cemeteries and night 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.919
 you activate this effect you can not 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.860
 make no norm or sex in one or 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.680

 I also hope to have spoken of the 

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:44.430
