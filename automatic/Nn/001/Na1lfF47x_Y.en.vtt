00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.220 
committed to it where else not gonna lay
on<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.800> board<00:00:17.039> first<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.609> all<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.230> you're

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
on the board first of all and you're

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.660 
on the board first of all and you're
probably<00:00:19.320> get<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> good<00:00:19.980> like<00:00:20.160> hitting<00:00:20.640> your

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
probably get a good like hitting your

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.390 
probably get a good like hitting your
shin<00:00:21.029> which<00:00:21.390> isn't<00:00:21.600> great<00:00:21.920> okay<00:00:22.920> second<00:00:23.310> thing

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
shin which isn't great okay second thing

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.460 
shin which isn't great okay second thing
is<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.939> think<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.390> learning<00:00:24.539> fakie<00:00:25.170> like

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
is that I think that learning fakie like

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.320 
is that I think that learning fakie like
spin<00:00:25.980> tricks<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:27.529> tre<00:00:28.529> flips<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.150> 360<00:00:30.150> it's

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
spin tricks like tre flips and 360 it's

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.680 
spin tricks like tre flips and 360 it's
much<00:00:30.779> easier<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:31.560> because<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.189> way<00:00:32.690> you

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
much easier just because of the way you

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.319 
much easier just because of the way you
throw<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.559> there<00:00:34.770> let<00:00:35.700> me<00:00:35.760> show<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:38.270> in<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
throw it out there let me show you in a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.110 
throw it out there let me show you in a
regular<00:00:40.010> 36<00:00:41.010> each<00:00:41.070> other<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.790> to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
regular 36 each other see it you have to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.860 
regular 36 each other see it you have to
kinda<00:00:42.329> pop<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:43.829> bit<00:00:43.980> or<00:00:44.160> throw<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.000> so

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
kinda pop it a little bit or throw it so

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.450 
kinda pop it a little bit or throw it so
the<00:00:46.050> tail<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.469> rotate<00:00:46.770> around<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.160> front<00:00:47.280> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
the tail can rotate around in front of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.720 
the tail can rotate around in front of
it<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:48.410> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.559> literally<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:49.950> pivot<00:00:50.550> them

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it you you can literally just pivot them

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.689 
it you you can literally just pivot them
out<00:00:51.590> just<00:00:52.590> pivot<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.100> out<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.520> it'll<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:55.699> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
out just pivot it out and it'll go you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.950 
out just pivot it out and it'll go you
got<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.300> lock<00:00:58.190> okay<00:00:59.270> one<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> main<00:01:00.600> step

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
got it on lock okay one of the main step

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.420 
got it on lock okay one of the main step

only need to know cuz throw the switch

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.210 
only need to know cuz throw the switch
trick<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.700> least<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.439> figis<00:01:16.439> majorly

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
trick but not least and figis majorly

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.170 
cuz they they'll teach you how to do a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
little pivot a little bit of paper out

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.940 
little pivot a little bit of paper out
there<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.689> lot<00:01:22.350> easier<00:01:22.590> then<00:01:23.450> actually<00:01:24.450> just

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
there a lot easier then actually just

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.899 
there a lot easier then actually just
throwing<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.040> out<00:01:27.920> okay<00:01:28.920> troubleshooting

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
throwing it out okay troubleshooting

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.300 
throwing it out okay troubleshooting
with<00:01:30.000> these<00:01:30.270> trips<00:01:30.659> i<00:01:30.930> would<00:01:31.380> say<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.890> when

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
with these trips i would say that when

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.990 
with these trips i would say that when
the<00:01:32.340> main<00:01:32.610> trouble<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.930> board<00:01:34.140> will<00:01:34.290> go

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
the main trouble is the board will go

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.069 
the main trouble is the board will go
flying<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.329> front<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.780> try<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
flying out in front and when you try and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.310 
flying out in front and when you try and
do<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.229> trick<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:38.430> cuz<00:01:38.729> either<00:01:39.659> you're

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
do this trick that's cuz either you're

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.560 
do this trick that's cuz either you're
not<00:01:41.040> pivoting<00:01:41.579> enough<00:01:41.850> or<00:01:42.180> you're<00:01:42.420> not

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
not pivoting enough or you're not

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.480 
not pivoting enough or you're not
turning<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:44.040> stand<00:01:44.280> with

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
turning up there now little stand with

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.600 
turning up there now little stand with
you<00:01:45.020> pretty<00:01:46.020> much<00:01:46.110> when<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.590> started<00:01:46.890> out<00:01:47.009> are

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
you pretty much when you started out are

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.830 
you pretty much when you started out are
always<00:01:47.820> gonna<00:01:47.939> go<00:01:48.060> find<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.479> front<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.780> you

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
always gonna go find out in front of you

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.990 
always gonna go find out in front of you
and<00:01:49.079> physically<00:01:50.009> your<00:01:50.159> job<00:01:50.369> kind<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.670> jump<00:01:50.880> out

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and physically your job kind of jump out

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.030 
and physically your job kind of jump out
there<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.210> land<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.799> if<00:01:52.799> you're<00:01:52.979> not

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
there and land on if you're not

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.380 
there and land on if you're not
committed<00:01:53.460> enough<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.729> actually<00:01:53.850> jump<00:01:54.210> out

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
committed enough to actually jump out

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.649 
committed enough to actually jump out
there<00:01:54.570> maybe<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.619> okay<00:01:56.340> boom<00:01:57.030> turn<00:01:57.509> out

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
there maybe it's like okay boom turn out

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.709 
there maybe it's like okay boom turn out

tracks a little more and if i get it i

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.550 
tracks a little more and if i get it i
like<00:02:06.810> SLO<00:02:07.110> fakie<00:02:07.500> lot<00:02:08.429> easier

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
like SLO fakie lot easier
