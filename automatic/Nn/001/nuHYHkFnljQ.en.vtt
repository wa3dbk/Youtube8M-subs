greenie<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:02.139> middle<00:03:02.500> but<00:03:02.739> most<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.549> is

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
greenie in the middle but most of it is

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.140 
greenie in the middle but most of it is
the<00:03:03.760> yeast<00:03:04.269> it<00:03:04.870> was<00:03:05.019> like<00:03:05.230> right<00:03:05.470> up<00:03:05.620> front

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
the yeast it was like right up front

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.990 
the yeast it was like right up front
it's<00:03:07.150> it's<00:03:07.599> sweet<00:03:08.079> but<00:03:08.379> not<00:03:08.530> like<00:03:09.069> cloyingly

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
it's it's sweet but not like cloyingly

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.509 
it's it's sweet but not like cloyingly
sweet<00:03:10.150> right<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.049> has<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.230> definite<00:03:12.069> Belgian

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
sweet right it has a definite Belgian

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.420 
sweet right it has a definite Belgian
characteristics<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.720> yeast<00:03:14.079> but<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.099> also<00:03:15.250> I

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
characteristics that yeast but it also I

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.800 
characteristics that yeast but it also I
don't<00:03:15.639> think<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.879> yeast<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.269> overpowering

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
don't think the yeast is overpowering

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.910 
don't think the yeast is overpowering
because<00:03:16.930> some<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.319> Belgian<00:03:17.620> beers<00:03:17.799> I

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
because some of the Belgian beers I

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.500 
because some of the Belgian beers I
drink<00:03:18.129> I<00:03:18.250> just<00:03:18.280> think<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.819> yeast<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.269> just<00:03:19.420> too

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
drink I just think the yeast is just too

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.479 
drink I just think the yeast is just too
much<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.019> taste<00:03:20.349> in<00:03:20.560> there<00:03:20.709> but<00:03:21.220> I<00:03:21.280> think

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
much so that taste in there but I think

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.729 
much so that taste in there but I think
this<00:03:21.639> hits<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.239> pretty<00:03:22.450> well<00:03:22.690> or<00:03:22.989> some<00:03:23.170> dark

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
this hits it pretty well or some dark

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.649 
this hits it pretty well or some dark
fruit<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.220> there<00:03:24.370> yes<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:25.180> got<00:03:25.329> a<00:03:25.389> lot<00:03:25.629> of

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
fruit in there yes it's got a lot of

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.599 
fruit in there yes it's got a lot of
complexity<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.349> it<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:26.799> think<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.519> know

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
complexity to it and I think you know

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.550 
complexity to it and I think you know
we'll<00:03:27.790> let<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:27.970> warm<00:03:28.180> up<00:03:28.389> and<00:03:28.629> kind<00:03:29.349> of<00:03:29.379> see

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
we'll let it warm up and kind of see

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.289 
we'll let it warm up and kind of see
where<00:03:29.709> it<00:03:29.859> goes<00:03:29.980> from<00:03:30.040> there<00:03:30.370> but<00:03:30.699> I<00:03:30.910> think

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
where it goes from there but I think

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.900 
where it goes from there but I think
definitely<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:32.010> pretty<00:03:33.010> good<00:03:33.190> beer<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.519> far<00:03:33.730> oh

fruits are you getting a lot of triples
and<00:04:23.110> doubles<00:04:23.620> not<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:26.290> it's<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.590> yeast<00:04:26.770> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
and doubles not and it's the yeast the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.430 
and doubles not and it's the yeast the
yeast<00:04:27.100> is<00:04:27.460> very<00:04:27.640> powdery<00:04:27.910> like<00:04:28.570> but<00:04:28.840> that's<00:04:29.020> I

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
yeast is very powdery like but that's I

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.530 
yeast is very powdery like but that's I
get<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.460> in<00:04:30.580> pretty<00:04:30.730> much<00:04:30.790> every<00:04:31.150> bud<00:04:31.300> when<00:04:31.480> I

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
get that in pretty much every bud when I

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.600 
get that in pretty much every bud when I
drink<00:04:31.750> so<00:04:32.020> right<00:04:32.350> and<00:04:32.590> I<00:04:32.650> think<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:33.100> it<00:04:33.340> like

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
drink so right and I think that it like

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.120 
drink so right and I think that it like
I<00:04:33.700> said<00:04:33.880> it's<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.090> little<00:04:34.419> bit<00:04:34.540> dry<00:04:34.780> not<00:04:35.650> overly

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
I said it's a little bit dry not overly

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.130 
I said it's a little bit dry not overly
dry<00:04:36.370> but<00:04:36.610> it's<00:04:36.760> definitely<00:04:36.910> very<00:04:37.360> carbonated

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
dry but it's definitely very carbonated

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.560 
dry but it's definitely very carbonated
and<00:04:38.980> I<00:04:39.310> think<00:04:39.550> it's<00:04:39.669> pleasing<00:04:40.060> on<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.180> palate

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
and I think it's pleasing on the palate

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.210 
and I think it's pleasing on the palate
it<00:04:40.690> goes<00:04:40.810> down<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.470> know<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:41.590> think<00:04:41.740> it's<00:04:42.010> it's

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
it goes down you know I think it's it's

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.710 
it goes down you know I think it's it's
not<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.669> wouldn't<00:04:42.910> say<00:04:42.970> it's<00:04:43.090> easy<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.479> drink

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
not I wouldn't say it's easy to drink

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.280 
not I wouldn't say it's easy to drink
but<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.290> think<00:04:44.590> it's<00:04:44.890> for<00:04:45.370> an<00:04:45.700> 8%<00:04:46.419> 8%<00:04:46.510> I<00:04:47.020> think<00:04:47.229> I

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
but I think it's for an 8% 8% I think I

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
on the palate I don't think the flavors

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.190 
on the palate I don't think the flavors
are<00:05:15.190> in<00:05:15.820> your<00:05:16.090> face<00:05:16.270> blowing<00:05:16.540> you<00:05:16.720> away<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:17.110> I

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
don't think that's what they're going

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.040 
don't think that's what they're going
for<00:05:18.340> in<00:05:18.580> this<00:05:18.669> beer<00:05:18.850> I<00:05:18.910> think<00:05:18.940> no<00:05:19.150> I'm<00:05:19.360> solid

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
for in this beer I think no I'm solid

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.480 
for in this beer I think no I'm solid
drinking<00:05:20.410> here<00:05:20.650> with<00:05:20.830> some<00:05:20.979> good<00:05:21.100> flavors<00:05:21.430> I

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
drinking here with some good flavors I

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.219 
drinking here with some good flavors I
think<00:05:21.669> they<00:05:21.760> really<00:05:22.030> made<00:05:22.270> one<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.810> was<00:05:22.930> just

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
think they really made one that was just

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.260 
think they really made one that was just
a<00:05:23.440> step<00:05:23.680> up<00:05:23.860> from<00:05:24.040> the<00:05:24.220> red<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.700> mean<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.060> Reds

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
a step up from the red I mean the Reds

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.140 
a step up from the red I mean the Reds
good<00:05:25.600> beer<00:05:25.780> on<00:05:25.990> its<00:05:26.140> own<00:05:26.320> but<00:05:26.650> I<00:05:26.970> really<00:05:27.970> think

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
good beer on its own but I really think

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.790 
good beer on its own but I really think
the<00:05:28.270> white<00:05:28.450> they<00:05:28.690> they<00:05:29.050> just<00:05:29.260> wanted<00:05:29.470> to<00:05:29.560> say

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
the white they they just wanted to say

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.190 
the white they they just wanted to say
hey<00:05:29.979> let's<00:05:30.430> let's<00:05:30.850> up<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.180> flavor<00:05:31.419> a<00:05:31.810> little

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
hey let's let's up the flavor a little

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.770 
hey let's let's up the flavor a little
bit<00:05:32.320> more<00:05:32.530> without<00:05:33.310> making<00:05:33.970> it<00:05:34.090> ridiculous

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
bit more without making it ridiculous

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.170 
bit more without making it ridiculous
and<00:05:35.020> I<00:05:35.680> mean<00:05:36.130> if<00:05:36.310> that's<00:05:36.790> what<00:05:37.000> they<00:05:37.120> were

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
and I mean if that's what they were

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.969 
and I mean if that's what they were
going<00:05:37.360> for<00:05:37.450> it<00:05:37.750> when<00:05:37.930> they<00:05:38.290> do<00:05:38.350> a<00:05:38.440> good<00:05:38.590> idea

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
going for it when they do a good idea

disagree<00:05:54.340> on<00:05:54.370> but<00:05:54.760> I<00:05:54.790> think<00:05:54.910> I<00:05:55.210> honestly<00:05:55.540> think

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
disagree on but I think I honestly think

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.350 
disagree on but I think I honestly think
our<00:05:55.840> tastes<00:05:56.440> are<00:05:56.620> pretty<00:05:56.860> similar<00:05:57.100> so<00:05:57.280> yeah<00:05:57.639> I

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
our tastes are pretty similar so yeah I

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.390 
our tastes are pretty similar so yeah I
think<00:05:58.630> you<00:05:58.870> get<00:05:59.050> a<00:05:59.080> different<00:05:59.500> aspect<00:06:00.100> from

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
think you get a different aspect from

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.220 
think you get a different aspect from
having<00:06:00.730> you<00:06:00.820> here<00:06:01.030> you<00:06:01.389> know<00:06:01.480> just<00:06:01.720> me<00:06:01.930> I<00:06:01.960> think

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
having you here you know just me I think

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.870 
having you here you know just me I think
we<00:06:02.410> have<00:06:02.560> different<00:06:02.710> different<00:06:03.520> tastes<00:06:03.669> so<00:06:03.760> we

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
we have different different tastes so we

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.490 
we have different different tastes so we
get<00:06:04.000> in<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:04.150> beer<00:06:04.300> but<00:06:04.450> I<00:06:04.510> think<00:06:04.660> overall<00:06:04.990> yeah

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
get in the beer but I think overall yeah

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.110 
get in the beer but I think overall yeah
you<00:06:05.710> know<00:06:05.800> our<00:06:05.950> stars<00:06:06.280> our<00:06:06.610> likes<00:06:06.850> are<00:06:07.030> the
