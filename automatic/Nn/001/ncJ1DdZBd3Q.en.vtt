00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
this over a sort of sandy color and then

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.970 
this over a sort of sandy color and then
more<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:29.209> very<00:03:29.450> pale<00:03:30.079> gray<00:03:30.470> on<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.769> back

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.949 
more of this very pale gray on the back
just<00:03:31.430> gives<00:03:31.609> a<00:03:31.670> nice<00:03:31.820> off<00:03:32.030> contrast<00:03:32.570> all<00:03:32.750> over

just gives a nice off contrast all over

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.319 
just gives a nice off contrast all over
the<00:03:33.049> body<00:03:33.200> in<00:03:33.769> terms<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.220> Emma's<00:03:34.549> articulation

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
the body in terms of Emma's articulation

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.380 
the body in terms of Emma's articulation
you<00:03:35.450> can<00:03:35.660> turn<00:03:35.870> her<00:03:36.109> head<00:03:36.350> one<00:03:36.650> way<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:38.030> the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
you can turn her head one way and the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.580 
you can turn her head one way and the
other<00:03:38.570> way<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:40.280> arms<00:03:40.700> do<00:03:41.600> rotate<00:03:42.109> but<00:03:42.380> they're

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
other way the arms do rotate but they're

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.349 
other way the arms do rotate but they're
loose<00:03:42.890> because<00:03:43.370> they're<00:03:43.579> part<00:03:43.880> of<00:03:44.150> the

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
loose because they're part of the

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.660 
loose because they're part of the
gimmick<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:46.010> although<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.280> can<00:03:46.519> rotate

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
gimmick and so although you can rotate

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.479 
gimmick and so although you can rotate
them<00:03:47.090> they<00:03:47.510> are<00:03:47.660> linked<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.100> windup

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
them they are linked to the windup

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.699 
them they are linked to the windup
system<00:03:50.030> okay<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:50.690> let's<00:03:51.049> have<00:03:51.109> a<00:03:51.290> look<00:03:51.470> at<00:03:51.590> this

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
system okay so let's have a look at this

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.520 
system okay so let's have a look at this
lemur<00:03:51.980> I'm<00:03:52.730> just<00:03:52.940> going<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.209> snip<00:03:54.049> off<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.290> end

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
lemur I'm just going to snip off the end

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:02.130 
lemur I'm just going to snip off the end
of<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.709> bag<00:03:55.010> here

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.430 

so<00:04:03.140> here<00:04:03.620> is<00:04:03.740> the<00:04:03.920> lemur<00:04:04.130> out<00:04:04.430> of<00:04:04.730> his<00:04:05.440> plastic

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
so here is the lemur out of his plastic

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.680 
so here is the lemur out of his plastic
bag<00:04:06.710> very<00:04:07.040> nicely<00:04:07.340> painted<00:04:07.730> knife<00:04:08.210> detailed

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
bag very nicely painted knife detailed

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.440 
bag very nicely painted knife detailed
eyes<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.490> think<00:04:10.760> we<00:04:10.880> have<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.030> little<00:04:11.240> bit<00:04:11.420> of

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
eyes and I think we have a little bit of

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.500 
eyes and I think we have a little bit of

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
articulation now only the head is

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.199 
articulation now only the head is
articulated<00:04:15.320> so<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.620> can<00:04:15.830> turn<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.280> head<00:04:16.459> can

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
articulated so you can turn the head can

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.610 
articulated so you can turn the head can
you<00:04:17.299> turn<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.660> arm<00:04:17.810> so<00:04:18.049> yeah<00:04:18.230> you<00:04:18.290> can<00:04:18.500> turn
