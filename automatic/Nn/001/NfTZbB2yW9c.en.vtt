program<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.780> if<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.260> want<00:02:26.409> to<00:02:26.439> use<00:02:26.500> my<00:02:26.769> finger<00:02:27.129> I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
program so if I want to use my finger I

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.649 
program so if I want to use my finger I
can<00:02:27.909> simply<00:02:28.629> draw<00:02:28.810> on<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.019> screen<00:02:30.540> with<00:02:31.540> the

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
can simply draw on the screen with the

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.470 
can simply draw on the screen with the
stylus<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:34.569> do<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:34.780> same<00:02:34.959> now<00:02:36.330> with<00:02:37.330> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
stylus I can do the same now with the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.870 
stylus I can do the same now with the
finger<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.410> touch<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.800> very<00:02:39.069> very<00:02:39.400> light<00:02:39.670> you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
finger the touch is very very light you

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.590 
finger the touch is very very light you
hardly<00:02:40.180> have<00:02:40.330> to

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
hardly have to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.740 
hardly have to
the<00:02:40.690> screen<00:02:40.960> with<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.560> stylus<00:02:41.920> if<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:43.600> touch

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
the screen with the stylus if you touch

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.270 
the screen with the stylus if you touch
too<00:02:44.050> light<00:02:45.510> okay<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:47.110> just<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.440> just<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.070> prove

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
too light okay and just to just to prove

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.220 
too light okay and just to just to prove
that<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.570> actually<00:02:49.840> touching<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
that I that is actually touching the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.460 
that I that is actually touching the
screen<00:02:51.600> okay<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.840> actually<00:02:52.990> touching<00:02:53.380> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
screen okay it is actually touching the

screen okay it is actually touching the
screen<00:02:53.710> there<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.310> can<00:02:54.400> see<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.670> you

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
screen there and you can see that you

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.690 
screen there and you can see that you
need<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.690> put<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.900> little<00:02:56.290> bit<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:56.950> pressure<00:02:57.310> a

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
need to put a little bit of pressure a

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.180 
need to put a little bit of pressure a
little<00:02:58.540> bit<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.840> pressure<00:02:59.080> on<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.800> stylus

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
little bit of pressure on the stylus

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.610 
little bit of pressure on the stylus
itself<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:02.080> get<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.350> results<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.350> just

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
itself to to get the results if I just

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.370 
itself to to get the results if I just
undo<00:03:06.250> all<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.720> i'm<00:03:07.720> going<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.930> right<00:03:08.080> kind<00:03:08.290> of

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
undo all that i'm going to right kind of

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.610 
undo all that i'm going to right kind of
sideways<00:03:08.590> just<00:03:09.070> if<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:10.060> try<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.360> write<00:03:10.660> with<00:03:11.080> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
sideways just if I try to write with the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.220 
sideways just if I try to write with the
stylus<00:03:11.950> as<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.150> can<00:03:13.300> see<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.660> didn't<00:03:13.960> pick<00:03:14.080> up

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
stylus as you can see it didn't pick up

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.880 
stylus as you can see it didn't pick up
the<00:03:14.410> middle<00:03:14.800> of<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:14.980> e<00:03:15.100> there<00:03:16.890> that's

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
the middle of the e there that's

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.930 
the middle of the e there that's
probably<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.250> little<00:03:18.640> bit<00:03:20.280> later<00:03:21.280> it's

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
probably a little bit later it's

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.300 
probably a little bit later it's
probably<00:03:22.030> debatable<00:03:22.660> as<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:24.180> which<00:03:25.180> one<00:03:25.420> is

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
probably debatable as to which one is

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.220 
probably debatable as to which one is
which<00:03:27.310> one<00:03:27.520> is<00:03:27.670> neater<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:30.270> yeah<00:03:31.270> look<00:03:31.780> it's

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
which one is neater but yeah look it's

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.600 
which one is neater but yeah look it's
certainly<00:03:33.040> got<00:03:33.160> some<00:03:33.370> uses<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:34.810> the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
certainly got some uses the the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.530 
certainly got some uses the the
unfortunately<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.760> drawing<00:03:37.000> program<00:03:37.210> will

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
unfortunately the drawing program will

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.790 
unfortunately the drawing program will
detect<00:03:37.960> your<00:03:38.560> hand<00:03:38.980> resting<00:03:39.520> on<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:40.680> then<00:03:41.680> you

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
detect your hand resting on and then you

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.880 
detect your hand resting on and then you
can't<00:03:42.070> you<00:03:42.640> can't<00:03:42.880> then<00:03:43.000> draw<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:44.440> would<00:03:44.620> take

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
can't you can't then draw it would take

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.220 
can't you can't then draw it would take
that<00:03:45.010> as<00:03:45.160> multi-touch<00:03:45.730> as<00:03:46.000> like<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:46.660> pinch<00:03:46.960> type

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
that as multi-touch as like a pinch type

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.960 
that as multi-touch as like a pinch type
movement<00:03:47.830> so<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:47.980> can't<00:03:48.280> rest<00:03:48.490> your<00:03:48.640> hand<00:03:48.880> on

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
movement so you can't rest your hand on

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.170 
movement so you can't rest your hand on
the<00:03:49.810> surface<00:03:50.200> but<00:03:51.160> that's<00:03:51.580> a<00:03:51.670> no<00:03:51.790> that's<00:03:52.030> a

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
the surface but that's a no that's a

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.570 
the surface but that's a no that's a
look<00:03:52.510> at<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.200> ipad<00:03:53.560> let's<00:03:53.770> jump<00:03:54.010> across<00:03:54.220> to

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
look at the ipad let's jump across to

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.570 
look at the ipad let's jump across to
the<00:03:55.060> iphone<00:03:55.540> so<00:03:56.410> I'm<00:03:56.470> across<00:03:56.740> on<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.070> iPhone

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
the iphone so I'm across on the iPhone

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.550 
the iphone so I'm across on the iPhone
there<00:03:57.820> and<00:03:58.030> we'll<00:03:58.180> do<00:03:58.270> the<00:03:58.390> same<00:03:58.600> thing<00:03:58.870> slide

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
there and we'll do the same thing slide

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.660 
there and we'll do the same thing slide
to<00:03:59.740> unlock<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:01.560> you'll<00:04:02.560> see<00:04:02.770> that<00:04:02.920> we<00:04:03.070> can<00:04:03.100> we

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
to unlock and you'll see that we can we

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.820 
to unlock and you'll see that we can we
can<00:04:03.790> swipe<00:04:04.090> pages<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:05.200> what<00:04:05.320> we<00:04:05.380> might<00:04:05.500> do<00:04:05.680> is

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
can swipe pages and what we might do is

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.610 
can swipe pages and what we might do is
we<00:04:05.950> might<00:04:06.160> just<00:04:06.370> jump<00:04:06.580> in<00:04:06.820> to<00:04:07.410> jump<00:04:08.410> into<00:04:08.500> a

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
we might just jump in to jump into a

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.570 
we might just jump in to jump into a
game<00:04:09.100> of<00:04:09.390> solitaire<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:11.170> again<00:04:12.070> these<00:04:12.370> games

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
game of solitaire and again these games

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.320 
game of solitaire and again these games
are<00:04:12.880> going<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.270> be<00:04:13.330> able<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:14.880> play<00:04:15.880> with<00:04:16.150> the

are going to be able to play with the

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.880 
are going to be able to play with the
stylus<00:04:16.570> now<00:04:16.810> again<00:04:17.049> when<00:04:17.410> you're<00:04:17.500> using<00:04:17.680> your

stylus now again when you're using your

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
finger you are attending to cover cover

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.870

the<00:04:20.290> screen<00:04:20.620> as<00:04:20.830> you<00:04:21.100> reach<00:04:21.280> across<00:04:21.520> to<00:04:21.730> do

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
the screen as you reach across to do

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.050 
the screen as you reach across to do
things<00:04:22.120> but<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.720> stylus<00:04:23.080> does<00:04:23.320> is<00:04:23.590> just<00:04:24.060> it

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
things but the stylus does is just it

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.260 
things but the stylus does is just it
maybe<00:04:25.690> helps<00:04:26.050> just<00:04:26.320> free<00:04:26.770> up<00:04:26.920> the<00:04:27.880> vision<00:04:28.180> a

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
maybe helps just free up the vision a

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.870 
maybe helps just free up the vision a
little<00:04:28.480> bit<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:29.460> stops<00:04:30.460> your<00:04:30.610> kind<00:04:30.790> of

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
little bit and stops your kind of

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.430 
little bit and stops your kind of
covering<00:04:31.390> covering<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.650> display<00:04:34.320> once<00:04:35.320> you

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
covering covering the display once you

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.960 
covering covering the display once you
get<00:04:35.560> used<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.890> being<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.220> little<00:04:36.550> bit<00:04:36.640> firmer

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
get used to being that little bit firmer

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.530 
get used to being that little bit firmer
with<00:04:37.270> your<00:04:37.480> presses<00:04:38.760> you'll<00:04:39.760> find<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.120> okay
