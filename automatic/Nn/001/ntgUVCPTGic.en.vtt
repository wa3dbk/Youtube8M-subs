00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
never tried on dresses before so I

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.050 
never tried on dresses before so I
relied<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> lot<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.350> their<00:01:28.710> expertise<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.820> find

the<00:01:30.150> dresses<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.659> fit<00:01:30.840> anywhere<00:01:31.110> else<00:01:31.259> so

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the dresses up with fit anywhere else so

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.840 
the dresses up with fit anywhere else so
they<00:01:31.680> went<00:01:31.920> through<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.280> they<00:01:32.369> picked<00:01:32.670> a
