hello again this is Gareth and today
I'll<00:00:04.380> be<00:00:04.410> reviewing<00:00:05.509> this<00:00:06.509> old<00:00:06.779> switch<00:00:07.080> most

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
I'll be reviewing this old switch most

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.530 
I'll be reviewing this old switch most
boiler<00:00:08.280> timer<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.760> came<00:00:09.000> out<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.210> my<00:00:09.300> kitchen

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
boiler timer that came out of my kitchen

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.539 
boiler timer that came out of my kitchen
after<00:00:10.050> 12<00:00:10.650> years<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:11.070> univer<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:12.179> use<00:00:13.549> this

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
after 12 years of univer of use this

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.420 
after 12 years of univer of use this
came<00:00:15.540> out<00:00:15.690> because<00:00:16.100> initially<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.250> them

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
came out because initially with them

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.179 
came out because initially with them
that<00:00:17.550> will<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.789> inside<00:00:18.510> timer<00:00:18.840> just<00:00:19.710> haven't

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
that will it inside timer just haven't

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.650 
that will it inside timer just haven't
been<00:00:20.279> able<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.580> figure<00:00:20.910> out<00:00:21.090> how<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.240> open<00:00:21.449> it

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
been able to figure out how to open it

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.590 
been able to figure out how to open it
up<00:00:21.689> yet<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.269> different<00:00:24.269> from<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
up yet but this is different from the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.519 
up yet but this is different from the
extractor<00:00:25.109> from<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.619> hobby<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.369> have

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
extractor from the hobby that I have

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.230 
extractor from the hobby that I have
that's<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.010> wiring<00:00:29.250> diagram<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.820> how<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.970> use

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
that's a a wiring diagram on how to use

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.630 
that's a a wiring diagram on how to use
it<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.679> didn't<00:00:32.120> says<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.360> August<00:00:33.780> 2<00:00:34.070> 2001<00:00:35.070> so

please be with right so anyway you have
timed<00:01:03.439> off<00:01:04.439> constant<00:01:05.869> water<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.140> heating<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
timed off constant water of heating and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.520 
timed off constant water of heating and
water<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.520> means<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.970> by<00:01:09.930> switching<00:01:10.409> on

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
water what this means is by switching on

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.929 
water what this means is by switching on
to<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.130> boiler<00:01:11.490> will<00:01:11.580> come<00:01:11.790> on

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
to that the boiler will come on

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090 
to that the boiler will come on
depending<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:12.960> time<00:01:13.439> you've<00:01:13.619> got<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.890> set

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
depending on what time you've got it set

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.080 
depending on what time you've got it set
to<00:01:14.990> off<00:01:15.990> switch<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.950> boil<00:01:17.130> off<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:17.939> why

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
to off switch to boil off you know why

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.410 
to off switch to boil off you know why
the<00:01:18.150> settings<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:18.960> constant<00:01:20.180> it's<00:01:21.180> on

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the settings on there constant it's on

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.330 
the settings on there constant it's on
all<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.600> time<00:01:21.930> depending<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.650> basically<00:01:22.979> yeah

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
all the time depending it basically yeah

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.570 
all the time depending it basically yeah
it's<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:24.180> turns<00:01:24.540> off<00:01:24.720> when<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.170> room<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
it's it turns off when the room is

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
it's it turns off when the room is
heated<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:28.430> needed<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.390> set

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
heated up to the needed it to it the set

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.810 
heated up to the needed it to it the set
time<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> thermostat<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.860> thermostat<00:01:32.729> is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
time on the thermostat the thermostat is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.580 
time on the thermostat the thermostat is
what<00:01:32.970> picks<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> temperature<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
what picks up the temperature in the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.429 
what picks up the temperature in the
room<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.030> very<00:01:36.090> grippy<00:01:36.570> you

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
room as you can see it's very grippy you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.630 
room as you can see it's very grippy you
know<00:01:37.560> that's<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> switches<00:01:38.400> are<00:01:38.490> very

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
know that's what the switches are very

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.330 
know that's what the switches are very
glibly<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.290> was<00:01:40.530> ripped<00:01:41.159> off

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
glibly this is but this was ripped off

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.230 
glibly this is but this was ripped off
the<00:01:41.520> wall<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.150> see<00:01:42.590> it's<00:01:44.060> half<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the wall as you can see it's half the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.539 
the wall as you can see it's half the
clip<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.600> missing<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.710> anyway<00:01:47.009> let's<00:01:47.220> move<00:01:47.399> on

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
clip is missing but anyway let's move on

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.889 
clip is missing but anyway let's move on
and<00:01:48.680> to<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.829> timer<00:01:50.130> itself<00:01:50.520> most<00:01:51.329> kids<00:01:51.689> out

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and to the timer itself most kids out

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.450 
and to the timer itself most kids out
there<00:01:52.110> most<00:01:52.320> young<00:01:52.619> people<00:01:52.649> would<00:01:53.159> probably

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
there most young people would probably

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.120 
there most young people would probably
never<00:01:53.909> know<00:01:54.270> how<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.540> use<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.049> these<00:01:55.200> it's

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
never know how to use one of these it's
