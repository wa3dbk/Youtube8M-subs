00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
prepared them from the beginning that

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.090 
prepared them from the beginning that
they<00:06:11.000> were<00:06:11.060> not<00:06:11.360> going<00:06:11.540> to<00:06:11.630> inherit<00:06:12.110> great

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
they were not going to inherit great

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.710 
they were not going to inherit great
wealth<00:06:13.430> but<00:06:13.700> that<00:06:13.910> wasn't<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:14.420> way<00:06:14.540> it<00:06:14.570> was

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
wealth but that wasn't the way it was

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.960 
wealth but that wasn't the way it was
going<00:06:14.750> to<00:06:14.930> work<00:06:15.110> in<00:06:15.380> their<00:06:15.560> family<00:06:15.980> I<00:06:16.160> think

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
going to work in their family I think

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.370 
going to work in their family I think
that<00:06:17.150> a<00:06:17.180> rich<00:06:17.390> person<00:06:17.840> should<00:06:18.020> leave<00:06:18.200> their

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
that a rich person should leave their

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.080 
that a rich person should leave their
children<00:06:19.010> up<00:06:19.100> so<00:06:19.250> they<00:06:19.370> can<00:06:19.490> do<00:06:19.580> anything<00:06:19.970> but

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
children up so they can do anything but

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.030 
children up so they can do anything but
not<00:06:20.210> enough<00:06:20.480> so<00:06:21.110> they<00:06:21.230> can<00:06:21.380> do<00:06:21.500> nothing<00:06:21.650> this

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
not enough so they can do nothing this

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.500 
not enough so they can do nothing this
isn't<00:06:22.310> in<00:06:22.400> keeping<00:06:22.700> with<00:06:22.730> my<00:06:22.850> view<00:06:23.180> of<00:06:23.300> how<00:06:23.450> the

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
isn't in keeping with my view of how the

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.010 
isn't in keeping with my view of how the
world<00:06:23.720> should<00:06:23.900> operate<00:06:24.320> to<00:06:24.710> create<00:06:26.020> huge

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
world should operate to create huge

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.370 
world should operate to create huge
amounts<00:06:27.470> of<00:06:27.560> dynastic<00:06:27.950> well
