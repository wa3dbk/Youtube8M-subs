00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
gaining as many subscribers I was

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.510 
gaining as many subscribers I was
getting<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.179> when<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:30.960> did<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.439> FIFA<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.160> f1

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
getting on when I did like FIFA and f1

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.600 
getting on when I did like FIFA and f1
and<00:00:32.820> cricket<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:34.620> kind<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.010> sort<00:00:35.489> of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and cricket and it's kind of sort of

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.799 
and cricket and it's kind of sort of
things<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.890> was<00:00:37.890> getting<00:00:38.190> odd<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.000> were<00:00:39.239> for

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
things I was getting odd and I were for

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.069 
things I was getting odd and I were for
subscribes<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.530> week<00:00:40.710> perhaps<00:00:41.390> now<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> only<00:00:42.840> get

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
subscribes a week perhaps now I only get

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.779 
subscribes a week perhaps now I only get
like<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:43.920> two<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.129> week

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
like one or two a week

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.450 
like one or two a week
so<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:45.660> great<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.559> probably<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
so it's not great because probably I

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.119 
so it's not great because probably I
felt<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.350> maybe<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.770> did<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
felt it was just because maybe I did the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.610 
felt it was just because maybe I did the
f1<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> thought<00:00:51.539> maybe<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.989> came<00:00:52.230> back<00:00:52.289> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
f1 so I thought maybe if I came back to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.160 
f1 so I thought maybe if I came back to
cricket<00:00:53.129> people<00:00:53.789> might<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.660> might<00:00:55.020> get

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
cricket people might like it I might get

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.950 
cricket people might like it I might get
more<00:00:55.320> subscribers<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.910> enjoyed<00:00:57.239> both<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
