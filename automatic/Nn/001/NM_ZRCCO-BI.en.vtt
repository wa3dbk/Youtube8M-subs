there all in the fourth fret but that's

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.360 
there all in the fourth fret but that's
not<00:02:14.870> how<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.050> play<00:02:15.349> it<00:02:15.379> but<00:02:15.860> like<00:02:16.040> that's<00:02:16.250> not

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
not how I play it but like that's not

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.619 
not how I play it but like that's not
how<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.489> put<00:02:16.670> my<00:02:16.730> fingers<00:02:17.030> but<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.300> think<00:02:17.540> that'd

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
how I put my fingers but I think that'd

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.420 
how I put my fingers but I think that'd
be<00:02:17.660> easier<00:02:18.050> for<00:02:18.080> other<00:02:18.349> people<00:02:18.379> because<00:02:19.310> I

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
be easier for other people because I

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.990 
be easier for other people because I
have<00:02:19.459> small<00:02:19.790> hands<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.920> just<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.430> use<00:02:22.849> my

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
have small hands and you just I use my

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.790 
have small hands and you just I use my

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
should look like this and you just strum

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.160 
should look like this and you just strum
that<00:03:04.969> again<00:03:05.329> it<00:03:05.629> should<00:03:05.840> sound<00:03:06.019> like<00:03:06.200> this

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
that again it should sound like this

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.170 
that again it should sound like this
now<00:03:08.800> remember<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:10.620> hand<00:03:11.620> uh<00:03:12.000> formation<00:03:13.000> and

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
now remember this hand uh formation and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.320 
now remember this hand uh formation and
then<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.080> just<00:03:14.230> move<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.530> down<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.330> you

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
then you just move it down to the you

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.360 
then you just move it down to the you
just<00:03:16.510> move<00:03:16.660> everything<00:03:16.870> down<00:03:17.110> like<00:03:17.560> one

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
just move everything down like one

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.250 
just move everything down like one
string<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.880> then<00:03:19.240> you<00:03:19.300> move<00:03:19.480> over<00:03:19.660> one<00:03:19.959> fret

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
string and then you move over one fret

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.980 
string and then you move over one fret
so<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.190> should<00:03:21.340> be<00:03:21.490> the<00:03:21.580> same<00:03:21.790> type<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:22.780> chord

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
now on the fifth fret and that one

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.870 
now on the fifth fret and that one
should<00:03:29.020> just<00:03:29.290> sound<00:03:29.410> like<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:29.700> if<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:30.790> guys
