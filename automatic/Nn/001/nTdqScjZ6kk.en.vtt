rearranging some of the pieces you see

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.740 
rearranging some of the pieces you see
that<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> original<00:00:19.980> square<00:00:20.699> whose<00:00:21.180> area<00:00:21.449> is

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750

this implies that the Red Square has an

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.560 
this implies that the Red Square has an
area<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.140> 2/5<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.370> there<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.730> other<00:00:54.000> wonders

parallelogram in two different ways you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.090 
parallelogram in two different ways you
know<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> area<00:01:09.840> equals<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> base<00:01:10.770> times
