years ago I don't know if you remember /
Phil<00:02:26.270> Hellmuth's<00:02:26.630> house<00:02:26.810> once<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.800> said<00:02:28.040> that

Phil Hellmuth's house once you said that

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.860 
Phil Hellmuth's house once you said that
you<00:02:28.220> used<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.459> play<00:02:28.670> heads<00:02:28.910> up<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
you used to play heads up on the on the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.800 
you used to play heads up on the on the
internet<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:31.640> said<00:02:31.850> yeah<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.209> know<00:02:32.330> give

me a call and we'll we'll play heads up

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.610 
me a call and we'll we'll play heads up
and<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:34.970> was<00:02:35.120> like<00:02:35.270> sure<00:02:35.510> but<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.020> never<00:02:36.290> did<00:02:36.560> it

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
and I was like sure but I never did it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.750 
and I was like sure but I never did it
and<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:37.190> would<00:02:37.310> have<00:02:37.340> learned<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.700> line<00:02:37.880> yeah

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
and I would have learned the line yeah

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.360 
and I would have learned the line yeah
no<00:02:40.760> but<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.330> yes<00:02:41.900> coconut<00:02:42.800> way<00:02:42.920> back<00:02:43.160> then

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
no but you you yes coconut way back then

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.130 
no but you you yes coconut way back then
I<00:02:43.550> was<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:43.790> play<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.480> thing<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.840> was<00:02:44.990> you

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
I was I play and the thing it was you

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.990 
I was I play and the thing it was you
could<00:02:45.260> play<00:02:45.440> like<00:02:45.470> 300<00:02:46.100> or<00:02:46.160> 600<00:02:46.430> hands<00:02:46.790> per

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
could play like 300 or 600 hands per

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.620 
could play like 300 or 600 hands per
hour

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
hour

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.840 
hour
right<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:48.050> mean<00:02:48.110> just<00:02:48.440> like<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.590> can<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.100> just

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
right I mean just like you can that just

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.310 
right I mean just like you can that just
like<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.090> can<00:02:50.240> at<00:02:50.450> us<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.750> think<00:02:50.810> actually<00:02:51.200> back

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
like you can at us I think actually back

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
like you can at us I think actually back
then<00:02:51.350> was<00:02:51.650> even<00:02:51.830> faster

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
then was even faster

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.850 
then was even faster
they<00:02:53.030> had<00:02:53.330> it<00:02:53.930> was<00:02:53.990> actually<00:02:54.290> all<00:02:54.410> text-based

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
they had it was actually all text-based

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.250 
they had it was actually all text-based
right<00:02:55.340> no<00:02:55.580> traffic's<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.990> could<00:02:57.140> download

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
right no traffic's you could download

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.930 
right no traffic's you could download
there's<00:02:57.800> actually<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.280> sold<00:02:58.550> wrote<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.730> program

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
there's actually it sold wrote a program

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.130 
there's actually it sold wrote a program
that<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.270> download<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.780> make<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.020> a<00:03:00.050> little

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
that you download to make it a little

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.330 
that you download to make it a little
more<00:03:00.260> graphical<00:03:00.740> but<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:00.920> never<00:03:01.100> liked<00:03:01.310> that

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
more graphical but I never liked that

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.370 
more graphical but I never liked that
well<00:03:01.880> all<00:03:02.060> tech<00:03:02.330> space<00:03:02.510> was<00:03:02.750> actually<00:03:03.110> really

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
well all tech space was actually really

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.230 
well all tech space was actually really
really<00:03:04.070> efficient<00:03:04.490> right<00:03:04.820> you'd<00:03:05.000> have<00:03:05.120> your

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
really efficient right you'd have your

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.640 
really efficient right you'd have your
cards<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.900> board<00:03:06.110> down<00:03:06.290> at<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.500> bottom

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
cards and the board down at the bottom

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.530 
cards and the board down at the bottom
but<00:03:06.920> everything<00:03:07.190> else<00:03:07.340> is<00:03:07.490> running<00:03:08.060> atactic

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
but everything else is running atactic

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.430 
but everything else is running atactic
it<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:08.870> can<00:03:09.020> see<00:03:09.140> everything<00:03:09.320> that's

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
it so you can see everything that's

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.650 
it so you can see everything that's
going<00:03:09.560> on<00:03:09.830> was<00:03:10.040> definitely<00:03:10.670> good<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:11.540> was

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
going on was definitely good it was

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.210 
going on was definitely good it was
absolutely<00:03:12.020> great<00:03:12.140> training<00:03:12.440> that<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.190> I

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
absolutely great training that and I

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.980 
absolutely great training that and I
think<00:03:13.460> you<00:03:13.790> know<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.300> do<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.750> lot<00:03:14.960> of

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
think you know I I do a lot of

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.960 
think you know I I do a lot of
mathematical<00:03:15.680> analysis<00:03:16.160> of<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.550> game<00:03:16.730> and

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
mathematical analysis of the game and

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.940 
mathematical analysis of the game and
most<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:17.750> them<00:03:18.050> it<00:03:18.410> applies<00:03:18.680> most

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
most of that them it applies most

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.040 
most of that them it applies most
strongly<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.430> heads<00:03:19.580> up<00:03:19.760> right<00:03:20.060> heads<00:03:20.780> up<00:03:20.870> can

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
strongly it heads up right heads up can

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.530 
strongly it heads up right heads up can
be<00:03:21.140> studied<00:03:21.380> much<00:03:22.190> more<00:03:22.370> rigorously<00:03:22.850> yeah

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
be studied much more rigorously yeah

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.300 
be studied much more rigorously yeah
from<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.840> game<00:03:24.020> theory<00:03:24.290> standpoint<00:03:24.800> it's<00:03:24.950> very

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
from a game theory standpoint it's very

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.070 
from a game theory standpoint it's very
hard<00:03:25.640> game<00:03:25.940> theory<00:03:26.180> has<00:03:26.300> a<00:03:26.330> really<00:03:26.960> really

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
hard game theory has a really really

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.930 
hard game theory has a really really
hard<00:03:27.350> time<00:03:27.560> dealing<00:03:27.800> with<00:03:28.010> like<00:03:28.460> three<00:03:28.730> player

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
hard time dealing with like three player

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.340 
hard time dealing with like three player
games<00:03:29.210> or<00:03:29.360> anything<00:03:29.570> more<00:03:29.870> than<00:03:30.020> two<00:03:30.140> player

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
games or anything more than two player

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.680 
games or anything more than two player
games<00:03:30.640> but<00:03:31.640> two<00:03:31.820> player<00:03:32.030> games<00:03:32.270> that<00:03:32.510> has<00:03:32.660> a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
games but two player games that has a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.900 
games but two player games that has a
decent<00:03:33.020> handle<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.650> want<00:03:33.830> I<00:03:34.310> want<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:34.670> ask<00:03:34.820> you

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
decent handle I want I want to ask you

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.970 
decent handle I want I want to ask you
about<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.060> heads<00:03:35.300> up<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:36.260> MBC<00:03:36.470> heads<00:03:36.740> up<00:03:36.860> in

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
about that heads up the MBC heads up in

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.250 
about that heads up the MBC heads up in
particular<00:03:37.400> because<00:03:37.760> on<00:03:38.480> one<00:03:38.810> on<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.140> one

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
particular because on one on the one

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.930 
particular because on one on the one
hand<00:03:39.440> we<00:03:39.530> hear<00:03:39.710> a<00:03:39.770> lot<00:03:40.070> of<00:03:40.100> people<00:03:40.460> complaining

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
hand we hear a lot of people complaining

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.670 
hand we hear a lot of people complaining
that<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.330> structure<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.720> too<00:03:41.930> fast<00:03:42.290> and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
that the structure is too fast and

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.770 
that the structure is too fast and
perhaps<00:03:42.830> have<00:03:43.070> some<00:03:43.100> truth<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.580> but<00:03:44.180> your

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
perhaps have some truth to that but your

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.380 
perhaps have some truth to that but your
success<00:03:45.050> is<00:03:45.650> sort<00:03:46.160> of<00:03:46.250> my<00:03:46.640> counter-argument

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
success is sort of my counter-argument

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.990 
success is sort of my counter-argument
to<00:03:47.420> that<00:03:47.510> because<00:03:48.550> someone<00:03:49.550> can<00:03:49.700> dominate

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
to that because someone can dominate

be<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:51.920> way<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.070> do<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.430> with<00:03:52.730> it<00:03:52.910> is<00:03:53.030> go<00:03:53.270> based

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
be a way to do it so with it is go based

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.330 
be a way to do it so with it is go based
in<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.900> sense<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:54.320> mean<00:03:54.470> yeah<00:03:54.740> you<00:03:54.800> can<00:03:55.010> say<00:03:55.190> the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
in a sense I mean yeah you can say the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.280 
in a sense I mean yeah you can say the
structure<00:03:55.700> is<00:03:55.790> fast<00:03:56.000> enough<00:03:56.270> in<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.630> very<00:03:57.050> real

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
structure is fast enough in a very real

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.230 
structure is fast enough in a very real
sense<00:03:57.590> this<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:58.550> know<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.790> structure<00:03:59.030> is

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
sense this you know the structure is

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.240 
sense this you know the structure is
fast<00:03:59.480> you<00:03:59.720> play<00:03:59.870> a<00:03:59.959> match<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.530> don't<00:04:01.130> know<00:04:01.190> if

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
fast you play a match I don't know if

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.010 
fast you play a match I don't know if
the<00:04:01.340> average<00:04:01.490> two<00:04:01.790> hours<00:04:02.120> maybe<00:04:02.570> not<00:04:02.810> quite

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
the average two hours maybe not quite

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.830 
the average two hours maybe not quite
two<00:04:03.140> hours<00:04:03.320> I<00:04:03.440> think<00:04:03.470> my<00:04:03.709> match<00:04:03.920> is<00:04:04.130> probably

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
two hours I think my match is probably

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.380 
two hours I think my match is probably
average<00:04:05.840> two<00:04:06.020> hours<00:04:06.490> but<00:04:07.490> but<00:04:08.120> think<00:04:08.300> about

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
average two hours but but think about

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.660 
average two hours but but think about
that<00:04:08.540> for<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.230> entire<00:04:09.470> tournament<00:04:09.800> you<00:04:10.610> know

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
that for the entire tournament you know

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.880 
that for the entire tournament you know
that<00:04:10.850> means<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.120> played<00:04:11.330> 12<00:04:11.600> hours<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.050> playing

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
that means I played 12 hours and playing

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.380 
that means I played 12 hours and playing
three<00:04:13.070> games<00:04:13.100> in<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:13.580> last<00:04:13.790> in<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.300> last

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
three games in the last in the last

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.000 
three games in the last in the last
match<00:04:14.660> that<00:04:14.690> means<00:04:15.050> I<00:04:15.170> played<00:04:15.380> like<00:04:15.560> 16<00:04:15.920> hours

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
match that means I played like 16 hours

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.000 
match that means I played like 16 hours
right<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:17.150> 16<00:04:17.989> hours<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.260> heads<00:04:18.530> up<00:04:18.739> is<00:04:18.980> a

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
right and 16 hours a heads up is a

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.170 
right and 16 hours a heads up is a
hugely<00:04:19.850> is<00:04:20.239> hugely<00:04:20.989> different<00:04:21.260> than<00:04:21.470> 16<00:04:21.799> hours

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
hugely is hugely different than 16 hours

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.730 
hugely is hugely different than 16 hours
16<00:04:23.180> hours<00:04:23.270> of<00:04:23.419> heads<00:04:23.690> up<00:04:23.870> I'm<00:04:24.050> literally

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
16 hours of heads up I'm literally

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.920 
16 hours of heads up I'm literally
playing<00:04:24.950> hands<00:04:25.550> for<00:04:25.760> 16<00:04:26.150> straight<00:04:26.360> hours<00:04:26.630> as

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
playing hands for 16 straight hours as

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.510 
playing hands for 16 straight hours as
soon<00:04:27.050> as<00:04:27.169> I<00:04:27.230> fold<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:27.560> get<00:04:27.680> another<00:04:27.860> hand<00:04:28.040> and<00:04:28.340> as

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
soon as I fold I get another hand and as

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.340 
soon as I fold I get another hand and as
soon<00:04:28.640> as<00:04:28.730> my<00:04:28.820> fault<00:04:29.450> I<00:04:29.570> get<00:04:29.720> that's<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:30.080> lot<00:04:30.230> of

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
soon as my fault I get that's a lot of

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.200 
soon as my fault I get that's a lot of
decisions<00:04:30.800> yeah<00:04:31.010> every<00:04:31.460> hand<00:04:31.640> matters<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.180> a

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
decisions yeah every hand matters and a

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.640 
decisions yeah every hand matters and a
lot<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:32.480> hands<00:04:32.630> really<00:04:32.780> matter<00:04:33.080> as<00:04:33.200> opposed<00:04:33.530> to

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
lot of hands really matter as opposed to

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.680 
lot of hands really matter as opposed to
a<00:04:33.710> full<00:04:33.890> table<00:04:34.310> where<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.910> examples<00:04:35.300> hands<00:04:35.510> or

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
a full table where the examples hands or

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.930 
a full table where the examples hands or
arrays<00:04:35.990> take<00:04:36.350> it<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:36.740> no<00:04:37.070> action<00:04:37.490> I'm<00:04:37.640> playing

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
arrays take it and no action I'm playing

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.300 
arrays take it and no action I'm playing
yeah<00:04:38.270> so<00:04:38.630> first<00:04:38.900> off<00:04:39.590> you're<00:04:39.919> dealing

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
yeah so first off you're dealing

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.280 
yeah so first off you're dealing
probably<00:04:41.000> twice<00:04:41.180> as<00:04:41.330> many<00:04:41.419> hands<00:04:41.780> or<00:04:41.930> more

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
probably twice as many hands or more

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.920 
probably twice as many hands or more
right<00:04:43.070> and<00:04:43.370> secondly<00:04:43.940> I'm<00:04:44.150> involved<00:04:44.450> in<00:04:44.660> every

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
right and secondly I'm involved in every

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.900 
right and secondly I'm involved in every
single<00:04:45.080> hand<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:45.590> not<00:04:45.710> just<00:04:45.980> like<00:04:46.160> 15<00:04:46.760> percent

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
single hand and not just like 15 percent

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.900 
single hand and not just like 15 percent
of<00:04:47.150> them<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:47.960> so<00:04:48.530> 16<00:04:48.950> hours<00:04:49.190> a<00:04:49.220> heads-up<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.669> me

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
of them so so 16 hours a heads-up to me

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.600 
of them so so 16 hours a heads-up to me
is<00:04:50.180> like<00:04:50.419> you<00:04:50.479> know<00:04:50.810> it's<00:04:51.020> 32<00:04:51.860> hours<00:04:52.040> of<00:04:52.280> hand

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
is like you know it's 32 hours of hand

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.129 
is like you know it's 32 hours of hand
then<00:04:52.849> plus<00:04:53.120> you're<00:04:53.449> really<00:04:53.780> involved<00:04:53.990> in

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
then plus you're really involved in

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.649 
then plus you're really involved in
every<00:04:54.319> single<00:04:54.439> hand<00:04:54.770> so<00:04:55.280> it's<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.729> lot<00:04:56.539> more

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
every single hand so it's a lot more

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.809 
every single hand so it's a lot more
than<00:04:56.840> 30<00:04:56.990> is<00:04:57.139> fried<00:04:57.409> like<00:04:57.710> 100<00:04:58.099> hours<00:04:58.340> one

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
than 30 is fried like 100 hours one

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.119 
than 30 is fried like 100 hours one
thing<00:04:58.969> that's<00:04:59.150> interesting<00:04:59.330> is<00:04:59.750> that<00:04:59.810> a<00:05:00.530> small

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
thing that's interesting is that a small

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.279 
thing that's interesting is that a small
ball<00:05:01.340> has<00:05:01.550> really<00:05:02.000> become<00:05:02.169> more<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:03.229> more

in that I don't limp but I probably make

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.499

smaller races than most people like

blind if I'm not the occasions that I

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:33.189 
blind if I'm not the occasions that I
fall<00:05:31.520> this<00:05:32.090> fall<00:05:32.300> but<00:05:32.509> I'm<00:05:32.599> never<00:05:32.779> gonna<00:05:32.900> limp

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
fall this fall but I'm never gonna limp

in<00:05:33.349> I'm<00:05:33.770> almost<00:05:34.520> never<00:05:34.729> gonna<00:05:34.939> live<00:05:35.120> in<00:05:35.289> okay

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
in I'm almost never gonna live in okay

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.959 
in I'm almost never gonna live in okay
so<00:05:36.529> I<00:05:36.560> saw<00:05:36.889> some<00:05:37.159> where<00:05:37.340> you<00:05:37.490> played<00:05:37.699> an<00:05:37.849> T

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:37.969 
so I saw some where you played an T

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:39.820 
so I saw some where you played an T
Block<00:05:38.210> in<00:05:38.449> the<00:05:38.599> in<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.020> third<00:05:39.289> one<00:05:39.529> and<00:05:39.710> you're

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
Block in the in the third one and you're

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.140 
Block in the in the third one and you're
good<00:05:40.250> friends<00:05:40.340> with<00:05:40.580> him<00:05:40.729> and<00:05:40.759> I'm<00:05:40.879> sure<00:05:40.939> you

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
good friends with him and I'm sure you

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.559 
good friends with him and I'm sure you
guys<00:05:41.330> have<00:05:41.539> talked<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:42.909> about<00:05:43.909> heads<00:05:44.120> up<00:05:44.360> and

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
guys have talked and about heads up and

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.869 
guys have talked and about heads up and
he<00:05:45.080> said<00:05:45.319> somewhere<00:05:45.680> aware<00:05:45.949> because

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:46.879 
he said somewhere aware because

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.179 
he said somewhere aware because
positional<00:05:47.479> advantage<00:05:47.539> heads<00:05:48.529> up<00:05:48.740> is<00:05:48.889> so

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:49.189 
positional advantage heads up is so

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:51.730 
positional advantage heads up is so
strong<00:05:49.580> you<00:05:50.539> should<00:05:50.719> always<00:05:50.990> raise<00:05:51.409> with

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
strong you should always raise with

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.920 
strong you should always raise with
every<00:05:52.099> single<00:05:52.460> hand<00:05:52.669> now<00:05:53.090> that<00:05:53.300> may<00:05:53.419> be<00:05:53.479> taking

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
every single hand now that may be taking

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.179 
every single hand now that may be taking
it<00:05:53.990> to<00:05:54.110> a<00:05:54.139> large<00:05:54.289> high<00:05:54.439> street<00:05:54.740> because<00:05:55.009> once

00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:55.189 
it to a large high street because once

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.499 
it to a large high street because once
the<00:05:55.310> other<00:05:55.430> player<00:05:55.669> adjusts<00:05:56.210> then<00:05:56.389> you're

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
the other player adjusts then you're

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.040 
the other player adjusts then you're
gonna<00:05:56.629> need<00:05:56.810> to<00:05:57.050> to<00:05:57.650> readjust<00:05:57.889> but<00:05:58.879> it's<00:05:59.870> like

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
gonna need to to readjust but it's like

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.659 
gonna need to to readjust but it's like
kind<00:06:00.259> of<00:06:00.319> it<00:06:00.469> I<00:06:00.529> think<00:06:00.770> that's<00:06:00.919> Johnny<00:06:01.310> there's

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
kind of it I think that's Johnny there's

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.550 
kind of it I think that's Johnny there's
not<00:06:01.789> much<00:06:02.060> to<00:06:02.330> I<00:06:02.629> think<00:06:02.839> that's<00:06:03.139> I<00:06:03.349> think

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
not much to I think that's I think

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.550 
not much to I think that's I think
that's<00:06:03.770> two<00:06:04.039> men<00:06:04.190> raising<00:06:04.639> too<00:06:04.909> often<00:06:05.440> and<00:06:06.440> I

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
that's two men raising too often and I

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.019 
that's two men raising too often and I
think<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:06.800> deeper<00:06:06.979> the<00:06:07.190> stacks<00:06:07.460> the<00:06:07.849> more

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:08.029 
think the deeper the stacks the more

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:09.700 
think the deeper the stacks the more
frequently<00:06:08.419> you<00:06:08.479> can<00:06:08.539> raise<00:06:08.810> does<00:06:09.319> he<00:06:09.440> mean<00:06:09.589> as

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
frequently you can raise does he mean as

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.490 
frequently you can raise does he mean as
opposed<00:06:10.039> to<00:06:10.099> one<00:06:10.639> composition<00:06:11.050> never<00:06:12.050> folded

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
opposed to one composition never folded

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.019 
opposed to one composition never folded
right<00:06:12.800> yeah<00:06:13.190> I<00:06:13.219> think<00:06:13.370> he<00:06:13.520> plays<00:06:13.729> the<00:06:13.849> same

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:14.029 
right yeah I think he plays the same

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:15.640 
right yeah I think he plays the same
strategy<00:06:14.419> Cohn<00:06:14.569> ever-living<00:06:14.990> actually<00:06:15.500> he

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
strategy Cohn ever-living actually he

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.279 
strategy Cohn ever-living actually he
says<00:06:16.069> never<00:06:16.279> feet<00:06:16.669> you<00:06:16.879> could<00:06:17.089> never<00:06:17.300> hold<00:06:17.719> he

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
says never feet you could never hold he

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.709 
says never feet you could never hold he
didn't<00:06:18.529> play<00:06:18.620> that<00:06:18.650> strategy<00:06:19.039> against<00:06:19.370> me<00:06:19.520> but

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
didn't play that strategy against me but

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:21.850 
didn't play that strategy against me but
that's<00:06:20.719> part<00:06:20.960> of<00:06:20.990> the<00:06:21.080> problem<00:06:21.259> you<00:06:21.529> know<00:06:21.560> what

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
that's part of the problem you know what

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.110 
that's part of the problem you know what
he<00:06:22.009> knows<00:06:22.189> he<00:06:22.849> knows<00:06:24.759> probably<00:06:25.759> against<00:06:26.060> a

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
he knows he knows probably against a

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.459 
he knows he knows probably against a
typical<00:06:26.449> opponent<00:06:26.839> it<00:06:26.900> might<00:06:27.080> be<00:06:27.229> right<00:06:27.439> just

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
typical opponent it might be right just

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.499 
typical opponent it might be right just
to<00:06:27.889> raise<00:06:28.009> every<00:06:28.400> every<00:06:28.819> city<00:06:29.000> head<00:06:29.150> until

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
to raise every every city head until

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.029 
to raise every every city head until
they<00:06:29.629> start<00:06:29.900> to<00:06:29.990> adjust<00:06:30.080> again<00:06:30.620> you<00:06:30.800> know<00:06:30.919> if

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 
they start to adjust again you know if

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.890 
they start to adjust again you know if
faced<00:06:31.250> you<00:06:31.580> know<00:06:31.610> I<00:06:31.969> mean<00:06:32.389> once<00:06:32.569> they<00:06:32.659> figure

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
faced you know I mean once they figure

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.390 
faced you know I mean once they figure
out<00:06:32.960> you're<00:06:33.050> doing<00:06:33.560> that<00:06:33.710> everything<00:06:34.279> you've

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
out you're doing that everything you've

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.950 
out you're doing that everything you've
got<00:06:34.550> to<00:06:34.669> make<00:06:34.789> some<00:06:35.000> sort<00:06:35.150> of<00:06:35.240> a<00:06:35.330> yes<00:06:35.539> I<00:06:35.629> think<00:06:35.839> I

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
got to make some sort of a yes I think I

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.149 
got to make some sort of a yes I think I
think<00:06:36.169> he's<00:06:36.289> actually<00:06:36.500> saying<00:06:36.830> it<00:06:36.979> wouldn't

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:37.159 
think he's actually saying it wouldn't

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.920 
think he's actually saying it wouldn't
be<00:06:37.310> a<00:06:37.339> bad<00:06:37.520> strategy<00:06:37.939> even<00:06:38.629> if<00:06:38.719> you<00:06:38.810> just

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
be a bad strategy even if you just

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.839 
be a bad strategy even if you just
announced<00:06:39.349> it<00:06:39.409> to<00:06:39.500> your<00:06:39.589> opponent<00:06:39.889> but<00:06:40.699> it

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
announced it to your opponent but it

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:45.219 
announced it to your opponent but it
seems<00:06:41.500> again<00:06:42.500> this<00:06:43.009> may<00:06:43.189> be<00:06:43.250> just<00:06:43.659> from<00:06:44.659> a<00:06:44.930> few

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
seems again this may be just from a few

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.409 
seems again this may be just from a few
observations<00:06:45.500> it<00:06:46.009> seems<00:06:46.279> that<00:06:46.520> even<00:06:47.060> with<00:06:47.330> all

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
observations it seems that even with all

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.230 
observations it seems that even with all
the<00:06:47.569> small<00:06:47.810> ball<00:06:48.050> your<00:06:48.800> strategy<00:06:49.339> not<00:06:49.939> just<00:06:50.000> in

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
the small ball your strategy not just in

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.579 
the small ball your strategy not just in
heads-up<00:06:50.479> tournaments<00:06:50.930> but<00:06:50.990> in<00:06:51.110> terminus<00:06:51.469> in

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:51.589 
heads-up tournaments but in terminus in

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:55.149 
heads-up tournaments but in terminus in
general<00:06:51.979> is<00:06:52.129> that<00:06:52.159> you<00:06:53.089> are<00:06:53.379> not<00:06:54.379> the<00:06:54.710> not

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:55.159 
general is that you are not the not

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:57.279 
general is that you are not the not
necessarily<00:06:55.310> the<00:06:56.060> power<00:06:56.750> poker

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
necessarily the power poker

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:00.100 
necessarily the power poker
big<00:06:57.860> ball<00:06:58.069> preflop<00:06:58.729> but<00:06:59.029> that<00:06:59.210> you're<00:06:59.839> much
