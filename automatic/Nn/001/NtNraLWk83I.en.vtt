00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.770
 as I had mentioned in the review 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.080
 of the new beta of windows 10 I'm going to 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.300
 make this video about how to install 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.430
 games for windows live for those who 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.240
 have interest to install their games in 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.900
 this new version of the system and good 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.850
 so let's start 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.770
 there are many who wonder why 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.930
 I do not have a logo and those things are good 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:30.180
 for a very universal phrase 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.770
 important to me do not do to the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.629
 others what you do not like to be seen 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.730
 frankly when I was watching a 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.470
 video and I saw that there was a wolf and so 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.140
 all that and took the truth has 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.430
 bothered quite then why I 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.199
 I do not give them a logo so they do not 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.550
 delay the video and information that 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.970
 you want to see because you 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.670
 they want to see the tutorial they do not want to see 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.650
 all the logo ok what are we going to do 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.180
 right now is to give right click run 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.420
 as administrator I tell them right now 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.809
 where I downloaded it 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.519
 and we are going to give him that if he runs 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.469
 then it will start to download in what 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.239
 it starts to download the parts of 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.460
 games for windows will take a long time 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.540
 let's go straight to the page 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.039
 microsoft is that is where I from where 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.000
 I took it out I'm going to put the link 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.300
 here abajito 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.880
 and it seems that finally installing 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.130
 directly from this page do not not 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.600
 cause them no error then I'll 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.110
 I'm going to put the link here below so that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.580
 you can enter this page and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.369
 give it to download and it's going to start the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.840
 automatic download in a moment 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.119
 then once it has already 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.640
 finished downloading is going to install 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.400
 then you are not going to start 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.229
 nothing else will close and good here comes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.119
 at the moment of truth just when 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.430
 one installed the game for windows live 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.770
 in versions like windows 8.1 or in my 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.149
 case you should start it says there was a 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.979
 connection error and then 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.200
 you will try later or there was an error 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.240
 of installation and all those things 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.820
 then what we are going to do 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.560
 is to search in the search engine for games 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.700
 windows live and we will leave the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.470
 application icon application 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.000
 then you are going to click 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.160
 left and it will open 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.170
 exactly as I have it I already opened it 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.180
 but I'm going to do it again so that 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.610
 you see that not using counting or 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.890
 nothing we are going to put game is going to us 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.300
 exit the windows application then 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.530
 is going to start 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.180
 and he's going to ask us to put our 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.310
 of our password in my case I have 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.040
 one but as I do not have any game then 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.570
 I'm not going to register it, I do not have any 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.300
 no legal game all that under 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.580
 are downloaded and good in the case of 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.830
 those who buy them with their games as 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.570
 are the yarn jersey and the others that are 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.910
 of games for windows live start with your 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.620
 session build everything will come out normal 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.630
 do not worry, you are not going to throw them 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.690
 no error in case they do not play 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.060
 this with games legally purchased in 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.680
 a store 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.360
 what they have to do is not start 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.010
 session and at the time they are going to play 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.660
 they have it, that is, they are going to 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.959
 play offline or in your case play 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.030
 the campaign if you need me 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.040
 comes to them from a game that stops 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.239
 stay to play it on live you 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.610
 put me here in the comments that 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.470
 game they want and I would be going up and 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.630
 I would also be telling you if you can 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.910
 or you can not play light always 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.640
 because there are many people who say no 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.800
 If you can do it in tutorial videos of 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.510
 how can you go to the mere hour then 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.670
 it's not true and then it hurts them in the 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.200
 I play your internal files and you 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.970
 they have to reinstall or they get them 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.569
 virus in your computer 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.970
 here in electronics what we do is 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.819
 real tutorials we do not go with 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.170
 stories and like the video of plants 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.560
 against zombies that I said I was going to 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.150
 give the account of origin those 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.430
 people who made their comments 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.830
 levels was one in the end the person that 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.750
 I chose or ignored me and well I know 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.220
 lost the game I did not give it to anyone 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.069
 final because nobody asked me and 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.360
 by another person with whom yes 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.790
 I was talking but because the time 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.110
 never was 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.750
 so if you want me 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.950
 go back to do that contest nothing more 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.450
 say it here in the comments if 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.219
 I would also do the video again and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.129
 let's go back to doing what is the 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:09.269
 contest good guys that's all I'll 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.269
 I leave a greeting goodbye
