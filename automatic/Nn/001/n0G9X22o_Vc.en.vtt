00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460 

I<00:00:02.149> think<00:00:03.149> it's<00:00:03.270> pretty<00:00:03.449> simpler<00:00:04.020> than<00:00:04.170> what<00:00:04.380> we

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
I think it's pretty simpler than what we

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.140 
I think it's pretty simpler than what we
were<00:00:04.620> in<00:00:04.710> last<00:00:04.920> year<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.250> think<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.609> players<00:00:05.850> or

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
were in last year I think the players or

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.810 
were in last year I think the players or
be<00:00:06.569> able<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.870> adjust<00:00:07.799> more<00:00:08.010> easily<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.790> know

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
make calls make checks more easily so

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.380 
make calls make checks more easily so
that's<00:00:12.000> why<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.120> think<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.480> went<00:00:17.180> you<00:00:18.180> know<00:00:18.359> I

his standards and expectations he set
for<00:01:10.270> us

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:39.790 

I<00:01:28.390> can<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.480> repeat<00:01:29.750> your<00:01:29.900> question<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:38.800> don't

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
I can you repeat your question I don't

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.950 
I can you repeat your question I don't
think<00:01:39.980> it'd<00:01:40.130> make<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.580> more<00:01:41.150> tough<00:01:41.420> i<00:01:41.540> think<00:01:41.840> it

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
think it'd make it more tough i think it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.930 
think it'd make it more tough i think it
gives<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.470> better<00:01:42.830> opportunity<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.640> take<00:01:43.910> the

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
gives a better opportunity to take the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.880 
gives a better opportunity to take the
ball<00:01:44.210> like<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.570> air<00:01:44.690> you<00:01:44.720> know<00:01:45.050> get<00:01:45.620> in<00:01:45.770> the

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
ball like the air you know get in the

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.010 
ball like the air you know get in the
sessions<00:01:46.370> not<00:01:46.820> pass<00:01:47.090> these<00:01:47.330> down<00:01:47.390> i<00:01:47.600> think

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
sessions not pass these down i think

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.050 
sessions not pass these down i think
that's<00:01:48.260> kind<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:48.950> advantage<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.460> give<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.910> us

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
that's kind of advantage to give to us

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:10.120 
that's kind of advantage to give to us
as<00:01:50.210> defensive<00:01:50.660> back

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:19.480 

I<00:02:16.570> think<00:02:17.570> is<00:02:17.780> more<00:02:18.260> tackling<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.010> know<00:02:19.160> we<00:02:19.340> got

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
I think is more tackling you know we got

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.670 
I think is more tackling you know we got
to<00:02:19.640> get<00:02:19.760> better<00:02:19.970> at<00:02:20.150> tackling<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.140> we

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
to get better at tackling and we we

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.710 
to get better at tackling and we we
practice<00:02:22.100> on<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.430> good<00:02:22.670> heart<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.330> good<00:02:23.480> on

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
practice on that good heart and good on

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.100 
practice on that good heart and good on
the<00:02:23.840> spring<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.940> know<00:02:26.120> play<00:02:26.540> us<00:02:26.810> got<00:02:26.990> to

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
the spring and you know play us got to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.050 
the spring and you know play us got to
trust<00:02:27.290> one<00:02:27.590> another<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:28.130> know<00:02:28.310> play<00:02:28.790> for<00:02:29.000> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
trust one another you know play for the

trust one another you know play for the
player<00:02:29.270> that's<00:02:29.570> planned<00:02:29.870> besides<00:02:30.080> you

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
player that's planned besides you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.850 
player that's planned besides you
instead<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.400> yourself
