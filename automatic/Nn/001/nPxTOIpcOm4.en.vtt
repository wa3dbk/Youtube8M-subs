we'll<00:00:06.060> just<00:00:06.330> shared<00:00:06.629> how<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:06.930> role<00:00:07.230> of

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
we'll just shared how the role of

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.870 
we'll just shared how the role of
genetics<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.010> her<00:00:08.069> family<00:00:08.429> history<00:00:08.849> of

genetics and her family history of

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.490 
genetics and her family history of
cancer<00:00:09.150> could<00:00:09.690> catch<00:00:09.870> up<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.200> her<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.440> the

future our next guest is telling us if
genetic<00:00:13.019> testing<00:00:13.530> can<00:00:13.950> really<00:00:14.250> predict<00:00:14.610> if

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
genetic testing can really predict if

known as dr. Murray how are you the show
we've<00:00:25.590> been<00:00:25.769> talking<00:00:26.070> about<00:00:26.160> genes<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.880> how

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
we've been talking about genes and how

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.210 
we've been talking about genes and how
they<00:00:27.150> affect<00:00:27.480> us<00:00:27.689> he<00:00:28.439> can<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.769> tell<00:00:28.920> us<00:00:28.949> what

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
they affect us he can you tell us what

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.460 
they affect us he can you tell us what
exactly<00:00:29.640> our<00:00:29.760> genes<00:00:30.090> what<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.510> they<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.660> genes

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
exactly our genes what do they do genes

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.220 
exactly our genes what do they do genes
are<00:00:31.619> little<00:00:31.980> pieces<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.520> DNA<00:00:32.730> our<00:00:33.300> roadmap<00:00:33.960> to

are little pieces of DNA our roadmap to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.590 
are little pieces of DNA our roadmap to
the<00:00:34.530> future<00:00:34.860> they're<00:00:35.070> kind<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the future they're kind of it's the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.180 
the future they're kind of it's the
directions<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> how<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.380> live<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.649> life<00:00:37.920> who

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
directions to how you live your life who

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.260 
directions to how you live your life who
you're<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.000> there's<00:00:39.120> about

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
you're going to be and there's about

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.990 
you're going to be and there's about
30,000<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.590> each<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.460> our<00:00:41.640> cells

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
30,000 of them in each one of our cells

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.930 
30,000 of them in each one of our cells
you<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:42.719> half<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.290> pair<00:00:43.710> from<00:00:43.950> your<00:00:44.399> mom<00:00:44.610> half

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you get half a pair from your mom half

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.540 
you get half a pair from your mom half
from<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.300> dad<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.809> together<00:00:46.590> those<00:00:47.100> genes

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
from your dad and together those genes

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.639 
from your dad and together those genes
will<00:00:47.730> determine<00:00:48.239> which<00:00:48.719> direction<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:49.530> which

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
will determine which direction or which

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.650 
will determine which direction or which
path<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.100> might<00:00:50.280> take<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:51.059> guess<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.329> would

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
path you might take but guess what would

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.029 
path you might take but guess what would
now<00:00:51.870> learn<00:00:52.079> there's<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.620> many<00:00:52.739> other<00:00:52.949> things

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
now learn there's so many other things

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.580 
now learn there's so many other things
that<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.640> kind<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.030> take<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.660> off<00:00:54.809> course<00:00:55.140> so

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
that can kind of take you off course so

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.619 
that can kind of take you off course so
it's<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.010> about<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.879> genes<00:00:57.120> well

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
it's not just about the genes well

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.270 
it's not just about the genes well
that's<00:00:57.809> how<00:00:58.079> does<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> gene<00:00:58.680> take<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> path

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that's how does a gene take the path

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.479 
that's how does a gene take the path
into<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.149> disease<00:01:00.660> well<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.890> happens<00:01:02.190> at<00:01:02.309> gene

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
into a disease well what happens at gene

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.219 
into a disease well what happens at gene
produces<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> protein<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> body<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.140> that

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
produces a protein in the body and that

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
produces a protein in the body and that
protein<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.860> really<00:01:05.250> important<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> kind<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
protein is really important to kind of

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.820 
protein is really important to kind of
direct<00:01:06.330> traffic<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.990> decide<00:01:07.320> where<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.650> go

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
direct traffic and decide where to go

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.219 
direct traffic and decide where to go
what<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.720> happen<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.080> can

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
what to do but what can happen you can

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750 
what to do but what can happen you can
get<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> mutation<00:01:11.010> which<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> word<00:01:11.729> that

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
get a mutation which is a word that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.270 
get a mutation which is a word that
really<00:01:12.119> means<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.600> permanent<00:01:13.260> problem<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.250> that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
really means a permanent problem in that

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.240 
really means a permanent problem in that
DNA<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.630> get<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> first<00:01:16.619> by<00:01:16.770> heredity

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
DNA you can get it first by heredity

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.890 
DNA you can get it first by heredity
that<00:01:17.490> means<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:17.970> example<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.390> bracket<00:01:18.750> one

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that means for example the bracket one

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.929 
that means for example the bracket one
gene<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> BRCA<00:01:19.380> gene<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.430> inherit<00:01:20.759> from

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
gene the BRCA gene you can inherit from

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.960 
gene the BRCA gene you can inherit from
a<00:01:21.119> parent<00:01:21.450> or<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.040> acquire<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.640> meaning

exposed to all sorts of toxins can

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
exposed to all sorts of toxins can
change<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.390> DNA<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:31.710> you're<00:01:32.070> not

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
change that DNA and then you're not

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.410 
change that DNA and then you're not
gonna<00:01:32.310> pass<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.030> your<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.360> gonna

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
gonna pass that on your just gonna

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.390 
gonna pass that on your just gonna
acquire<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.020> yourself<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.590> end<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.159> maybe

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
acquire it yourself and end up maybe

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.649 
acquire it yourself and end up maybe
with<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> cancer<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.240> all<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> genetic

other<00:01:42.329> reasons<00:01:42.570> well<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> think<00:01:43.290> ed<00:01:43.649> stories

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
other reasons well I think ed stories

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.370 
other reasons well I think ed stories
the<00:01:44.220> most<00:01:44.460> common<00:01:45.090> now<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.840> past<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.350> used

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the most common now in the past we used

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.469 
the most common now in the past we used
to<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.829> gene<00:01:47.189> tests<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> time<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.180> rare

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
to do gene tests all the time for rare

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.539 
to do gene tests all the time for rare
diseases<00:01:48.799> but<00:01:49.799> now<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.189> we're<00:01:50.310> learning

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
diseases but now that we're learning

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.760 
diseases but now that we're learning
more<00:01:50.790> about<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.450> whole<00:01:51.659> alphabet<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.409> genes

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
more about that whole alphabet of genes

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
more about that whole alphabet of genes
that<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.189> all<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.899> people<00:01:54.899> are<00:01:55.020> really

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that we all have people are really

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.170 
that we all have people are really
asking<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.009> I've<00:01:56.159> cancer<00:01:56.579> my<00:01:56.759> family

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
asking you know I've cancer my family

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.270 
asking you know I've cancer my family
heart<00:01:57.479> disease<00:01:57.840> let's<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.890> some<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.189> these

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
heart disease let's do some of these

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
heart disease let's do some of these
tests<00:01:59.670> unfortunately<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> lot<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.869> them<00:02:01.079> have

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
tests unfortunately a lot of them have

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.230 
tests unfortunately a lot of them have
been<00:02:01.350> advertised<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> consumer<00:02:02.700> way<00:02:03.180> too

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
been advertised to the consumer way too

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.539 
been advertised to the consumer way too
early<00:02:03.479> there's<00:02:04.200> still<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.799> lot<00:02:05.009> more<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.430> need

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
early there's still a lot more we need

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.459 
early there's still a lot more we need
to<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.360> worry<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.899> some<00:02:07.200> people

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
to know so I do worry that some people

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.529 
to know so I do worry that some people
are<00:02:07.560> having<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.099> test<00:02:08.340> without<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.300> going

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
are having the test without really going

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.270 
are having the test without really going
through<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> counseling<00:02:10.319> ed<00:02:10.830> was<00:02:11.039> great

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
through the counseling ed was great

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.090 
through the counseling ed was great
because<00:02:11.489> she<00:02:11.790> did

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
because she did

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.950 
because she did
have<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.340> counseling<00:02:12.910> she<00:02:13.420> knew<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.900> she

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
have the counseling she knew that she

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.270 
have the counseling she knew that she
was<00:02:14.140> making<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.470> right<00:02:14.590> decision<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.130> don't

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
was making the right decision you don't

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.160 
was making the right decision you don't
we<00:02:15.850> should<00:02:16.000> just<00:02:16.150> go<00:02:16.270> out<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.570> get<00:02:16.660> tested<00:02:17.140> for

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
we should just go out and get tested for

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.500 
we should just go out and get tested for
everything<00:02:17.530> no<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.490> fact<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:18.970> think<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
everything no in fact I think the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.300 
everything no in fact I think the
problem<00:02:19.960> is<00:02:20.050> we've<00:02:20.260> promoted<00:02:20.500> genes<00:02:21.100> as

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
problem is we've promoted genes as

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.610 
problem is we've promoted genes as
though<00:02:21.460> suddenly<00:02:21.910> that's<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.720> template<00:02:23.500> of

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
though suddenly that's the template of

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.140 
though suddenly that's the template of
what<00:02:23.650> our<00:02:23.770> future<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.190> going<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.460> be<00:02:24.640> that

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
what our future is going to be that

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.780 
what our future is going to be that
roadmap<00:02:25.480> can<00:02:25.990> change<00:02:26.320> depending<00:02:26.650> it's<00:02:27.580> not

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
roadmap can change depending it's not

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.190 
roadmap can change depending it's not
just<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.150> genes<00:02:28.450> actually<00:02:28.720> there's<00:02:29.110> an

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
just the genes actually there's an

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.330 
just the genes actually there's an
article<00:02:29.410> yesterday<00:02:29.680> in<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.070> New<00:02:30.190> York<00:02:30.310> Times

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
article yesterday in the New York Times

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.820 
article yesterday in the New York Times
that<00:02:30.790> looked<00:02:31.030> at<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.810> surface<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> genes

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
that looked at the surface of the genes

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.830 
that looked at the surface of the genes
and<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.100> showed<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.370> we<00:02:34.030> can<00:02:34.240> change<00:02:34.510> what's

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
and it showed that we can change what's

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.120 
and it showed that we can change what's
on<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.080> surface<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> genes<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:35.920> can

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
on the surface of the genes that can

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.180 
on the surface of the genes that can
turn<00:02:36.430> off<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.030> turn<00:02:37.090> on<00:02:37.690> what<00:02:38.620> cells<00:02:38.980> are

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
turn off and turn on what cells are

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.680 
turn off and turn on what cells are
working<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.760> mean<00:02:40.240> if<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.450> environment

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
working I mean if the environment

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.090 
working I mean if the environment
affecting<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.560> environment<00:02:41.680> around

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
affecting the environment around

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.160 
affecting the environment around
instance<00:02:42.790> yeah<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.330> click<00:02:43.540> on<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.690> destroyer

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
instance yeah to click on a destroyer

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.800 
instance yeah to click on a destroyer
sure<00:02:44.920> okay<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:45.610> this<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:45.970> question<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:46.510> when

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
sure okay so this is a question so when

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.940 
sure okay so this is a question so when
it<00:02:46.900> comes<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:47.140> cancer<00:02:47.320> we<00:02:47.590> have<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.710> lot<00:02:47.920> of

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
it comes to cancer we have a lot of

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.230 
it comes to cancer we have a lot of
women<00:02:48.160> who<00:02:48.430> are<00:02:48.520> just<00:02:48.700> going<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.120> get

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
women who are just going to get

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.180 
women who are just going to get
genetically<00:02:49.750> tested<00:02:49.960> to<00:02:50.650> see<00:02:50.680> if<00:02:50.830> they<00:02:50.920> carry

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
genetically tested to see if they carry

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.460 
genetically tested to see if they carry
this<00:02:51.370> breast<00:02:51.640> cancer<00:02:52.060> gene<00:02:52.330> just<00:02:52.960> like<00:02:53.080> ed<00:02:53.290> was

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
this breast cancer gene just like ed was

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.950 
this breast cancer gene just like ed was
talking<00:02:53.800> about<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.490> what<00:02:55.450> did<00:02:55.510> these<00:02:55.660> tests

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
talking about so what did these tests

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.380 
talking about so what did these tests
show<00:02:56.370> what<00:02:57.370> they're<00:02:57.580> doing<00:02:57.850> they're<00:02:57.970> looking

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
show what they're doing they're looking

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.570 
show what they're doing they're looking
they've<00:02:58.600> looked<00:02:58.900> at<00:02:59.080> all<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.770> entire<00:02:59.920> sort<00:03:00.520> of

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
they've looked at all the entire sort of

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.190 
they've looked at all the entire sort of
gene<00:03:00.820> map<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.540> they're<00:03:01.660> looking<00:03:01.930> for<00:03:02.080> little

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
gene map and they're looking for little

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.950 
gene map and they're looking for little
areas<00:03:02.680> on<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.220> gene<00:03:03.460> map<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.780> we

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
areas on that gene map that that we

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.360 
areas on that gene map that that we
produce<00:03:05.140> or<00:03:05.440> look<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.740> same<00:03:05.950> as<00:03:06.220> another

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
produce or look the same as another

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.520 
produce or look the same as another
person<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:06.970> has<00:03:07.240> that<00:03:07.270> same<00:03:07.810> defect<00:03:08.350> and

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
person that has that same defect and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.160 
person that has that same defect and
really<00:03:09.370> what<00:03:10.030> we're<00:03:10.270> saying<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.690> this<00:03:10.900> type<00:03:11.140> of

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
really what we're saying is this type of

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.200 
really what we're saying is this type of
testing<00:03:11.770> is<00:03:11.950> still<00:03:12.640> in<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:12.940> very<00:03:13.060> early

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
testing is still in the very early

if you test positive for this for for

if you test positive for this for for
anything<00:03:42.520> I<00:03:42.850> mean<00:03:43.000> this<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.350> should<00:03:44.350> you<00:03:44.560> be

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
anything I mean this is should you be

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.650 
anything I mean this is should you be
getting<00:03:45.400> counseling<00:03:45.640> if<00:03:46.030> somebody<00:03:46.360> says<00:03:46.540> oh

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
getting counseling if somebody says oh

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.900 
getting counseling if somebody says oh
you've<00:03:46.870> you've<00:03:47.380> got<00:03:47.650> this<00:03:48.010> looks<00:03:48.520> like<00:03:48.700> this

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
you've you've got this looks like this

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.460 
you've you've got this looks like this
been<00:03:49.150> in<00:03:49.270> your<00:03:49.360> family<00:03:49.420> or<00:03:49.960> you've<00:03:50.140> developed

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
been in your family or you've developed

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.350 
been in your family or you've developed
this<00:03:50.710> I<00:03:50.890> mean<00:03:51.010> because<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.460> think<00:03:51.520> people<00:03:52.090> get

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
this I mean because I think people get

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.110 
this I mean because I think people get
tested<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:52.900> then<00:03:53.170> run<00:03:53.350> amok<00:03:53.680> because<00:03:54.670> you

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
tested and then run amok because you

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.880 
tested and then run amok because you
know<00:03:55.270> then<00:03:55.570> what<00:03:55.840> do<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:55.960> do<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:56.440> are<00:03:56.650> there

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
know then what do you do so are there

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.210 
know then what do you do so are there
things<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:57.310> can<00:03:57.580> do<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.820> sort<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:59.040> slow<00:04:00.040> the

Alzheimer disease occurs in very young

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.430 
Alzheimer disease occurs in very young
people<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.600> if<00:05:03.750> you<00:05:03.870> have<00:05:03.990> a<00:05:04.080> family<00:05:04.260> history

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
people and if you have a family history

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.350 
people and if you have a family history
of<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:04.830> occurring<00:05:05.070> in<00:05:05.310> someone<00:05:05.669> under<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.240> age

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
of it occurring in someone under the age

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.170 
of it occurring in someone under the age
of<00:05:06.570> 60<00:05:07.020> that's<00:05:07.260> quite<00:05:07.590> young<00:05:07.860> there<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.669> a<00:05:08.699> gene

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
of 60 that's quite young there is a gene

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.120 
of 60 that's quite young there is a gene
that<00:05:09.449> can<00:05:09.930> that<00:05:10.169> can<00:05:10.229> tell<00:05:10.650> you<00:05:10.800> whether<00:05:10.979> or

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
that can that can tell you whether or

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.310 
that can that can tell you whether or
not<00:05:11.250> you<00:05:11.580> will<00:05:12.150> develop<00:05:12.419> Alzheimer's<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:13.229> if

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
not you will develop Alzheimer's so if

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.279 
not you will develop Alzheimer's so if
you<00:05:13.440> get<00:05:13.590> tested<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.250> you're<00:05:14.880> positive

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
you get tested and you're positive

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.050 
you get tested and you're positive
that's<00:05:16.289> very<00:05:16.830> worrisome<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:17.520> will<00:05:17.789> likely

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
that's very worrisome you will likely

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.939 
that's very worrisome you will likely
develop<00:05:18.389> Alzheimer's<00:05:19.050> disease<00:05:19.350> but<00:05:19.740> for<00:05:19.860> the

develop Alzheimer's disease but for the
rest<00:05:20.130> of<00:05:20.340> all<00:05:20.520> right<00:05:20.699> there's<00:05:20.940> really<00:05:21.120> no<00:05:21.330> cure

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
rest of all right there's really no cure

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.120 
rest of all right there's really no cure

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
there isn't anything you can do about it

there isn't anything you can do about it
except<00:05:45.990> lifestyle<00:05:46.620> we<00:05:46.889> know<00:05:47.190> you<00:05:47.880> can<00:05:48.090> play
