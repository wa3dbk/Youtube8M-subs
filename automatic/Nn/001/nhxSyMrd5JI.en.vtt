00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 I have long wanted to make a video about possible 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.319
 For reasons seek on the fault of dragons and the best 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.990
 time for this after the story rather than 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.120
 dance dragons come up hard on 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.940
 the moment of the beginning of the dance targaryen seized 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.430
 13 adults and five young dragons 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.100
 three more wild dragons dwelt on 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.519
 dragon k as a result of the war died 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.050
 four young 12 adults and 1 9 dragon 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.810
 let's talk about the survivors 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.359
 one of the and dragons named vtsik glad 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.189
 succeeded in the power of a girl named crappy 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.989
 however after she left 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.660
 dragon girl pond 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.730
 nobody saw them there is a version that she 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.860
 went to the valley where he settled in 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.320
 remote region where is dropping off 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.020
 only tribes of savages within this 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.160
 the clan theories burned the very guys that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.620
 worked on elena 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.960
 arose when one of the branches is more 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.449
 old clan painted dogs start 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.910
 worship the fiery witch who commanded 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.219
 dragon one more surviving dragon was 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.500
 silver wings after poisoning and and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.780
 rider white ulf few 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.180
 unsuccessful attempts to straddle them 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.189
 flew off in an unknown direction also 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.860
 inaccurate information about the fate of cannibals 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.990
 last to ride their dragons but rather 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.810
 just whether they even their days somewhere in the shower 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.240
 away from human settlements last 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.729
 the survivor was her dragon named morning 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.650
 who was born during the war so 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.159
 one hundred thirty first year in the hands 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.130
 and ghana 3 or rather his council regent was 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.469
 only young dragon and dragon 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.079
 an explanation should be made here 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.890
 this dragon is mentioned in the song world 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.960
 ice and flame 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.180
 but he was definitely not the last 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.850
 dragon as in the saga itself is clearly 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.759
 it was written that the female was small 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.700
 green cover with wilted but none 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.100
 egg so do not stretch consequently 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.479
 during the reign of Ivan the third born 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.810
 at least one dragon 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.340
 or rather the dragon of her name is known but 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.189
 it is said that she died a hundred and fifty 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.310
 the third year therefore am died 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.560
 152 or earlier here we come 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.140
 the main question is why 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.899
 the extinction of dragons is the version that this 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.709
 directly related to the magic in the world of song 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.110
 ice and flame 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.630
 after the fall of valeria, the magic began 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.290
 fade away and it affected 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.569
 the Dragon 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.510
 the largest of the dragons is targaryen his 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.910
 balerion was born in val still road 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.790
 all the other dragons were born 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.190
 later already on dragon stone and not one 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.230
 of them did not reach the size of black horror 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.359
 besides the dragon were all 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.670
 less and less and here we come across 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.769
 with the question of eggs and chicken 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.350
 did the magicians leave because they disappeared 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.750
 dragons or dragons still angry that 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.880
 magic left the world is unknown 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.130
 I personally tend to the second version 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.680
 since the same others are unequivocally 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.769
 magical creatures and we know for sure 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.850
 what night watch scouts 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.260
 faced with others before birth 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.060
 dragons daneris 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.360
 but it will be so simple I would hardly 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.580
 dedicated to this topic separate 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.920
 There is a theory on which magicians 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.580
 certainly left the world and dragons 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.190
 grow smaller 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.470
 but their so quickly disappearing was 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.990
 the process is man-made the first theory 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.570
 is that igan 3 poisoned 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.060
 the last female dragon because of what her 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.770
 the eggs never prok bite though no 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.650
 no direct evidence that 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.960
 agon did it but indirectly and unconditionally 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.540
 has the king suffered two at once 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.150
 the hardest injury in childhood directly 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.920
 associated with the dragon first and year 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.870
 I had to sit down on my first time 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.900
 dragon storm cloud 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.090
 when he was saved photo 3 arch and when he 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.670
 landed on dragon stone was 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.980
 absolutely pale and piss from him 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.459
 the young dragon soon passed away 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.280
 injuries 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.280
 and about a year later in front of Wigan 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.010
 solar fire planted his mother the queen 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.830
 Rainier iii gun is described as sad 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.420
 gloomy and not smiling 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.730
 no wonder he was afraid he hated 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.190
 dragons and quite likely he decided 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.320
 do away with these creatures at the same 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.080
 time he will obviously not dare to do 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.810
 it is open so long as power 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.630
 targaryen from rested on the dragon instead 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.799
 this he chose slowly and systematically 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.680
 poison the dragon 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.959
 and along with the young dragon of the morning and 100 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.989
 information that we have only 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.269
 the dragon died 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.680
 than for natural reasons they are in battle 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.740
 there was a black horror 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.800
 when he was about 200 years old here 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.780
 morning was about 23 and dragon and that 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.690
 less can anyone object to 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.940
 this theory, we note that the game invited 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.370
 Eastern magicians so that by 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.620
 witchcraft breathed life fight not eggs 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.690
 however it is necessary to understand that in the world 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.090
 songs of ice and flame on each 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.639
 melisander accounts for hundreds if not 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.130
 thousands of charlatans owning no 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.710
 magic johan understood this perfectly 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.440
 there is also another theory with which we 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.690
 bump into a vulture feast when sam 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.180
 abides in old places he communicates with 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.729
 arch meister named marvin that very 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.560
 fascinated by the study of ancient magic as 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.900
 confirmation of some progress in 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.159
 this direction in his body burns 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.889
 obsidian candle 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:12.139
 Mardan tells Sam that it was Mr. 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.419
 once killed the dragons as they 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.120
 hate magic and everything connected with it 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.639
 so sam has to learn to keep 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.430
 tongue after teeth and do not talk about others 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.370
 the walking dead and things like that 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.229
 marvin himself left st doblo side 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.830
 as he said join daenerys 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.419
 and help and conquer the iron throne 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.580
 this theory looks quite logical 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.500
 since mister is essentially scientists 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.080
 westeros which studies various 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.840
 sciences from medicine history to mathematics 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.729
 and astronomy turn study 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.340
 secret sciences i.e. magicians 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.409
 considered a waste of time before 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.430
 the arrival of the targaryen and westerros almost no 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.740
 there was a place magicians 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.469
 the same children of the forest have long gone far 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.120
 north therefore the appearance of dragons is clearly 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.159
 I did not like the citadel 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.469
 but unlike the clergy who 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.630
 attempted to open become masters 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:04.500
 acted much smarter by the way 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.150
 there is a big theory which 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.650
 claims to be mr and 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.470
 provoked the uprising of robert 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.130
 barateona thereby finally overthrown 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.500
 targaryen 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:16.410
 but let's talk about this in detail in another 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.480
 time therefore I consider quite probable 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.680
 to the extinction of the dragons mister 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.160
 put your hand 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.020
 however, I personally tend to believe that both 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.700
 the above theories are true remember 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.610
 early years of aegon rule 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.070
 since he was an 11 year old orphan with him 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.020
 a council of seven regents was created at what 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.380
 in the five years of its existence it was 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.820
 as many as 13 members and only one person 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.430
 permanently held his post on 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.470
 throughout all five years you probably 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.050
 guessed it was a great place 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.850
 then he was Mr. named semolina 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.070
 naively assumes that he does not 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.040
 took advantage of this opportunity and not 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.169
 influenced the king's teenage mind 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.690
 convincing him that the dragon is their evil 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.610
 must be destroyed in this way 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.340
 mystery definitely stand for so much 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:05.070
 soon extinction of dragons but also uah 3 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.830
 was up to date and supported them it was 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.510
 my opinion and what do you think you can 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.640
 this conspiracy has no 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.550
 no reason or you have 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.320
 own theory on the subject 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.990
 write your opinion in the comments as well 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.820
 same join vkontakte group thanks for 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.570
 attention with you was Vlad on liberal yes 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.570
 new meetings
