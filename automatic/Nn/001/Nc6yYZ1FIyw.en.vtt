00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.260 

I<00:00:37.950> started<00:00:38.950> my<00:00:39.040> career<00:00:39.340> you<00:00:39.580> know<00:00:39.700> as<00:00:39.790> as<00:00:40.060> a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
I started my career you know as as a

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.580 
I started my career you know as as a
landscape<00:00:40.750> photographer<00:00:41.140> that's<00:00:41.290> all<00:00:41.440> I<00:00:41.470> ever

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
landscape photographer that's all I ever

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.920 
landscape photographer that's all I ever
cared<00:00:41.920> about

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.050 

I<00:00:44.990> think<00:00:45.920> that<00:00:46.070> there's<00:00:46.400> a<00:00:46.460> simple<00:00:46.790> beauty

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
I think that there's a simple beauty

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.170 
I think that there's a simple beauty
that<00:00:47.180> comes<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:48.010> being<00:00:49.010> able<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.220> have<00:00:49.520> a<00:00:49.790> tool

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
that comes to being able to have a tool

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.390 
that comes to being able to have a tool
that<00:00:50.480> allows<00:00:51.170> you<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:51.470> capture<00:00:51.770> something<00:00:52.100> as

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
that allows you to capture something as

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.460 
that allows you to capture something as
vividly<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.150> as<00:00:53.300> as<00:00:53.480> graphically<00:00:54.260> as<00:00:54.350> you

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
vividly and as as graphically as you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.740 
vividly and as as graphically as you
remember<00:00:54.860> it<00:00:54.950> and<00:00:55.090> for<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:56.270> much<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.600> my<00:00:56.720> life

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
remember it and for so much of my life

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.210 
remember it and for so much of my life
as<00:00:57.050> a<00:00:57.110> photographer<00:00:57.590> I've<00:00:57.680> been<00:00:57.830> searching

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
as a photographer I've been searching

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.819 
as a photographer I've been searching
for<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:58.400> tool

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.950 

I<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.730> these<00:01:02.820> places<00:01:03.210> remain<00:01:03.420> empty

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
I think these places remain empty

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.499 
I think these places remain empty
because<00:01:04.470> they<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.030> don't<00:01:06.390> know

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
because they just they just don't know

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:07.639 
because they just they just don't know
what's<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:06.899> you<00:01:07.110> know<00:01:07.380> there's

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
what's out there you know there's

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.469 
what's out there you know there's
there's<00:01:08.399> a<00:01:08.460> willingness<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.970> want<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> go

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
there's a willingness to want to go

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.880 
there's a willingness to want to go
farther<00:01:09.869> go<00:01:10.439> deeper<00:01:11.220> explore<00:01:12.000> more<00:01:12.330> and

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
farther go deeper explore more and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.780 
farther go deeper explore more and
that's<00:01:13.890> what<00:01:14.100> drives<00:01:14.250> me<00:01:14.399> as<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.670> photographer

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.639 
that's what drives me as a photographer
that's<00:01:15.509> what's<00:01:15.720> always<00:01:15.840> driven<00:01:16.259> me<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> want
