00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:21.169
 and here hurry your nickname means more 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.430
 because admin opens comonism 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.800
 plug read 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.600
 admin console password is entered means 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.430

 emphasizing not writing getting caught by the city and 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.540
 so our space and your password and so 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.430
 then go to the server 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.090
 To constantly exchange direct it is possible 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.710

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.950
