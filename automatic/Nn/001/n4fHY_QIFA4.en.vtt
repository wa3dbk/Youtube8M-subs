00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
there would be a nice a nice you know
addition<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.860> there<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.369> know

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
addition to have on there but you know

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
addition to have on there but you know
it<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.869> let<00:01:16.470> me<00:01:16.530> show<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.680> how

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it is with this so let me show you how

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.649 
it is with this so let me show you how
this<00:01:16.830> goes<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.180> did<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.450> it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this goes in and I really did I think it

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.380 
this goes in and I really did I think it
really<00:01:18.810> did<00:01:19.070> factor<00:01:20.070> how<00:01:20.220> they<00:01:20.640> had<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.090> thin

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
really did factor how they had this thin

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.149 
really did factor how they had this thin
closure<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.049> slide<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.590> from<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
closure here is you slide it in from the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.920 
closure here is you slide it in from the
middle<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.700> side<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.540> instead<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
middle or the side here instead of the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
middle or the side here instead of the
top<00:01:25.110> I've<00:01:25.770> used<00:01:25.950> wallet<00:01:26.159> cases<00:01:26.400> where<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
top I've used wallet cases where you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.859 
top I've used wallet cases where you
have<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.759> slide<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:26.970> from<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> top<00:01:27.420> section

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
have to slide it from the top section

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.230 
have to slide it from the top section
here<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.860> func<00:01:29.310> accidentally<00:01:29.790> out<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
here and the func accidentally out that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.999 
here and the func accidentally out that
weighs<00:01:30.360> widths<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.200> center<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
weighs widths in the center here and

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.520 
weighs widths in the center here and
isn't<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.400> doesn't<00:01:32.610> move<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.150> all<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
isn't it doesn't move out at all so the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.240 
isn't it doesn't move out at all so the
right<00:01:34.680> into<00:01:34.860> place<00:01:35.990> button<00:01:36.990> enclosure<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
right into place button enclosure and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.039 
right into place button enclosure and
that's<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> case<00:01:38.700> looks<00:01:39.390> pretty<00:01:39.689> nice<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that's the case looks pretty nice it

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.510 
that's the case looks pretty nice it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
it's $52 case so it's a little up there

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.050 
it's $52 case so it's a little up there
in<00:02:45.900> price<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.470> little<00:02:47.010> expensive<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:47.880> more

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
in price a little expensive it's more

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.030 
in price a little expensive it's more
than<00:02:48.210> $30<00:02:48.720> which<00:02:48.990> in<00:02:49.110> my<00:02:49.200> opinion<00:02:49.320> is<00:02:49.590> an

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
than $30 which in my opinion is an

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.880 
than $30 which in my opinion is an
affordable<00:02:50.280> case<00:02:50.670> but<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:52.410> know<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.560> think

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
affordable case but you know I think

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.990 
affordable case but you know I think
it's<00:02:53.010> definitely<00:02:53.160> worth<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.490> money<00:02:53.700> just<00:02:53.850> for

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
it's definitely worth the money just for

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.430 
it's definitely worth the money just for
the<00:02:54.060> craftsmanship<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:54.810> case<00:02:55.080> will<00:02:55.260> last

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
the craftsmanship in this case will last

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.960 
the craftsmanship in this case will last
for<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> really<00:02:55.710> long<00:02:55.950> time<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.400> my<00:02:56.490> opinion

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970
