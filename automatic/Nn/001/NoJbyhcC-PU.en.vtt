there's a skin buying technology which

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.410 
there's a skin buying technology which
litt<00:02:38.310> actually<00:02:38.760> lifts<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.090> hair<00:02:39.300> off<00:02:39.390> the

roof<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.020> it's<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.980> lot<00:02:41.190> better<00:02:41.520> because<00:02:41.760> it

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
roof and it's a lot better because it

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.040

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.250 
Sunday um the hair is kind of growing
back<00:03:56.330> but<00:03:56.750> it's<00:03:57.500> quite<00:03:58.340> light<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.720> it's<00:04:00.020> quite

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
back but it's quite light and it's quite

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.700 
back but it's quite light and it's quite
thin<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:02.390> hasn't<00:04:02.840> fully<00:04:02.960> grown<00:04:03.260> back<00:04:03.440> yet

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
thin and it hasn't fully grown back yet

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.440 
thin and it hasn't fully grown back yet
it's<00:04:03.890> just<00:04:04.040> started<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.430> sprout<00:04:04.700> out<00:04:04.970> at<00:04:05.330> the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
it's just started to sprout out at the

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.640 
it's just started to sprout out at the
moment<00:04:05.600> so<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:08.000> has<00:04:08.390> worked<00:04:08.690> quite<00:04:08.900> well<00:04:09.020> and

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
moment so it has worked quite well and

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.640 
moment so it has worked quite well and
it<00:04:10.210> definitely<00:04:11.380> was<00:04:12.380> worth<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.830> money<00:04:12.860> I

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
it definitely was worth the money I

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.229 
it definitely was worth the money I
would<00:04:15.650> recommend<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:16.459> people<00:04:16.700> who<00:04:17.060> are
