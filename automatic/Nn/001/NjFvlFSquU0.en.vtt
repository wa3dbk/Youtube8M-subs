00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:04.450
 when Andreas Bartels from the max-planck-institut works on his work 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.710
 he pursued a neurological draw 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.680
 he was looking for women and men who were terribly in love and 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.710
 examined their brain function Â»today he is a networker 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.999
 but then met 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.020
 Here were pictures of the loved one 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.329
 alternating with those of friends 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.019
 compared this child and found out how "image" emerges 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.110
 the main benefit really true that the WDR years 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.750
 and, interestingly, the exact areas 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.250
 any nonsense 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.330
 Reward systems sit 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.400
 a brain in love with his brain in the drug rush 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.950
 says Andreas Bartels 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.920
 by taking opiates 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.650
 the same brain regions are activated as in love 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.560
 perhaps four years may be enough to draw attention to life 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.580
 now is over 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.780
 there are 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.060
 under two percent I think was very important finding 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.670
 that in our second study 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880
 Russo maternal love went 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.130
 in other words, exactly the same areas of the brain have lit up love 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.270
 Occean from the mother 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.570
 Austin court dismissed or from a partner on the cultivation 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.750
 renovated the same they see in the background is therefore a beer 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.420
 Sontra region found that activates the one involved regions such as the one 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.900
 Investigators had usually light up 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.560
 When you're stressed out when you're worried about money 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.610
 especially supported 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.130
 and secondly 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.870
 was one the region Rheine 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.190
 a network of regions suppressed 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.760
 that usually also by the many people 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.950
 have the task 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.340
 To judge in other rooms, for example, the trustworthiness 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.640
 to judge a face 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.820
 or to make a moral decision 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.910
 these areas are also suppressed in the face 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.350
 of the beloved 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.600
 the entire journey now there are completely new study people 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:09.799
 That's me 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.989
 Benedict's bow to over a thousand individuals have proven it too 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:14.989
 People 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.919
 this variation of the RZ made 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:18.899
 to be massive 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:21.829
 Minden that the red bull team will 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.309
 the human 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:28.009
 Bonding behavior also influences us Davis a leather its form this 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:29.829
 also the Smiths the Third Line is 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.319
 Percentage associated with that is that people do a double 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:37.079
 both have a chance to get married, for example 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.309
 or you just that the sheet 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.189
 a double the probability 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.569
 percent 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.650
 the ehec crisis 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.360
 To have passage and that can be read by the genes 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.719
 Learning values 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.159
 since then it is quiet 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.959
 very well knows what a winged has to be sure that is 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:58.139
 Percent of the monkeys the reward system that we will get along with the 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.849
 see beloved or loved one 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.159
 then a picture of the sensory appeal of the Baltic Sea poured 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.020
 Percent increased 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.510
 and so on the beloved alone has already thought of the beloved 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:15.249
 for probably that distributions activation in the striatum reward system 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:19.419
 At the same time, all of those with negative emotions are revealed 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.279
 to have suppressed their activation 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:26.669
 That's sort of a push-pull mechanism of its ramped up refurbishment 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.329
 preserve and that is 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.480
 around the goal of the district 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.970
 they all stayed the same 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.280
 May make us happy yes what is love Percent of love is natural 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.099
 on 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.349
 wonderful feeling when in love 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.659
 first scuffles fully motivated sharing 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.729
 percent 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.199
 Most of the life has pink 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:54.389
 Percent on Wall Street could say from a biological point of view, love is 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.379
 Therefore, he is not becoming an addiction basically anytime it is in Tormann of Pop 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.309
 Sissi is 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.809
 Lower percent 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:07.149
 It is very selective on a partner's life focused on a drugstore 

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:08.749
 no one else just ideas 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.779
 and that is not replaceable and there are too 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.269
 Withdrawal symptoms appearances 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.539
 around 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:21.339
 which can get too close to those of the bird migration by what percent can indicate 

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.500
 Insomnia of the DAX is gentle and aggression
