when I started at the very very end of
August<00:03:29.349> it<00:03:30.349> was<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:30.739> hot<00:03:30.980> even<00:03:31.250> though<00:03:31.489> we<00:03:31.730> have

whole<00:03:51.579> electric<00:03:52.930> energy<00:03:53.930> crisis<00:03:54.739> right<00:03:54.919> now

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
whole electric energy crisis right now

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.629 
whole electric energy crisis right now
um<00:03:56.299> they're<00:03:57.260> going<00:03:57.409> to<00:03:57.470> start<00:03:57.650> a<00:03:57.859> blackout<00:03:58.340> so

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
um they're going to start a blackout so

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.729 
um they're going to start a blackout so
that<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:59.569> can<00:03:59.750> conserve<00:04:00.109> some<00:04:00.560> energy<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:02.739> when

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
that it can conserve some energy so when

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.469
