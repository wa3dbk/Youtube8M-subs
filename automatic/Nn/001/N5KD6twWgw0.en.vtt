00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.030 
usually don't keep my makeup right here
but<00:02:29.690> since<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.230> lighting<00:02:30.530> was<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.680> little<00:02:30.920> bit

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
but since the lighting was a little bit

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.420 
but since the lighting was a little bit
better<00:02:31.190> over<00:02:31.610> here<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:32.150> decided<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.470> shoot<00:02:34.280> over

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
here so again I'll probably do two parts

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
and let's get started what i have now

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.260 
and let's get started what i have now
this<00:02:41.780> bin<00:02:41.989> I<00:02:42.290> hate<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.190> much<00:02:43.250> because<00:02:44.030> when

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
this bin I hate it so much because when

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.940 
this bin I hate it so much because when
you<00:02:44.330> pull<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.540> drawers<00:02:44.870> out<00:02:45.110> they<00:02:45.320> don't<00:02:45.440> stop

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
you pull the drawers out they don't stop

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.130 
you pull the drawers out they don't stop
they<00:02:46.190> come<00:02:46.340> all<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.850> way<00:02:46.880> out<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.810> have<00:02:47.989> the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
they come all the way out so I have the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.229 
they come all the way out so I have the
tendency<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.920> pull<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.820> drought<00:02:50.090> and

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
tendency to pull the drought and

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.759 
tendency to pull the drought and
everything<00:02:50.540> falls<00:02:50.810> all<00:02:50.989> over<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.230> place<00:02:51.410> so

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
everything falls all over the place so

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.949 
everything falls all over the place so
I'm<00:02:52.670> just<00:02:52.850> going<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.060> pull<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.570> drawer<00:02:53.720> all

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
I'm just going to pull the drawer all

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.720 
I'm just going to pull the drawer all
the<00:02:54.080> way<00:02:54.200> out<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.680> can<00:02:54.860> see<00:02:55.190> everything

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730
