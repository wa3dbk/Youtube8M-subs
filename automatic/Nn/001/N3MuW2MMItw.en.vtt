different colors different shapes
different<00:02:34.800> angles<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.489> while<00:02:35.850> yes<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.239> can

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
different angles so while yes you can

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.880

spend<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> extra<00:02:36.810> time<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.350> make<00:02:37.560> sure<00:02:37.620> they

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
spend the extra time to make sure they

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.590 
spend the extra time to make sure they
look<00:02:38.010> pretty<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.610> nice<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.060> straight<00:02:39.390> the

look pretty and nice and straight the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.210 
look pretty and nice and straight the
cotta<00:02:39.780> makes<00:02:40.019> no<00:02:40.170> sense<00:02:40.440> considering<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:41.100> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
cotta makes no sense considering it's a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.220 
cotta makes no sense considering it's a
Halloween<00:02:41.519> recipe<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.810> way<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.050> think

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
Halloween recipe so that way I think

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.320 
Halloween recipe so that way I think
they<00:02:43.500> look<00:02:43.650> more<00:02:43.920> effective<00:02:44.400> just<00:02:44.850> like<00:02:45.090> this

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
they look more effective just like this

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.660 
they look more effective just like this
but<00:02:45.930> let's<00:02:46.380> see<00:02:46.530> what<00:02:46.620> they<00:02:46.739> taste<00:02:46.890> like

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
there really is a very very interesting

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.680 
there really is a very very interesting
mix<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.830> flavors<00:02:57.220> in<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.700> Apple<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.270> caramel
