00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.030 

all<00:00:04.790> right<00:00:04.910> so<00:00:05.060> I<00:00:05.090> tighten<00:00:05.420> down<00:00:05.710> these<00:00:06.710> nuts

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
all right so I tighten down these nuts

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.160 
all right so I tighten down these nuts
and<00:00:07.250> of<00:00:07.310> course<00:00:07.519> they're<00:00:07.970> quarter-inch<00:00:08.930> nuts

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
and of course they're quarter-inch nuts

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.449 
and of course they're quarter-inch nuts
so<00:00:09.379> it<00:00:09.469> takes<00:00:09.620> a<00:00:09.710> 7/16<00:00:10.490> inch<00:00:10.840> wrench<00:00:12.160> and<00:00:13.160> again

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:13.459 
so it takes a 7/16 inch wrench and again

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.080 
so it takes a 7/16 inch wrench and again
the<00:00:13.580> reason<00:00:14.000> these<00:00:14.990> are<00:00:15.170> so<00:00:15.379> long<00:00:15.699> is<00:00:16.699> to<00:00:16.940> mount

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
the reason these are so long is to mount

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.050 
the reason these are so long is to mount
the<00:00:17.270> fuse<00:00:18.170> panel<00:00:18.460> bring<00:00:19.460> this<00:00:19.550> over<00:00:19.730> I'll<00:00:19.910> show

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
the fuse panel bring this over I'll show

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.960 
the fuse panel bring this over I'll show
you<00:00:20.119> here's<00:00:20.509> one<00:00:20.689> little<00:00:20.839> mounting<00:00:21.259> tab<00:00:21.970> see

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
you here's one little mounting tab see

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.999 
you here's one little mounting tab see
it<00:00:23.060> it's<00:00:23.449> right<00:00:23.599> there<00:00:23.839> and<00:00:24.650> then<00:00:24.859> there's

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
it it's right there and then there's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.620 
it it's right there and then there's
another<00:00:25.189> one<00:00:25.429> right<00:00:26.150> there

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
another one right there

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.359 
another one right there
so<00:00:27.410> we've<00:00:27.679> left<00:00:27.859> those<00:00:28.150> bolts<00:00:29.150> nice<00:00:29.329> and<00:00:29.570> long

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
so we've left those bolts nice and long

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.190 
so we've left those bolts nice and long
and<00:00:31.369> see<00:00:31.519> those<00:00:31.669> bolts<00:00:31.970> are<00:00:32.090> secured<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:33.079> now<00:00:33.170> I

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
and see those bolts are secured so now I

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.630 
and see those bolts are secured so now I
don't<00:00:33.350> have<00:00:33.590> to<00:00:33.710> go<00:00:33.829> on<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.070> other<00:00:34.190> side<00:00:34.460> with

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
don't have to go on the other side with

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.850 
don't have to go on the other side with
a<00:00:34.670> wrench<00:00:34.940> to<00:00:35.030> hold<00:00:35.150> them<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:35.780> could<00:00:36.470> just<00:00:36.620> put

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
a wrench to hold them I could just put

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.170 
a wrench to hold them I could just put
my<00:00:37.360> fuse<00:00:38.360> panel<00:00:38.750> into<00:00:39.560> place<00:00:40.420> slide<00:00:41.420> it<00:00:41.570> on<00:00:41.750> and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
my fuse panel into place slide it on and

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.530 
my fuse panel into place slide it on and
then<00:00:44.180> take<00:00:44.390> those<00:00:44.540> other<00:00:44.750> two<00:00:44.960> nuts<00:00:45.490> lit<00:00:46.490> up<00:00:46.610> on

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.170 

and<00:00:50.540> just<00:00:50.780> connect<00:00:51.110> just<00:00:52.070> thread<00:00:52.910> them<00:00:53.030> on

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
and just connect just thread them on

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.060 
and just connect just thread them on
there<00:00:53.360> like<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.910> now<00:00:56.360> removing<00:00:57.350> the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
there like that and now removing the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.270 
there like that and now removing the
fuse<00:00:58.340> panel<00:00:58.810> it's<00:00:59.810> just<00:00:59.990> a<00:01:00.080> one-man<00:01:00.440> job<00:01:03.280> and

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
fuse panel it's just a one-man job and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.830 
fuse panel it's just a one-man job and
it's<00:01:04.519> nicely<00:01:04.810> secured<00:01:07.299> to<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.420> firewall<00:01:08.749> of

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
it's nicely secured to the firewall of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.999 
it's nicely secured to the firewall of
the<00:01:08.899> truck<00:01:10.840> so<00:01:11.840> that<00:01:11.869> little<00:01:12.259> portion<00:01:12.890> is

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
the truck so that little portion is

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.569 
the truck so that little portion is
finished<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.820> reason<00:01:17.149> you'll<00:01:17.869> kind<00:01:18.109> of

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
finished and the reason you'll kind of

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.730 
finished and the reason you'll kind of
if<00:01:19.579> you<00:01:19.729> can<00:01:19.850> see<00:01:20.030> right<00:01:20.060> there<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.780> little

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
if you can see right there the little

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.559 
if you can see right there the little
hole<00:01:21.950> for<00:01:21.979> that's<00:01:22.880> for<00:01:22.969> the<00:01:23.149> wires<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.479> go

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
hole for that's for the wires to go

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.739 
hole for that's for the wires to go
through<00:01:23.840> into<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.460> driver's<00:01:25.460> compartment

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:25.749 
through into the driver's compartment

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.809 
through into the driver's compartment
you'll<00:01:26.749> see<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.109> feast<00:01:27.319> like<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.130> mentioned

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
you'll see the feast like I mentioned

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.879 
you'll see the feast like I mentioned
before<00:01:28.850> these<00:01:29.329> are<00:01:29.359> the<00:01:29.539> two<00:01:32.649> these<00:01:33.649> are<00:01:33.799> the

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:33.889 
before these are the two these are the

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:36.309 
before these are the two these are the
two<00:01:34.039> bundles<00:01:34.280> right<00:01:34.579> here<00:01:35.049> that<00:01:36.049> need<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.259> be

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
two bundles right here that need to be

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.859 
two bundles right here that need to be
fed<00:01:36.560> through<00:01:36.799> that<00:01:36.920> hole<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.399> they're<00:01:38.329> kinda

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
fed through that hole and they're kinda

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.450 
fed through that hole and they're kinda
you<00:01:39.409> can<00:01:39.560> see<00:01:39.679> where<00:01:39.859> this<00:01:39.950> one's<00:01:40.219> kind<00:01:40.429> of

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
you can see where this one's kind of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.190 
you can see where this one's kind of
wire<00:01:40.670> tied<00:01:40.969> around<00:01:41.119> that<00:01:41.479> I'm<00:01:41.929> going<00:01:42.079> to<00:01:42.109> try

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
wire tied around that I'm going to try

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.410 
wire tied around that I'm going to try
and<00:01:42.350> leave<00:01:42.439> that<00:01:42.649> wire<00:01:42.829> tie<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:43.189> place<00:01:43.490> that's

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
and leave that wire tie in place that's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.629 
and leave that wire tie in place that's
why<00:01:44.509> I<00:01:44.569> drilled<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:44.869> hole<00:01:44.960> there<00:01:45.639> because

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
why I drilled that hole there because

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.169 
why I drilled that hole there because
it's<00:01:46.819> right<00:01:47.149> level<00:01:47.749> with<00:01:48.679> this<00:01:48.859> bundle<00:01:49.310> so

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
it's right level with this bundle so

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.940 
it's right level with this bundle so
we'll<00:01:50.420> just<00:01:50.600> feed<00:01:51.139> the<00:01:51.319> wires<00:01:51.499> through<00:01:51.619> there

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
we'll just feed the wires through there

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.550 
we'll just feed the wires through there
and<00:01:52.719> then<00:01:53.719> we'll<00:01:53.810> be<00:01:53.929> ready<00:01:54.079> to<00:01:54.200> start<00:01:54.319> hooking

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
and then we'll be ready to start hooking

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.219 
and then we'll be ready to start hooking
things<00:01:54.920> up<00:01:55.100> I<00:01:55.539> just<00:01:56.539> wanted<00:01:56.719> to<00:01:56.810> give<00:01:56.929> you<00:01:56.959> one

things up I just wanted to give you one
more<00:01:57.259> shot<00:01:57.579> of<00:01:58.579> how<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.229> fuse<00:02:00.229> panel<00:02:00.409> is

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
more shot of how the fuse panel is

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.590 
more shot of how the fuse panel is
actually<00:02:00.799> mounted<00:02:01.279> in<00:02:01.399> here<00:02:01.639> so<00:02:02.329> we'll<00:02:02.420> come

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
actually mounted in here so we'll come

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.789

up and look at it from the top you can

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.429 
up and look at it from the top you can
see<00:02:03.950> what<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.549> was<00:02:04.639> talking<00:02:04.700> about<00:02:04.999> before<00:02:05.439> this

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
see what I was talking about before this

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:07.959 
see what I was talking about before this
little<00:02:06.709> plastic<00:02:06.889> area<00:02:07.399> around<00:02:07.639> the<00:02:07.789> turn

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
little plastic area around the turn

signal relay mount if it's an inch over
its<00:02:14.060> contacting<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:14.870> little<00:02:15.110> catch<00:02:15.349> right

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
its contacting this little catch right

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.290 
its contacting this little catch right
here<00:02:15.830> on<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.760> park

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
here on the park

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.630 
here on the park
brake<00:02:17.510> assembly<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:19.100> that's<00:02:19.280> why<00:02:19.370> we<00:02:19.490> had<00:02:19.610> to

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
brake assembly so that's why we had to

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.780 
brake assembly so that's why we had to
drill<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.030> holes<00:02:20.210> one<00:02:21.020> inch<00:02:21.200> over<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:22.610> clear

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
drill the holes one inch over to clear

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.050 
drill the holes one inch over to clear
that<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.210> is<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.390> round<00:02:26.050> relay<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.940> know

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
that and it is a round relay so you know

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.540 
that and it is a round relay so you know
you<00:02:29.120> could<00:02:29.480> trim<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.110> off<00:02:30.400> but<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.520> still

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
you could trim this off but you still

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.970 
you could trim this off but you still
got<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:31.910> big<00:02:32.390> round<00:02:32.600> relay<00:02:33.080> in<00:02:33.260> there<00:02:33.440> that's

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
got a big round relay in there that's

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.580 
got a big round relay in there that's
going<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.190> be<00:02:34.310> catching<00:02:34.550> on<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.820> so<00:02:35.660> you

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
going to be catching on that so you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.220 
going to be catching on that so you
don't<00:02:36.680> want<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.040> know<00:02:37.540> pop<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:39.170> thing

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
don't want that you know pop this thing

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.350 
don't want that you know pop this thing
to<00:02:39.560> pop<00:02:40.250> your<00:02:40.460> little<00:02:40.550> relay<00:02:40.910> out<00:02:41.090> then<00:02:41.300> you

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
to pop your little relay out then you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.110 
to pop your little relay out then you
don't<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.630> turn<00:02:41.870> signals<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.880> that's<00:02:43.880> why<00:02:43.970> we

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
don't have turn signals so that's why we

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.650 
don't have turn signals so that's why we
drilled<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.450> an<00:02:44.540> inch<00:02:44.690> over<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:46.390> come<00:02:47.390> on<00:02:47.510> here

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
drilled in an inch over so come on here

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.010 
drilled in an inch over so come on here
we'll<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:48.760> different<00:02:49.760> angles<00:02:50.060> on<00:02:50.210> it<00:02:50.270> and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
we'll just different angles on it and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.150 
we'll just different angles on it and
I'll<00:02:51.140> let<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.320> two<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.560> pedals

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
I'll let the two the pedals

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.130 
I'll let the two the pedals
probably<00:02:53.150> not<00:02:53.270> a<00:02:53.300> good<00:02:53.360> shot<00:02:53.810> but<00:02:55.900> that's<00:02:56.900> it

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
probably not a good shot but that's it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.650 
probably not a good shot but that's it
that's<00:02:57.260> how<00:02:57.380> we<00:02:57.440> get<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.710> mounted<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:59.330> so<00:02:59.540> now

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
that's how we get it mounted and so now

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.440 
that's how we get it mounted and so now
we<00:02:59.720> just<00:02:59.810> go<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.080> run<00:03:00.230> wires
