 and we are finally in red again 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.059
 spain i wanted it takes a while 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.780
 because it is the wash three days in between 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.859
 four 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.660
 but I have mountains listen to you 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.800
 see suggestions from your lip during the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.260
 delivery must be against the bit 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.029
 4332 the variant baby your team pair 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 interesting space I must say very 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.170
 classic looking i have to be good at it 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.789
 really good but I'll be on a form or 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.980
 because I shoot him 100 again 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.510
 in the also of the goal and how duo 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 first know for sure in the top three 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.730
 best budget striker in the game absolutely 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.200
 the may first be a discussion about the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.700
 my opinion but I have the tires here 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.540
 by three co on the wing give him too 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.309
 just for 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.600
 look at the rates it self can do that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.520
 he is like that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.899
 multifunctional though, but he cuts it 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.270
 he has the ball that scans the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.739
 wing short completely not well defended 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.030
 I care for keeper knows how to save 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.520
 by three o'clock there stands for the full 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.559
 moon and then it is already two 0's and it will come 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.329
 but with a shot on the pole that makes 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.890
 is unfortunately with the game for them because me 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.650
 've got the ball with bullshit walk to the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.610
 defender a no bob roderigo for 3 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.350
 against 0 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.450
 he does it through my had when he shoots 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.010
 I have to say he is very good inside 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.330
 especially if you have no no to that nails 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.250
 every ns deity always is that of whole 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.470
 good completion but ball with bush kids 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.780
 on rodrigo and you guessed it one here 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.270
 you have another four goals of rotary go 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.259
 corner and headed for 4 pairs with 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.850
 one may no longer matter 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.680
 I want this first game of 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.360
 episode with the four two which is gay 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.549
 because of course works towards that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.590
 division 5 title in extra conical 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.840
 we hopefully iniesta go so fast 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.360
 possibly the I just need this completely 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 english team how not as good as it 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.299
 could be but you know each one 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.680
 thing he is maybe a little low 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.950
 budget here case you come through 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.270
 pitch on theo and I want to know this 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.240
 do you think its really in shape 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.950
 is necessary because if you can notice it 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.090
 normal carp became vault but he 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.159
 scores his second goal here 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.450
 competition and really has violence 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.170
 us to know the michael score 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.090
 you need him 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.100
 show me that indeed as I say 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.810
 this in the comments I am curious because 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.369
 otherwise I might have to save myself from it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.689
 otherwise it might not be necessary 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.579
 With this man, you come in third place 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.930
 good cross shot in tight 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.270
 the short corner 3 but then here 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.590
 ball on through for the pier one and he 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.319
 is less two-digit minutes close 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.450
 these men 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.650
 what i do understand i wim the four one 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.299
 which is just fine 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.049
 we are now on 13 points in that vision 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:22.180
 by this 442 weekend 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.530
 can be good so formation if you 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.969
 know how to use it 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.319
 checking out in baking form converts to is 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.639
 very often common wall stitch 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.739
 beware there is via 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.540
 david via is so good guys really 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.310
 please use it for too long 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.230
 for week do that before you play with your 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.959
 I'm going to tell him top martinus that is 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.219
 200 discover eleven minutes and you know how 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.909
 let it be he has tree felling here 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.010
 honey 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.530
 literally save the one for a few seconds 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.150
 little bit of fuss here comes two one 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.019
 bit of a scrappy goal but I shoot 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.549
 on the pole 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.609
 then I have an open door and I knock it 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.079
 about yes I will indeed come over you but me 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.969
 are you right again mentally through 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.459
 and those who score in the two want him now 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:59.469
 three one then it seems like game over 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.699
 is not lived campaign with the balloon 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.500
 hkz 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:04.540
 header went past r32 but I thought 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.439
 that you have one in a one ball money 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.680
 that be the can happen to anyone 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:11.379
 but here the steak of the year 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.260
 Guys This is the best if that's you 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.509
 ever going to see that fits so horribly me 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.459
 may have come in first me but he wins 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:19.689
 what if we both don't want it 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.220
 because we are playing equal to, I have to 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.989
 this team through a two and two and french 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.120
 tywin letty pÃ©rez say in from krisman 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.220
 plug from benzema a lot of informs 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.359
 very very expensive team very good too and 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.259
 I am already right with the first side 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.639
 bus quets 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.169
 he can't really shoot shot I'm going 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.299
 font come you i had by people 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.769
 his clear scored a zero but something 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.989
 more than a minute with 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.669
 Rodrigo in you guessed it already two your help 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.290
 played by after 19 minutes 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.540
 about a good 3 how then with the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.430
 bal so duo is also very good for link a 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.049
 player's not knowing it means 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.849
 just point your mind ball keeps it 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.439
 a bit stuck otherwise he joins 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.449
 Paul knew by Easter 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.370
 very handy to have it is at 3 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.169
 0 so sees and goes our plan then come 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.269
 pogba suddenly f a tough banging boy 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.949
 hanging out scores the green again 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.319
 long shot that he got through with am heavy 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.549
 balk jokari the man and that's the two 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.979
 three already arrive for him 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.259
 yes indeed I disrupted this now not me 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:10.870
 win with three two fairly straight if you 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:12.939
 session your very 17 points are how they stand in 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.620
 gedit team not in a lot of cams 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.150
 technology sleeve got new for cam 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.280
 but the market was not out because he 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.779
 used this is it will be good click 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.760
 again right on with sweetness and that 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.930
 cry my ship beautiful here then determine 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.010
 you just know this is a one in 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.520
 the game will get me more with 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.650
 would be 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.259
 at the Rodrigo knows through the 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.720
 Kruijver I scored 1 to 0 in the 36th 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.220
 minute had this man was absolutely rica 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.080
 clouds a good stitch until scolding 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.210
 beaches can finish this man well 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.069
 that is why he scores the one 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.599
 one that seems very lamb all the same 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.699
 to become because of what happens 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:44.229
 nothing at all until e certainly no pedo me 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.669
 can already be done outside 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.050
 just work through death petrus 5 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.669
 louis for shooting with help and 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.400
 scored 2 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.710
 a wonderful win takes 20 points that 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.050
 vision title won completely nice because 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.190
 I like Skoda Casillas who want to be very whole here 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.259
 long syncope with the hans of themsche 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.370
 suppose i want i always take keepers' 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.889
 if i can because it is simply the best 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.569
 suggests theo cookbook in my opinion 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.580
 theo of 24 escape his very well 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.530
 contract and now this is on steam 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.849
 pretty good that's going in the right direction 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.349
 I am curious if he also has Division 4 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.610
 able to overcome but thank you 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.870
 you do for looking like the 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.639
 Dockers enjoyed that subscribers did not 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.050
 layer of suggestion behind 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.900
 are on budget but within the 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.639
 10k fun I had to get for that 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.180
 I am curious and I would love to see you 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.180
 again later
