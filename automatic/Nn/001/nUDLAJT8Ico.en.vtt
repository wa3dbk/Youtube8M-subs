minutes

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.910 
minutes
of<00:00:17.670> flashbacks<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.720> they<00:00:19.109> weren't<00:00:19.439> so

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
of flashbacks but they weren't so

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.250 
of flashbacks but they weren't so
unbearable<00:00:20.730> they<00:00:20.880> were<00:00:20.970> placed<00:00:21.300> at<00:00:21.570> moments

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
unbearable they were placed at moments

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.220 
unbearable they were placed at moments
where<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.560> guess<00:00:23.189> they<00:00:23.730> were<00:00:23.869> necessary<00:00:24.869> and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
where I guess they were necessary and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.800 
where I guess they were necessary and
fitting<00:00:26.130> there<00:00:26.490> was<00:00:26.670> definitely<00:00:27.119> parts<00:00:27.510> where

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
fitting there was definitely parts where

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.960 
fitting there was definitely parts where
they<00:00:28.140> kind<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.560> extended<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> flashback<00:00:29.820> too

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
they kind of extended the flashback too

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.269 
they kind of extended the flashback too
much<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.449> when<00:00:30.660> Naruto<00:00:30.900> was<00:00:31.710> talking<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
much like when Naruto was talking on the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.729 
much like when Naruto was talking on the
bridge<00:00:32.550> with<00:00:32.910> Kakashi<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:34.050> wasn't<00:00:34.559> who

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
bridge with Kakashi that wasn't who

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.709 
bridge with Kakashi that wasn't who
needed<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.880> okay<00:00:36.180> whatever<00:00:36.510> it's

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
needed to but it's okay whatever it's

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.000 
needed to but it's okay whatever it's
it's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.079> little<00:00:37.200> bit<00:00:37.320> more<00:00:37.500> bearable<00:00:37.860> than

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
it's a little bit more bearable than

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.889

and at the ending of course we end with
sort<00:04:08.970> of<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.390> guess<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.990> cliffhanger<00:04:10.440> because<00:04:11.010> we

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
sort of I guess a cliffhanger because we

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.210 
sort of I guess a cliffhanger because we
get<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.370> see<00:04:11.400> some<00:04:11.580> of<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.090> leaf<00:04:12.900> eleven<00:04:13.830> fight

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
and that was just something like you

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.599 
and that was just something like you
know<00:04:16.500> random<00:04:16.799> fight<00:04:16.979> so<00:04:17.100> now<00:04:17.190> we<00:04:17.250> could<00:04:17.400> see

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609

unnecessary flashbacks but still

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.440 
unnecessary flashbacks but still
definitely<00:04:44.220> some<00:04:44.550> parts<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:44.880> complain<00:04:45.240> about

but when it comes to the canon aspect of
this<00:04:47.970> episode<00:04:48.480> definitely<00:04:49.260> deserves<00:04:49.920> like<00:04:50.220> an

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
this episode definitely deserves like an
