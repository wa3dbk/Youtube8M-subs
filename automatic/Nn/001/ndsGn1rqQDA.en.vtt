violets true add a bang here because

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.440 
violets true add a bang here because
when<00:00:03.810> you've<00:00:03.959> added<00:00:04.110> straps<00:00:04.859> rings<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:06.089> straps

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
when you've added straps rings to straps

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.870 
when you've added straps rings to straps
sometimes<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.109> get<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.470> floppy<00:00:08.099> effect<00:00:08.639> and

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880

what<00:00:09.000> I'm<00:00:09.179> aiming<00:00:09.630> for<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.769> give<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.099> bag<00:00:11.309> a

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
what I'm aiming for is to give the bag a

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.580 
what I'm aiming for is to give the bag a
little<00:00:11.820> bit<00:00:11.969> more<00:00:12.210> structure<00:00:12.840> by<00:00:13.110> adding<00:00:13.139> a

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
little bit more structure by adding a

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.829 
little bit more structure by adding a
couple<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.920> eyelets<00:00:14.370> there<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.450> holding

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
couple of eyelets there and it's holding

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.680 
couple of eyelets there and it's holding
the<00:00:16.350> straps<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:16.920> place<00:00:17.190> against<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.880> ring<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
on the strap and normally I would use a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.610 
on the strap and normally I would use a
marker<00:00:38.969> point<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> market<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.020> see<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.379> yes

marker point to market can we see it yes

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.709 
marker point to market can we see it yes
we<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.610> should<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:41.879> used<00:00:42.000> chalk<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.540> that

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
we can I should have used chalk on that

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.450 
we can I should have used chalk on that
point<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:45.059> using<00:00:45.660> my<00:00:45.809> Sadler's<00:00:46.440> punch<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
point and I'm using my Sadler's punch to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.459 
point and I'm using my Sadler's punch to
punch<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.879> hole<00:00:48.059> straight<00:00:48.510> through<00:00:48.629> all<00:00:49.230> layers

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
punch a hole straight through all layers

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.959 
punch a hole straight through all layers
there's<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.280> bit<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.579> bang<00:00:50.760> now

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
there's going to be a bit of a bang now

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.610 
there's going to be a bit of a bang now
a<00:00:52.940> nice<00:00:53.940> neat<00:00:54.270> hole<00:00:54.539> through<00:00:55.170> both<00:00:55.230> layers

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
a nice neat hole through both layers

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.510 
a nice neat hole through both layers
both<00:00:56.399> straps<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:58.050> hole<00:00:58.230> should<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.039> little

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
both straps the hole should be a little

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.000 
both straps the hole should be a little
bit<00:00:59.670> smaller<00:01:00.120> than<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.809> actual<00:01:00.989> eyelid<00:01:01.680> so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
bit smaller than the actual eyelid so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.609 
bit smaller than the actual eyelid so
that<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.699> force<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.870> fabric<00:01:04.409> over

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that you have to force the fabric over

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.880 
that you have to force the fabric over
the<00:01:05.280> eyelet<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.360> that's<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.500> doesn't

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the eyelet and that's so that it doesn't

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.460 
the eyelet and that's so that it doesn't
wobble<00:01:08.070> around<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.090> loose<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.900> there<00:01:12.470> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
wobble around and get loose in there the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.210 
wobble around and get loose in there the
front<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> eyelid<00:01:14.540> goes<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.380> this

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
front of the eyelid goes on to this

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.760 
front of the eyelid goes on to this
little<00:01:17.640> doughnut<00:01:18.479> shaped<00:01:18.840> part<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
little doughnut shaped part of the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.260 
little doughnut shaped part of the
setting<00:01:20.130> tool<00:01:20.460> goes<00:01:21.390> down<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:23.270> then

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
setting tool goes down on there and then

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.690 
setting tool goes down on there and then
there's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> washer<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:26.130> goes<00:01:26.720> on<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> back

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
there's a washer that goes on the back

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
there's a washer that goes on the back
like<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.079> other<00:01:31.259> part<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
like that and then the other part of the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.149 
like that and then the other part of the
setting<00:01:32.130> tool<00:01:32.400> stops<00:01:33.030> down<00:01:33.390> inside<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.829> tube

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
setting tool stops down inside the tube

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.090 
setting tool stops down inside the tube
part<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> eyelet<00:01:36.710> it's<00:01:37.710> all<00:01:37.829> nice<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
part of the eyelet it's all nice and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
part of the eyelet it's all nice and
firm<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.850> there<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.270> then<00:01:39.360> another<00:01:39.479> loud<00:01:39.900> bang

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
firm in there and then another loud bang

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
firm in there and then another loud bang
or<00:01:40.409> two<00:01:42.110> or<00:01:43.110> three<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.939> you've<00:01:44.939> got<00:01:45.119> an<00:01:45.210> eyelet

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
or two or three and you've got an eyelet

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.469 
or two or three and you've got an eyelet
in<00:01:45.750> there<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.310> that's<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.299> it

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
in there and that's all there is to it

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.330 
in there and that's all there is to it
so<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.380> put<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.759> more<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:52.280> you'll<00:01:53.280> see

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so I put one more in here and you'll see

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.920 
so I put one more in here and you'll see
the<00:01:53.640> difference<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.270> makes<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the difference that it makes to the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.920 
the difference that it makes to the
strap<00:01:57.170> push<00:01:58.170> those<00:01:58.700> it's<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.880> fabric<00:02:00.390> over<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930

back<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> eyelet<00:02:03.979> put<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.159> head<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
back of the eyelet put the head on the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.120 
back of the eyelet put the head on the
setting<00:02:06.060> tool

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
setting tool

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.440 
setting tool
is<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> fabric<00:02:09.350> there<00:02:10.350> it<00:02:10.440> goes<00:02:10.650> again

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:23.780 

washer<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:17.180> setting<00:02:18.180> tool<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:22.430> couple<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.550> bangs

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
washer on setting tool a couple of bangs

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.100 
washer on setting tool a couple of bangs
and<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.510> we<00:02:24.630> go

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and there we go

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.750 
and there we go
I<00:02:25.140> could<00:02:25.620> probably<00:02:25.740> do<00:02:26.100> one<00:02:26.280> more<00:02:26.400> bang<00:02:26.610> on

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
I could probably do one more bang on

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.810 
I could probably do one more bang on
that<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:30.470> thanks<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.770> we're<00:02:32.640> in

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
that one and thanks to like we're in

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.420 
that one and thanks to like we're in
okay<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.440> that's<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.830> Scopes<00:02:35.100> there<00:02:35.190> they

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
okay so that's the Scopes there they

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.820 
okay so that's the Scopes there they
just<00:02:35.640> sit<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.390> much<00:02:36.600> better<00:02:37.200> they're<00:02:37.680> not

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
just sit so much better they're not

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.390 
just sit so much better they're not
collapsing<00:02:38.370> into<00:02:38.520> themselves<00:02:39.740> so<00:02:40.740> that's<00:02:41.220> all

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
collapsing into themselves so that's all

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.000 
collapsing into themselves so that's all
there<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.880> it
