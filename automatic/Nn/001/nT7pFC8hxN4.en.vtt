00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
thought well why didn't he put it on the

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.910 
thought well why didn't he put it on the
wall<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:46.910> actually<00:00:47.210> I<00:00:47.480> wondered<00:00:47.839> since<00:00:48.679> then

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
wall and actually I wondered since then

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.709 
wall and actually I wondered since then
when<00:00:49.100> I've<00:00:49.309> just<00:00:49.339> been<00:00:49.670> pursuing<00:00:50.179> a<00:00:50.359> career<00:00:50.539> of

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
when I've just been pursuing a career of

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.750 
when I've just been pursuing a career of
revenge<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:51.620> know<00:00:51.980> thinking<00:00:52.309> every<00:00:52.519> time<00:00:52.670> I

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
revenge you know thinking every time I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.439 
revenge you know thinking every time I

most<00:00:57.379> of<00:00:57.499> my<00:00:57.620> poem<00:00:57.890> starts<00:00:58.100> as<00:00:58.429> little

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
most of my poem starts as little

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.470 
most of my poem starts as little
daydreams<00:00:59.269> really<00:01:00.230> an<00:01:00.530> idea<00:01:01.210> leads<00:01:02.210> to

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
daydreams really an idea leads to

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.020 
daydreams really an idea leads to
another<00:01:02.719> idea<00:01:03.260> leads<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.890> another<00:01:04.100> idea<00:01:04.640> and

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
another idea leads to another idea and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.200 
another idea leads to another idea and
really<00:01:05.930> before<00:01:06.409> I<00:01:06.710> know<00:01:06.950> what<00:01:07.580> I'm<00:01:07.790> doing<00:01:08.090> I'm

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
really before I know what I'm doing I'm

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.200 
really before I know what I'm doing I'm
some<00:01:08.540> way<00:01:08.780> into<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.800> poem<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.580> I<00:01:10.940> started

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
some way into the poem and I started

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.970 
some way into the poem and I started
snap<00:01:11.540> out<00:01:11.750> of<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.050> daydream<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.740> think

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
snap out of the daydream and think

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.100 
snap out of the daydream and think
actually<00:01:13.700> that's<00:01:14.240> that's<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.810> stuff<00:01:15.080> that

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
actually that's that's the stuff that

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.470 
actually that's that's the stuff that
poems<00:01:15.650> are<00:01:15.770> made<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:16.160> and<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:16.970> at<00:01:17.120> that<00:01:17.240> point

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
poems are made of and it's at that point

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.050 
poems are made of and it's at that point
that<00:01:17.600> I'll<00:01:17.840> sit<00:01:18.410> down<00:01:18.440> and<00:01:18.620> I<00:01:19.040> start<00:01:19.730> writing

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
that I'll sit down and I start writing

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.990 
that I'll sit down and I start writing
it<00:01:20.360> out<00:01:20.510> as<00:01:20.570> language<00:01:21.350> I've<00:01:22.130> always<00:01:22.520> been

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
it out as language I've always been

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.310 
it out as language I've always been
interested<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:24.730> poetry<00:01:25.730> because<00:01:26.390> it's<00:01:26.660> it's

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
interested in poetry because it's it's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.630 
interested in poetry because it's it's
so<00:01:27.560> powerful<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.730> know<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.780> few<00:01:30.140> words<00:01:30.640> space

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
so powerful you know so few words space

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.630 
so powerful you know so few words space
on<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.240> page<00:01:32.420> all<00:01:32.810> around<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.410> so<00:01:33.680> there's<00:01:34.490> an

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
on the page all around it so there's an

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.010 
on the page all around it so there's an
intensity<00:01:35.240> there<00:01:35.900> that<00:01:36.500> I<00:01:36.530> admire<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.690> I<00:01:38.690> like

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
intensity there that I admire and I like

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.740 
intensity there that I admire and I like
the<00:01:39.200> idea<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.620> you<00:01:39.920> can<00:01:40.130> say<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.460> lot<00:01:40.790> with

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
the idea that you can say a lot with

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.990 
the idea that you can say a lot with
with<00:01:42.080> just<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.440> little<00:01:42.620> bit<00:01:42.830> I<00:01:43.340> think<00:01:43.820> I've

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
with just a little bit I think I've

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.420 
with just a little bit I think I've
always<00:01:44.120> liked<00:01:44.360> that<00:01:44.390> idea<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:45.050> less<00:01:45.320> is<00:01:45.590> more<00:01:46.040> I

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
always liked that idea of less is more I

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.390 
always liked that idea of less is more I
think<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.440> expectation<00:01:48.440> is<00:01:48.710> always<00:01:49.160> towards

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
think the expectation is always towards

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.470 
think the expectation is always towards

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
very clear read read and read yeah you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.119 
very clear read read and read yeah you
can't<00:02:31.579> write<00:02:31.849> unless<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.719> read<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.650> don't

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
that idea to paper I used to play a lot

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.789 
that idea to paper I used to play a lot
of<00:04:05.659> cricket<00:04:06.109> and<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:08.169> always<00:04:09.169> felt<00:04:09.620> there<00:04:09.739> was

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
of cricket and I always felt there was

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.759 
of cricket and I always felt there was
nothing<00:04:10.280> more<00:04:10.489> satisfying<00:04:10.970> and<00:04:11.930> then<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.590> take

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
nothing more satisfying and then to take

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.360 
nothing more satisfying and then to take
a<00:04:12.829> catch<00:04:13.419> just<00:04:14.419> when<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:15.049> ball<00:04:15.259> lands<00:04:15.769> right

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
a catch just when the ball lands right

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.939 
a catch just when the ball lands right
in<00:04:16.699> your<00:04:16.880> hand<00:04:17.120> that<00:04:17.620> split-second<00:04:18.620> when<00:04:18.799> your

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
in your hand that split-second when your

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.219 
in your hand that split-second when your
fingers<00:04:19.280> close<00:04:19.669> around<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.269> ball<00:04:20.479> and<00:04:20.780> the

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
fingers close around the ball and the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.860 
fingers close around the ball and the
catch<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.680> completed<00:04:22.400> I<00:04:22.759> always<00:04:23.630> made<00:04:23.780> me

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
catch is completed I always made me

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.589 
catch is completed I always made me
think<00:04:24.110> that<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.470> was<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.620> similar<00:04:25.599> satisfaction

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
think that it was a similar satisfaction

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.190 
think that it was a similar satisfaction
to<00:04:26.870> finishing<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.409> poem<00:04:27.760> closing<00:04:28.760> out<00:04:28.880> a<00:04:28.909> point

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
to finishing a poem closing out a point

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.970 
to finishing a poem closing out a point
your<00:04:30.950> fingers<00:04:31.340> around<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:32.720> last<00:04:32.960> full<00:04:33.590> stop

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
your fingers around the last full stop

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.520 
your fingers around the last full stop
so<00:04:34.520> this<00:04:34.700> this<00:04:34.880> point<00:04:35.060> tries<00:04:35.390> to<00:04:35.600> draw<00:04:36.290> those

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
so this this point tries to draw those

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.670 
so this this point tries to draw those
two<00:04:36.800> ideas<00:04:37.010> together<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.880> tie<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.150> with<00:04:38.420> one

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
two ideas together and tie it with one

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.480 
two ideas together and tie it with one
