00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
squeeze and then I'm gonna pick the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.960 
squeeze and then I'm gonna pick the
implement<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.310> see<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> twists

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
implement up as I do that see it twists

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
implement up as I do that see it twists
it<00:01:24.090> into<00:01:24.390> place<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.070> now<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:27.500> pressure<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.860> up

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
it into place so now the pressure is up

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.020 
it into place so now the pressure is up
here<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:30.150> down<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> bottom<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:31.500> palm<00:01:32.030> so

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
here or down on the bottom of my palm so

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.179 
here or down on the bottom of my palm so
I<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.229> didn't<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:34.740> grip<00:01:35.009> any

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
I I just I didn't get my grip any

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.600 
I I just I didn't get my grip any
stronger<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.060> put<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:37.350> handle<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
stronger I just put the handle in a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.800 
stronger I just put the handle in a
stronger<00:01:39.270> position<00:01:40.549> in<00:01:41.549> my<00:01:41.850> hand<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> just

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
stronger position in my hand so I just

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.690 
stronger position in my hand so I just
have<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.110> much<00:01:43.200> more<00:01:43.259> surface<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> starts

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
have so much more surface if it starts

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.010 
have so much more surface if it starts
to<00:01:44.850> slip<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.600> end<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.780> slipping

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
to slip it's going to end up slipping

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.649 
to slip it's going to end up slipping
into<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.560> second<00:01:46.979> position<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.640> I'll<00:01:48.509> be

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
into that second position and I'll be

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.940 
into that second position and I'll be
able<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.840> hold<00:01:49.020> onto<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.619> little<00:01:49.829> bit

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
able to hold onto it for a little bit

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.569 
able to hold onto it for a little bit
longer<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.750> painful<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.320> cut

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
longer and this is painful and I cut

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.429 
longer and this is painful and I cut
whereas<00:01:53.579> my<00:01:53.850> palm<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.299> into<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.659> squeeze

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
whereas my palm up into it squeeze

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.240 
whereas my palm up into it squeeze
squeeze<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:58.950> really

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
squeeze you see like that it's really
