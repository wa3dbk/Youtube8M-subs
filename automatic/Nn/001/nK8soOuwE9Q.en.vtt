00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:24.230
 one of the tips that we will analyze 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.710
 concerns the concentration of the player in the game then 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:32.509
 there is such a situation that 2 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.600
 player grandfather ball meaning they start a friend 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.270
 to a friend of the gear moment of transmission 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.150
 both raise their heads 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.270
 but what is going on left and right 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.390
 have develop a habit 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.850
 turn your head before and after taking the ball 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.850
 become boring that is it is very important now 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:58.900
 we will analyze the situation once or twice 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.680
 two before the reception again two 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:07.060
 It means that it gives us something to eat 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.479
 receiving the ball we already look like 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.240
 dispose of the sword and after you 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.640
 have worked with the ball you should already 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.009
 make quick decisions where to go 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.500
 how do you take the police this very 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.430
 important and often this whole thing happens 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.140
 just like that again rivals cheerfully on 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.909
 ball and still not doing 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.439
 doing my partner 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.509
 head and I, respectively, look down at 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:42.229
 Basically, I work out a simple transfer 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:45.189
 although it must be done exactly as shown 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.189
 well, at least so
