00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
happens but this time around it's going

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.800 
happens but this time around it's going
to<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.920> different<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.549> Goku<00:02:00.360> doesn't

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
to be different because Goku doesn't

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.950 
to be different because Goku doesn't
just<00:02:01.079> fight<00:02:01.380> him<00:02:01.649> by<00:02:01.979> himself<00:02:02.490> he's<00:02:03.329> got<00:02:03.600> maybe

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
just fight him by himself he's got maybe

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.459 
just fight him by himself he's got maybe
piccolo<00:02:04.920> Gohan<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.030> Krillin<00:02:06.570> with<00:02:06.750> him<00:02:06.960> so

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
piccolo Gohan and Krillin with him so

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.040 
piccolo Gohan and Krillin with him so
that's<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.520> change<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.629> outcome<00:02:10.020> a

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
that's going to change the outcome a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.550 
that's going to change the outcome a
little<00:02:10.379> bit

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
