00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.470
 very good guys, how are you? 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:06.359
 flow street and we are a guerrilla with 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.979
 subscribers in playstation 4 that already 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.259
 I had not made carts and 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.910
 subscribers in cool and good plan and 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.740
 I had quite enough desire I'm going to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.299
 win me a couple of races and I'm going to 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.890
 go up today so well let's go up 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.690
 turn 1 of 2 we have a spiral 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.400
 giant forward and I hope huge 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.990
 swing with the turns because you can 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.460
 to be very complicated and put here 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.440
 life come I'm not hitting here with 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.510
 aesthetics well all boy gets caught 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.640
 the albal paper as you have seen and 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.680
 well we bring here the environments one in 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.929
 marmoset and one from albal paper or much to 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.910
 who reads it or shit and the ally already 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.519
 ally or to lose them I have them 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.350
 because you know that the leader is so much 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.359
 less manageable but had not been for a long time 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.129
 I picked it up and I'm going to do it now in 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.960
 this race and see what macho and what 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.539
 bad luck had there good that it does is 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.859
 say what are you doing waiting for man and me 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.019
 no matter what, I still wait for you 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.699
 help you win in your face kid in your 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.170
 face if you come to wait for me 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.120
 Sorry but I'm going to come on 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.859
 to shoot because I'm competitive but 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.829
 well come on let's go come on let's go for 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.359
 ahead by the way today today today there are 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.350
 several cool videos on the channel so 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.820
 Stay tuned because you're going to like it 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.380
 much is worth it here is the spiral 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.200
 Attention 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.649
 attention how you catch this you have to 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.170
 catch the kinematics because no no no 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.149
 it's worth what they asked me to lose, not what 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.460
 I understand, I do not understand where 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.020
 to go or what to do with shits 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.210
 this is done, I'm leaving the car to 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.649
 back is where it's worth around here 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.770
 here over here we will have to make a 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.390
 kind of pirouette perfect aquino voucher 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.920
 It's worth it 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.060
 I have caught it well I think that above all 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.700
 there is a quick goal that seen in the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.259
 miniature were you fallen uncle I think that 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.240
 river of everything there is a walk ryder but no 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.439
 I'm sure so we have to have 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.819
 to get up male because if we 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.920
 we throw here life is worth I think it has 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:49.520
 past one just comes out perfect 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.399
 worth it is that it seems easy and it is not 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.049
 difficult but it is not sucked either 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.450
 arrived at the moment when it fails is 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.860
 a moment when nothing fails 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.750
 metro what if you go car sideways 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.250
 You've fucked up because you see that 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.929
 trip over everything and you drop and there and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.429
 you can put it right I hope the 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.250
 center they will not have the street 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.720
 shit 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.020
 and today my luck my luck and I were 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.250
 wind for the power 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.780
 please please please flow for the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.490
 brave concentration well if you do not 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.730
 you can go well you can go you can not 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.320
 follow it you do not stay well 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.640
 shock care report is perfect 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.560
 let's go well, becoming good, I'm 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.720
 using Balearic go well here you go back 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.420
 no no no no no no no no 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.830
 uncle I have gone through the point and not 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.140
 I caught him and I go in third is to say 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.090
 I think they have passed two yes I think that 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.820
 it's been two and ocean's got me 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.890
 from the damn point dude seriously what bad 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.260
 lucky boy I dropped my car 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.070
 up on the walk king uncle what the fuck 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.070
 okay, let's go 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.160
 so I do not have only one because 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.320
 I'm going the second one I'm going to like it 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.300
 I feel a lot of wind balcÃ¡cer 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.360
 boy almost bust here the side of the 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.920
 and caravan is okay let's go 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.470
 I think I will now go into turn 2 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.180
 as soon as it's good, complete this in the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.120
 half turn is where the fuck 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.220
 will be what is the goal worth here is 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.840
 perfect lap 2 we made the turn 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.190
 in about 3 minutes approximately 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.560
 cago around hitting all time 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.480
 now and well the first one I imagine since 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.220
 it will be quite far if you do not shit it 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.570
 not the burden is very difficult to catch him but 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.730
 but at the moment they enter the 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.020
 spiral I hope it ends so I 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.400
 I do not expect me not to shit because more or 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.690
 less and as it is but he good 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.600
 he also knows how it is or perfectly 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.700
 You can do it first and I stay 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.350
 Well with the desire to win but good 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.060
 no matter what we try we try 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.190
 that by trying it is not worth it 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.860
 let's put where the fuck is worth 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.690
 here perfect now is like the typical 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.100
 not the typical piece of stuffing 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.420
 of good in the races before what 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.620
 you how handsome is the spiral that by 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.640
 I'll leave the race to the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.530
 description in case you want to play the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.210
 spirals are already very cool the truth 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.650
 ok you start here macho a stick 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.650
 here in the middle serious uncle 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.610
 also the horn of this car or a 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.610
 truck 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.829
 I just looking to see what I'm 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.370
 a sand that park gave me a race 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.310
 it has a serious value let's go 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.900
 ok here comes the good thing I hope you 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.570
 I have kagado and I hope to go to the first 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.280
 attention that I'm going from still very second 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.430
 I think the moment has not let shat 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.340
 it's worth the first vale vale flow not the 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.919
 head no head the fuck uncle before 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.770
 I say it before, my uncle before I say it 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.090
 before I put the prawn male no no no no what 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.940
 I can paste like that I think the first 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.500
 only if the red of the entity is worth 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.389
 come on, did not recover, recovered, recovered 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.580
 come on let's go to recovered I'll go first 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.330
 it's attention this can be epic 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.880
 this can be epic given just right a 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.190
 container below that is if I 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.970
 wait for me one more second and the container 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.880
 Above pierre container above 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.370
 and asked and in the male world race already 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.310
 just passed below the ratio worth 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.270
 its time does not go up it goes up is that you know 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.949
 what happens what I want to do so thoroughly 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.840
 so as not to screw it up he wants me to go 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.130
 Uncle car seems easy to me because 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.960
 spirals are not usually very complicated 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.880
 but this guy I do not know what's wrong with him is that 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.410
 it is as very closed or as very towards 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.639
 up then the car is going against you 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.590
 the containers below 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.110
 and it is much much more complicated you can 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.999
 you see it and you go outside 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.020
 going up the car you have to be 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.639
 raising law at the moment in which 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.409
 bounce the car a little bit you can not 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.590
 handle it because thinking you can not 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.330
 fold you can not bend ok we go I think 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.590
 that this is the good I feel it 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.720
 I feel it I feel it 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.910
 kid 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.130
 well, my feeling is a 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.970
 Each route you have already seen a damn 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.680
 that make route vale let's go I have it what 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.910
 I have the mind I have the mind 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.910
 visualizing my victory attention 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.740
 at the moment when I say that I do not 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.480
 what will happen will be when I pass it 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.030
 because it does not make any sense this is worth 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.680
 Come on, come on, okay, it's here, I'm not going 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.540
 to spend here as soon as I enter the world 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.680
 I'm going to hit it, I'm going to fly away, not me 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.390
 I 'm going to pass it all the world is going to 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.610
 overtake and I'm going to make an ene efe 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.560
 almost that almost if you know I stay a 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.090
 handful and now because I do not get it right 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.760
 never the egg raid is to say because or 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.340
 be the spiral because I think that they have 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.740
 past and out in every kid if they have 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.480
 past that is with me all kid 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.530
 now I get it seriously right now 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.320
 when the first one will be past 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.840
 attention but you have not gone all out 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.670
 in all uncle please flu you concentrated 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.290
 that you have half to nothing if you spend 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.260
 this and you win the uncle race but you have 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.030
 what happens you have to spend what 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.660
 we are going to you can pass it you can 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.430
 happen 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.699
 Concentrate Concentrate Concentrate 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.839
 I stay without forcing 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.029
 wants to go through this because now it's so 

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:52.519
 complicated and before it was not uncle what 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:54.259
 shit happens to them this concentrate uncle by 

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:56.209
 please, it's not that hard 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:07:00.080
 that is the spiral that seems easy but 

00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:02.629
 it's not okay let's go the spiral that 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.629
 It seems easy but it is not your turn again 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:07.550
 is that I stopped accelerating and you play it 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:09.949
 the car stops working and then 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.009
 the attention is worth yes sir vale saw the 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:14.119
 first ok I think he could win the 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.259
 aversion now I did not get ahead in the air
