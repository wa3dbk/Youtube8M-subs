00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
you with that run very happy I think we

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.770

could<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:08.760> ran<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> little<00:03:09.120> better<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.660> do

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
could have ran a little better but we do

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.270 
could have ran a little better but we do
have<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.930> single<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:10.440> we<00:03:10.500> took<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.740> little<00:03:10.890> easier

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
have a single so we took a little easier

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.060 
have a single so we took a little easier
but<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.000> knew<00:03:12.240> G<00:03:12.510> would<00:03:12.660> be<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.780> very<00:03:13.530> good<00:03:13.800> racer

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
but I knew G would be a very good racer

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.560 
but I knew G would be a very good racer
so<00:03:14.340> it'd<00:03:14.430> be<00:03:14.520> very<00:03:14.550> tough<00:03:15.000> from<00:03:15.210> you<00:03:15.300> win<00:03:15.450> it
