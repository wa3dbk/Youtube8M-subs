and all the samples here that you
brought<00:00:19.830> are<00:00:20.100> using<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.699> same<00:00:20.939> idea<00:00:21.300> of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
brought are using that same idea of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380 
brought are using that same idea of
mixing<00:00:22.320> polymer<00:00:22.740> clay<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.670> silver<00:00:24.240> clay

mixing polymer clay with the silver clay

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.330 
mixing polymer clay with the silver clay
that's<00:00:24.779> right<00:00:25.019> well<00:00:25.560> show<00:00:25.890> us<00:00:25.920> how<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.220> get

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
that's right well show us how to get

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.120 
that's right well show us how to get
started<00:00:26.550> okay<00:00:27.330> first<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.470> all<00:00:28.560> polymer<00:00:29.010> clay

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130

can be used to make the textures for
your<00:00:33.270> metal<00:00:33.780> clay<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.800> I'm<00:00:35.160> using<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.989> bendable

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
your metal clay so I'm using a bendable

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.209 
your metal clay so I'm using a bendable
formula<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.800> polymer<00:00:38.370> clay<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.590> if<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.950> are

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
drawing you can use just anything

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.670 
drawing you can use just anything
plastic<00:00:54.840> cards<00:00:56.059> tools<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.809> your<00:00:57.870> from<00:00:58.559> your

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
plastic cards tools from your from your

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.799 
plastic cards tools from your from your
table<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.449> piece<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
table this is just a little piece of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.930 
table this is just a little piece of
tubing<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.350> you're<00:01:01.500> making<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> mixture<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
tubing so you're making the mixture that

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.030 
tubing so you're making the mixture that
you're<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.359> use<00:01:03.570> that's<00:01:04.470> correct

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
you're going to use that's correct

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.060 
you're going to use that's correct
and<00:01:05.299> because<00:01:06.299> you're<00:01:06.540> drawing<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.080> mold<00:01:07.320> it's

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and because you're drawing the mold it's

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130 
and because you're drawing the mold it's
going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:08.970> more<00:01:09.150> unique<00:01:09.479> than<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.990> went

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
going to be more unique than if you went

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.460 
going to be more unique than if you went
and<00:01:10.350> bought<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.680> rubber<00:01:10.860> stamp<00:01:11.159> sure<00:01:12.470> that's

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and bought a rubber stamp sure that's

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.840 
and bought a rubber stamp sure that's
right<00:01:13.740> that's<00:01:14.159> right<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
right that's right if you have a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.870 
right that's right if you have a
favorite<00:01:15.119> stamp<00:01:15.570> or<00:01:16.290> an<00:01:16.890> image<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.580> want

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
favorite stamp or an image that you want

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.539 
favorite stamp or an image that you want
specifically<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.100> draw<00:01:20.310> your<00:01:20.340> own

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
specifically but you can draw your own

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.670 
specifically but you can draw your own
and<00:01:20.970> bring<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.479> your<00:01:21.509> own<00:01:21.720> style<00:01:22.439> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and bring in your own style and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.740 
and bring in your own style and
personality<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.270> piece<00:01:24.509> we're

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
personality so for this piece we're

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.450 
personality so for this piece we're
using<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.710> want<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> be<00:01:25.979> clear<00:01:26.159> about<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
using I just want to be clear about the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.740 
using I just want to be clear about the
different<00:01:26.790> kinds<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.060> polymer<00:01:27.390> clay<00:01:27.540> that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
different kinds of polymer clay that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.450 
different kinds of polymer clay that
you're<00:01:27.900> using<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.159> bendable

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you're using so this one is the bendable

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.450 
you're using so this one is the bendable
this<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.299> bendable<00:01:30.630> clay<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.130> is

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
this is the bendable clay and it it is

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.490 
this is the bendable clay and it it is
most<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.119> most<00:01:33.420> bendable<00:01:33.900> formula<00:01:34.350> of

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
most the most bendable formula of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.840 
most the most bendable formula of
polymer<00:01:34.890> clay<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.270> make<00:01:36.920> all<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.979> my<00:01:38.189> molds

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
polymer clay and I make all of my molds

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.600 
polymer clay and I make all of my molds
and<00:01:39.049> you<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> molds<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.799> used<00:01:41.040> against

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and you the molds can be used against

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.910 
and you the molds can be used against
metal<00:01:41.939> clay<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.320> used<00:01:43.530> against

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
metal clay and they can be used against

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.380 
metal clay and they can be used against
the<00:01:44.009> polymer<00:01:44.399> clay<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.820> they<00:01:45.000> are<00:01:45.149> very

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the polymer clay so they are very

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.760 
the polymer clay so they are very
versatile<00:01:45.899> once<00:01:46.110> you've<00:01:46.290> made<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.530> own

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
versatile once you've made your own

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.920 
versatile once you've made your own
patterns<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.689> I'm<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.549> use

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
patterns so I'm going to going to use

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.469 
patterns so I'm going to going to use
these<00:01:51.930> two<00:01:52.290> molds<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.189> I've<00:01:53.310> drawn<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:54.329> are

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
these two molds that I've drawn that are

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.149 
these two molds that I've drawn that are
sort<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.869> complementary<00:01:55.500> there's<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.950> dots

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
sort of complementary there's the dots

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.620 
sort of complementary there's the dots
and<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.060> swirls<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.640> use<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.909> against<00:02:00.299> some

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and the swirls and use that against some

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.679 
and the swirls and use that against some
of<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.710> metal<00:02:02.009> clay<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.240> always<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:03.659> to

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
of the metal clay and you always want to

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.770 
of the metal clay and you always want to
keep<00:02:03.840> your<00:02:03.960> metal<00:02:04.259> clay<00:02:04.469> wrapped<00:02:05.250> tightly<00:02:05.780> in

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
keep your metal clay wrapped tightly in

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.820 
keep your metal clay wrapped tightly in
the<00:02:06.960> air<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.590> don't<00:02:07.829> want<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.220> dry<00:02:08.369> out

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
the air you don't want it to dry out

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.150 
the air you don't want it to dry out
I'll<00:02:10.830> set<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.280> aside

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
I'll set that aside

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.670 
I'll set that aside

and you also are working on a craft mat

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.890 
and you also are working on a craft mat
here<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.190> looks<00:02:15.370> like<00:02:15.490> yeah<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.480> these<00:02:16.630> little

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
sheets are Teflon that you can get at

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.380 
sheets are Teflon that you can get at
the<00:02:19.270> cooking<00:02:20.020> store<00:02:20.470> okay<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.820> little<00:02:22.240> bit

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
the cooking store okay and a little bit

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.970 
the cooking store okay and a little bit
of<00:02:22.510> handball<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.170> some<00:02:23.350> people<00:02:23.620> like<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:23.770> use

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
of handball and some people like to use

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.910 
of handball and some people like to use
olive<00:02:24.190> oil<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:27.990> using<00:02:28.990> first<00:02:29.230> ambassador<00:02:29.860> it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
olive oil and using first ambassador it

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.030 
olive oil and using first ambassador it
may<00:02:30.190> need<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.400> little<00:02:30.730> bit<00:02:30.850> on<00:02:30.970> your<00:02:31.090> tools<00:02:31.510> too

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
may need a little bit on your tools too

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.200 
may need a little bit on your tools too
and<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.160> want<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.430> roll<00:02:33.550> this<00:02:33.730> out<00:02:34.650> about<00:02:35.650> a

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
and you want to roll this out about a

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.580 
and you want to roll this out about a
between<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.240> millimeter<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.900> two<00:02:38.080> millimeters

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
between a millimeter and two millimeters

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.650 
between a millimeter and two millimeters
thick<00:02:38.950> mm-hmm<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:40.320> also<00:02:41.320> put<00:02:41.740> some<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.610> that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
thick mm-hmm and also put some of that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.020 
thick mm-hmm and also put some of that
hand<00:02:43.660> balm<00:02:43.900> on<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.920> molds<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:45.700> you're<00:02:45.850> using

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
hand balm on the molds so you're using

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.790 
hand balm on the molds so you're using
that<00:02:46.240> as<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.420> mold<00:02:46.690> release<00:02:46.960> that's<00:02:47.200> right<00:02:47.560> if

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
that as a mold release that's right if

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.590 
that as a mold release that's right if
you're<00:02:47.980> using<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.460> molds<00:02:48.760> with<00:02:48.790> polymer<00:02:49.390> clay

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
you're using the molds with polymer clay

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.190 
you're using the molds with polymer clay
you<00:02:50.080> use<00:02:50.290> water<00:02:50.620> as<00:02:51.370> your<00:02:51.760> mold<00:02:51.970> release<00:02:52.330> so

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
you use water as your mold release so

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.270 
you use water as your mold release so
you're<00:02:53.350> really<00:02:53.500> combining<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:54.040> lot<00:02:54.160> of

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
you're really combining a lot of

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.710 
you're really combining a lot of
different<00:02:54.580> techniques<00:02:54.880> in<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.270> one<00:02:55.450> piece

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
different techniques in this one piece

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.960 
different techniques in this one piece
that's<00:02:56.140> right<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:58.450> I'm<00:02:58.540> making<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.960> sandwich

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
that's right so I'm making a sandwich

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.740 
that's right so I'm making a sandwich
and<00:03:00.970> I'm<00:03:01.240> going<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.570> roll<00:03:03.210> fairly<00:03:04.210> firmly<00:03:04.510> you

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
and I'm going to roll fairly firmly you

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.390 
and I'm going to roll fairly firmly you
don't<00:03:04.930> want<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.140> thin<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.350> out<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:05.920> much<00:03:06.130> that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
don't want to thin it out so much that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.820 
don't want to thin it out so much that
the<00:03:06.520> metal<00:03:06.820> is<00:03:06.940> too<00:03:07.180> thin<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.680> would

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
the metal is too thin and that it would

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.550 
the metal is too thin and that it would
break<00:03:09.070> mm-hmm<00:03:10.000> but<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.360> do<00:03:10.570> want<00:03:10.870> but<00:03:11.470> you

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
break mm-hmm but you do want but you

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.440 
break mm-hmm but you do want but you
only<00:03:11.740> rule<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.160> once<00:03:12.340> right<00:03:12.730> that's<00:03:13.060> right<00:03:13.270> if

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
only rule it once right that's right if

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.140 
only rule it once right that's right if
you<00:03:13.540> roll<00:03:13.720> back<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.170> forth<00:03:14.230> you'll<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.970> clay

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
you roll back and forth you'll the clay

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.370 
you roll back and forth you'll the clay
will<00:03:16.330> shift<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.780> you'll<00:03:16.900> get<00:03:17.050> kind<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.290> a

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
will shift and you'll get kind of a

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.490 
will shift and you'll get kind of a
shadow<00:03:17.620> mm-hmm<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.520> do<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.090> lot<00:03:19.300> of<00:03:19.330> pieces<00:03:20.080> with

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
shadow mm-hmm I do a lot of pieces with

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.830 
shadow mm-hmm I do a lot of pieces with
text<00:03:21.490> on<00:03:21.610> them<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.090> that's<00:03:22.240> a<00:03:22.390> problem

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
text on them and that's a problem

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.540 
text on them and that's a problem
because<00:03:23.200> you're<00:03:23.800> kind<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.100> shadow<00:03:24.310> behind

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
because you're kind of a shadow behind

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.150 
because you're kind of a shadow behind
the<00:03:24.790> lettering<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:26.320> then<00:03:26.530> I'm<00:03:26.709> going<00:03:26.770> to<00:03:26.950> lay

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
the lettering so then I'm going to lay

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.880 
the lettering so then I'm going to lay
my<00:03:27.209> my<00:03:28.209> pattern<00:03:28.600> piece<00:03:28.840> against<00:03:29.440> there<00:03:29.650> and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
my my pattern piece against there and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.380 
my my pattern piece against there and
this<00:03:30.700> piece<00:03:30.910> is<00:03:31.209> going<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.510> have<00:03:31.980> self<00:03:32.980> bail<00:03:33.550> so

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
this piece is going to have self bail so

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.640 
this piece is going to have self bail so
I'm<00:03:34.890> going<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:35.950> cut<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.020> on<00:03:38.140> either<00:03:38.290> side

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
I'm going to cut and it on either side

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.490 
I'm going to cut and it on either side
of<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:39.100> center<00:03:39.490> line<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.840> then<00:03:41.110> cut<00:03:41.350> that

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
of that center line and then cut that

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.110 
of that center line and then cut that
out<00:03:43.080> mm-hmm<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.350> with<00:03:44.680> metal<00:03:44.980> clay<00:03:45.130> we<00:03:45.850> just

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
out mm-hmm and with metal clay we just

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.280 
out mm-hmm and with metal clay we just
always<00:03:46.360> want<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.570> remember<00:03:46.750> that<00:03:46.989> it's<00:03:47.140> going

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
always want to remember that it's going

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.600 
always want to remember that it's going
to<00:03:47.350> shrink<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.680> little<00:03:47.770> bit<00:03:47.920> right<00:03:48.370> that's

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
to shrink a little bit right that's

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.940 
to shrink a little bit right that's
right<00:03:48.940> depending<00:03:49.750> on<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.959> formula<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.709> your

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
right depending on the formula of your

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.640 
right depending on the formula of your
clay<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.750> shrinkage<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.440> in<00:03:54.310> this<00:03:54.640> particular

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
clay the shrinkage is in this particular

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.530 
clay the shrinkage is in this particular
formula<00:03:56.650> that<00:03:56.950> I'm<00:03:57.070> using<00:03:57.310> it's<00:03:57.640> between<00:03:58.090> ten

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
formula that I'm using it's between ten

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.380 
formula that I'm using it's between ten
and<00:03:58.570> fifteen<00:03:58.780> percent<00:03:59.260> okay<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:00.270> just<00:04:01.270> be

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
and fifteen percent okay so just be

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.540 
and fifteen percent okay so just be
prepared<00:04:01.540> that's<00:04:02.380> right<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.980> will<00:04:03.190> come<00:04:03.430> out

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
prepared that's right it will come out

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.910 
prepared that's right it will come out
smaller<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.570> that's<00:04:05.290> something<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:05.770> you

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
smaller and that's something that you

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.840 
smaller and that's something that you
would<00:04:06.160> need<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.580> think<00:04:06.820> about<00:04:07.050> if<00:04:08.050> there's<00:04:08.500> a

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
would need to think about if there's a

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.570 
would need to think about if there's a
certain<00:04:09.850> element<00:04:10.690> that<00:04:11.170> has<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.560> that<00:04:12.220> is<00:04:12.370> a

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
certain element that has to that is a

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.990 
certain element that has to that is a
certain<00:04:13.060> defined<00:04:13.989> size<00:04:14.350> and<00:04:14.950> shape<00:04:15.520> that<00:04:15.820> you

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
certain defined size and shape that you

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.750 
certain defined size and shape that you
need<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:17.290> I'm<00:04:17.350> gonna<00:04:17.500> put<00:04:17.770> this<00:04:17.919> stuff<00:04:17.980> back<00:04:18.459> in

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
need so I'm gonna put this stuff back in

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.400 
need so I'm gonna put this stuff back in
the<00:04:18.880> package<00:04:19.359> so<00:04:19.600> in<00:04:19.780> this<00:04:19.930> piece<00:04:20.200> you're

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
the package so in this piece you're

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.020 
the package so in this piece you're
really<00:04:20.680> making<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.100> puzzle<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.700> could<00:04:21.850> fit

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
really making a puzzle that could fit

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.830 
really making a puzzle that could fit
any<00:04:22.210> size<00:04:22.539> you<00:04:23.169> you're<00:04:23.590> making<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.250> completely

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
any size you you're making it completely

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.050 
any size you you're making it completely
and<00:04:25.260> it's<00:04:25.410> also<00:04:25.590> very<00:04:25.800> customized<00:04:26.639> because<00:04:26.790> we

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
and it's also very customized because we

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.670 
and it's also very customized because we
can<00:04:27.210> make<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:27.360> bezel<00:04:27.690> in<00:04:27.810> any<00:04:27.930> size<00:04:28.200> right

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
can make a bezel in any size right

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.580 
can make a bezel in any size right
because<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.460> don't<00:04:29.700> have<00:04:29.910> an<00:04:30.570> existing<00:04:30.960> stone

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
because I don't have an existing stone

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.170 
because I don't have an existing stone
I'm<00:04:31.889> going<00:04:32.070> to<00:04:32.160> be<00:04:32.220> using<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.610> polymer<00:04:33.030> clay

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
I'm going to be using the polymer clay

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.830 
I'm going to be using the polymer clay
to<00:04:33.480> make<00:04:33.630> my<00:04:33.900> own<00:04:34.190> my<00:04:35.190> own<00:04:35.220> design<00:04:35.820> so<00:04:36.510> this<00:04:36.660> one

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
to make my own my own design so this one

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.510 
to make my own my own design so this one
has<00:04:37.020> already<00:04:37.290> been<00:04:37.470> dried<00:04:37.830> right<00:04:38.340> that's

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
has already been dried right that's

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.990 
has already been dried right that's
right

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
right

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.930 
right
that's<00:04:39.180> not<00:04:39.389> fired<00:04:39.690> right<00:04:40.290> this<00:04:40.950> one<00:04:41.160> because

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
that's not fired right this one because

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.450 
that's not fired right this one because
it's<00:04:42.150> it's<00:04:42.480> dry<00:04:42.900> you<00:04:43.500> can<00:04:43.530> finish<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.220> with<00:04:44.430> a

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
it's it's dry you can finish it with a

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.090 
it's it's dry you can finish it with a
little<00:04:44.730> sanding<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.810> then<00:04:46.260> either<00:04:46.770> torch

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
little sanding and then either torch

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.580 
little sanding and then either torch
fire<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.490> or<00:04:47.610> kill<00:04:47.820> fire<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.300> mm-hmm<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:48.930> then

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
fire it or kill fire it mm-hmm and then

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.760 
fire it or kill fire it mm-hmm and then
you<00:04:50.250> move<00:04:50.460> on<00:04:50.639> after<00:04:51.120> that's<00:04:51.780> ready<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.410> add

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
you move on after that's ready to add

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.340 
you move on after that's ready to add
the<00:04:53.100> bezel<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.180> would<00:04:54.450> use<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.660> piece<00:04:54.960> of<00:04:54.990> flat

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
the bezel so I would use a piece of flat

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.850 
the bezel so I would use a piece of flat
wire<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:56.340> form<00:04:56.639> it<00:04:56.790> into<00:04:56.910> a<00:04:57.030> loop<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:58.050> solder

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
wire and form it into a loop and solder

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.500 
wire and form it into a loop and solder
the<00:04:59.100> seam<00:04:59.370> and<00:04:59.820> then<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:01.050> can<00:05:01.350> form<00:05:02.510> refine

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
the seam and then you can form refine

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.629 
the seam and then you can form refine
the<00:05:03.690> shape<00:05:03.960> because<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:04.740> first<00:05:04.979> loop<00:05:05.160> is<00:05:05.310> not

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
the shape because that first loop is not

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.400 
the shape because that first loop is not
very<00:05:05.880> pretty<00:05:05.970> with<00:05:06.330> your<00:05:06.510> nifty<00:05:06.690> tool<00:05:06.990> that's

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
very pretty with your nifty tool that's

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.460 
very pretty with your nifty tool that's
right<00:05:07.710> out<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.040> right<00:05:08.280> angle<00:05:08.669> pliers<00:05:09.630> so

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
right out of right angle pliers so

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.980 
right out of right angle pliers so
refine<00:05:10.919> that<00:05:11.160> a<00:05:11.550> little<00:05:11.880> bit<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:12.270> then<00:05:12.840> this

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
refine that a little bit and then this

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.379 
refine that a little bit and then this
one's<00:05:13.200> ready<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.530> go<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:14.639> again<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:14.940> little<00:05:15.180> bit

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
one's ready to go and again a little bit

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.570 
one's ready to go and again a little bit
of<00:05:15.479> easy<00:05:15.750> paste<00:05:16.050> solder<00:05:16.320> inside<00:05:16.889> the<00:05:17.250> the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
of easy paste solder inside the the

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.300 
of easy paste solder inside the the
piece<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:18.419> solder<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:18.919> it'll<00:05:19.919> have<00:05:20.040> to<00:05:20.190> be

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
piece and solder that it'll have to be

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.270 
piece and solder that it'll have to be
cleaned<00:05:20.639> in<00:05:20.910> pickle<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.900> then<00:05:22.290> this<00:05:22.800> one<00:05:23.040> has

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
cleaned in pickle and then this one has

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.760 
cleaned in pickle and then this one has
been<00:05:23.690> oxidized<00:05:24.690> with<00:05:25.200> a<00:05:25.229> liver<00:05:25.560> of<00:05:25.740> sulfur

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
been oxidized with a liver of sulfur

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.370 
been oxidized with a liver of sulfur
solution<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:27.240> then<00:05:27.690> after<00:05:27.990> it's<00:05:28.139> all

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
solution and then after it's all

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.710 
solution and then after it's all
polished<00:05:28.800> up<00:05:29.010> it'll<00:05:29.910> look<00:05:30.030> like<00:05:30.270> this<00:05:30.539> you

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
polished up it'll look like this you

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.360 
polished up it'll look like this you
have<00:05:30.840> your<00:05:30.960> bezel<00:05:31.140> ready<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.650> go<00:05:31.800> it's<00:05:32.160> ready

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
have your bezel ready to go it's ready

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.450 
have your bezel ready to go it's ready
to<00:05:32.460> go<00:05:32.700> and<00:05:33.090> ready<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.660> fit<00:05:34.080> my<00:05:34.440> own<00:05:34.650> polymer

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
to go and ready to fit my own polymer

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.690 
to go and ready to fit my own polymer
clay<00:05:35.810> shape<00:05:36.810> in<00:05:37.110> there<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:37.979> you're<00:05:38.160> using<00:05:38.340> the

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
clay shape in there and you're using the

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.990 
clay shape in there and you're using the
granite<00:05:39.150> type<00:05:39.330> of<00:05:39.539> this<00:05:39.990> is<00:05:40.229> a<00:05:40.440> new<00:05:40.740> new<00:05:41.039> color
