masks while trapping and releasing crows

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.489 
masks while trapping and releasing crows
the<00:00:41.699> researchers<00:00:42.269> then<00:00:42.539> gave<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.079> caveman

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:43.499 
the researchers then gave the caveman

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.829 
the researchers then gave the caveman
masks<00:00:43.979> to<00:00:44.399> random<00:00:44.850> people<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.389> asked<00:00:45.600> them<00:00:45.719> to

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
masks to random people and asked them to

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.049 
masks to random people and asked them to
walk<00:00:46.229> around<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.829> campus<00:00:47.069> what<00:00:47.729> they<00:00:47.850> found

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
walk around the campus what they found

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.209 
walk around the campus what they found
is<00:00:48.359> that<00:00:48.389> the<00:00:48.690> released<00:00:49.079> birds<00:00:49.530> essentially

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
is that the released birds essentially

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.219 
is that the released birds essentially
flipped<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.239> began<00:00:51.629> yelling<00:00:52.049> at<00:00:52.139> the

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
flipped out and began yelling at the

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:53.750 
flipped out and began yelling at the
people<00:00:52.530> wearing<00:00:52.799> the<00:00:52.889> mask<00:00:53.100> what's<00:00:53.489> even<00:00:53.729> more

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
people wearing the mask what's even more

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.430 
people wearing the mask what's even more
surprising<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.719> birds<00:00:55.019> that<00:00:55.289> had

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
surprising is that birds that had

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.529 
surprising is that birds that had
nothing<00:00:55.709> to<00:00:56.069> do<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.670> study<00:00:56.850> had<00:00:57.359> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
nothing to do with the study had the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.660 
nothing to do with the study had the
same<00:00:57.809> reaction<00:00:58.019> towards<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.889> mask<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.429> guess

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
same reaction towards the mask I guess

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.340 
same reaction towards the mask I guess
you<00:00:59.760> could<00:00:59.879> say<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.089> little<00:01:00.179> birdie<00:01:00.659> told<00:01:01.049> them

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
you could say a little birdie told them

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.739 
you could say a little birdie told them
these<00:01:01.530> cavemen<00:01:02.069> were<00:01:02.280> mean<00:01:02.760> dudes<00:01:03.149> so

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
these cavemen were mean dudes so

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:05.510 
these cavemen were mean dudes so
essentially<00:01:04.290> these<00:01:04.559> crows<00:01:04.890> felt<00:01:05.160> a<00:01:05.280> certain

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
essentially these crows felt a certain

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.370 
essentially these crows felt a certain
way<00:01:05.670> about<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.090> person<00:01:06.660> they<00:01:06.780> had<00:01:06.870> never<00:01:07.080> met

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
way about a person they had never met

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.170 
way about a person they had never met
before<00:01:07.410> because<00:01:08.280> their<00:01:08.460> friends<00:01:08.880> opinions

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
before because their friends opinions

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.690 
before because their friends opinions
had<00:01:09.600> such<00:01:09.870> a<00:01:09.900> strong<00:01:10.350> influence<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:11.160> them<00:01:11.400> when

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
had such a strong influence on them when

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.550 
had such a strong influence on them when
they<00:01:11.760> saw<00:01:11.940> on<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> other<00:01:12.360> mask<00:01:12.720> or<00:01:13.050> face<00:01:13.290> they
