00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.420
 good guys since a new mode is 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.250
 called 4h and derived in what they see is that 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.220
 is going to add a new type of water 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.650
 will add the same water but 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.870
 transparent and as well reflected as 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.670
 in there you can see the reflection in 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.349
 reality makes the water look like 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.289
 a beauty but the evils that are going to you 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.640
 lower the gp fps a bit so they have 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.489
 than having a good computer to be able to 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.169
 run the mod worth the water you see 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.019
 transparent normal and also have 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.669
 I think two books there in the parts to 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.250
 the samples are already going to see but as in 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.989
 water is a transparent beauty and 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.480
 you also see the animals that are in 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.399
 the water and you see the clear background 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.860
 very, very good, well, there 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.100
 come the cigars that taught them I think 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.100
 A) Yes 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.290
 in the water so they can see how it looks and 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.280
 see as well as the distance in short so 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.490
 as if it had been the distance 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.340
 short minimum that is done with haze and 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.340
 those things for being the reflection and so on 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.640
 and that is the book as you see there when one 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.860
 it's in some parts of the water it's going 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.350
 to see blue sky so in some 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.880
 parts is better in some parts or 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.560
 if not, the water is going to look like that with the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.300
 blue sky is worth so when they have 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.120
 that part you can try to go to another 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.280
 part as it has very good reflexes 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.230
 even the installation guys what 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.100
 we are going to do is go our page that 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.010
 it will be the exception 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.510
 obviously the most recent version that 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.850
 will always be the highest the most 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.980
 recent and download handle 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.250
 that we are not going to need or for help and 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.180
 mod loader let's download 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.420
 we waited a bit here on the page 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.750
 Atfrie we waited five seconds 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.170
 we wait a bit we can close this not 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.820
 I know why I'm threatened 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.830
 well what we are going to do now is 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.150
 move that file to the desktop 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.060
 Now what we are going to do is open it 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.950
 and what we are going to do with this boy is 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.970
 that we let the water know those things and 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.030
 well what we are going to do now is 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.020
 minimize it irak and started and in search 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.500
 let's put percentage appdata 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.020
 percentage and we give the enter key 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.800
 here to find a folder called point 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.660
 Minecraft 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.490
 we copy it to the bean folder 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.090
 wants the folder well what are we going to 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.400
 do is let's copy the 4 bears you know 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.840
 these things what we are going to do is here 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.910
 in the folder and let's move the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.010
 folder is called sader vale not the 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.070
 let's move here in the inside 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.160
 folder is ok and now let's open the 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.050
 main craft point and open with winrar 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.760
 achievers 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.420
 and here what we are going to do is erase the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.420
 meta folder and 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.599
 and pass only the point files 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.760
 class is worth four more files 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.760
 class 2 points 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.700
 ok she is from all facilities very 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.980
 but very simple as they saw ama 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.989
 knowing folder goes inside 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.860
 bing and the key point files inside 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.890
 of microns 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.880
 that is very, very simple, we open 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.570
 our micro is normally 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.110
 open we open the tomatoes normally 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.970
 singleplayer 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.890
 as I told you to provoke a bit of the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.320
 when you are creating your world or something and 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.910
 well I do not know why this is a 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.569
 little wet we're going to get out of here from 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.030
 fact 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.030
 touch a new creative world 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.430
 we wait a bit we wait a bit 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.430
 we hope a little 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.120
 we hope a little good as since 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.890
 we appeared in the water in fact 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.290
 and how the world will be created will I have a 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.150
 little bit of lac and as always the book of 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.150
 the south joke and it 's very close to the water 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.400
 we appear like this we go to a new world 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.140
 how much is this amount already guided 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.370
 so have a little patience 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.230
 It's worth a little patience, no hands 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.970
 we go 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.400
 believe in the world 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.870
 we go 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.870
 OK 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.030
 and how they come to stop the world 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.440
 it takes a lot for the motivation we dedicate 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.470
 but a little bit I 'll put him on camera 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.470
 fast 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.150
 well finally we already suffered here in the 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.730
 Map 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.620
 how are we going to see in the water forgive 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.850
 the lac because he is already just creating the 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.320
 world more than I have all the graphics 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.320
 to the maximum or I have 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.250
 the lighting is maximum and of all the 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.200
 maximum and good as they see there the reflection 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.880
 others and so they will have their water but very 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.170
 good and we have a part of the chejter 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.550
 because there are many chejter and well 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.920
 boy until next time I hope that you 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.160
 like this review and installation and we 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.160
 we see
