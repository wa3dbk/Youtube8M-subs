I'd say there was something down all
through<00:00:01.920> her<00:00:02.100> haze<00:00:02.520> I<00:00:02.730> he<00:00:03.389> just<00:00:03.570> got<00:00:03.689> rolled<00:00:03.990> up

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
through her haze I he just got rolled up

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.369 
through her haze I he just got rolled up
a<00:00:04.230> bind<00:00:05.450> he's<00:00:06.450> nursing<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.990> little<00:00:07.020> bit<00:00:07.290> out

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
I think sometimes those things or

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.919 
I think sometimes those things or
positives<00:00:11.969> because<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.360> get<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> chance<00:00:12.690> to

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
positives because you get a chance to

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.120 
positives because you get a chance to

whole<00:03:36.680> big<00:03:37.010> picture<00:03:37.210> I<00:03:38.210> think<00:03:38.780> it's<00:03:38.930> going<00:03:39.020> to

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
whole big picture I think it's going to

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.210 
whole big picture I think it's going to
pay<00:03:39.230> off<00:03:39.260> for<00:03:39.710> us<00:03:39.770> at<00:03:40.130> some<00:03:40.340> point<00:03:41.440> but<00:03:42.440> you

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
pay off for us at some point but you

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.070 
pay off for us at some point but you
know<00:03:43.310> we'll<00:03:43.460> continue<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:44.000> roll<00:03:44.660> those<00:03:44.810> guys

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
know we'll continue to roll those guys

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.790 
know we'll continue to roll those guys
around<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.770> I<00:03:45.950> say<00:03:46.820> as<00:03:46.970> we<00:03:47.090> get<00:03:47.270> closer<00:03:47.800> right

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
around and I say as we get closer right

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.550 
around and I say as we get closer right
now<00:03:48.980> we're<00:03:49.430> just<00:03:49.960> trying<00:03:50.960> to<00:03:51.020> trying<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.440> give

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
now we're just trying to trying to give

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.900 
now we're just trying to trying to give
them<00:03:51.590> all<00:03:51.710> equal<00:03:52.010> opportunity<00:03:52.430> but<00:03:52.550> once<00:03:52.730> we

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
them all equal opportunity but once we

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.500 
them all equal opportunity but once we
get<00:03:53.060> dialed<00:03:53.690> in<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:54.110> think<00:03:54.410> we'll<00:03:54.560> have<00:03:55.510> three

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
get dialed in I think we'll have three

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.949 
get dialed in I think we'll have three
or<00:03:56.600> four<00:03:56.810> guys<00:03:56.960> in<00:03:57.200> fact<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.630> fair<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.810> say

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
or four guys in fact is it fair to say

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.480 
or four guys in fact is it fair to say
