back<00:01:53.110> from<00:01:53.440> you<00:01:53.560> know<00:01:53.590> latch<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.670> couple<00:01:54.970> the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
back from you know latch the couple the

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.890 
back from you know latch the couple the
last<00:01:55.660> year<00:01:56.020> and

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
last year and

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.410 
last year and
in<00:01:56.990> my<00:01:57.890> freshman<00:01:58.130> year<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.460> think<00:01:58.700> my<00:01:58.940> vision<00:01:59.330> is

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
in my freshman year I think my vision is

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.770 
in my freshman year I think my vision is
probably<00:02:00.370> my<00:02:01.370> best<00:02:01.580> asset<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.210> think<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.630> you

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
probably my best asset I think that you

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.480 
probably my best asset I think that you
know<00:02:02.900> I'm<00:02:03.080> able<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.620> see<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.890> lot<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.310> holes

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
know I'm able to see a lot of the holes

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.460 
know I'm able to see a lot of the holes
that<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:04.880> know<00:02:05.120> maybe<00:02:05.330> some<00:02:05.900> other<00:02:06.080> other

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
that you know maybe some other other

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.080 
that you know maybe some other other
running<00:02:06.830> backs<00:02:06.980> aren't<00:02:07.250> able<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.490> see<00:02:07.730> I<00:02:07.760> think

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
running backs aren't able to see I think

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.600 
running backs aren't able to see I think
that<00:02:08.270> also<00:02:08.660> can<00:02:09.530> bring<00:02:09.710> a<00:02:09.770> good<00:02:10.280> burst<00:02:10.430> of

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
that also can bring a good burst of

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.400 
that also can bring a good burst of
speed<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:11.090> between<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.810> tackles<00:02:11.990> I<00:02:12.260> think

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
speed in between the tackles I think

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.200 
speed in between the tackles I think
that's<00:02:12.560> something<00:02:12.710> that<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.580> know<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.700> kind<00:02:14.120> of

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
that's something that you know I kind of

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.460 
that's something that you know I kind of
see<00:02:14.390> myself<00:02:14.570> as<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.590> stronger<00:02:16.100> side<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.370> my<00:02:16.460> game

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
see myself as a stronger side of my game

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.230 
see myself as a stronger side of my game
