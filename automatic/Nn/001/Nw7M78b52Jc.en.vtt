like<00:00:53.129> that

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.930 

and<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:01.510> goes<00:01:02.100> speedometer<00:01:03.100> says<00:01:03.310> 40<00:01:03.760> but<00:01:03.910> I

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
and it goes speedometer says 40 but I

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.610 
and it goes speedometer says 40 but I
think<00:01:04.180> that's<00:01:04.360> as<00:01:04.510> fast<00:01:04.780> as<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.110> goes<00:01:05.320> because

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
think that's as fast as it goes because

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.980 
think that's as fast as it goes because
I<00:01:05.770> think<00:01:05.980> I<00:01:06.040> can<00:01:06.190> do<00:01:06.280> about<00:01:06.490> it<00:01:09.780> let's<00:01:10.780> give<00:01:10.960> it

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
I think I can do about it let's give it

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.530 
I think I can do about it let's give it
a<00:01:11.140> test<00:01:11.350> run
