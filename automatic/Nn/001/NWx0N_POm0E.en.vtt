00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hmm 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.820
 sometimes I liked my school at 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.150
 sometimes I found it annoying because I had 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.179
 many of these teachers who become 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.850
 matter and then that science class 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.189
 you do not see how your body or class of 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.130
 story as your story is a date 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.720
 it's a thing apart from life 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.779
 I think that hinders when 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.050
 knowledge is alienated from life 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.359
 interest 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.340
 the world is our starting point and the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.250
 arrival point in your books in the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.430
 sense of humility walking the countryside 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.610
 walk around the city and to the museums watch 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.629
 shows attend the factories the gardens 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.860
 you can not just look at what the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.930
 people call cognitive skills 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.250
 that they are important nobody is 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.360
 admire if the student has to learn 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.850
 Portuguese does not have to learn 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.980
 mathematics but the school has paper 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 much greater than teaching Portuguese and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.640
 mathematics 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.410
 we already know by intuition more when 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.600
 the rankings of 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.420
 schools that only measure this performance 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.189
 cognitive there is a pressure from the parents I am 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.049
 including peace of the middle class 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.150
 of wanting to think that the most 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.320
 important is the school note on the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.490
 school ended up privileging 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.680
 historically all this field of 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.600
 cognitive abilities 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.650
 only the world needs more 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.080
 than this 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.259
 the world is in need of skills 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.259
 cooperation as tolerance and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.259
 ability to cooperate to work in 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.630
 team to achieve results after all 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.210
 accounts education looks at the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.670
 of a person is not a person. 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.939
 in its entirety from a person who 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.600
 is in the society that will integrate 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.220
 from there for some time as a professional 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.680
 who will become father who will see his mother 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.350
 then you know this person who needs to be 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.780
 Look at the school, I do not 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.390
 it is a discourse to put aside the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.680
 learning to read and write well 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.680
 learn math
