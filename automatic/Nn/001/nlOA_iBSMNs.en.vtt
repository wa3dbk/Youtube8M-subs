00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
boundaries every now and then there is a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.420 
boundaries every now and then there is a
generation<00:01:01.719> of<00:01:01.839> artists<00:01:02.320> which<00:01:02.830> have<00:01:03.040> a<00:01:03.070> far

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
greater populist kind of reach that they

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.330 
greater populist kind of reach that they

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
and that the beauty of doing something

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.260 
and that the beauty of doing something
illegal<00:01:11.439> it's<00:01:11.890> most<00:01:12.250> of<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.490> location<00:01:12.939> as<00:01:13.119> you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
illegal it's most of the location as you

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.090 
illegal it's most of the location as you

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.880 
many of them are brave but they're also
doing<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.960> because<00:04:52.320> there's<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.620> poignant

doing it because there's a poignant

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.010 
doing it because there's a poignant
reason<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.430> do<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:53.700> because<00:04:54.180> they<00:04:54.570> believe<00:04:54.599> in

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
reason to do it because they believe in

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.800 
reason to do it because they believe in
free<00:04:55.229> speech<00:04:55.260> because<00:04:55.950> they<00:04:56.130> believe<00:04:56.400> in<00:04:56.520> art

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
free speech because they believe in art

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.840 
free speech because they believe in art
ma<00:04:56.900> cracy<00:04:57.320> and<00:04:57.530> because<00:04:58.190> there<00:04:58.400> are<00:04:58.430> issues

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
ma cracy and because there are issues

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.400 
ma cracy and because there are issues
that<00:04:58.880> they<00:04:59.120> feel<00:04:59.360> are<00:04:59.389> important<00:04:59.930> to<00:04:59.990> tackle

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410

that they feel are important to tackle
so<00:05:01.040> to<00:05:01.100> me<00:05:01.550> some<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:02.000> these<00:05:02.180> artists<00:05:02.600> are<00:05:02.660> not

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
so to me some of these artists are not

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.280 
so to me some of these artists are not
in<00:05:02.930> fact<00:05:03.050> vandals<00:05:03.590> but<00:05:03.830> they're<00:05:03.980> heroes
