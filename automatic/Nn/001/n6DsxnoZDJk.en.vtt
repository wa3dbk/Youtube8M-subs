00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.360
 I got you now to exercise it out the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.940
 right-angled coordinate system 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.300
 brought there can be so much 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.189
 easier to reflect first did you do that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.230
 checkered paper to help 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.210
 and second, the points can be exact 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:34.140
 We can be stated so 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:44.940
 agree point a 20 sitting here point 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:46.800
 B 40 and C is 3 and I have just got that 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.379
 I pay close attention to the mirrors 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.079
 strayed 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.910
 Here now we can again 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.020
 you could do that as you could 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.020
 imagine a triangle 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.180
 you develop the mirror image in which you 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.010
 That's exactly what we think 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.940
 to have 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.580
 we count the distance from azur mirror 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.090
 Axis you know that the mirror axis 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:28.860
 here is 15 and the double 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:32.370
 distance you wear upwards so 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.370
 do you end up at 3? 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:49.190
 this distance I save myself now 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:53.060
 would be deleted the point c is too 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.660
 at the same time the mirror point we 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.590
 call it aim and make it at b 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:04.400
 you same again 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.820
 the distance from b to the mirror axis becomes 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.820
 doubles 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.540
 This is where the point b strikes me 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:31.150
 Hope you can practice with me again 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.150
 painting which coordinates has been deleted 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.569
 23 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:47.720
 the coordinates of cmc are dashed 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:53.140
 stayed the same and the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.140
 coordinates of b are 43 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:08.190
 if you have the coordinates now 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:08.190
 compare then do you see that the 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.260
 the first coordinates have remained 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.200
 is because the mirror axis 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.640
 runs parallel to the x-axis if you 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.060
 You can enjoy it too 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.480
 connect again to the triangle and fits 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:33.520
 then your mirror image and the triangle 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:38.590
 a smear b dash-dot-c so 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:42.580
 could you every figure now at one 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.340
 mirror axis and can mirror 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.250
 sometimes quite nice figures will find so 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.650
 This triangle has its mirror triangle 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:57.550
 up here 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:04:00.550
 ok i read the task before you have it 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.420
 but already prepared sign in one 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:08.890
 coordinate system the points with the 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:14.610
 coordinates 12 point b with the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:21.459
 coordinates 33 c with the coordinates 45 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:25.870
 d with the coordinates 31 and e with the 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.660
 coordinates 52 we already have 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.140
 prepared and I want to be with you now 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.979
 the task continues investigating more 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.960
 the picture points at the mirrored 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.820
 just where is the mirror straight 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.110
 the mirror axis is here at all 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.600
 not yet registered 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:49.690
 which is required of us as follows 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:52.030
 The mirror axis is bfr color 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.950
 not yet and it is indicated with 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.950
 the coordinates 0 0 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.390
 b was given before 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.690
 that means that is a task the 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.260
 Mirror axis only in retrospect of the 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.510
 must be registered with 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.490
 bf as a mirror axis there you can 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.520
 think the same will not be enough 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.240
 but we still have to 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.240
 continue 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.310
 now we were asked by the 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.020
 determine image points 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.030
 the new at our mirror point now 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.410
 of it a bit beside it slipped 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.919
 is not a problem is that a 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:54.350
 Regarding the mirror axis small it 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:57.880
 over here will have his picture point 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.389
 while de has the mirror spot here 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.300
 and so on 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:05.950
 This, incidentally, is exactly what the sitting 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.419
 yes has the task to ask 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.900
 dash is back on the other side 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.139
 his 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.300
 while e over here is so 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:17.180
 a rather complicated and extensive 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.110
 task I now for you 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.110
 wants to prepare 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:28.130
 I've already prepared the 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.630
 distances vertical distances important 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.710
 is that here always the right angle 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.930
 is created 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.500
 whether that is done with the geodreieck or 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:41.500
 with the protractor these distances in the 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.500
 the same distance creates the picture points 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:55.419
 The dot de is mirrored here 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:07:01.340
 The stroke is on the mirror axis 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:03.169
 and arises at the same place in the 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:09.470
 same distance to the mirror axis 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:15.340
 Mirrored stroke arises here above and 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:15.340
 as last t stroke 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:22.280
 do you understand it can do it too 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.919
 giving tasks became mutual 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.020
 it does not have to reflect that for a long time 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:28.039
 as much fun as with a little boy or 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.900
 Pine trees 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:31.900
 but it is in mathematics
