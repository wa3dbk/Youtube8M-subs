00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.059
 wesley and people today I bring you 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.400
 one more building here on the canal 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.070
 today is wednesday every wednesday 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.230
 More or less at this time I bring a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.930
 tutorial other than a tutorial 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.970
 Quick for us to build and galley 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.760
 As you can see, I made a car. 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.880
 of formula 1 has several ways of 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.610
 to do it I did it this way as well 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.710
 We can change the color of the car. 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.030
 as you can see I made a red 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.520
 and yellow 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.399
 but you can choose other colors 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.860
 And you guys know I like it 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.129
 to make a background scene just for 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.410
 complete with the construction right 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.660
 and I hope you have more tan 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.660
 today we will only learn how to do 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 this beauty formula-1 car then is 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.859
 This is it people I hope you 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.290
 have tanned and let's make them 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.820
 So 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.220
 good guys I took the mold out of 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.799
 shadows for you to see how it is 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.740
 build without it and let's do 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.210
 that car then people very easy 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.759
 First of all, I'll ask you. 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.729
 get these materials I'm in 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.100
 hand here that is the clay block clay 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.710
 in case you will choose the color of your 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.330
 car and I do not want to make yellow myself 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.250
 I got the red one but I want to do the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.740
 yellow already let here 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.479
 the personal stone slab and a piston and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.030
 To do this you do not 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.680
 catch the coal block left jump 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.990
 two blocks here to leave a 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.030
 legal distance from the other car and people 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.649
 puts two blocks so personal to 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.470
 do the tires 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.040
 There you put a magician here in the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.290
 half and three slabs in front is here already 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.810
 the front of the car we pull 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.869
 two more blocks behind 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.729
 You put a piston here. 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.000
 lying does not place standing 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.850
 leave him with the wood turned here and the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.580
 people put a clay on each side is 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.430
 just pull one another here we go 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.599
 put the other two tires personal well 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.800
 easy not 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.530
 there 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.810
 you're going to put a clay and 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.480
 they will put another on top not guys 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.890
 confuse this part is easier 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.050
 The way I'm talking to give 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.140
 right then for us to put the slabs 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.380
 here already take her already personal you go 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.140
 put one on that tire on the top 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.570
 of the tire and one in this tire also and here 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.750
 on the top you put a slab 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.810
 pull a left and a right beauty 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.570
 and basically that's what guys this vehicle 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.640
 it's very easy to build now it's just 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.970
 people add the details you 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.040
 can trap this part 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.550
 Let me take the stairs that I think 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.400
 I'm late here, there's exactly one here. 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.160
 we can put the buttons on the tires 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.620
 too, guys, if you want I think 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.680
 which is cool decorate with 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.740
 other option is the frame also 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.050
 but there goes of your personal choice and the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.390
 next I'll get these plates 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.120
 put one between the two 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.790
 wheels and here guys the next I go 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.560
 put two here and it would be nice if the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.290
 people put it here too but I do not 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.170
 I recommend that you do this personally 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.810
 because because this is accidentally you 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.510
 stepping on this plate will activate this piston 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.140
 and it will push the blocks back 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.120
 So do not make it personal then just 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.310
 leaves a piston here other than 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.290
 beauty a piston is not a plaque 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.150
 pressure 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.580
 done it folks come here 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.350
 Let me get the rail I'm going to put 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.390
 one here in that hole 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.190
 You can take our 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.610
 sensitivity does not show too fast 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.370
 Let's change here. Okay, you'll get the 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.950
 kart people this cart here the people 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.989
 You'll put one here to make one. 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.300
 stool we can sit in the car 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.340
 It's very cool. 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.680
 Let me see the whole car here. 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.560
 of Formula 1 has a ball here half 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.380
 strange and I managed to make her 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.269
 with the music disc and the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.150
 frame then we put a team 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.030
 music album leaves him standing personal 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.430
 and people are basically this car of 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.880
 formula 1 I'll get the plate that people 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.870
 places 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:36.120
 a snare another ciel clothing 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.160
 to put the wrong beauty and guys that's it 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.110
 so look it did not work too much 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.870
 for us to make these cars 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.690
 formula 1 and the cool thing is that you can 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.390
 to change his colors, he gets very crazy 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.550
 make several cars on a track of this sim 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.830
 Of course it's not a complete clue 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.320
 Guys I just did a little bit and fast 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.390
 I did not even capriche right just for people. 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.330
 see how it would look more or less 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.460
 car on the track but that's it guys I 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.920
 I hope you have tanned this 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.700
 ferial institute video here of another 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.740
 vehicle 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.350
 remembering that every Wednesday or 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.480
 cry I bring constructions of this style 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.030
 buildings much easier for us 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.770
