fast<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.690> make<00:02:44.830> it's<00:02:45.830> not<00:02:45.950> going<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.310> be<00:02:46.660> much

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
fast to make it's not going to be much

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.130 
fast to make it's not going to be much
harder<00:02:47.870> for<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:50.570> can<00:02:50.720> have<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:50.959> as<00:02:51.020> high

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
harder for you you can have it as high

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.260 
harder for you you can have it as high
as<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.410> want<00:02:51.590> make<00:02:52.340> any<00:02:52.640> different<00:02:53.090> rooms

actually let's do that just for a little

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.210 
actually let's do that just for a little
bit<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.120> decoration<00:03:29.680> actually<00:03:30.680> like<00:03:30.950> that
