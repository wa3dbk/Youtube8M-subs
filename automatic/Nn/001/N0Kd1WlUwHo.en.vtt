00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.829
Next-gen graphics (Hoping)
This is the part where I can talk about what

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.710
I hope to see in up-coming games.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.010
A lot of it will be repeated from my old video
on this subject, only hopefully this video

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.430
will have clearer examples.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.610
Firstly, in my 2008 video I was hoping for
an increase in parallax mapping in games.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.260
Well, forget I said that.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.750
It has been replaced with another, better,
and far simpler solution- TESSELLATION.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.890
This is effectively just increasing the number
of triangles things are made out of as you

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.400
get closer to them, which gives the impression
of more detail.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.570
If you had infinite processing power this
could replace things such as bump mapping-

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.100
in fact, rendering everything in 3D first
is how they generate the bump maps for characters

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.269
in the first place.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.889
But for now a blend of the two is the most
efficient way to go.

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:42.579
I hope that movement gets a once-over in games.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.030
Rockstar seem the only ones capable of really
fluid animations at the moment.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.039
Check out Grand Theft Auto 4 and Max Payne
3, both using Euphoria’s animation system

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.969
which can combine animations and let the computer
go free-style if it needs to.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.760
For example, if you decide to make Max jump
head-first into a concrete pillar.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.409
We’re beginning to see decent physics being
implemented into new games.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.659
Borderlands 2 has tons of debris, rip-able
cloth and real-time liquid thrown in thanks

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.909
to Nvidia’s physx, but an open-source alternative
for both Nvidia and AMD to use is needed if

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.090
these effects are to be included for more
than just visual effects in games.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.920
After trying out 3D in games, I like the idea
but it’s still poorly supported in most

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.920
games.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.070
It does well in games where the action goes
on up-close (Like Portal) or where the cameras

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.950
for individual eyes are far enough away from
each other to make everything look 3D (I find

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.110
third person games do better at this than
first person games).

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.710
The only time it really breaks the game is
where a 3D crosshair isn’t supported, making

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.310
the targeting in games impossible (Unreal
Tournament 3, for example).

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.179
The real problem is that you have a choice
between 3D and double the FPS, which can instead

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.069
be put towards better graphics and gameplay-related
improvements.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.229
If anything, 3D benefits older games better
than it does new ones, breathing a new lease

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.229
of life into them.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.369
You can't beat Deus Ex in 3D with 32x antialiasing!

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.880
Next gen graphics (realistic) and next gen
console speculation

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.440
I will be mentioning the consoles a lot in
this video, because like them or not, they

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.619
are the baseline that game developers aim
for when making games.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.790
They both contain custom processors which
make them incredibly difficult to compare

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.069
to PCs in terms of power, but their graphics
cards are the equivalent of the Geforce 7900

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.069
/ radeon 1900 series.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.040
Computer hardware is now many generations
ahead of the consoles, as you can see from

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.140
this list dating back to the year 2000.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.340
You can also see how large the gap is compared
with between previous generations.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.349
Most games today have a minimum requirement
of a Geforce 8800 or radeon 2900- this is

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.550
because this is roughly how powerful the consoles
are, plus a little bit more because PCs never

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.170
seem to be as efficient at running games and
they tend to run the games at higher resolutions.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.790
Graphics technology has slowed down since
these consoles were released, perhaps this

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.560
is because further advancements are harder
to achieve, or maybe there just simply isn’t

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.739
any point, since all games are made with the
consoles in mind.

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.840
The geforce 9000 series was a refresh of the
8000 series, the 200 series was a jump up,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.810
they skipped 300 completely for desktops and
since then have had 3 series, each more powerful

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.810
than the last.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.290
It's about time they refreshed the console
hardware.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.239
Now for fun I’m just going to predict what
the next generation of consoles will be like.

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.140
I'm predicting that they're going to be a
fair bit more powerful than today's consoles,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.340
since I don't see it worth Sony's or Microsoft's
time to release a console that's hardly any

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.460
more powerful than the last, especially since
it will be powering games for the next 10

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.460
years or so.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.751
I wouldn't be surprised if they had a custom-made
8 or 16 core processor, where each core is

00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:28.990
significantly less powerful than the one in,
say, your PC.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.950
This is based off the way they had a tri-core
processor in current consoles and how well

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.640
it performed against dual core PCs at the
time.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.950
Who knows, AMD’s method of having more cores
may eventually pay off if they go down this

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.090
route of optimising games for large number
of cores.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.239
Intel were experimenting with a 48 core processor
a couple of years ago, there must be some

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.730
kind of benefit to it.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.709
I see it as the most logical way to go, instead
of trying to make a couple of cores as efficient

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.680
as possible at crunching large amounts of
data.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.079
I mean, what was the reason for going multi-core
in the first place?

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.409
As for the graphics card, I’ve heard rumours
that it will have a Radeon 76501 which I think

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.549
would be a real disappointment if it’s true-
it would hardly be any more powerful than

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.040
the current generation2, possibly able to
run today’s console games but at full HD

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.269
and at slightly better frame-rates.

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.230
A more powerful GPU, or a dual GPU option
would be more beneficial.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.030
Most new processors have a graphics card built
in3.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.890
Although still fairly slow, they're getting
better and may eventually used in crossfire

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.220
with a separate graphics card to effectively
double performance.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:37.210
If the next gen has 'dual graphics', I reckon
it would be something along these lines.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.400
As for RAM, RAM is cheap and I hope that the
next generation has as much of it as possible.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.960
Currently, the Xbox360 and PS3 have 512 MB
of RAM altogether, for both graphics and general

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.960
use.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.000
This is a real limiting factor when it comes
to textures in-game, and this is the one main

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.530
area that current games could improve graphically.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.350
Chuck in 8 GB and watch the detail in games
go up, and the loading times go down- something

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.750
that has been promised for a long time, yet
doesn’t seem to improve as new generations

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.760
come out.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.631
Another hint at the power of the next generation
consoles comes from the tech demos that are

00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:11.060
coming out for next-generation engines.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.001
The Unreal 4 engine and Square Enix’s4 are
both running on a single geforce 680- this

00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:19.370
suggests that this could be the baseline for
the next generation of consoles.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.510
It would certainly be a big step up from current
consoles, what with the 680 being arguably

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.190
the most powerful single-gpu in the world5
right now.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.200
Don’t try and calculate what sort of spec
they could fit in for a £400 selling-price,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.850
I have no doubt that the sum of the hardware
in the next generation of consoles will be

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.080
more than their selling price initially.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.210
This happened with both the Xbox360 and the
PS3 and was done to make them as future-proof

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.550
as possible.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.830
This explains this generation’s extended
life.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.720
I’m sure it will be the same with the next
generation, and definitely hope that it’s

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.230
the case since it will be the baseline hardware
for new games to aim for until the next, next-gen.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.230
– geforce 240 is slightly below the geforce
8800 for performance, which is as close as

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.230
I can get to the geforce 7900 which is in
current generation consoles.
