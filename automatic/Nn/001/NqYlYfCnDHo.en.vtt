why I don't know from where but he does

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.809 
why I don't know from where but he does
so<00:06:35.660> that's<00:06:36.190> that's<00:06:37.190> where<00:06:37.400> you<00:06:37.490> need<00:06:37.520> the<00:06:37.669> blue

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:37.819 
so that's that's where you need the blue

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:39.490 
so that's that's where you need the blue
there<00:06:38.509> go<00:06:38.630> the<00:06:38.660> back<00:06:38.900> of<00:06:39.020> the<00:06:39.080> head<00:06:39.229> is<00:06:39.350> just

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
there go the back of the head is just

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.230 
there go the back of the head is just
simply<00:06:39.710> green<00:06:40.130> so<00:06:40.580> is<00:06:40.699> the<00:06:40.789> bottom<00:06:41.090> so<00:06:41.210> you

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
simply green so is the bottom so you

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.170 
simply green so is the bottom so you
know<00:06:41.419> it's<00:06:41.539> not<00:06:41.660> that<00:06:41.780> big<00:06:41.870> video<00:06:42.110> and<00:06:43.180> yeah
