00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.660
 through feeding by means of a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.810
 the manufacturing is very simple but 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.920
 robust with very light materials very 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.570
 pleasant to the touch and that we 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.070
 will provide long sessions of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.070

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.600
 as we see in the helmet they have the 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.280
 activation of noise cancellation 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.750
 external that really works very well 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.850
 is one of the headphones with which 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.560
 it works better and it will help us to go 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.659
 the street in a very noisy environment or 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.520
 even in indoor environments in the 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.259
 we want to isolate I do not know perfectly 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 to listen to our music or as 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.520
 we say the audio of some movie 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.329
 has two cables one for 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.979
 connect it to any audio source and 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.200
 another that has control of 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.729
 reproduction for ipod ipod and for 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.770
 of course the iphone since it also has 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.920
 with a microphone to attend to our 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.920
 calls 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.490
 the other cable will provide us with the 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.740
 possibility to connect it to any 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.560
 Type of ipod to any audio source 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.720
 also having the control to increase 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.850
 the sound or to have it more controlled 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.850
 either way the bose offer a 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.800
 great audio quality because no doubt 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.990
 we are facing a very earphones 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.400
 travelers thanks to the cancellation of 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.870
 so efficient noise that they include 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.870
