00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.289
 friends friends of the community record is 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.519
 I send many greetings like all the 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.039
 weeks thanks you are with us 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.900
 Well, football starts tomorrow but 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.669
 do not forget that during these 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.860
 months passed things there was football never 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.130
 stopped having it but look at this we have 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.710
 that a young lady got in there 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.109
 sexoservidoras in removed them they got it 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.110
 they got the treated they were sent 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.150
 they stole them 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.660
 but then something happened that is still not 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.059
 very clear second several players 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.129
 they fell into this that is the clenbuterol and 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.019
 in this the clenbuterol was already very 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.299
 Of course, they did not inject anything, 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.979
 rather what came to pass was of 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:51.229
 some way or another to leave it more 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.790
 that clear the subject that has to do 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.979
 with the meat then they 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.949
 they consumed but whatever 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:00.170
 football tomorrow and a kind is generated 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.930
 funny expectation playful and 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.760
 generous are going to release a report all 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.439
 the teams as every year live the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.299
 marketing then it's going to run from 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.040
 you from the stores closest to your 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.110
 address so you can buy t 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.800
 supplier and that you feel like part of 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.750
 some equipment but the most important thing is 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.030
 that what we have very in the short term 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.940
 is the world sub-20 that's very 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.280
 important because if this generation 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:29.320
 sub-20 manages to develop a great tournament 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.480
 we could start now yes and believe with 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.030
 more strength than our forces 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.980
 basic our young if you really 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.250
 can build a future there is a 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.440
 we have been champions of 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.910
 sub-20 twice and we continue 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.310
 being a team of medium-level hair 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.720
 world then hopefully all this we 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.700

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.140
