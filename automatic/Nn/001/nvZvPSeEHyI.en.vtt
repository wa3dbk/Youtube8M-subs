hello today we're talking about

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.370 
hello today we're talking about
experiments<00:00:02.850> with<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.179> barometer<00:00:03.419> now<00:00:04.230> I'm

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
experiments with a barometer now I'm

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.840 
experiments with a barometer now I'm
going<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.620> show<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:04.859> how<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.130> make<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.430> homemade

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
going to show you how to make a homemade

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.670 
going to show you how to make a homemade
barometer<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.600> how<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.870> use<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.290> here<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.470> just

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
barometer and how to use it here in just

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.650 
barometer and how to use it here in just
a<00:00:07.830> moment<00:00:08.189> but<00:00:08.550> what<00:00:08.760> experiment<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.389> can<00:00:09.510> do

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
a moment but what experiment you can do

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.749 
a moment but what experiment you can do
if<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:09.990> already<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> barometer<00:00:11.040> at<00:00:11.550> home

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
if you already have a barometer at home

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.390 
if you already have a barometer at home
is<00:00:12.059> take<00:00:12.809> some<00:00:13.019> measurements<00:00:13.380> first<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.250> all

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
is take some measurements first of all

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.939 
is take some measurements first of all
on<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.639> day<00:00:15.210> where<00:00:15.630> it's<00:00:15.929> kind<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.350> average

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
on a day where it's kind of average

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.099 
on a day where it's kind of average
maybe<00:00:17.340> some<00:00:17.670> clouds<00:00:17.970> maybe<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.630> little<00:00:18.900> bit<00:00:18.990> of

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
maybe some clouds maybe a little bit of

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.769 
maybe some clouds maybe a little bit of
Sun<00:00:19.350> no<00:00:19.949> rain<00:00:20.220> take<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> measurement<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
Sun no rain take the measurement of the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.230 
Sun no rain take the measurement of the
barometer<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.680> day<00:00:22.949> now<00:00:23.519> over<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.029> next

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240

barometer on that day now over the next
two<00:00:24.510> weeks<00:00:24.779> what<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.710> every<00:00:26.310> day<00:00:26.519> at

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
two weeks what you do is every day at

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.849 
two weeks what you do is every day at
the<00:00:27.210> same<00:00:27.480> time<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.289> take<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> pressure

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the same time you take the pressure

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.800 
the same time you take the pressure
reading<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.490> then<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.119> chart<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
reading and then you can chart that on a

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.749 
reading and then you can chart that on a
piece<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.199> paper<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.099> also<00:00:32.250> want<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
piece of paper but I also want you to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.330 
piece of paper but I also want you to
add<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> couple<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.750> other<00:00:33.989> readings<00:00:34.500> notice

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
add a couple of other readings notice

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.270 
add a couple of other readings notice
when<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> sky<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.750> sunniest<00:00:37.200> take<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
when the sky is the sunniest take the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.090 
when the sky is the sunniest take the
pressure<00:00:38.520> reading<00:00:38.940> then<00:00:39.149> also<00:00:39.559> when<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> sky

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
pressure reading then also when the sky

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.330 
pressure reading then also when the sky
is<00:00:41.579> filled<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.480> storms<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.260> rainfall<00:00:43.500> take

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
is filled with storms or rainfall take

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.760 
is filled with storms or rainfall take
the<00:00:44.489> pressure<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.059> point<00:00:45.510> too<00:00:45.809> now<00:00:46.559> as

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the pressure at that point too now as

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.860 
the pressure at that point too now as
you<00:00:46.920> look<00:00:47.129> over<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.430> chart<00:00:47.879> make<00:00:48.570> sure<00:00:48.719> that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
you look over your chart make sure that

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.660 
you look over your chart make sure that
you<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> time<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.950> took<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
you have the time that you took the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.639 
you have the time that you took the
pressure<00:00:51.030> readings<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.899> day<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.500> took

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
pressure readings the day that you took

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.470 
pressure readings the day that you took
the<00:00:52.800> pressure<00:00:53.010> readings<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.640> also<00:00:54.000> note<00:00:54.270> when

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the pressure readings and also note when

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
the pressure readings and also note when
it<00:00:54.570> was<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> sunniest<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.469> when<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.160> was<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it was the sunniest and when it was the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.150 
it was the sunniest and when it was the
stormiest<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.480> compare<00:00:58.440> those<00:00:58.680> readings

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
stormiest and compare those readings

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.979 
stormiest and compare those readings
you'll<00:00:59.640> notice<00:01:00.000> first<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you'll notice first of all that the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.900 
you'll notice first of all that the
pressure<00:01:01.440> has<00:01:01.649> been<00:01:01.770> fluctuating<00:01:02.579> from<00:01:02.699> day

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
pressure has been fluctuating from day

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.060 
pressure has been fluctuating from day
to<00:01:02.969> day<00:01:03.090> sometimes<00:01:04.019> higher<00:01:04.290> sometimes<00:01:04.650> lower

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
to day sometimes higher sometimes lower

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.190 
to day sometimes higher sometimes lower
but<00:01:05.339> what<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.610> should<00:01:05.880> find<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> days

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
but what you should find is on the days

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.469 
but what you should find is on the days
where<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> stormiest<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:09.150> when<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
where it's the stormiest that's when the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.060 
where it's the stormiest that's when the
pressure<00:01:09.720> reading<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.500> lowest<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
pressure reading will be the lowest and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.710 
pressure reading will be the lowest and
on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> day<00:01:11.729> where<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> sunniest

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
on the day where it's the sunniest

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.750 
on the day where it's the sunniest
without<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> cloud<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.590> sky<00:01:13.680> that's<00:01:14.520> when

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
without a cloud in the sky that's when

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760 
without a cloud in the sky that's when
the<00:01:14.850> pressure<00:01:15.119> will<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.930> highest<00:01:16.140> now

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the pressure will be the highest now

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.679 
the pressure will be the highest now
here's<00:01:16.979> how<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> use<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.729> homemade<00:01:18.150> barometer

tape and tape that straw to the top of

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.149 
tape and tape that straw to the top of
the<00:01:38.820> balloon<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.560> what<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.680> want<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.009> from

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the balloon and what you want to do from

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.899 
the balloon and what you want to do from
here<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.780> measure<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.200> 2-week<00:01:43.860> basis<00:01:44.340> what

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
here is measure on a 2-week basis what

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.490 
here is measure on a 2-week basis what
the<00:01:45.119> pressure<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.689> doing<00:01:45.990> because<00:01:46.259> what

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the pressure is doing because what

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.560 
the pressure is doing because what
you'll<00:01:46.710> notice<00:01:47.009> when<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> pressure<00:01:47.939> rises

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you'll notice when the pressure rises

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 
you'll notice when the pressure rises
outside<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.890> means<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.310> air<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
outside that means the air on the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.910 
outside that means the air on the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
outside of the can is now higher that's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.190 
outside of the can is now higher that's
going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.159> push<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.729> balloon<00:01:54.090> down<00:01:54.360> causing

going to push that balloon down causing

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.280 
going to push that balloon down causing
the<00:01:55.290> straw<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.950> pivot<00:01:56.159> up<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.960> go<00:01:58.140> over

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the straw to pivot up and as you go over

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.990 
the straw to pivot up and as you go over
the<00:01:58.409> next<00:01:58.560> two<00:01:58.740> weeks<00:01:58.979> you'll<00:01:59.219> notice<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.700> days

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the next two weeks you'll notice on days

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.389 
the next two weeks you'll notice on days
when<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> pressure<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.840> low<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
when the pressure is low that the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.429 
when the pressure is low that the

that<00:02:30.520> day<00:02:30.700> as<00:02:30.880> those<00:02:31.120> types<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.960> weather<00:02:32.200> are

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
that day as those types of weather are

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.960 
that day as those types of weather are
pretty<00:02:32.800> typical<00:02:32.980> with<00:02:33.460> high<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.910> low

pretty typical with high and low

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.910 
pretty typical with high and low
pressure<00:02:34.750> those<00:02:35.230> are<00:02:35.350> just<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.620> couple<00:02:35.800> of

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
pressure those are just a couple of

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.900 
pressure those are just a couple of
experiments<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.580> can<00:02:36.700> do<00:02:36.850> with<00:02:37.360> barometers
