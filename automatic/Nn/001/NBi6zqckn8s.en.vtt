got<00:00:37.559> elastic<00:00:38.559> in<00:00:39.010> it<00:00:39.130> so<00:00:39.370> that<00:00:39.520> when<00:00:39.640> it's

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
you've got the veil which locks onto the

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.290 
you've got the veil which locks onto the
hat<00:00:53.080> and<00:00:53.550> zippers<00:00:54.550> to<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.330> suit<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:58.059> I'm<00:00:58.150> just

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
hat and zippers to the suit and I'm just

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.139 
hat and zippers to the suit and I'm just
going<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.449> zip<00:00:58.750> it

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.469 

so<00:01:04.689> you<00:01:04.780> can<00:01:04.929> see<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:07.000> pretty<00:01:07.270> much<00:01:07.420> a

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
so you can see it's pretty much a

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:15.809 
so you can see it's pretty much a
one-person<00:01:08.170> operation<00:01:13.679> and<00:01:14.679> you<00:01:15.670> can

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
one-person operation and you can

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:17.459 
one-person operation and you can
actually<00:01:16.030> unzip<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:16.929> that<00:01:17.079> you<00:01:17.170> can<00:01:17.319> just

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
actually unzip it so that you can just

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:18.630 
actually unzip it so that you can just
flip<00:01:17.619> it<00:01:17.740> over<00:01:17.859> and<00:01:17.950> have<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.219> hanging<00:01:18.429> off<00:01:18.520> the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
flip it over and have it hanging off the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.699 
flip it over and have it hanging off the
back<00:01:18.869> I'm<00:01:19.869> just<00:01:19.929> gonna<00:01:20.140> go<00:01:20.319> ahead<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.530> take<00:01:20.679> it

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:20.709 
back I'm just gonna go ahead and take it

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:23.059 
back I'm just gonna go ahead and take it
all<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.920> way<00:01:21.009> off

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
all the way off

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:28.679 
all the way off
so<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:26.229> just<00:01:26.409> comes<00:01:26.590> off<00:01:26.969> we<00:01:27.969> got<00:01:28.149> two

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
so that just comes off we got two

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.240 
so that just comes off we got two
choices<00:01:28.899> on<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.259> hats<00:01:29.439> you've<00:01:29.649> got<00:01:29.799> this<00:01:30.009> one

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
choices on the hats you've got this one

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.219 
choices on the hats you've got this one
which<00:01:30.399> is<00:01:30.549> a<00:01:32.399> PVC<00:01:33.399> material<00:01:34.000> it's<00:01:34.840> got<00:01:34.990> very

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
which is a PVC material it's got very

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.899 
which is a PVC material it's got very
small<00:01:35.319> gaps<00:01:35.829> in<00:01:36.039> it<00:01:36.130> so<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.340> bees<00:01:36.489> can't<00:01:36.759> get

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
small gaps in it so the bees can't get

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.839 
small gaps in it so the bees can't get
into<00:01:37.179> it<00:01:37.439> very<00:01:38.439> tight<00:01:38.679> mesh<00:01:38.920> on<00:01:39.159> here<00:01:39.399> allows

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:39.849 
into it very tight mesh on here allows

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.089 
into it very tight mesh on here allows
good<00:01:40.060> visibility<00:01:40.720> at<00:01:41.319> the<00:01:41.439> same<00:01:41.649> time<00:01:41.890> with

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
good visibility at the same time with

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.550 
good visibility at the same time with
the<00:01:42.219> elastic<00:01:42.670> around<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:42.969> Hat<00:01:43.209> and<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
the elastic around the Hat and the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.529 
the elastic around the Hat and the
zipper<00:01:45.340> at<00:01:45.429> the<00:01:45.489> bottom<00:01:45.880> you're<00:01:46.299> not<00:01:46.420> gonna

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
zipper at the bottom you're not gonna

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.779 
zipper at the bottom you're not gonna
have<00:01:46.689> to<00:01:46.750> worry<00:01:46.899> about<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.140> bees<00:01:47.289> getting<00:01:47.619> in

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
have to worry about the bees getting in

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.639 
have to worry about the bees getting in
also<00:01:48.789> works<00:01:49.030> well<00:01:49.539> for<00:01:49.569> Yellowjackets<00:01:50.500> and

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
also works well for Yellowjackets and

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.050 
also works well for Yellowjackets and
another<00:01:50.979> stinging<00:01:51.459> insect<00:01:51.789> so<00:01:51.879> you<00:01:51.939> might

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
another stinging insect so you might

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.940 
another stinging insect so you might
want<00:01:52.179> to<00:01:52.209> have<00:01:52.329> to<00:01:52.390> deal<00:01:52.509> with<00:01:52.689> and<00:01:53.439> then<00:01:53.829> the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
want to have to deal with and then the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.660 
want to have to deal with and then the
one<00:01:54.099> piece<00:01:54.310> suit<00:01:54.810> again<00:01:56.310> if<00:01:57.310> you're<00:01:57.549> doing

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
one piece suit again if you're doing

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
honeybees they're not particularly

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.600 
honeybees they're not particularly
aggressive<00:01:58.959> usually<00:01:59.649> unless<00:02:00.159> you're<00:02:00.369> messing

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
aggressive usually unless you're messing

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.029 
aggressive usually unless you're messing
with<00:02:00.640> their<00:02:00.819> honey<00:02:01.379> and<00:02:02.379> at<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.679> point<00:02:02.860> you

probably want to smoke them but you can

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.910 
probably want to smoke them but you can
always<00:02:06.099> tape<00:02:06.520> up<00:02:06.729> any<00:02:06.909> places<00:02:07.209> like<00:02:07.989> here

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
always tape up any places like here

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.529 
always tape up any places like here
