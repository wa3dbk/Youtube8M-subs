00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
at two points on both sides we turn the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.220 
at two points on both sides we turn the
bolt<00:00:27.860> on<00:00:28.100> a<00:00:28.130> bed<00:00:28.430> frame<00:00:28.730> into<00:00:29.570> a<00:00:29.600> hook<00:00:29.840> on<00:00:29.990> bed

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
bolt on a bed frame into a hook on bed

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:40.209 
bolt on a bed frame into a hook on bed
frame<00:00:30.580> it's<00:00:31.580> pretty<00:00:31.880> simple

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.150 

so<00:00:40.879> here<00:00:41.269> we're<00:00:41.510> going<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:41.960> use<00:00:42.289> a<00:00:42.320> queen-size

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
so here we're going to use a queen-size

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.479 
so here we're going to use a queen-size
bed<00:00:43.190> frame<00:00:43.969> with<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.329> full-size<00:00:45.019> headboard<00:00:45.769> the

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
bed frame with a full-size headboard the

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.520 
bed frame with a full-size headboard the
headboard<00:00:46.910> hooks<00:00:47.180> on<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:48.109> bed<00:00:48.289> frame

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
headboard hooks on and the bed frame

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.029 
headboard hooks on and the bed frame
bolts<00:00:48.949> on<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.230> we're<00:00:51.230> using<00:00:51.440> a<00:00:51.589> bedrick

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
bolts on so we're using a bedrick

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.389 
bolts on so we're using a bedrick
adaptor<00:00:52.610> this<00:00:53.269> is<00:00:53.449> it<00:00:53.659> right<00:00:54.079> here<00:00:54.409> so<00:00:55.070> we're

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
adaptor this is it right here so we're

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.740 
adaptor this is it right here so we're
going<00:00:55.519> to<00:00:55.579> go<00:00:55.699> ahead<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.030> hook<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.329> bed<00:00:56.510> hook

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
going to go ahead and hook the bed hook

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.079 
going to go ahead and hook the bed hook
adaptor<00:00:57.199> in<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.159> then<00:00:58.309> we're<00:00:58.460> going<00:00:58.610> to<00:00:58.670> use<00:00:58.850> a

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
adaptor in and then we're going to use a

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.689 
adaptor in and then we're going to use a
mod<00:00:59.390> plate<00:00:59.860> when<00:01:00.860> we<00:01:00.949> use<00:01:01.159> these<00:01:01.399> two<00:01:01.670> little

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
mod plate when we use these two little

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.029 
mod plate when we use these two little
gadgets<00:01:02.449> to<00:01:02.829> make<00:01:03.829> this<00:01:04.009> workout<00:01:05.500> so<00:01:06.500> we<00:01:06.890> have

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
gadgets to make this workout so we have

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:08.590 
gadgets to make this workout so we have
the<00:01:07.190> bedding<00:01:07.520> adaptor<00:01:07.940> it's<00:01:08.090> already<00:01:08.420> in

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
there and then we're going to attach the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:28.630 
there and then we're going to attach the
mod<00:01:13.820> plate<00:01:16.330> right<00:01:17.330> here

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.859
