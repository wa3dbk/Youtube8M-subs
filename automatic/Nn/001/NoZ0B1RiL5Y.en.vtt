00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
there we go that was a pretty big one so

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:58.670 
there we go that was a pretty big one so
as<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:58.319> see<00:02:58.379> they're<00:02:58.620> actually

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
as you can see they're actually

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.900

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
mouths and that's what creates a big

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.680 
mouths and that's what creates a big
splash<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.879> mean<00:03:02.879> that's<00:03:03.060> what<00:03:03.180> we<00:03:03.269> focused<00:03:03.629> a

splash I mean that's what we focused a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.600 
splash I mean that's what we focused a
lot<00:03:03.780> on<00:03:03.840> our<00:03:03.989> programs<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.220> not<00:03:05.370> just

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
lot on our programs and it's not just

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.280 
lot on our programs and it's not just
