I<00:02:02.039> know<00:02:02.490> most<00:02:02.579> people<00:02:02.820> don't<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.090> we

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
I know most people don't know that we

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:23.020 
I know most people don't know that we
have<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.360> desert<00:02:03.689> area<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.049> see<00:02:04.229> so

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.670 

motivated<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.660> then<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.260> pull<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
motivated this and then we pull the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.460 
motivated this and then we pull the
lines<00:02:25.890> for<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.340> moisture<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.750> feed<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.260> roots

of<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.710> plants<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.430> then<00:02:29.880> we'll<00:02:30.060> cover<00:02:30.270> it

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
of the plants and then we'll cover it

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.840 
of the plants and then we'll cover it
with<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.600> black<00:02:31.380> mulch<00:02:32.160> they<00:02:32.460> call<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.760> a

plastic<00:02:33.330> mulch<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.380> between<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.860> rows<00:02:35.040> we

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
plastic mulch and in between the rows we

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.800 
plastic mulch and in between the rows we
lay<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.670> alfalfa<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.390> that's<00:02:36.570> where<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.750> gets

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
lay the alfalfa and that's where it gets

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.470 
lay the alfalfa and that's where it gets
his<00:02:37.050> nutrition<00:02:37.640> so<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.820> will<00:02:38.970> go<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.180> till

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
his nutrition so this will go on till

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.780 
his nutrition so this will go on till
about<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.020> middle<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.260> October<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.610> then

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
about the middle of October and then

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.890 
about the middle of October and then
we'll<00:02:42.000> harvest<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:43.520> one<00:02:44.520> of<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.900> crucial

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
we'll harvest it one of the crucial

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.870 
we'll harvest it one of the crucial
things<00:02:46.320> with<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.740> stevia<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.610> we<00:02:47.730> have

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
things with this stevia is that we have

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.400 
things with this stevia is that we have
to<00:02:48.000> get<00:02:48.090> into<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> ground<00:02:48.660> at<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.870> certain<00:02:49.080> time

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
to get into the ground at a certain time

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.320 
to get into the ground at a certain time
because<00:02:49.860> our<00:02:50.040> growing<00:02:50.340> seasons<00:02:50.880> not<00:02:51.060> that

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.839 
reason I'm telling you that is that
that's<00:04:47.060> how<00:04:47.840> this<00:04:48.080> alfalfa<00:04:49.069> differs<00:04:49.460> from<00:04:49.729> the

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
that's how this alfalfa differs from the

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.839 
that's how this alfalfa differs from the
sprouts<00:04:50.509> in<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.919> roots<00:04:52.219> go<00:04:52.460> down<00:04:52.610> about

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
sprouts in that the roots go down about

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.730 
sprouts in that the roots go down about
a<00:04:52.909> hundred<00:04:53.090> feet<00:04:53.479> picks<00:04:54.229> up<00:04:54.409> all<00:04:54.560> the

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
a hundred feet picks up all the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.709 
a hundred feet picks up all the
nutrients<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:55.870> minerals<00:04:56.870> out<00:04:57.349> of<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.770> soil

00:04:58.709 --> 00:04:58.719 
nutrients and minerals out of the soil

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.089 
nutrients and minerals out of the soil
it<00:04:59.719> was<00:04:59.870> just<00:05:00.050> saying<00:05:00.349> like<00:05:00.500> it<00:05:00.650> was<00:05:00.800> on<00:05:00.949> that

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
it was just saying like it was on that

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.369 
it was just saying like it was on that
only<00:05:01.849> after<00:05:02.240> ten<00:05:02.419> years<00:05:02.449> of<00:05:02.689> working<00:05:03.139> this

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
only after ten years of working this

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.219 
only after ten years of working this
thing<00:05:03.439> it<00:05:04.189> is<00:05:04.430> very<00:05:04.580> different<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.960> soil<00:05:06.110> here

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
thing it is very different the soil here

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.019 
thing it is very different the soil here
than<00:05:06.590> what<00:05:06.740> most<00:05:06.979> organic<00:05:07.340> farmers<00:05:07.819> would<00:05:07.939> be

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:08.029 
than what most organic farmers would be

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:09.219 
than what most organic farmers would be
working<00:05:08.210> with<00:05:08.479> they're<00:05:08.659> looking<00:05:08.930> for<00:05:09.110> that

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
working with they're looking for that

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:10.929 
working with they're looking for that
when<00:05:09.349> they<00:05:09.439> squeeze<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.460> that<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:10.699> sticks

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:10.939 
when they squeeze it that it sticks

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:12.610 
when they squeeze it that it sticks
together<00:05:11.120> it's<00:05:11.569> never<00:05:11.900> going<00:05:12.020> to<00:05:12.080> happen<00:05:12.169> here

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
together it's never going to happen here

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.079 
together it's never going to happen here
it<00:05:12.770> doesn't<00:05:12.919> matter<00:05:13.129> how<00:05:13.279> much<00:05:13.490> water<00:05:13.729> we<00:05:13.879> put

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:14.089 
it doesn't matter how much water we put

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.869 
it doesn't matter how much water we put
to<00:05:14.180> this<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.539> how<00:05:15.050> much<00:05:15.639> alfalfa<00:05:16.639> plant

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:16.879 
to this and how much alfalfa plant

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.959 
to this and how much alfalfa plant
material<00:05:17.300> goes<00:05:18.139> into<00:05:18.589> that<00:05:18.620> soil<00:05:19.069> it's<00:05:19.639> never

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
material goes into that soil it's never

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.079 
material goes into that soil it's never
going<00:05:20.180> to<00:05:20.270> do<00:05:20.449> that<00:05:20.479> because<00:05:20.870> of<00:05:21.199> the<00:05:21.699> sand<00:05:22.699> but

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:23.089 
going to do that because of the sand but

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.939 
going to do that because of the sand but
which<00:05:23.389> is<00:05:23.539> absolutely<00:05:24.050> fantastic<00:05:24.229> for<00:05:24.889> the

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
which is absolutely fantastic for the

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.709 
which is absolutely fantastic for the
crops<00:05:25.189> that<00:05:25.279> we<00:05:25.460> grow<00:05:25.490> that's<00:05:26.180> what<00:05:26.389> they<00:05:26.479> love

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
crops that we grow that's what they love

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:29.709 
crops that we grow that's what they love
the<00:05:27.349> mineral-rich<00:05:27.939> sandy<00:05:28.939> soil<00:05:29.210> this<00:05:29.330> was<00:05:29.539> all

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
the mineral-rich sandy soil this was all

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.769 
the mineral-rich sandy soil this was all
old<00:05:30.110> river<00:05:30.409> bottom<00:05:30.770> if<00:05:31.419> you<00:05:32.419> know<00:05:32.509> if<00:05:32.599> you<00:05:32.689> had

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779 
old river bottom if you know if you had

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.079 
old river bottom if you know if you had
to<00:05:32.870> look<00:05:33.050> at<00:05:33.169> the<00:05:33.500> way<00:05:34.159> the<00:05:34.279> land<00:05:34.520> like<00:05:34.789> she<00:05:34.939> can

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:35.089 
to look at the way the land like she can

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:37.240 
to look at the way the land like she can
tell<00:05:35.330> that<00:05:35.599> this<00:05:35.839> was<00:05:36.110> part<00:05:36.649> of<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.860> river<00:05:37.009> at

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
tell that this was part of the river at

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.550 
tell that this was part of the river at
one<00:05:37.399> point<00:05:37.610> in<00:05:37.789> time<00:05:37.930> so<00:05:38.930> we<00:05:39.020> got<00:05:39.139> phenomenal

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
one point in time so we got phenomenal

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.740 
one point in time so we got phenomenal
minerals<00:05:40.520> here<00:05:40.669> it's<00:05:40.909> very<00:05:41.330> pure<00:05:41.719> and

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
minerals here it's very pure and

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.019 
minerals here it's very pure and
pristine<00:05:41.990> I<00:05:42.469> mean<00:05:42.770> it's<00:05:42.919> a<00:05:43.039> farm<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.550> it<00:05:43.849> might

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
pristine I mean it's a farm and it might

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.689 
pristine I mean it's a farm and it might
not<00:05:44.060> like<00:05:44.360> tidy<00:05:44.599> but<00:05:44.839> it<00:05:44.960> is<00:05:45.110> very<00:05:45.460> pristine<00:05:46.460> as

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
not like tidy but it is very pristine as

00:05:46.699 --> 00:06:07.950 
not like tidy but it is very pristine as
the<00:05:46.819> way<00:05:47.110> nature<00:05:48.110> intended<00:05:48.580> plants<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:49.699> grow
