he wants to be in the video and then on

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.940 
he wants to be in the video and then on
this<00:01:59.110> map<00:01:59.290> this<00:01:59.409> one<00:01:59.560> would<00:01:59.680> be<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.770> little

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
this map this one would be a little

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.440 
this map this one would be a little
further<00:02:00.159> away<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:00.759> we<00:02:00.970> go<00:02:01.060> ahead<00:02:01.210> take<00:02:01.330> the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
further away so we go ahead take the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.719 
further away so we go ahead take the
elevator<00:02:01.720> down<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.159> then<00:02:03.159> it<00:02:03.280> will<00:02:03.340> be<00:02:03.490> in<00:02:03.610> the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
elevator down and then it will be in the

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.029 
elevator down and then it will be in the
main<00:02:04.000> computer<00:02:04.450> lab<00:02:04.990> area<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.649> guess<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.920> best

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
main computer lab area I guess the best

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.560 
main computer lab area I guess the best
way<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.220> call<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:06.610> just<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.030> get<00:02:07.149> some<00:02:07.299> points

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
way to call it just you get some points

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.930 
way to call it just you get some points
real<00:02:07.720> quick<00:02:07.930> before<00:02:08.080> we<00:02:08.259> go<00:02:08.410> down<00:02:08.819> all<00:02:09.819> right

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
real quick before we go down all right

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.750 
real quick before we go down all right
there<00:02:10.090> we<00:02:10.179> go<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:11.400> was<00:02:12.400> actually<00:02:12.670> pretty

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
surprised that they actually put this

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.240 
surprised that they actually put this
back<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.260> game<00:02:14.470> but<00:02:14.800> like<00:02:14.890> i<00:02:14.980> said<00:02:15.010> before

let's<00:03:04.600> go<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:05.970> think<00:03:06.970> they<00:03:07.090> already<00:03:07.180> up<00:03:07.420> they

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
let's go I think they already up they

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.610 
let's go I think they already up they
already<00:03:07.660> opened<00:03:07.959> up<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.079> door<00:03:08.290> right<00:03:08.560> over

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620
