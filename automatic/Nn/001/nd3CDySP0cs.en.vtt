if<00:03:15.420> they<00:03:15.599> did<00:03:15.810> it's<00:03:16.079> going<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.290> be<00:03:16.380> super<00:03:16.650> fast

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
if they did it's going to be super fast

can go you can put it on on demand which

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.250 
can go you can put it on on demand which
will<00:04:13.139> I'll<00:04:13.380> ramp<00:04:13.650> up<00:04:13.829> as<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:14.310> needed<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:15.260> let

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
will I'll ramp up as it's needed and let

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.259 
will I'll ramp up as it's needed and let
me<00:04:16.320> show<00:04:16.349> you<00:04:16.530> someone's<00:04:16.919> test<00:04:17.160> pretty<00:04:18.120> good

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
me show you someone's test pretty good

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.640 
me show you someone's test pretty good
actually

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.010 

I<00:04:21.650> was<00:04:22.220> getting<00:04:22.520> like<00:04:22.670> almost<00:04:23.090> over<00:04:24.020> 3000<00:04:26.020> so

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
I was getting like almost over 3000 so

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.190 
I was getting like almost over 3000 so
this<00:04:27.830> is<00:04:27.860> a<00:04:28.040> really<00:04:28.220> good<00:04:28.490> rom<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:28.730> think<00:04:29.200> I'll

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
this is a really good rom I think I'll

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.320 
this is a really good rom I think I'll
have<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.680> test<00:04:31.100> out<00:04:31.400> more<00:04:31.820> but<00:04:32.740> I<00:04:34.150> think<00:04:35.150> it's<00:04:35.270> a

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
have to test out more but I think it's a

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.870 
have to test out more but I think it's a
really<00:04:35.480> good<00:04:35.570> one<00:04:35.920> it's<00:04:36.920> action<00:04:37.460> alpha

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
really good one it's action alpha

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.540 
really good one it's action alpha
version<00:04:38.180> in<00:04:39.140> other<00:04:39.290> words<00:04:39.530> I<00:04:39.950> guess<00:04:40.250> sometimes

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
version in other words I guess sometimes

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.580 
version in other words I guess sometimes
it<00:04:40.880> can<00:04:41.000> reboot<00:04:41.360> but<00:04:41.690> so<00:04:41.870> far<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.410> hasn't

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
it can reboot but so far it hasn't

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.480 
it can reboot but so far it hasn't
rebooted<00:04:43.240> but<00:04:44.240> haven't<00:04:44.540> used<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.170> for<00:04:45.530> long<00:04:45.710> so

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
rebooted but haven't used it for long so

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.720 
rebooted but haven't used it for long so
hopefully<00:04:47.390> when<00:04:47.540> we<00:04:47.570> reboot<00:04:48.460> but<00:04:49.460> i'll<00:04:49.550> have

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
hopefully when we reboot but i'll have

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.630 
hopefully when we reboot but i'll have
it<00:04:49.910> set<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:50.960> at<00:04:51.640> one<00:04:52.640> point<00:04:52.820> 4<00:04:53.060> gigahertz<00:04:53.360> at

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
it set it at one point 4 gigahertz at

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.220 
it set it at one point 4 gigahertz at
performance<00:04:55.640> for<00:04:56.180> a<00:04:56.210> whole<00:04:56.390> day<00:04:56.420> and<00:04:56.690> see<00:04:56.870> it

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
performance for a whole day and see it

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.120 
performance for a whole day and see it
reboots<00:04:58.630> bottom<00:04:59.630> it's<00:04:59.870> a<00:05:00.110> really<00:05:00.440> good<00:05:00.530> rom<00:05:00.860> i

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
reboots bottom it's a really good rom i

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.090 
reboots bottom it's a really good rom i
think<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:01.550> it's<00:05:01.850> very<00:05:02.480> water<00:05:03.320> down<00:05:03.620> if<00:05:03.920> you

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
think so it's very water down if you

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.670 
think so it's very water down if you
want<00:05:04.280> something<00:05:04.520> super<00:05:05.000> fast<00:05:05.380> no<00:05:06.380> bloatware

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
want something super fast no bloatware

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.350 
want something super fast no bloatware
this<00:05:07.490> is<00:05:07.640> definitely<00:05:07.850> a<00:05:08.120> great<00:05:08.480> room<00:05:08.720> to<00:05:08.870> get

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
this is definitely a great room to get

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.820 
this is definitely a great room to get
everything's<00:05:11.360> working<00:05:11.780> for<00:05:12.020> G<00:05:12.260> so<00:05:12.560> I've<00:05:12.620> got

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
everything's working for G so I've got

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.530 
everything's working for G so I've got
33<00:05:13.700> 36<00:05:14.660> that<00:05:15.050> is<00:05:15.230> very<00:05:15.470> respectable<00:05:17.530> Olympic

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
33 36 that is very respectable Olympic

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.950 
33 36 that is very respectable Olympic
us<00:05:20.540> to<00:05:20.870> single<00:05:21.590> thread<00:05:22.600> let's<00:05:23.600> see<00:05:23.750> what<00:05:23.870> kind

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
us to single thread let's see what kind

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.480 
us to single thread let's see what kind
of<00:05:24.110> numbers<00:05:24.410> again<00:05:25.540> 24

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.159 

24

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.939 

24<00:05:36.129> so<00:05:36.729> about<00:05:36.999> 24<00:05:37.599> that's<00:05:37.840> not<00:05:37.990> super<00:05:38.229> fast<00:05:38.620> but

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
24 so about 24 that's not super fast but

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.489 
24 so about 24 that's not super fast but
those<00:05:39.159> aren't<00:05:39.370> all<00:05:39.669> the<00:05:39.969> numbers<00:05:40.360> quadrant<00:05:41.349> is

00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:41.499 
those aren't all the numbers quadrant is

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:45.529 
those aren't all the numbers quadrant is
more<00:05:41.740> more<00:05:42.699> I<00:05:42.759> think<00:05:42.930> exact<00:05:43.930> as<00:05:44.289> far<00:05:44.650> as

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
more more I think exact as far as

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.450 
more more I think exact as far as
getting<00:05:46.539> performance<00:05:47.289> out<00:05:47.499> of<00:05:47.529> your<00:05:47.740> nexus<00:05:48.310> s

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
getting performance out of your nexus s

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.640 
getting performance out of your nexus s
but<00:05:49.090> that's<00:05:49.240> really<00:05:49.449> fast<00:05:49.870> comparing<00:05:50.499> to

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
but that's really fast comparing to

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.390 
but that's really fast comparing to
other<00:05:50.680> devices<00:05:51.129> i<00:05:51.610> have<00:05:52.199> near<00:05:53.199> 3500<00:05:54.129> and<00:05:54.310> i'm

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
other devices i have near 3500 and i'm

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.070 
other devices i have near 3500 and i'm
sure<00:05:54.610> if<00:05:54.699> i<00:05:54.789> run<00:05:55.029> a<00:05:55.090> couple<00:05:55.330> more<00:05:55.539> times<00:05:55.840> the
