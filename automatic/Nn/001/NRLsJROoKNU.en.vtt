and<00:02:11.370> second<00:02:11.879> watching<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.629> one<00:02:12.810> four<00:02:13.050> ball

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
and second watching that one four ball

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.020 
and second watching that one four ball
it<00:02:15.599> is<00:02:15.750> kind<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.050> difficult<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.770> like<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:17.940> I

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030

going to miss that one so it's going to

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.930 
going to miss that one so it's going to
roll<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.480> wall<00:02:46.080> should<00:02:46.980> get<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> triple<00:02:47.700> out<00:02:47.790> of

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
roll to wall should get a triple out of

roll to wall should get a triple out of
this<00:02:48.090> no<00:02:48.390> problem<00:02:48.840> at<00:02:48.930> all<00:02:49.019> except<00:02:49.519> goes<00:02:50.519> off

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
this no problem at all except goes off

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.590 
this no problem at all except goes off
his<00:02:51.150> glove<00:02:52.519> so<00:02:53.519> it's<00:02:53.940> like<00:02:54.420> an

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
his glove so it's like an

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.509

yeah see now I'm one for two I got to

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.630 
yeah see now I'm one for two I got to
circle<00:03:15.569> all<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.750> bases<00:03:16.290> on<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.860> don't

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
circle all the bases on that I don't

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.490 
circle all the bases on that I don't
think<00:03:18.030> I've<00:03:18.239> had<00:03:18.390> anything<00:03:18.989> remotely<00:03:19.320> close

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
ever so I'm happy I don't know I guess

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.420 
ever so I'm happy I don't know I guess
I'd<00:03:45.690> be<00:03:45.810> even<00:03:46.079> more<00:03:46.260> happy<00:03:46.500> if<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:46.950> wasn't<00:03:47.310> like

mean<00:04:36.960> I'm<00:04:37.050> getting<00:04:37.170> a<00:04:37.290> lot<00:04:37.470> of<00:04:37.620> cool<00:04:37.770> things<00:04:37.880> to

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
mean I'm getting a lot of cool things to

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.630 
mean I'm getting a lot of cool things to
do<00:04:39.830> covering<00:04:40.830> second<00:04:41.250> when<00:04:41.340> somebody's

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
do covering second when somebody's

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.310 
do covering second when somebody's
trying<00:04:41.790> to<00:04:41.940> steal<00:04:42.060> starting<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.870> double<00:04:43.140> play

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
trying to steal starting a double play

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.420 
trying to steal starting a double play
being<00:04:43.590> part<00:04:43.950> of<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.340> double<00:04:44.550> play<00:04:46.010> all<00:04:47.010> of<00:04:47.070> that

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
being part of a double play all of that

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.460 
being part of a double play all of that
but<00:04:47.870> apparently<00:04:48.870> nothing<00:04:49.740> going<00:04:50.010> today<00:04:51.470> with

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
but apparently nothing going today with

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.050 
but apparently nothing going today with
it<00:04:52.590> being<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.860> top<00:04:53.040> of<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.280> ninth<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.790> guess

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
it being the top of the ninth I guess

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.350 
it being the top of the ninth I guess
the<00:04:54.210> game<00:04:54.390> is<00:04:54.600> tied<00:04:54.960> so<00:04:57.410> maybe<00:04:58.410> we'll<00:04:59.030> see<00:05:00.030> some

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
the game is tied so maybe we'll see some

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.560 
the game is tied so maybe we'll see some
fielding<00:05:01.050> action<00:05:03.980> but<00:05:04.980> I<00:05:05.250> don't<00:05:06.240> know<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.330> got<00:05:06.540> a

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
fielding action but I don't know I got a

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.030 
fielding action but I don't know I got a
chance<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.140> be<00:05:08.480> the<00:05:09.480> run<00:05:09.720> that<00:05:09.990> gets<00:05:10.230> us<00:05:10.440> the

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
chance to be the run that gets us the

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.570 
chance to be the run that gets us the
win<00:05:11.280> but<00:05:11.670> nope<00:05:12.950> right<00:05:13.950> there<00:05:14.190> I<00:05:14.220> would<00:05:14.370> have
