00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
a whole solo I think about it all the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.169 
a whole solo I think about it all the
time<00:00:27.840> because<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:29.010> determining<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
time because it's really determining I

when<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.200> working<00:00:40.200> through<00:00:40.440> something<00:00:40.890> like

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
when I'm working through something like

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.470 
when I'm working through something like
a<00:00:41.070> new<00:00:41.309> melody<00:00:41.750> that's<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.840> great<00:00:43.050> example<00:00:43.200> um

a new melody that's a great example um
I've<00:00:45.480> been<00:00:45.539> trying<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> learn<00:00:46.020> some<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:46.800> jazz

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
I've been trying to learn some some jazz

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.060 
I've been trying to learn some some jazz
standards<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.320> it's<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.590> cool<00:00:49.890> because

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
standards and it's really cool because

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.670 
standards and it's really cool because
some<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> them<00:00:50.610> lay<00:00:50.760> out<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.500> third<00:00:52.500> position

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
some of them lay out in third position

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.100 
some of them lay out in third position
or<00:00:53.340> fourth<00:00:53.670> position<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:54.899> finding

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
or fourth position but what I'm finding

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.069 
or fourth position but what I'm finding
is<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.789> it's<00:00:56.789> no<00:00:57.059> different<00:00:57.600> than<00:00:57.660> ear

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
is that it's no different than ear

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.689 
is that it's no different than ear
training<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.770> understanding<00:00:59.129> note

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
training and understanding note

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
relationships when I was just working on

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.889

this once before on YouTube but it's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.230 
this once before on YouTube but it's
worth<00:01:09.720> saying<00:01:09.750> again<00:01:10.700> taking<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.790> song<00:01:12.000> like

straight harp starting on the four blow

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.340 
straight harp starting on the four blow
so<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.850> learn<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> little<00:01:27.750> bit<00:01:27.840> about<00:01:28.080> where

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so you learn a little bit about where

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.800 
so you learn a little bit about where
those<00:01:28.530> notes<00:01:28.829> lay<00:01:29.100> out<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.600> straight

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
those notes lay out and your straight

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.450 
those notes lay out and your straight
heart<00:01:31.020> position<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.710> blowing<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.189> drawing

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
heart position just blowing and drawing

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.179 
heart position just blowing and drawing
primarily<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.810> could<00:01:34.560> learn<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
primarily and then you could learn the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.120 
primarily and then you could learn the
bottom<00:01:35.610> end<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:37.680> melody<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
bottom end of that the melody on the

bottom end of that the melody on the
bottom<00:01:38.520> end<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.329> scale<00:01:39.659> where<00:01:39.990> does

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
bottom end of the scale where does

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.289 
bottom end of the scale where does
require<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.829> play<00:01:41.070> bends<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.000> don't

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
require you to play bends so I don't

00:01:42.299 --> 00:02:02.590 
require you to play bends so I don't
really<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:42.990> self<00:01:43.560> discovering<00:01:44.100> it

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.569 

really<00:02:03.600> focus<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.229> that's<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.560> point<00:02:04.740> you

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
really focus but that's the point you

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.639 
really focus but that's the point you
want<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:05.850> make<00:02:05.970> sure<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.210> really<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.619> I

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
want to make sure you really know so I

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.259 
want to make sure you really know so I
can<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.190> by<00:02:08.369> ear<00:02:08.610> not<00:02:08.819> because<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.119> can

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
can do that by ear not because I can

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.050 
can do that by ear not because I can
hear<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.840> note<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.080> want<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.790> visualize<00:02:11.790> the

bend right I know I have an association
for<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:14.459> then<00:02:14.700> there<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.690> note<00:02:15.900> I

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
for what then there is to that note I

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.050 
for what then there is to that note I
want<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:17.069> that's<00:02:17.280> another<00:02:17.550> good<00:02:17.790> thing<00:02:17.819> and

want so that's another good thing and
you<00:02:18.120> could<00:02:18.269> do<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.480> all<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.720> way<00:02:18.840> across<00:02:18.989> and

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
you could do this all the way across and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.570 
you could do this all the way across and
do<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.980> high<00:02:20.190> end

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
do this on the high end

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.330 
do this on the high end
finding<00:02:21.569> Saints<00:02:22.380> Go<00:02:22.769> marchin<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:23.220> that's

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
finding Saints Go marchin and that's

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.250 
finding Saints Go marchin and that's
just<00:02:23.489> one<00:02:23.640> example<00:02:23.940> then<00:02:24.209> learning<00:02:24.390> different

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
just one example then learning different

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.080 
just one example then learning different
positions<00:02:25.709> same<00:02:26.010> key<00:02:26.370> harp<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.910> you're

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
positions same key harp that you're

playing<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.420> different<00:02:27.540> keys<00:02:27.900> now<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.260> could

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
playing in different keys now you could

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:39.170 
playing in different keys now you could
go<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.860> cross<00:02:29.160> our<00:02:29.400> play<00:02:30.209> an<00:02:30.450> E<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:39.000> also

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
go and cross our play an E so it's also

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.300

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
thinking about when it comes to just

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.789 
thinking about when it comes to just
improvising<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:15.900> understanding<00:03:16.440> what<00:03:16.620> those

improvising and understanding what those

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.550

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
said take a series of notes I've

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.849 
said take a series of notes I've
mentioned<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.019> in<00:03:22.079> other<00:03:22.260> videos<00:03:22.620> where<00:03:22.829> you

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
mentioned this in other videos where you

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.030 
mentioned this in other videos where you
you're<00:03:23.609> playing<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.060> couple<00:03:24.239> notes<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:25.040> you're

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
you're playing a couple notes and you're

following<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.730> changing<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.780> final<00:03:28.200> note

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
following it changing up the final note

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.129

every<00:03:28.590> time<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.209> have<00:03:33.329> another<00:03:33.569> four<00:03:33.870> blow

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
every time so I have another four blow

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.229 
every time so I have another four blow
it's<00:03:34.859> not<00:03:35.040> important<00:03:35.459> what<00:03:35.579> I'm<00:03:35.700> playing<00:03:35.910> yet

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239

it's not important what I'm playing yet
I'll<00:03:36.660> give<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:37.319> but<00:03:37.470> just<00:03:37.620> check

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.240 

that's<00:03:41.970> already

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
that's already

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.369 
that's already
and<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.610> ends<00:03:44.909> on<00:03:44.970> four<00:03:45.209> blow<00:03:45.420> so<00:03:46.050> I'm<00:03:46.230> just

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
and it ends on four blow so I'm just

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.780

gonna<00:03:46.470> play<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.890> same<00:03:47.069> riff<00:03:47.400> but<00:03:47.549> I'm<00:03:47.670> just

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
gonna play the same riff but I'm just

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.970 
gonna play the same riff but I'm just
gonna<00:03:47.940> change<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.540> last<00:03:48.750> note<00:03:49.049> each<00:03:49.620> time

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
gonna change the last note each time

00:03:49.980 --> 00:04:07.850 
gonna change the last note each time
moving<00:03:50.970> up<00:04:06.440> actually<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.560> should<00:04:07.680> have<00:04:07.799> been

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
moving up actually that should have been

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.640 
moving up actually that should have been
a<00:04:07.920> draw<00:04:08.099> so<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.730> remember<00:04:09.390> it<00:04:09.510> flips<00:04:09.959> seven

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
a draw so and remember it flips seven

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.309 
a draw so and remember it flips seven
through<00:04:10.799> ten<00:04:11.010> everything<00:04:11.400> flips<00:04:11.959> so<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:12.989> want

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
through ten everything flips so I want

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.909 
through ten everything flips so I want
to<00:04:13.409> start<00:04:13.680> out<00:04:13.860> I<00:04:15.289> want<00:04:16.289> to<00:04:16.350> go<00:04:16.440> from<00:04:16.620> low<00:04:16.859> to

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
to start out I want to go from low to

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:25.040 
to start out I want to go from low to
high<00:04:17.039> got<00:04:17.519> a<00:04:17.549> go<00:04:17.729> draw<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.000> blow<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:24.750> hear<00:04:24.930> it

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
high got a go draw to blow you hear it

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.990 
high got a go draw to blow you hear it
so<00:04:25.320> when<00:04:25.919> you<00:04:26.010> get<00:04:26.130> up<00:04:26.250> there<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.490> keep<00:04:26.639> going

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
so when you get up there you keep going

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.760
