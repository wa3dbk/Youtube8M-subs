in<00:00:06.210> banggood<00:00:06.660> well<00:00:07.200> install<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.919> on<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.189> fries

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
in banggood well install it on the fries

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.799 
in banggood well install it on the fries
radhika<00:00:09.170> quadcopter<00:00:10.219> well<00:00:11.420> the<00:00:12.420> problem<00:00:12.750> is

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
radhika quadcopter well the problem is

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.430 
radhika quadcopter well the problem is
that<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.889> gaming<00:00:14.309> require<00:00:14.969> close<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.630> 15

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
that the the gaming require close to 15

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.390 
that the the gaming require close to 15
centimeters<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:18.210> ground<00:00:18.720> clearance<00:00:18.900> and

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
centimeters to of ground clearance and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.210 
centimeters to of ground clearance and
unfortunately<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.850> only<00:00:21.029> 13<00:00:21.720> 14<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
unfortunately you have only 13 14 in the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.310 
unfortunately you have only 13 14 in the
fine<00:00:23.460> 3d<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.240> mean<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:27.320> last

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
fine 3d so it mean that you the the last

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.790 
fine 3d so it mean that you the the last
part<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.980> touching<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.300> ground<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.590> need

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
part is touching the ground so you need

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.110 
part is touching the ground so you need
maybe<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.540> to<00:00:33.540> elevate<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.770> feet<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.430> install

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
maybe to to elevate the feet to install

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.369 
maybe to to elevate the feet to install
this<00:00:36.559> gimmick<00:00:37.559> whatever<00:00:38.600> well<00:00:39.600> install<00:00:40.200> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
this gimmick whatever well install a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.940 
this gimmick whatever well install a
mobius<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.640> gopro<00:00:42.090> for<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.719> mean<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
mobius is not the gopro for I mean that

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.729 
mobius is not the gopro for I mean that
is<00:00:44.129> acting<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> perfect<00:00:45.420> results<00:00:46.350> of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
is acting to have a perfect results of

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.979 
is acting to have a perfect results of
civilizations<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.539> not<00:00:48.690> bad<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:48.960> all

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
civilizations but it's not bad at all

00:00:48.989 --> 00:01:02.000 
civilizations but it's not bad at all
how<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.410> make<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> small<00:00:49.890> demo<00:00:50.309> so<00:01:00.680> as<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.859> can

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
how we make a small demo so as you can

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.480 
how we make a small demo so as you can
see<00:01:03.830> he's<00:01:04.830> working<00:01:05.339> not<00:01:05.489> bad<00:01:07.130> there<00:01:08.130> are<00:01:08.250> some

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
see he's working not bad there are some

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.310 
see he's working not bad there are some
vibration<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> system<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> not

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
vibration because the system is not

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.000 
vibration because the system is not
perfect<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.330> feel<00:01:12.600> some<00:01:12.930> vibration<00:01:13.010> so

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
perfect you can feel some vibration so

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.660 
perfect you can feel some vibration so
the<00:01:14.220> PID<00:01:14.540> baby<00:01:15.740> he's<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.770> perfect<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.460> is

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the PID baby he's not perfect that is

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.170 
the PID baby he's not perfect that is
not<00:01:17.880> bad<00:01:18.030> at<00:01:18.210> all

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.500 

so<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.470> solve<00:01:25.830> how<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.760> limit<00:01:27.360> this

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
so I have to solve how to limit this

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.900 
so I have to solve how to limit this
vibration<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.620> it's<00:01:29.250> not<00:01:29.370> a<00:01:29.400> GoPro<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
vibration because it's not a GoPro I

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.750 
vibration because it's not a GoPro I
guess<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.080> not<00:01:31.230> bad<00:01:31.380> an<00:01:31.620> but<00:01:32.460> at

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
guess and that is not bad an but at

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:43.720 
guess and that is not bad an but at
least<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.840> there<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.440> forgot<00:01:34.620> to<00:01:34.920> mention<00:01:35.040> that

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.770 

you<00:01:44.730> need<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:45.120> plug<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.950> your<00:01:47.420> those<00:01:48.420> who<00:01:48.630> dig

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you need to plug your your those who dig

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.520 
you need to plug your your those who dig
in<00:01:48.930> based<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:50.480> this<00:01:51.480> select<00:01:51.960> part<00:01:52.260> of<00:01:52.440> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
in based on the this select part of the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.040 
in based on the this select part of the
connector<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.370> be<00:01:53.700> aware<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:53.940> the<00:01:54.270> plus<00:01:54.540> in

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
connector and be aware that the plus in

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.469 
connector and be aware that the plus in
on<00:01:55.230> the<00:01:55.320> bottom<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.930> minus<00:01:58.070> is<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> top<00:01:59.910> so

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
on the bottom and minus is on the top so

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.930 
on the bottom and minus is on the top so
top<00:02:01.010> left<00:02:02.010> is<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.400> ground<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:04.369> bottom<00:02:05.369> left

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
top left is the ground and bottom left

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.730 
top left is the ground and bottom left
is<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.540> plus<00:02:06.930> 12<00:02:07.380> volts<00:02:08.100> okay<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:09.500> thank<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.619> for
