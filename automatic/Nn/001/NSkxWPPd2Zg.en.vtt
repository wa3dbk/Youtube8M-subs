00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.270
 this new microsoft inside air video 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.250
 and this time we're going to try the ran 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.200
 taste hector beat a bracelet 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.420
 quantifier of the people of run taste 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.210
 and that if you do not know them, they are 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.789
 specialists in the whole field subject of 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.529
 fitness and the truth is that in addition 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.779
 they behave very well with windows home because 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.490
 have many of their applications and or 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.490
 I have installed is not that I use them much 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.550
 but installed are this that you download 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.230
 the application with the faith that you're going to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.020
 exercise but then you do not 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.790
 anyway, the truth is that the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.829
 application that also took 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.020
 start from me to connect with the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.000
 quantifying bracelet goes very well as 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.950
 now we will see and the bracelet has left me 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.450
 very good sensations the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.090
 true to begin with has a design 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.030
 different 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.800
 does not reach the terms of any of 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.140
 the other bracelets that we have already seen and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.460
 keeps with them certain characteristics 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.460
 that are appreciated 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.610
 the boot button east and corbin us 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.560
 will allow access to the now basic to what 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.630
 which are the steps you have walked the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.909
 calories that we have consumed and time 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.470
 of activity that we have had 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.170
 although the operation is very good 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.759
 yes that could be considered for a 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.710
 future and I hope you consider it the 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.900
 option on the one hand to be able to time 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.300
 the exercise that we do just in case 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.420
 we feel like that option never comes 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.280
 besides and on the other hand the power to see the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.170
 alarms because if this device to 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.570
 through the run days tic me application 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.940
 you can set us the alarms of 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.190
 way that the bracelet vibrates and we 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.509
 indicate the time at which we have to 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.280
 wake up also works very well 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.830
 because with a touch it deactivates it is 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.630
 way you do not go crazy having 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.090
 to do cabals to stop 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.100
 vibrate that can be very annoying believe me 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.720
 one of the things that has also 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.520
 surprised and for good of the start 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.500
 stick nick is that on the top 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.050
 of the screen that you will be seeing now 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.149
 has a little dot and that dot is a 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.649
 lighting sensor so that in 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.509
 function of what situation we 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.420
 let's find it will light up more or less the 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.459
 screen to not be very annoying 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.930
 is that the screen is very small 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.090
 I have not had any problems at the time 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.739
 to see it with direct sunlight what 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.209
 which is very much appreciated because it is 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.220
 true that in other devices that 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.810
 could prove when you're under the light 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.940
 direct to the sun you do not get to see anything and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.040
 so if you go running for example and 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.020
 You are under the sun, you can not see 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.740
 I do not even say the time 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.840
 I have made 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.670
 then the work he has done 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.620
 fantastic on the screen the truth that 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.510
 It is very good and much appreciated 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.340
 even if it's a basic screen that 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.290
 It's what we need , after all 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.730
 sees perfectly and gives us a 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.430
 very good autonomy so that being 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.010
 little one is not going to consume us much 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.530
 for me the main advantage of run 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.840
 taste and c is on the one hand the pack with the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.049
 that comes that includes this bracelet 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.849
 in blue one in black and a clip for 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.010
 clip to place it on the pants 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.750
 in the belt or where we want if not 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.819
 we want to always be with the bracelet in 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.129
 the arm which is very much appreciated and 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.049
 apart through the store we have the 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.840
 option to buy different colors of 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.209
 bracelet so that it does not turn out 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.099
 monotonous and we can change it or else that 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.409
 If the bracelet is damaged by the use 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.359
 we can change without problem because what 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.819
 what we can do is directly take 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.290
 the device like I'm going to do now 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.629
 that does not cost much 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.430
 and changing the a new bracelet 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.379
 we practically released a 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.780
 quantifier as you see is a 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.670
 very small device apart has the 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.230
 advantage that it can get wet and there's no 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.120
 any kind of problem is to say is 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.189
 submersible I think up to 30 or 100 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.260
 meters and we will not have any kind of 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.480
 problem to be able to submerge or 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.430
 wash hands with him so that 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.680
 if we exercise and we are people 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.739
 we go up a lot no problem is 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.659
 say the bracelet will not reach 30 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.930
 days of use with it and it's going to fall 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.819
 of the arm you can not wash with it 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.189
 I do not say put the washing machine because I do not 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.169
 I know but I think that up to that point 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.790
 we could arrive in a way that we 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.889
 we have to worry at all about the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.810
 big stigma anyway anyway yes 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.970
 you can not take out the receiver and put the 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.919
 bracelet in the washing machine I do not know again 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.750
 how will it work 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:17.289
 It is your responsibility if you want it 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.759
 do but the option is there for the 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.560
 daily use the truth is that the rand 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.000
 nor does it work very well 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.950
 in fact the configuration was 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.230
 just put my 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.390
 email and my password and directly 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.280
 had all the access to my information from 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.440
 my errant account eastick already in my 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.120
 mobile phone which is very comfortable 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.250
 because already the bracelet is directly 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.620
 configured according to the parameter of 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.000
 my height and my weight which is ideal 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.380
 because in other bracelets yes that is 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.660
 true that we have the problem that 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.430
 we have to be registering or 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.500
 choosing between a range of three 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.230
 variables if you do little exercise a lot 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.100
 or are you a normal person then 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:57.100
 you have to pigeonhole you say in 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.960
 one of the three sectors because if not the 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.180
 bracelet will not do it this way 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.240
 Well, at least let's say they think what 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.170
 it is more optimal for you if you are very 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.390
 valderas because they will put more 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.220
 limited and if not then less 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.230
 this device we have been doing 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.450
 tests as you know and the truth is 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.460
 that perfectly counts the steps the 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.930
 difference becomes 1% 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.060
 compared to the polar look that already 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.710
 you know what I have and with the core sensor 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.090
 of the mobile phone there is hardly 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.160
 difference and the truth is that it 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.390
 thank you very much yes it is true that a 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.390
 of the things that I also liked 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.009
 much is that if we are walking and we give 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.409
 to the button to see the steps 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.599
 is going to show us the steps how it's going 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.129
 increasing in real time which is 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.529
 thanks because it's a way to 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.180
 check that if it's working and what 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.099
 does relatively well at best there are 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.319
 moments when you get stuck moving 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.479
 the steps but in general terms what 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.889
 they do very very well 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.779
 using the run this time application and 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.219
 we will be able to monitor everything 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:53.409
 moment what we are doing with the 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.689
 bracelet and see our history both of 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.819
 I dream of other activities one 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.499
 advantage of this bracelet is that by 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:01.569
 the application we can manage the 

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:04.089
 alarms that will wake us up by vibration 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.699
 as I already told you and we can also 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:09.159
 one side make the inactivity alert 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.930
 activate the inactivity alert that in 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.999
 vibrate to the device when we are 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.649
 long time still I have it 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:16.330
 deactivated because if I would not go back 

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:18.159
 crazy because if you're working you're 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.339
 sitting and this is going to be vibrating every 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:23.080
 X time and it is not the most pleasant and 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.939
 on the other hand another thing that allows us 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.979
 do is modify at all times both 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:28.569
 our weight as our stature for 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:30.819
 update it according to how 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.649
 the days go by evidently the 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.509
 height we're not going to change much at 

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:36.580
 better some woman takes heels then 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:38.379
 you can put that measures more but for 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.659
 everything else in the background is not so 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:42.159
 necessary but I do find it interesting 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.590
 the detail of the weight to be able to go 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.330
 updating it we can also do 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.310
 as I said sleep measurement 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.319
 this is one of the drawbacks that 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.990
 go to the start tic I tear off 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:55.020
 orbit because to quantify the dream 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.340
 we have to press the button 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.430
 then it exerts a vibration as we go 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.230
 Let's see 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.480
 and is already measuring the dream actually 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.700
 has an active timer and right now 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.230
 indicates that I've been asleep for five seconds 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.910
 this is a disadvantage a small 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.340
 inconvenient because the truth I hope 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.350
 that in the future they can fix it and the 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.470
 identification of the dream be in passive 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.660
 although it is not so exact so we 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.850
 allow to be able to quantify it without 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.170
 any kind of problem without having it 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.810
 do because we do not always go to 

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.640
 agree that is the biggest problem as I 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.830
 I am a person not excessively 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.930
 sportsman although I do sports all 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.820
 weeks right now it's the witness's 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.920

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.590
 analysis of the stick me boot more 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.390
 focused on the sport I leave here the 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.890
 result of the most that I have come to 

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:44.070
 do steps with the ran taste and 

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:47.000
 corbitt and see if it is able to overcome 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.000
