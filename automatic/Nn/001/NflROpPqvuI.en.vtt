00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.709
 a decade ago for canarias fernando martín who tomorrow a course here in 

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:06.130
 monterrey 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.749
 great an awareness is announced 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:12.919
 We are talking about the ex-lover of telephones. 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.029
 our job to leave suffering to that is what we should do 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.189
 aware that no suffering councilor is that 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.579
 the entire universe is based on a very clear premise 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.460
 everything that is false produces suffering 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.970
 So, yes, you are suffering because you have 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.479
 a false belief install take 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.670
 everything that the true can only produce almunia 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.520
 or if not everything would be that they have returned 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.830
 If not 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.859
 this suffering that we 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.690
 show to us 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.400
 which is what we have to correct in our days 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.100
 that what we do not accept is what you have and what you want will change the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.600
 bad in our life 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.070
 or that the block 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.200
 the wrong behaviors that we have as curious 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.200
 inflexible arrogant intolerant 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.980
 those behaviors cause suffering 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.780
 I want to tell you the suffering of the plan way the little bombs stolen that 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.880
 undertake the board of conscience 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.390
 so that you are realizing 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.830
 you have a fascist belief that is causing you wrong behaviors 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.369
 is generating conflict 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.299
 and conflict makes people lose creativity from conflict 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:20.600
 your life energy 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.270
 and the passes enter both in prison and the marin depression that this disease 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.320
 that is, there is a very clear chain 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.870
 I want to say that suffering is 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.610
 the basis of the evolution of consciousness at a low level of consensus 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.620
 we find a very low level in functions the planet earth 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.290
 predominantly tempt the level of consciousness in a universe and 7 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.220
 so here children basically learn to take control of our 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.160
 emotions 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.790
 there alcalá 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.440
 to experience in life because it is through experience that we 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.320
 we understand 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.550
 you knowledge allows us to understand 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.100
 it's the experience 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.270
 in the rock that comes from the interior dt says I just realized this 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.040
 because it came from adén 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.880
 the truths do not count on truths edil has been experiencing 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.690
 and for those that pronounce 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.209
 the officers on the coasts the experience 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.109
 i 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.539
 suffering also helps us learn many things to get ahead 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:25.759
 aa to get a family in the face of the bull by the horns 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:30.049
 that is to say the one that the suffering has a consent the sense of 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.009
 suffering is 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.189
 unfortunately, we 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.309
 we have a team 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.629
 the ego is what is called the installed belief system that has a 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:38.499
 person 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:42.959
 that belief system and it's ice cream or ego 3 false beliefs basically 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:43.960
 limitations 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.900
 another one historical criteria of our mind the crises the vices that 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.819
 us 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.989
 so wrong now 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.989
 and now we know how to act in an equivocal way 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.529
 they make conflict with others 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:00.739
 the conflict and all this kind of thing 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.480
 p 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.379
 is what we have to get out of our life because what we 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.379
 we want to be happy 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.299
 when expertise can not be had when you have a quantity prince suazo 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.719
 is the matter mind 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.719
 from the universe it determines that you have to get rid of it 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.370
 for that they install them moment of birth for the moment in your childhood 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.020
 the moment that your ego is brewing the culture your parents of the school the 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.930
 area affiliation of and accurate 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.509
 the fars press agency was installed 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.329
 with them gómez act 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.979
 and you are wrong 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.959
 because they are false 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.419
 when you make mistakes, you suffer 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.049
 Wanting to find happiness examines the causes 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.209
 that they produced it 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.079
 and find the truth 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.039
 all truth is hidden by a false belief 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.660
 and emerged inside 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.989
 the moment you eliminate three clubs 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.309
 for the truth then what makes us feel good in arrears harmony the 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.569
 forgiveness love compassion and understanding everything is exactly 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.279
 essentially stable love 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.359
 love the essential characteristic of love delivers 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:07.639
 because neutrality 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.109
 because neutrality the basis of respect contrary to the basis of tolerance 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.669
 neutrality is what allows the universe to exist diversity 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.279
 if I was not not entered 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.970
 we would have to live what we wanted that we lived 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.970
 then we would not have any responsibility over our life 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:28.559
 we kept puppets living a 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:31.860
 a script that he would have designed for us 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.320
 but on the other hand mind is not like this reality is based on the free 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.599
 freedom is the students tecos freedom shakhtar 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.900
 but that freedom implies that you have --results 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.090
 the time to make decisions and actions 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.330
 in your life and in life, your loved ones 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.809
 those results are the ones that lets you know 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:53.499
 they are advanced last tax rate 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:55.240
 the results 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.020
 Of course, no matter how much your friend, I am Juan, I can see the results in your 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.020
 are the ones that the filmmaker does not really take away are not 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.650
 where is where the United States and in that act 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.439
