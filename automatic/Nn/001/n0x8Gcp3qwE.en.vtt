the same chord pattern the verse and the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.910 
the same chord pattern the verse and the
chorus<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.900> only<00:02:35.050> two<00:02:35.350> parts<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.740> we

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
chorus of the only two parts that we

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:48.059 
chorus of the only two parts that we
have<00:02:36.130> let's<00:02:36.760> check<00:02:37.090> out<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.450> verse

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.300 

so<00:02:48.670> we're<00:02:49.329> gonna<00:02:49.450> play<00:02:49.959> E<00:02:50.200> minor<00:02:50.849> twice<00:02:53.310> just

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
so we're gonna play E minor twice just

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.830 
so we're gonna play E minor twice just
with<00:02:54.489> two<00:02:54.670> down<00:02:54.939> strums<00:02:55.390> one<00:02:56.159> two

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
with two down strums one two

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.520 
with two down strums one two
we're<00:02:58.840> gonna<00:02:58.959> switch<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.409> D

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.340 

we're<00:03:02.890> gonna<00:03:03.010> do<00:03:03.250> down<00:03:03.640> up-up<00:03:04.170> that's<00:03:05.170> going

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
we're gonna do down up-up that's going

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.870 
we're gonna do down up-up that's going
to<00:03:05.410> be

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.760 

so<00:03:13.240> those<00:03:13.420> two<00:03:13.660> chords<00:03:13.990> are<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.470> same

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
so those two chords are in the same

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.710 
so those two chords are in the same
measure<00:03:15.420> then<00:03:16.420> we're<00:03:16.540> gonna<00:03:16.630> go<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.870> B<00:03:17.230> minor
