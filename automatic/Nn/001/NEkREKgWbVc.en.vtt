00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:17.130

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.189

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.500

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.680

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.170
 sections of clean-up at home then in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.090

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.530
 always something to do there is always time 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.530

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:13.740
 box for you my box will be mine 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.680
 bag is not very serious just like 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.470
 I told you we need big 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.330
 spaces allow things to not have 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.390
 need to take away so many things 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.659
 however, if there were need we are 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.759
 always open to send to the station 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.680
 virtual of this outgoing box 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.680
 better valentine one thing 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.820

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.190
 in the mother I take the first year that 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.020
 we came to stay here there are a lot 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.530
 tied up because maybe my mom galatina 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.930
 I am very fond of it then 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.130
 remember the first year but they did me 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.080
 one end the poor estrogen jar they have 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.900
 done under their own time 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.220
 as you see this month we will try to 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.740
 give us gifts for this new job 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.910
 what we are doing at home and will be 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.190
 precisely the new fresh flowers 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.090
 we archive that the old ones that now do not 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.290
 no more meaning 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.120
 we consider here and weekend when 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.840
 it will be time to free the box 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.220
 I will consider whether to keep them later I have to do 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.690
 the case, however, I keep it apart 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.900
 elective and parliamentary box inside 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.000
 the closet and let me know what he did 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.860
 that how he would eliminate them as they are 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.860
