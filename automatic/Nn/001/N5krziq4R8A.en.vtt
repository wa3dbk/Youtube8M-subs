phones<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.830> tattoo<00:01:05.159> let's<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.060> little<00:01:06.240> bit

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
phones a tattoo let's go to a little bit

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
phones a tattoo let's go to a little bit
more<00:01:06.479> complicated<00:01:06.780> future<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:08.040> would

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
more complicated future and that would

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.210 
more complicated future and that would
be<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> script<00:01:09.390> scribe<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.409> lead<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
be the script scribe for a lead so you

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.190 
be the script scribe for a lead so you
can<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.400> put<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:12.060> also<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:12.780> let's

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
can just put this on also on here let's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.080 
can just put this on also on here let's
unlock<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
unlock it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090 
unlock it
and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.929> when<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> put<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.859> this<00:01:17.009> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and then when you put it on here this is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.429 
and then when you put it on here this is
a<00:01:17.219> reproduction<00:01:17.850> future<00:01:18.359> it<00:01:18.420> will<00:01:18.600> ask<00:01:18.990> us<00:01:19.259> if

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
a reproduction future it will ask us if

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.480 
a reproduction future it will ask us if
we<00:01:19.560> want<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.280> use<00:01:20.399> LEDs<00:01:22.009> like<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.219> so<00:01:23.460> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
we want to use LEDs like this so it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.639 
we want to use LEDs like this so it
tells<00:01:23.759> us<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.270> cover<00:01:24.539> is<00:01:24.689> connected<00:01:25.140> just

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
tells us that cover is connected just

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.499 
tells us that cover is connected just
have<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.039> okay<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.149> close

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
have to it okay and then when you close

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.319 
have to it okay and then when you close
it<00:01:27.539> up<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.130> will<00:01:29.280> hit<00:01:29.609> the<00:01:29.819> power<00:01:30.210> button
