00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.690 
able to be played against people on the
xbox<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.040> gigantic<00:02:05.399> too

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
xbox one and this is gigantic too

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.069 
xbox one and this is gigantic too
because<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.119> technologies<00:02:06.570> out<00:02:06.659> there<00:02:06.719> I

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
because the technologies out there I

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.529 
because the technologies out there I
mean<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.799> probably<00:02:08.039> very<00:02:08.250> similar<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.789> how

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
mean it's probably very similar to how

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.340 
mean it's probably very similar to how
the<00:02:09.869> ps3<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.560> ps4<00:02:10.800> would

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
the ps3 and ps4 would

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.380 
the ps3 and ps4 would
especially<00:02:12.190> because<00:02:12.490> they<00:02:12.640> only<00:02:12.820> have<00:02:13.060> the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
especially because they only have the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.620 
especially because they only have the
system<00:02:13.990> how<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.160> PS<00:02:15.400> Vita<00:02:15.790> works<00:02:16.090> with<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
system how the PS Vita works with the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.690 
system how the PS Vita works with the
other<00:02:16.780> councils<00:02:17.260> too<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:17.740> that's<00:02:18.340> also<00:02:18.490> very

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
other councils too so that's also very

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.600 
other councils too so that's also very
very<00:02:19.270> very<00:02:19.480> awesome<00:02:20.020> plus<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.650> positive<00:02:21.430> to

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
very very awesome plus and positive to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.020 
very very awesome plus and positive to
that<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.720> anyways<00:02:23.680> it's<00:02:24.100> very<00:02:24.400> exciting<00:02:25.000> to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
that so anyways it's very exciting to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.380 
that so anyways it's very exciting to
get<00:02:25.420> this<00:02:25.630> information<00:02:25.870> from<00:02:26.380> World<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.100> Tanks

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
get this information from World of Tanks

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.940 
get this information from World of Tanks
obviously<00:02:28.390> they<00:02:28.780> said<00:02:29.080> they<00:02:29.230> are<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.560> first

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
obviously they said they are the first

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.470 
obviously they said they are the first
game<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.670> actually<00:02:31.660> use<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.440> technology<00:02:32.860> and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
game to actually use this technology and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.430 
game to actually use this technology and
they're<00:02:34.480> not<00:02:34.630> going<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.810> be<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.020> last<00:02:35.230> game

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440
