 Well, it's very viable 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.100
 for esther 2 idea of being two liquids 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:12.810

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.690
 a version then 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.739
 brings those main things because almost 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.700
 main and good what else is 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.000
 new brings the chat to talk while 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.840
 with your friends in the premises they will talk 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.840
 now 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.659
 talk with good 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.950
 also removed the display man up not 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:47.709
 I know why it's called real does not have the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.620
 concept in English but this is 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.730
 to play 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.730
 online and then say welcome to the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.819
 to minecraft rounds 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.349
 it's a beta version we still follow 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:08.250
 testing the new updates but 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.250
 eventually we have 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.780
 willett at your time that division ishares 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.530
 reading that will leave us to ten 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.010
 players play online drained and free 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:26.180
 this is free but while because the 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.180
 limit to send 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.520
 madoff servile and neither can you 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:37.330
 create many service and this will be 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.629
 optional but it's going to be a pay service 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.310
 and you'll have to go be the one paid and this does not 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.310
 I'm liking it for nothing because 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:57.880
 pay no no no we do not talk so we leave 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.500
 your recipe that we no longer want the no 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.249
 we want them to charge for playing online 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.239
 because I would not give anything 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:09.239
 and well this I believe that it was put then 

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:11.270
 they changed the screen inside also 

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:14.380
 change 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:20.920
 because the graphics changed too much 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.920
 now we will have the try to look 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.720
 look at me 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.080
 these are the normal graphs if a 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.650
 bring fire also bring game is a 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.650
 new thing 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:42.190
 well, these are the normal graphs 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:45.400
 if you see the shadows and that but I for 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.250
 to be able to record the 10 tracks and let's say 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:55.360
 I have to give the render views of the 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:58.419
 half does not leave me good but the same and so 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.360
 and thus be able to play well or good more or 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.229
 less well 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.229
 it's the same 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:13.819
 I'm lying I'm lying to you 

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:13.819
 and here that there is nothing here 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:23.599
