land snail was not actually my last one

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.470 
land snail was not actually my last one
but<00:00:19.500> I've<00:00:19.619> decided<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.850> introductory

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
but I've decided with the introductory

but I've decided with the introductory
pet<00:00:21.720> videos<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.199> just<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.769> show<00:00:23.010> you

pet videos I'm just going to show you
the<00:00:23.340> ones<00:00:23.550> I'm<00:00:23.850> almost<00:00:24.240> definitely<00:00:24.869> going<00:00:24.990> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the ones I'm almost definitely going to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.650 
the ones I'm almost definitely going to
be<00:00:25.560> keeping<00:00:25.980> that's<00:00:26.519> why<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> only<00:00:26.970> shown<00:00:27.300> one

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
be keeping that's why I only shown one

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.250 
be keeping that's why I only shown one
of<00:00:27.810> six<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> baby<00:00:29.039> geckos<00:00:29.640> only<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> 5<00:00:31.050> I

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
of six of the baby geckos only a 5 I

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.930 
of six of the baby geckos only a 5 I
think<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> term<00:00:31.949> 5<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> end<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
think that the term 5 in the end of the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.340 
think that the term 5 in the end of the
back<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> tranches<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> don't<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.110> why<00:00:34.320> I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
back of the tranches I don't know why I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.770 
back of the tranches I don't know why I
shown<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> babies<00:00:35.100> as<00:00:35.219> well<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.180> only

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
shown the babies as well but I'm only

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.209 
shown the babies as well but I'm only
definitely<00:00:37.140> keeping<00:00:37.440> three<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.829> each<00:00:37.920> around

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
definitely keeping three of each around

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.650 
definitely keeping three of each around
as<00:00:38.430> I'm<00:00:38.520> definitely<00:00:38.850> keeping<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> Frog<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
as I'm definitely keeping the Frog the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.630 
as I'm definitely keeping the Frog the
dogs<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.410> kept<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:41.040> parents<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
dogs going to be kept to my parents and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the adult echoes the two females are

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.740 
the adult echoes the two females are
definitely<00:00:44.820> coming<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.210> me<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> may<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.570> to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
definitely coming with me I may have to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.450 
definitely coming with me I may have to
sell<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> two<00:00:46.320> males<00:00:46.590> hence<00:00:47.010> why<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> didn't

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
sell the two males hence why I didn't

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.150 
sell the two males hence why I didn't
show<00:00:47.670> those<00:00:48.000> either<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> different

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
show those either so this is a different

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.910 
show those either so this is a different
vowel<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.879> believe<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> different<00:00:52.559> species

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
vowel I believe is a different species

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.000 
vowel I believe is a different species
to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.969> last<00:00:54.360> giant<00:00:54.840> land<00:00:55.110> snail<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.590> albino

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
to the last giant land snail my albino

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.979 
to the last giant land snail my albino
this<00:00:56.460> one's<00:00:56.610> obviously<00:00:56.940> isn't<00:00:57.149> albino

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
this one's obviously isn't albino

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.840 
this one's obviously isn't albino
although<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.620> got<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.859> lovely<00:00:59.070> very<00:00:59.430> light

although it's got a lovely very light
color<00:01:00.270> I'm<00:01:00.359> hoping<00:01:00.750> he'll<00:01:00.930> eat<00:01:01.170> he's<00:01:01.859> this

one's<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.579> lot<00:01:02.820> less<00:01:03.030> friendly<00:01:03.359> perhaps<00:01:03.690> who's

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
one's a lot less friendly perhaps who's

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.929 
one's a lot less friendly perhaps who's
younger<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.799> there's<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> very<00:01:05.610> strong

younger but is it there's a very strong
suspicion<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.930> actually<00:01:07.350> very<00:01:07.560> sadly<00:01:08.340> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
suspicion this is actually very sadly I

wild caught animal which means of course

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.469 
wild caught animal which means of course
it<00:01:11.159> wasn't<00:01:11.310> bred<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.640> captivity<00:01:11.760> which<00:01:12.270> really

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
it wasn't bred in captivity which really

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.630 
it wasn't bred in captivity which really
does<00:01:12.689> survive<00:01:13.110> I'm<00:01:13.590> never<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.070> fan<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.580> I

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
does survive I'm never a fan of that I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.370 
does survive I'm never a fan of that I
always<00:01:14.970> prefer<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.630> been<00:01:15.810> captive<00:01:16.170> bred

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
always prefer if it's been captive bred

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.660 
always prefer if it's been captive bred
because<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.189> least<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.460> couple<00:01:17.580> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
because then at least a couple of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.820 
because then at least a couple of
generations<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.350> better<00:01:19.650> on

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
generations just because it's better on

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.670 
generations just because it's better on
the<00:01:20.130> world<00:01:20.310> etc<00:01:20.850> etc<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.750> less<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.380> concern

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the world etc etc it's less of a concern

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.740 
the world etc etc it's less of a concern
it<00:01:22.860> comes<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.130> things<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:23.369> snails<00:01:23.820> more<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it comes to things like snails more of a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.630 
it comes to things like snails more of a
concern<00:01:25.049> when<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.259> comes<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.680> more<00:01:25.860> complex

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
concern when it comes to more complex

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.149 
concern when it comes to more complex
animals<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> frogs<00:01:27.720> branches<00:01:28.500> etc<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
animals like the frogs branches etc and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.770 
animals like the frogs branches etc and
then<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.790> personal<00:01:30.150> moral<00:01:30.479> stance

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
then it's just a personal moral stance

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.200 
then it's just a personal moral stance
but<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> reason<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.490> got<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.850> little

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
but the reason is is got this little

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.940 
but the reason is is got this little
crack<00:01:33.630> at<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.900> life<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:34.500> there

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
crack at the life you can see there

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.260 
crack at the life you can see there
there<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:35.939> go

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
there we go

she'll<00:03:12.780> get<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.200> 30<00:03:13.519> centimeters<00:03:14.519> in<00:03:14.640> size

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
she'll get the 30 centimeters in size

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.479 
she'll get the 30 centimeters in size
which<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.470> ridiculous<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.709> then<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.310> actual

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
which is ridiculous and then the actual

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.770 
which is ridiculous and then the actual
body<00:03:17.670> can<00:03:17.879> span<00:03:18.090> even<00:03:18.180> further<00:03:18.419> that's<00:03:18.660> our

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
body can span even further that's our

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.780 
body can span even further that's our
big<00:03:18.930> screen<00:03:19.049> size<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.829> can<00:03:19.950> get<00:03:20.040> too<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:20.489> yeah

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
big screen size it can get too but yeah

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.240 
big screen size it can get too but yeah

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
the tank space for it actually smells

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.780

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
but the there oh you can just about see

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.530 
but the there oh you can just about see
if<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.419> focus<00:03:51.930> very<00:03:52.079> carefully<00:03:53.150> so<00:03:54.150> yeah

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
if you focus very carefully so yeah

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.900 
if you focus very carefully so yeah
that's<00:03:55.019> pretty<00:03:55.200> much<00:03:55.919> it<00:03:56.250> isn't<00:03:56.459> really<00:03:56.760> much

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
that's pretty much it isn't really much

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.270 
that's pretty much it isn't really much
else<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.239> say<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.810> might<00:03:58.290> do<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.440> tank<00:03:58.769> video<00:03:59.129> or

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
else to say I might do a tank video or

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.190 
else to say I might do a tank video or
something<00:03:59.489> but<00:03:59.879> honestly<00:04:00.510> I'll<00:04:00.690> probably<00:04:00.989> be

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
something but honestly I'll probably be

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.990 
something but honestly I'll probably be
doing<00:04:01.379> those<00:04:01.650> once<00:04:01.829> I<00:04:01.950> actually<00:04:02.099> move<00:04:02.459> of

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
doing those once I actually move of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.490 
doing those once I actually move of
course<00:04:03.269> I'll<00:04:03.389> be<00:04:03.419> a<00:04:03.540> few<00:04:03.750> months<00:04:03.930> I'm<00:04:04.260> not<00:04:04.379> sure

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
course I'll be a few months I'm not sure

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.379 
course I'll be a few months I'm not sure
exactly<00:04:04.709> what<00:04:04.980> I'll<00:04:05.069> do<00:04:05.280> with<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.639> I<00:04:05.849> might

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
exactly what I'll do with that I might

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.580 
exactly what I'll do with that I might
do<00:04:06.510> some<00:04:06.690> more<00:04:06.780> feeding<00:04:07.109> videos<00:04:07.410> in<00:04:07.530> the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
do some more feeding videos in the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.409 
do some more feeding videos in the
future<00:04:07.739> perhaps<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> tarantulas<00:04:08.970> or<00:04:09.150> the

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
future perhaps of the tarantulas or the

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.539 
future perhaps of the tarantulas or the
geckos<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.260> mean<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.919> geckos<00:04:11.190> are<00:04:11.280> adorable

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
geckos I mean the geckos are adorable

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:12.680 
geckos I mean the geckos are adorable
when<00:04:11.790> they<00:04:11.970> even<00:04:12.120> actually<00:04:12.359> haven't<00:04:12.510> shown

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
when they even actually haven't shown

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.119 
when they even actually haven't shown
you<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:12.930> set<00:04:13.169> so<00:04:13.260> I'll<00:04:13.410> probably<00:04:13.620> do<00:04:13.889> because

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
you that set so I'll probably do because

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.860 
you that set so I'll probably do because
I'm<00:04:14.400> feeding<00:04:14.699> them<00:04:14.879> they're<00:04:15.090> what<00:04:15.599> they<00:04:15.690> eat

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
I'm feeding them they're what they eat

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.460 
I'm feeding them they're what they eat
is<00:04:16.019> essentially<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.560> powder<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.489> add<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.820> water

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
is essentially a powder you add to water

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.819 
is essentially a powder you add to water
yeah

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
yeah

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.560 
yeah
it<00:04:20.400> also<00:04:20.549> needs<00:04:20.699> do<00:04:20.880> bit<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.150> rant<00:04:21.359> about

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
it also needs do bit of a rant about

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.270 
it also needs do bit of a rant about
like<00:04:21.810> pet<00:04:22.019> chops<00:04:22.320> versus<00:04:22.590> private<00:04:22.950> breeders

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
like pet chops versus private breeders

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.370 
like pet chops versus private breeders
at<00:04:23.370> some<00:04:23.550> point<00:04:23.760> just<00:04:23.880> because<00:04:23.969> this<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.380> well

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
at some point just because this is well

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.510 
at some point just because this is well
pets<00:04:25.650> believe<00:04:25.950> or<00:04:26.099> not<00:04:26.190> have<00:04:26.310> always<00:04:26.400> been

pets believe or not have always been

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.770 
pets believe or not have always been
quite<00:04:26.729> a<00:04:26.849> big<00:04:26.880> part<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.390> my<00:04:27.539> life

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
quite a big part of my life

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.110 
quite a big part of my life

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
and since actually sell to pet shops I'd

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.879 
and since actually sell to pet shops I'd
know<00:04:30.510> their<00:04:30.690> practices<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.350> actually<00:04:31.590> have<00:04:31.860> a
