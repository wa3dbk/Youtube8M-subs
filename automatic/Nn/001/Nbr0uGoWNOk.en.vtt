00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
activate is zillions ultimate but out of

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
activate is zillions ultimate but out of
curiosity<00:00:31.800> what<00:00:32.340> goes<00:00:32.790> next<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> vein

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
curiosity what goes next so the vein

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.569 
curiosity what goes next so the vein
continues<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> auto<00:00:34.620> attacking<00:00:34.920> me<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> try

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
continues to auto attacking me to try

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.940 
continues to auto attacking me to try
and<00:00:35.610> kill<00:00:36.090> me<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.270> second<00:00:36.809> time<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.680> time

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and kill me a second time but this time

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.340 
and kill me a second time but this time
it<00:00:38.190> seems<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.670> my<00:00:38.850> item<00:00:39.329> guardian<00:00:39.899> angel

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it seems like my item guardian angel

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.680 
it seems like my item guardian angel
activates<00:00:40.890> second<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.640> aatrox<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.329> obviously

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
activates second so aatrox can obviously

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.020 
activates second so aatrox can obviously
be<00:00:42.860> extremely<00:00:43.860> difficult<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.430> kill<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.850> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
be extremely difficult to kill if you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.910 
be extremely difficult to kill if you
have<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> zillion<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:45.989> team<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.379> guardian

Twitter<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.500> thrush<00:00:56.039> cused<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.550> target<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
Twitter if thrush cused a target and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.060 
Twitter if thrush cused a target and
then<00:00:57.180> uses<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.660> second<00:00:58.230> part<00:00:58.530> where<00:00:58.680> he<00:00:58.800> flies

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
then uses the second part where he flies

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.279 
then uses the second part where he flies
to<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.309> target<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.090> mid-flight<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.780> target

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
to the target but mid-flight that target

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.830 
to the target but mid-flight that target
dies<00:01:01.559> what<00:01:02.160> happens<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> thresh<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
dies what happens to thresh so the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.420 
dies what happens to thresh so the
reason<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.260> one<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.559> somewhat<00:01:04.920> interesting

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
reason this one is somewhat interesting

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.700 
reason this one is somewhat interesting
is<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:05.790> whenever<00:01:06.210> Thresh's<00:01:06.900> Q<00:01:07.170> kills<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
is because whenever Thresh's Q kills a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.010 
is because whenever Thresh's Q kills a
target<00:01:08.189> Thresh<00:01:08.610> does<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.090> gain<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> option

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
target Thresh does not gain the option

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.890 
target Thresh does not gain the option
to<00:01:10.049> fly<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> worse<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.130> targets<00:01:11.610> location<00:01:12.060> so

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
to fly to worse that targets location so

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.510 
to fly to worse that targets location so
with<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.170> being<00:01:13.409> said<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.860> set<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.280> nice

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
with that being said we set up a nice

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.640 
with that being said we set up a nice
little<00:01:14.549> test<00:01:15.150> case<00:01:15.390> scenario<00:01:15.960> mundo<00:01:16.439> has<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.580 
time so to test this one we put each
other<00:01:38.610> quite<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> distance<00:01:39.360> apart<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.320> both

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
other quite a distance apart and we both

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.530 
other quite a distance apart and we both
attack<00:01:41.100> each<00:01:41.280> other<00:01:41.430> with<00:01:41.729> our<00:01:41.759> ultimate<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
attack each other with our ultimate and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.210 
attack each other with our ultimate and
we<00:01:42.810> let<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> Warwick's<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.680> run<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.100> each

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
we let the Warwick's to run up to each

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.800 
we let the Warwick's to run up to each
other<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:45.060> don't<00:01:45.180> determine<00:01:45.600> this

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
other so that we don't determine this

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.660 
other so that we don't determine this
based<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.229> who<00:01:46.409> used<00:01:46.619> their<00:01:46.799> ultimate<00:01:47.189> faster

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
based on who used their ultimate faster

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.340 
based on who used their ultimate faster
and<00:01:47.880> from<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.780> i<00:01:48.930> use<00:01:49.200> my

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
and from this you can see that i use my

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.050 
and from this you can see that i use my
ultimate<00:01:49.799> first<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.579> second<00:01:51.000> my

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
ultimate first and the second my

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.819 
ultimate first and the second my
ultimate<00:01:51.479> finished<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.110> other<00:01:52.320> warwick

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
ultimate finished the other warwick

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.770 
ultimate finished the other warwick
automatically<00:01:53.549> used<00:01:53.790> his<00:01:54.090> because<00:01:54.600> his

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
automatically used his because his

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.870 
automatically used his because his
ultimate<00:01:55.290> was<00:01:55.470> still<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.920> q<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.579> from<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
ultimate was still in q so from the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.280 
ultimate was still in q so from the
first<00:01:56.909> truck<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.479> thought<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> was<00:01:57.930> simply

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
first truck we thought it was simply

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.230 
first truck we thought it was simply
just<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.740> roll<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.280> die<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.909> that<00:01:59.939> either

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
just a roll of the die and that either

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.999 
just a roll of the die and that either
war<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.899> go<00:02:00.990> first<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.890> completely

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
war can go first it's just completely

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.459 
war can go first it's just completely
random<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.149> decided<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.719> do<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> best<00:02:04.320> of

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
random so we decided to do a best of

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.440 
random so we decided to do a best of
three<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.280> current<00:02:05.430> scenario<00:02:05.729> i<00:02:06.149> use

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
three but in the current scenario i use

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.419 
three but in the current scenario i use
my<00:02:06.659> ultimate<00:02:07.049> second<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.860> activated

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
my ultimate second but it activated

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.249 
my ultimate second but it activated
first<00:02:08.729> which<00:02:09.090> made<00:02:09.300> me<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.450> may

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
first which made me think may

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.780 
first which made me think may
the<00:02:10.379> person<00:02:10.769> that<00:02:10.799> uses<00:02:11.129> their<00:02:11.430> ultimate

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the person that uses their ultimate

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.699 
the person that uses their ultimate
second<00:02:12.299> will<00:02:12.420> actually<00:02:12.840> get<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.019> first<00:02:13.409> hit

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
second will actually get the first hit

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.949 
second will actually get the first hit
and<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.189> happens<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.790> true<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.329> seems<00:02:15.629> to

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
and that happens to be true it seems to

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.140 
and that happens to be true it seems to
work<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> stab<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.220> Warwick<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.730> uses

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
work like a stab the Warwick that uses

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.210 
work like a stab the Warwick that uses
the<00:02:18.269> skill<00:02:18.599> itself<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.349> enemy<00:02:19.500> Warwick's

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
the skill itself on the enemy Warwick's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.250 
the skill itself on the enemy Warwick's
second<00:02:20.760> will<00:02:20.970> actually<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.750> activate

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
second will actually have it activate

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.500 
second will actually have it activate
first<00:02:22.680> since<00:02:23.250> he's<00:02:23.430> technically<00:02:23.909> higher<00:02:24.239> on

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
first since he's technically higher on

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.479 
first since he's technically higher on
the<00:02:24.720> cue<00:02:24.989> stack<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.470> then<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.980> Warwick<00:02:26.340> that

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
the cue stack and then the Warwick that

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.160 
the cue stack and then the Warwick that
used<00:02:26.730> his<00:02:26.970> ability<00:02:27.420> first<00:02:27.810> will

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
used his ability first will

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.199 
used his ability first will
automatically<00:02:28.829> use<00:02:28.860> his<00:02:29.340> ultimate<00:02:29.790> after<00:02:30.090> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
automatically use his ultimate after the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.390 
automatically use his ultimate after the
other<00:02:30.390> Warwick's<00:02:30.900> ultimate<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.379> done<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.010> TL

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
other Warwick's ultimate is done so TL

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.460 
other Warwick's ultimate is done so TL
DR<00:02:32.700> using<00:02:33.180> ultimate<00:02:33.569> second<00:02:34.019> is<00:02:34.110> actually

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
DR using ultimate second is actually

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.649 
DR using ultimate second is actually
better<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.430> final<00:02:35.849> myth<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:36.390> episode

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
better in the final myth of this episode

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.619 
better in the final myth of this episode
can<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.470> blitz<00:02:37.829> or<00:02:37.980> thrushes<00:02:38.609> grab<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.150> target

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
can to blitz or thrushes grab a target

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.149 
can to blitz or thrushes grab a target
that<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> other<00:02:40.049> champion<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.799> already

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
that the other champion is already

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.390 
that the other champion is already
grabbing<00:02:41.489> hence<00:02:42.150> interrupting<00:02:42.840> each<00:02:42.930> other

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
grabbing hence interrupting each other

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.220 
grabbing hence interrupting each other
so<00:02:44.400> for<00:02:44.609> this<00:02:44.730> myth<00:02:44.970> there<00:02:45.209> are<00:02:45.450> two<00:02:45.750> test<00:02:45.989> case

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
so for this myth there are two test case

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.199 
so for this myth there are two test case
scenarios<00:02:46.799> in<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.250> first<00:02:47.489> one<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.730> use<00:02:47.879> my<00:02:48.030> hook

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
scenarios in the first one I use my hook

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.819 
scenarios in the first one I use my hook
first<00:02:48.510> landed<00:02:49.109> on<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.290> moon<00:02:49.409> dough<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.769> then

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
first landed on the moon dough and then

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.860 
first landed on the moon dough and then
blitz<00:02:50.220> uses<00:02:50.579> his<00:02:50.790> hook<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:51.389> this<00:02:51.510> one<00:02:51.720> does

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
blitz uses his hook but this one does

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.569 
blitz uses his hook but this one does
not<00:02:52.139> interrupt<00:02:52.500> Thresh's<00:02:53.069> hook<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.430> can

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
not interrupt Thresh's hook and I can

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.699 
not interrupt Thresh's hook and I can
still<00:02:53.879> fly<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.180> my<00:02:54.389> target<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.319> second

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
still fly to my target but the second

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.349 
still fly to my target but the second
scenario<00:02:55.889> is<00:02:56.340> more<00:02:56.639> interesting<00:02:57.120> because

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
scenario is more interesting because

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.210 
scenario is more interesting because
this<00:02:57.720> one<00:02:57.900> bliss<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.319> gonna<00:02:58.500> use<00:02:58.709> his<00:02:58.769> hook

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
this one bliss is gonna use his hook

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.129 
this one bliss is gonna use his hook
first<00:02:59.609> and<00:02:59.790> hit<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.090> moon<00:03:00.299> dough<00:03:00.450> first<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
first and hit the moon dough first and

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.050 
first and hit the moon dough first and
then<00:03:01.409> thrash<00:03:01.739> will<00:03:01.950> hit<00:03:02.129> his<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.639> as<00:03:02.909> it

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
then thrash will hit his and as it

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.369 
then thrash will hit his and as it
happens<00:03:03.389> you<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.629> see<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.079> thrush

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
happens you can see that the thrush

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.229 
happens you can see that the thrush
interrupted<00:03:05.129> blitzes<00:03:05.519> hook<00:03:05.790> completely

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
interrupted blitzes hook completely

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.360
