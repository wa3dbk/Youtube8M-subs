feet is 8 foot by 8 foot and to me that

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.410 
feet is 8 foot by 8 foot and to me that
would<00:02:04.409> be<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> minimum<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.340> would<00:02:05.729> use<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.360> would

actually rather rather have 8 foot by 10
foot<00:02:09.270> but

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
foot but

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.620 
foot but
since<00:02:11.070> plywood<00:02:11.490> comes<00:02:11.700> neat<00:02:11.910> foot<00:02:12.120> Winx<00:02:12.540> we

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
since plywood comes neat foot Winx we

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.330 
since plywood comes neat foot Winx we
just<00:02:12.810> wanted<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.080> meet<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.440> made<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.100> size

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
just wanted to meet it made it this size

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.760 
just wanted to meet it made it this size
and<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.640> works<00:02:14.850> fine<00:02:15.350> we<00:02:16.350> didn't<00:02:16.560> had<00:02:16.650> any

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
and this works fine we didn't had any

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.380 
and this works fine we didn't had any
problems<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:18.120> want<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.360> just

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
problems with this I just want I just

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.380 
problems with this I just want I just
like<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.750> little<00:02:19.050> bit<00:02:19.140> bigger<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.210> it's

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
like a little bit bigger but so it's

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.850 
like a little bit bigger but so it's
real<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.840> know<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.080> real<00:02:22.260> simple<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.650> make

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
real you know it's real simple to make

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.440 
real you know it's real simple to make
this<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.400> think<00:02:23.460> six<00:02:23.880> sheets<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.240> plywood

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
this is I think six sheets of plywood

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.370 
this is I think six sheets of plywood
two<00:02:25.380> skids<00:02:25.770> if<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.130> two<00:02:26.310> befores<00:02:27.050> about<00:02:28.050> six

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
two skids if you two befores about six

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.570 
two skids if you two befores about six
sheets<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.800> ten<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:30.680> just<00:02:31.680> painted<00:02:32.070> it's

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
sheets of ten and just painted it's

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.660 
sheets of ten and just painted it's
painted<00:02:33.000> with<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.180> sprayer<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:34.490> that's<00:02:35.490> all

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
painted with the sprayer and that's all

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.820 
painted with the sprayer and that's all
there<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.210> it's<00:02:36.360> got<00:02:36.480> too<00:02:36.720> too<00:02:37.350> hard<00:02:37.560> so

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
there is to it it's got too too hard so

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.170 
there is to it it's got too too hard so
we<00:02:37.980> can<00:02:39.710> have<00:02:40.710> Pharaoh<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.220> two<00:02:41.370> styles<00:02:42.000> at<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
we can have Pharaoh to two styles at the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.180 
we can have Pharaoh to two styles at the
same<00:02:42.390> time<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.930> then<00:02:43.020> it's<00:02:43.170> got<00:02:43.320> some<00:02:43.590> kind<00:02:44.100> of

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
same time and then it's got some kind of

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.070 
same time and then it's got some kind of
like<00:02:44.370> eyeballs<00:02:44.850> area<00:02:45.240> where<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.420> can<00:02:45.570> hook<00:02:45.900> it

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
like eyeballs area where I can hook it

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.360 
like eyeballs area where I can hook it
up<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.500> tractor<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.010> pull<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.310> around

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
up to the tractor and pull it around

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.550 
up to the tractor and pull it around
through<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> pasture<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.300> move<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.200> will<00:02:49.350> move

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
through the pasture to move it will move

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.460 
through the pasture to move it will move
it<00:02:50.060> after<00:02:51.060> every<00:02:51.450> time<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.660> South<00:02:51.959> Pharaohs

south to have eleven so we try and give
them<00:03:06.200> two<00:03:07.200> chances<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.890> have<00:03:08.070> at<00:03:08.220> least<00:03:08.430> eleven

pigs and then she doesn't have eleven on
her<00:03:11.100> next<00:03:11.310> litter<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:12.560> she'll<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.830> take

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
they'll bounce back and be really good

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.699 
they'll bounce back and be really good
on<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.260> second<00:03:31.739> but<00:03:32.840> what<00:03:33.840> we<00:03:33.959> got<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.470> look<00:03:34.620> at

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
had pigs yet is we always kind of stiff

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.699 
had pigs yet is we always kind of stiff
over<00:03:53.640> this<00:03:53.820> fence<00:03:54.090> here<00:03:54.269> we<00:03:54.540> always<00:03:54.870> pinch

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
over this fence here we always pinch

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.310 
over this fence here we always pinch
them<00:03:55.980> off<00:03:56.160> because<00:03:56.840> since<00:03:57.840> they<00:03:57.959> never<00:03:58.080> had

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
them off because since they never had

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.540 
them off because since they never had
pigs<00:03:58.530> before<00:03:58.650> all<00:03:58.950> times<00:03:59.160> they<00:03:59.280> don't<00:03:59.400> know

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
pigs before all times they don't know

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.370 
pigs before all times they don't know
what's<00:03:59.730> going<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.360> they'll<00:04:01.019> sometimes

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
what's going on and they'll sometimes

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.009 
what's going on and they'll sometimes
they'll<00:04:01.739> try<00:04:02.360> you<00:04:03.360> know<00:04:03.420> two<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.660> them<00:04:03.870> have

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
they'll try you know two of them have

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.600 
they'll try you know two of them have
pigs<00:04:04.320> in<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.560> same<00:04:04.769> spot<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.340> that's<00:04:05.489> a

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
pigs in the same spot and that's a

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.280 
pigs in the same spot and that's a
recipe<00:04:06.420> for<00:04:06.540> disaster

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
recipe for disaster

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.699 
recipe for disaster
so<00:04:08.070> we<00:04:08.190> always<00:04:08.370> try<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.850> fence<00:04:09.660> them<00:04:09.840> off<00:04:09.989> let

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
so we always try and fence them off let

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.650 
so we always try and fence them off let
them<00:04:10.830> have<00:04:10.980> their<00:04:11.100> pigs<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.730> then<00:04:11.880> I'll<00:04:12.390> take

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
them have their pigs and then I'll take

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.030 
them have their pigs and then I'll take
these<00:04:12.840> down<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.110> dates<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.709> she's<00:04:13.860> already

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
these down to dates and she's already

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.340 
these down to dates and she's already
had<00:04:14.280> her<00:04:14.310> pigs<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.970> then<00:04:15.750> I'll<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.140> girl

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
had her pigs and then I'll this girl

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.820 
had her pigs and then I'll this girl
right<00:04:16.500> here

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
right here

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.080 
right here
it's<00:04:17.580> fixing<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.330> have<00:04:18.479> pigs<00:04:19.640> she's<00:04:20.640> got<00:04:20.820> milk

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
it's fixing to have pigs she's got milk

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.580 
it's fixing to have pigs she's got milk
so<00:04:21.330> she<00:04:21.390> probably<00:04:21.630> picked<00:04:22.020> tonight<00:04:22.200> House

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
so she probably picked tonight House

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.030 
so she probably picked tonight House
fence<00:04:23.160> her<00:04:23.340> off

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
fence her off

experiment around with them to get the
apps<00:04:45.730> best<00:04:46.720> design<00:04:47.080> but<00:04:47.260> this<00:04:47.350> works<00:04:47.620> good<00:04:47.860> if

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
apps best design but this works good if

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.430 
apps best design but this works good if
you're<00:04:48.220> going<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.600> ever<00:04:49.600> feral<00:04:50.050> any<00:04:50.200> sales
