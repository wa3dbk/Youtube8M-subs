00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.750
 How about how good you are? 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.299
 here I am one more day today I wanted you 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.780

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.580
 what have I done in mac so much in valenciÃ  

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.380
 who were these days and we were in the 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.480
 English court and we saw the last things 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.699
 of the collection that I was if I did not 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.279
 wrong or something like that because neither 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.000
 I know it and from a back to bad I did 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.100
 a few days here in Madrid so nothing I 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.710
 but to say it 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.650
 I start to show it I bought from the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.140
 collection is that I tell you they were like 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.120
 is not illuminating 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.120
 is the Ecuador side 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.440
 skin finish the collection I saw it here 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.750
 in Madrid but they only had the soft 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.300
 environment that you say yes yes yes it's very 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.760
 pretty is from collection lie is from 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.760
 fixed line and I already have it since 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.379
 and that I am here as you see has that 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.399
 beautiful coral or orange 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.850
 out there in the middle and it's very beautiful I'm going to 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.850
 do that 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.100
 As you can see, it's pretty clear, I have the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.700
 fingers stained from the video that has 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.700
 recorded before 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.530
 and there you see it as you already know the mineral 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.680
 there are mack 615 do not usually have 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.260
 purpurina always there is always zimmer 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.810
 I do not know if you are seeing it is usually 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.840
 always a very very finite shimmer and that 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.850
 gives a lot of light to the face and this if 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.840
 I'm not mistaken they have a price of 27 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.840
 euros more or less 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.979
 another little thing I buy that same day 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.850
 here I have this lipstick that we saw 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.150
 of a day we did to do the back to 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.800
 mac but they had it exhausted is the pin fer 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.140
 pop 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.140
 and as you will see now it is a rose 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.330
 very clear 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:26.320
 but it really is not as neon and now 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.320
 on the lips especially I do not know 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.800
 and there on camera looks very much but 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.070
 then the lips do not 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.800
 it is not so much is a point not very beautiful and 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.290
 especially for now for the summer and 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.570
 these things the sea lipsticks I think 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.140
 they are around 19 euros more or 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.880
 less and now I'm going to show you the three 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.880
 I caught with a cane 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.230
 the first one and the one I had wanted since 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.850
 a lot of time ago but always 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.430
 I want the measurement store that they had it 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.290
 exhausted in belgium which is from where 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.090
 they send them then that was 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.349
 impossible to find it and it is 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.349
 the famous diva 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.770
 and you also have a principle this 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.390
 lipstick does not call me anything the attention is 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.880
 more I 've had it several times in my hand 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.110
 I bought it from a friend and I've never 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.110
 said how nice 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.710
 but this winter I started to like 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.670
 these lipsticks 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:37.030
 burgundy eggplant 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.819
 or whatever you want to call it and this is super 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.510
 nice is mate 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.510
 and he puts it 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.630
 and I tell you it 's very beautiful it 's a color 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.550
 more of winter but taking advantage of what 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.230
 they had what I had to catch by the way 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.230
 from before I did not tell you the texture 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.370
 what is a crime without the little brush 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.370
 if he touched my face 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.100
 If you covered my face, focus the camera 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.140
 you have to focus 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.350
 another one of the lipsticks of the back to mark 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.910
 they were 3 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.910
 It was the ju 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.169
 I 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.169
 as it is said is an Englishman 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.710
 and it's a knot because I do not do more than 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.139
 colorines buy and then when carrying 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.770
 a more marked makeup of eyes and 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.490
 I never have a lipstick muse 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.610
 put myself 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.099
 and now you will see this gives a tad of 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.520
 brightness but little more 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.520
 I also 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.330
 I am a bit difficult when it comes to doing it 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.740
 It's a lip tone and the only thing that 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.569
 contributes is a tad of brightness and very 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:02.159
 little color 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:02.159
 and the third in discord was the angel 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.460
 what is a frost of the few frost that 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.380
 I like vila and this is also 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.510
 a tone 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.430
 he saw it very similar to the previous one what 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.010
 unique that gives a relative more colors 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.020
 be here as you see is very similar to 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.790
 another but a tad more color and what 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.740
 I chose it because that's why I always 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.980
 that I make makeup is a smoky 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.220
 eyes or whatever I never have a lip 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.170
 newt what to wear so you're nothing 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.940
 were my brand purchases because they 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.390
 have liked to be of assistance has 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.890
 awakened the cars and I hope that if you 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.510
 they liked you can find them because 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.660
 the collection is exhausted in almost all 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.950
 parts so nothing many kisses and we 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.950
 we see the next video chao
