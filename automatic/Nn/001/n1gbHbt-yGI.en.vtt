00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.890
 ap 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.690
 the moon 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.690
 ae 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.859
 ae 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.080
 good is the first is a satisfaction power 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:44.530
 again come back to Coritiba after 13 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:48.580
 years of my passing here and a great 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.710
 opportunity to re-play a series of 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.910
 and face this challenge to know and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.540
 responsibility that one has of 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.800
 wear a shirt like Coritiba's and 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.880
 consequently make a good 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.850
 competition is the right cori 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.759
 the sooner you get back into the 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.250
 competition and I hope so with 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:17.290
 a lot of confidence is and also 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.130
 believing in the potential not to 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.009
 only the athletes but the commission is not 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.440
 with the support of the coritiba fan 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.619
 club will return there again 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.330
 paths are needed there for a 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.899
 best campaign a pretty surprise 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.570
 positive in the way I was received 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.409
 it is clear that the vast majority of athletes 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.110
 already faced is one more that 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.570
 I had the opportunity to act together 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.990
 was the Sao Paulo team in the passage 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.420
 we had together at botafogo and now it 's 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.060
 to be able to leave as soon as possible and 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.640
 getting to know the athletes on a daily basis and 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.180
 consequently what is most important 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.280
 inside the field is to mix the fastest 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.130
 possible so that we can obtain 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.679
 this in our trajectory to 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.580
 that I had in the boot in that 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.100
 year is both with heliton and as 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.769
 The commander was ney franc and 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.269
 opportunity now and work with 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:25.090
 two here at Coritiba and even joked 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.310
 recently with helitone it is expected that the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.140
 same trajectory that we had in the 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.880
 that year's Brazilian championship. 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.670
 we had a following 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.739
 if I'm not mistaken of 11 12 victories we 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.250
 we can reach here in Coritiba 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.650
 also and consequently we obtain the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.350
 success that we both want for each 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.580
 one here is the competition for it to have 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:53.210
 This is the way this is important. 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.610
 Trying a regularity is the usual 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.100
 teams that do not succeed are the ones 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.330
 more suffer during a competition 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.960
 like this 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.700
 so it's best if you can do the 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.520
 your homework to win indoors 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.210
 and always take points away from home is 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.660
 so you can then reach an average 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.810
 good and consequently have a good 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.310
 position within the competition 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.910
 suffers a lot in this team that alternates 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.940
 very much and consequently for being a 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.680
 competition of a better technical level is 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.510
 You see, your opponents are better opponents. 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.560
 posture each game has to be a 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.980
 decision-making even if not the game 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.760
 many times it becomes even more 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.620
 complicated the motivation of a group 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.610
 of a cast has to be every 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.770
 match 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.990
 the renewed spirit for each game is 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.240
 this is the great challenge for a 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.140
 competition is long as is the championship 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.660
 Brazilian 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.280
 how I always tried to talk in all 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.470
 the teams that I was in 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.930
 the greatest respect the athlete can have is 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.960
 When he comes in and puts on his shirt, it 's with 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.110
 with the determination that it is necessary 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.570
 and respecting mainly the fact that 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.250
 he is in a determined association, right? 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.770
 I had a trip through the parana cube here. 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:23.030
 in Curitiba back again to have the 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:25.160
 coritiba and consequently to the same 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.650
 convictions that I had there I will have here 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.660
 and as I also had other clubs I think 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.470
 that the athlete has to live 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.910
 because we end up having many 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.280
 changes throughout the career and 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.260
 consequently you have to have that 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.600
 independent thinking of the shirt 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.780
 you see the message I leave here 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.720
 hello guys, as always a 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.750
 in love he continues to support the team 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.340
 is the club especially in a series to 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.210
 where matches are more difficult is the 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.990
 level is how I spoke on one level 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.310
 is greater is demand and 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.169
 consequently the fan in that 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.990
 moment is fundamental right 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.550
 We know how much the club needs. 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.970
 exit as quickly as possible from a 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.360
 recovery and consequently I arrive 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.830
 also with this challenge is to do here 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.949
 a good job and therefore right and 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.560
 show is the fan that in the 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.810
 the support of even the affection that I 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.169
 I've had with many that I met in this 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.660
 period I can enjoy and enjoy 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.900
 well again of a passage here in the 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.900
 coritiba
