I'm<00:00:08.920> going<00:00:09.370> to<00:00:09.430> show<00:00:09.580> you<00:00:09.640> how<00:00:09.790> to<00:00:09.820> overclock

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.300 
I'm going to show you how to overclock

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.470 
I'm going to show you how to overclock
an<00:00:10.540> i7<00:00:10.930> 930<00:00:11.530> so<00:00:11.920> that<00:00:12.100> you<00:00:12.250> can<00:00:12.430> get<00:00:12.610> go<00:00:13.270> from

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
an i7 930 so that you can get go from

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.350 
an i7 930 so that you can get go from
2.80<00:00:14.700> up

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
2.80 up

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.850 
2.80 up
or<00:00:16.450> is<00:00:16.570> your<00:00:16.690> heat<00:00:16.900> sink<00:00:17.200> fan<00:00:17.350> will<00:00:17.650> allow<00:00:17.800> you

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
or is your heat sink fan will allow you

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.300 
or is your heat sink fan will allow you
to<00:00:18.010> go<00:00:18.160> your<00:00:18.430> cooling<00:00:18.730> system<00:00:18.760> can<00:00:19.720> support

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.970 

okay<00:00:24.310> what<00:00:24.940> you<00:00:25.120> see<00:00:25.420> here<00:00:25.780> is<00:00:25.990> my<00:00:26.290> overclock

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
okay what you see here is my overclock

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.160 
okay what you see here is my overclock
and<00:00:27.280> you<00:00:27.400> can<00:00:27.580> see<00:00:27.790> what<00:00:27.910> I've<00:00:28.000> got<00:00:28.300> if<00:00:28.930> you

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
and you can see what I've got if you

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.470 
and you can see what I've got if you
look<00:00:29.350> at<00:00:29.470> my<00:00:29.590> target<00:00:29.890> cpu<00:00:30.550> frequency<00:00:30.940> which<00:00:31.450> is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
look at my target cpu frequency which is

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.780 
look at my target cpu frequency which is
right<00:00:31.810> here<00:00:32.050> it<00:00:32.230> says<00:00:32.710> my<00:00:33.010> processor<00:00:33.670> is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
right here it says my processor is

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.460 
right here it says my processor is
currently<00:00:34.150> at<00:00:34.300> 3.5<00:00:35.290> 1/4<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.989> my<00:00:38.680> ram<00:00:39.010> is<00:00:39.370> at

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
currently at 3.5 1/4 and my ram is at

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.060 
currently at 3.5 1/4 and my ram is at
3.1.3

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
3.1.3

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.880 
3.1.3
3/8<00:00:42.730> in<00:00:42.970> my<00:00:43.180> stock<00:00:43.570> Ram<00:00:43.960> is<00:00:45.270> 1333<00:00:46.270> megahertz<00:00:46.890> so

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
3/8 in my stock Ram is 1333 megahertz so

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.680 
3/8 in my stock Ram is 1333 megahertz so
you<00:00:48.040> can<00:00:48.250> see<00:00:48.460> I<00:00:48.490> overclocked<00:00:49.240> my<00:00:49.450> RAM<00:00:49.660> a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
you can see I overclocked my RAM a

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.870 
you can see I overclocked my RAM a
little<00:00:50.079> bit<00:00:50.230> but<00:00:50.590> you<00:00:50.800> shouldn't<00:00:51.400> go<00:00:51.490> too<00:00:51.550> high

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
little bit but you shouldn't go too high

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.819 
little bit but you shouldn't go too high
on<00:00:51.910> your<00:00:52.060> RAM<00:00:52.329> so<00:00:52.510> if<00:00:52.600> you<00:00:52.690> have<00:00:52.780> 1600<00:00:53.470> speedram

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
on your RAM so if you have 1600 speedram

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.610 
on your RAM so if you have 1600 speedram
try<00:00:54.130> and<00:00:54.250> stay<00:00:54.460> around<00:00:54.730> that<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.810> the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
try and stay around that and the

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.830 
try and stay around that and the
processor<00:00:57.250> will<00:00:57.790> go<00:00:58.030> as<00:00:58.210> high<00:00:58.360> as<00:00:58.390> your<00:00:58.630> RAM

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
processor will go as high as your RAM

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.380 
processor will go as high as your RAM
will<00:00:59.050> let<00:00:59.200> you<00:00:59.380> go<00:00:59.560> so<00:00:59.920> let's<00:01:00.460> get<00:01:01.000> started

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
will let you go so let's get started

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.620 
will let you go so let's get started
here<00:01:01.450> first<00:01:02.380> you<00:01:02.500> want<00:01:02.770> to<00:01:02.800> go<00:01:02.920> into<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.630> let's

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
here first you want to go into the let's

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.249 
here first you want to go into the let's
go<00:01:04.780> back<00:01:05.080> here<00:01:05.550> let<00:01:06.550> me<00:01:06.640> reset<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.630> defaults

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
go back here let me reset the defaults

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.499 
go back here let me reset the defaults
here<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.710> I'll<00:01:08.860> show<00:01:08.890> you<00:01:09.130> what<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.520> change<00:01:09.700> is

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
here and I'll show you what to change is

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.780 
here and I'll show you what to change is
put<00:01:10.780> f7<00:01:11.619> on<00:01:11.710> mine<00:01:12.040> go<00:01:12.880> to<00:01:12.940> yes<00:01:14.190> okay<00:01:15.190> let<00:01:15.640> me<00:01:15.700> go

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
put f7 on mine go to yes okay let me go

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.600 
put f7 on mine go to yes okay let me go
back<00:01:15.970> so<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.479> enter<00:01:17.110> in<00:01:17.380> your<00:01:17.410> BIOS<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:18.399> want

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
back so you enter in your BIOS you want

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.969 
back so you enter in your BIOS you want
to<00:01:18.700> go<00:01:18.790> to<00:01:18.850> frequency<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.020> voltage<00:01:20.200> control

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
to go to frequency and voltage control

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.850 
to go to frequency and voltage control
push<00:01:21.670> enter<00:01:22.049> then<00:01:23.049> the<00:01:23.229> first<00:01:23.440> thing<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:23.710> want

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
push enter then the first thing you want

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.980 
push enter then the first thing you want
to<00:01:23.920> do<00:01:24.070> is<00:01:24.220> go<00:01:24.370> into<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.700> voltage<00:01:25.060> control<00:01:25.720> if

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
to do is go into the voltage control if

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.460 
to do is go into the voltage control if
you<00:01:26.710> have<00:01:26.740> an<00:01:26.979> EVGA<00:01:28.080> motherboard<00:01:29.080> you<00:01:29.260> want<00:01:29.409> to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
you have an EVGA motherboard you want to

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.800 
you have an EVGA motherboard you want to
go<00:01:29.530> without<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:30.430> droop<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.909> can<00:01:31.060> see<00:01:31.270> with<00:01:31.600> or

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
go without the droop you can see with or

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.250 
go without the droop you can see with or
without<00:01:31.930> if<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.650> want<00:01:32.799> to<00:01:32.890> go<00:01:32.950> without<00:01:34.260> then

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
without if you want to go without then

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.719 
without if you want to go without then
go<00:01:35.440> into<00:01:35.619> these<00:01:35.830> settings<00:01:36.130> right<00:01:36.280> here<00:01:36.369> and

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
go into these settings right here and

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.020 
go into these settings right here and
you'll<00:01:37.060> see<00:01:37.299> what<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.869> stocks<00:01:38.320> are<00:01:38.590> on<00:01:39.250> here

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
you'll see what the stocks are on here

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.500 
you'll see what the stocks are on here
the<00:01:40.270> Bray's<00:01:40.510> all<00:01:40.900> these<00:01:41.110> one<00:01:41.380> higher<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:43.390> the

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
here and see if you see it's 1.125 go

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.030 
here and see if you see it's 1.125 go
ahead<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:52.720> raise<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:53.080> one<00:01:53.439> higher<00:01:53.740> than<00:01:54.100> that

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
ahead and raise it one higher than that

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.770 
ahead and raise it one higher than that
now<00:01:57.040> your<00:01:57.280> dim<00:01:57.520> bolted<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.090> can<00:01:58.270> if<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.600> know

would not raise this higher than 100 you

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.720 
would not raise this higher than 100 you
might<00:02:10.239> have<00:02:10.390> some<00:02:10.540> issues<00:02:11.400> I'm<00:02:12.400> going<00:02:12.670> to

this<00:02:21.250> one<00:02:21.610> you'll<00:02:21.910> see<00:02:22.150> why<00:02:22.329> we're<00:02:22.540> raising

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
this one you'll see why we're raising

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.990 
this one you'll see why we're raising
all<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.049> temp<00:02:23.320> after<00:02:23.739> this<00:02:23.920> or<00:02:24.250> at<00:02:24.459> all<00:02:24.790> the

all the temp after this or at all the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.820 
all the temp after this or at all the
voltages<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.959> went<00:02:26.200> ahead<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.500> raised<00:02:26.620> it

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
voltages so I went ahead and raised it

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.150 
voltages so I went ahead and raised it
all<00:02:27.040> one<00:02:27.430> higher<00:02:27.760> than<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.300> stock<00:02:28.569> that

all one higher than the stock that

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.950 
all one higher than the stock that
you<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.670> then<00:02:30.300> we'll<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.540> push<00:02:30.660> escape

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
you of it then we'll just push escape

I don't even mess with any of that so
okay<00:03:29.790> here's<00:03:30.390> your<00:03:30.480> overclock<00:03:30.990> right<00:03:31.200> here<00:03:31.380> so

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
okay here's your overclock right here so

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.270 
okay here's your overclock right here so
we<00:03:31.920> got<00:03:32.120> 133<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.240> stock<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.810> doe<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:34.380> this<00:03:35.100> is

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
we got 133 is stock to a doe and this is

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.980 
we got 133 is stock to a doe and this is
set<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.520> 21<00:03:35.940> what<00:03:36.270> you<00:03:36.420> want<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.660> go<00:03:36.720> ahead<00:03:36.870> and

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
set to 21 what you want to go ahead and

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.449 
set to 21 what you want to go ahead and

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
do is set this to 20 to start with set

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.970 
do is set this to 20 to start with set
it<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.670> 20<00:03:42.320> then<00:03:43.320> it's<00:03:43.530> going<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.709> lower<00:03:43.890> my

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
it to 20 then it's going to lower my

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.280 
it to 20 then it's going to lower my
core<00:03:44.370> clock<00:03:44.580> down<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.850> two<00:03:45.209> six<00:03:45.510> six<00:03:45.780> now<00:03:46.230> you

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
core clock down to two six six now you

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.020 
core clock down to two six six now you
can<00:03:46.500> see<00:03:46.770> what<00:03:46.950> all<00:03:47.070> your<00:03:47.220> overclocking<00:03:47.850> is

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
can see what all your overclocking is

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.580 
can see what all your overclocking is
going<00:03:48.240> to<00:03:48.300> be<00:03:48.390> done<00:03:48.600> it'll<00:03:49.020> show<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.290> right

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
going to be done it'll show you right

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.730 
going to be done it'll show you right
here<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:50.070> my<00:03:50.610> board<00:03:50.940> anyways<00:03:51.570> not<00:03:52.050> necessarily

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
here on my board anyways not necessarily

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.310 
here on my board anyways not necessarily
yours<00:03:52.950> okay<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.360> if<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.600> go<00:03:54.840> ahead<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.140> raise

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
yours okay so if I go ahead and raise

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.020 
yours okay so if I go ahead and raise
this<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.860> I'm<00:03:56.160> just<00:03:56.459> gonna<00:03:56.670> pick<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.850> random

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
this to I'm just gonna pick a random

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.880 
this to I'm just gonna pick a random
number<00:03:57.330> if<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:57.690> put<00:03:57.930> your<00:03:58.110> CPU<00:03:58.590> with<00:03:58.709> this

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
number if you put your CPU with this

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.890 
number if you put your CPU with this
it's<00:03:59.160> going<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.400> fry<00:03:59.610> your<00:03:59.790> processor<00:04:00.270> 100%

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
it's going to fry your processor 100%

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.310 
it's going to fry your processor 100%
for<00:04:01.020> sure

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
for sure

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.140 
for sure
but<00:04:01.620> I'm<00:04:01.709> putting<00:04:01.830> I<00:04:01.950> put<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.400> at<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.640> max<00:04:02.850> just

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
but I'm putting I put it at the max just

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.720 
but I'm putting I put it at the max just
to<00:04:03.270> show<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.510> what<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.930> could<00:04:04.140> possibly<00:04:04.739> do<00:04:05.430> I

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
to show you what you could possibly do I

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.510 
to show you what you could possibly do I
mean<00:04:06.510> yeah<00:04:07.200> it's<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:07.800> high<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.040> doesn't<00:04:08.459> even

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
mean yeah it's so high it doesn't even

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.970 
mean yeah it's so high it doesn't even
show<00:04:08.790> up<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:09.180> mean<00:04:09.390> come<00:04:09.810> on<00:04:09.959> let's<00:04:10.620> put<00:04:10.770> it<00:04:10.830> in

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
show up I mean come on let's put it in

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
show up I mean come on let's put it in
something<00:04:11.160> lower<00:04:11.459> just<00:04:11.790> for<00:04:12.709> go<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.739> 400<00:04:14.370> okay

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
something lower just for go to 400 okay

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.370 
something lower just for go to 400 okay
so<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:15.780> would<00:04:15.870> essentially<00:04:16.260> be

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
so that would essentially be

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.310 
so that would essentially be
overclocking<00:04:17.160> my<00:04:17.280> processor<00:04:17.880> 28.0<00:04:18.780> from<00:04:19.200> a

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
overclocking my processor 28.0 from a

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.370 
overclocking my processor 28.0 from a
266<00:04:20.130> now<00:04:20.700> you're<00:04:21.209> guaranteed<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.720> fry<00:04:22.169> your

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
266 now you're guaranteed to fry your

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.030 
266 now you're guaranteed to fry your
whole<00:04:22.500> system<00:04:23.720> okay<00:04:24.720> let<00:04:25.230> me<00:04:25.440> go<00:04:25.680> ahead<00:04:25.770> and

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
whole system okay let me go ahead and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.550 
whole system okay let me go ahead and
set<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.280> now<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:26.850> want<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.210> stay<00:04:27.510> around<00:04:27.720> 200

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
set it now you want to stay around 200

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.580 
set it now you want to stay around 200
210<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.550> mean<00:04:30.210> if<00:04:30.419> you<00:04:30.510> go<00:04:30.600> to<00:04:30.690> 210<00:04:31.140> let<00:04:31.380> me<00:04:31.440> see

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
210 I mean if you go to 210 let me see

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.620 
210 I mean if you go to 210 let me see
what<00:04:31.740> if<00:04:31.830> I<00:04:31.890> give<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.220> two<00:04:33.060> ten<00:04:33.270> will<00:04:33.419> give<00:04:33.540> you

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
what if I give you two ten will give you

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.800 
what if I give you two ten will give you
4.0<00:04:34.230> at<00:04:34.970> 20<00:04:36.229> it<00:04:37.229> should<00:04:37.440> go<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.590> let's<00:04:38.070> say<00:04:38.250> 300

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
4.0 at 20 it should go to let's say 300

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.000 
4.0 at 20 it should go to let's say 300
yeah<00:04:39.810> that's<00:04:40.050> going<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.289> overclock<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.800> about

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
yeah that's going to overclock it about

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.439 
yeah that's going to overclock it about
6.0

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
6.0

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.390 
6.0
just<00:04:42.569> you<00:04:42.840> know<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:43.139> matter<00:04:43.499> of<00:04:43.650> messing<00:04:44.279> around

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
just you know a matter of messing around

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.850 
just you know a matter of messing around
with<00:04:44.699> it<00:04:44.759> and<00:04:45.120> getting<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.629> you<00:04:46.590> know<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
with it and getting the you know the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.619 
with it and getting the you know the
settings<00:04:47.189> right<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.490> one<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:47.639> use<00:04:48.029> is<00:04:48.270> one

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
settings right the one I use is one

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:53.959 
settings right the one I use is one
seven<00:04:49.229> five<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.889> believe<00:04:50.180> um<00:04:51.469> no<00:04:52.469> okay<00:04:53.189> yes<00:04:53.520> this

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
seven five I believe um no okay yes this

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:54.559 
seven five I believe um no okay yes this
might<00:04:54.180> be<00:04:54.330> it

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
might be it

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.809 
might be it
I<00:04:54.599> think<00:04:55.199> I<00:04:55.259> use<00:04:55.439> one<00:04:55.710> seven<00:04:56.159> five<00:04:56.430> which

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
I think I use one seven five which

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.209 
I think I use one seven five which
overclocks<00:04:57.389> my<00:04:57.629> to<00:04:57.689> 802<00:04:58.169> three<00:04:58.710> point<00:04:58.979> five

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
overclocks my to 802 three point five

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.450 
overclocks my to 802 three point five
and<00:04:59.639> then<00:05:00.629> once<00:05:01.409> you<00:05:01.589> have<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:01.860> decent

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
and then once you have a decent

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.820 
and then once you have a decent
overclock<00:05:03.089> right<00:05:03.419> here<00:05:03.689> and<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:04.289> got<00:05:04.469> a<00:05:04.499> you

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
overclock right here and you got a you

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.159 
overclock right here and you got a you
know<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:05.219> nice<00:05:05.729> you're<00:05:06.360> saying<00:05:06.569> okay<00:05:06.870> I<00:05:06.900> can

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
know a nice you're saying okay I can

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.049 
know a nice you're saying okay I can
deal<00:05:07.379> with<00:05:07.409> three<00:05:07.770> five<00:05:08.039> then<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:08.729> go<00:05:08.819> back

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:09.059 
deal with three five then you go back

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.999 
deal with three five then you go back
into<00:05:09.270> your<00:05:09.360> memory<00:05:09.689> feature<00:05:09.930> what<00:05:10.620> you<00:05:10.710> want

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
into your memory feature what you want

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.489 
into your memory feature what you want
to<00:05:11.069> do<00:05:11.159> is<00:05:11.309> raise<00:05:11.639> this<00:05:11.999> up<00:05:12.300> as<00:05:12.659> high<00:05:13.229> as<00:05:13.259> you

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:13.499 
to do is raise this up as high as you

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.489 
to do is raise this up as high as you
can<00:05:13.529> now<00:05:14.150> if<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:15.270> notice<00:05:15.599> that<00:05:15.779> raised<00:05:16.110> mine

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:16.499 
can now if you notice that raised mine

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.149 
can now if you notice that raised mine
to<00:05:16.740> 1402<00:05:17.550> if<00:05:17.909> I<00:05:18.029> try<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:18.330> run<00:05:18.569> my<00:05:18.779> RAM<00:05:19.080> at<00:05:19.349> 1402

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
to 1402 if I try and run my RAM at 1402

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.369 
to 1402 if I try and run my RAM at 1402
it'll<00:05:20.759> more<00:05:20.969> than<00:05:21.180> likely<00:05:21.419> it'll<00:05:21.749> run<00:05:22.020> better

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
it'll more than likely it'll run better

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:23.390 
it'll more than likely it'll run better
give<00:05:22.620> me<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.800> blue<00:05:22.949> screen<00:05:23.189> of<00:05:23.339> death

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
give me the blue screen of death

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.100 
give me the blue screen of death
eventually<00:05:23.969> so<00:05:24.449> what<00:05:24.629> I<00:05:24.659> need<00:05:24.749> to<00:05:24.930> go<00:05:24.990> ahead

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
eventually so what I need to go ahead

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.629 
eventually so what I need to go ahead
and<00:05:25.199> do<00:05:25.289> is<00:05:25.499> lower<00:05:25.889> this<00:05:26.219> down<00:05:26.279> to<00:05:27.919> 174<00:05:28.919> maybe

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
and do is lower this down to 174 maybe

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.420 
and do is lower this down to 174 maybe
just<00:05:29.849> a<00:05:29.969> few<00:05:29.999> let's<00:05:30.539> see<00:05:30.779> we<00:05:31.740> just<00:05:31.979> lower<00:05:32.249> that

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
just a few let's see we just lower that

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.519 
just a few let's see we just lower that
down<00:05:32.639> until<00:05:33.089> we<00:05:33.330> get<00:05:33.419> it<00:05:33.569> closer<00:05:33.960> to<00:05:34.199> the

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
down until we get it closer to the

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.899 
down until we get it closer to the
original<00:05:36.199> that<00:05:37.199> it<00:05:37.349> needs<00:05:37.499> to<00:05:37.740> be<00:05:37.889> at<00:05:38.039> so<00:05:38.699> mine

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
original that it needs to be at so mine

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.299 
original that it needs to be at so mine
is<00:05:39.319> 1333<00:05:40.319> we<00:05:40.499> want<00:05:40.680> to<00:05:40.740> get<00:05:40.860> it<00:05:40.979> a<00:05:41.039> little<00:05:41.069> bit

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:41.309 
is 1333 we want to get it a little bit

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:44.980 
is 1333 we want to get it a little bit
closer<00:05:41.550> than<00:05:41.699> that<00:05:42.059> so<00:05:42.300> we're<00:05:42.419> go<00:05:42.479> to<00:05:42.539> 173<00:05:43.229> and

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
closer than that so we're go to 173 and

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.749 
closer than that so we're go to 173 and
overclocking<00:05:45.990> is<00:05:46.139> basically<00:05:46.589> your<00:05:47.129> RAM<00:05:47.399> is

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
overclocking is basically your RAM is

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.059 
overclocking is basically your RAM is
the<00:05:48.389> limits<00:05:48.689> what<00:05:48.870> you<00:05:49.020> got<00:05:49.199> so<00:05:49.770> I<00:05:49.800> can<00:05:49.949> go<00:05:50.009> to

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
the limits what you got so I can go to

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.659 
the limits what you got so I can go to
one<00:05:50.279> seven<00:05:50.610> oh<00:05:51.080> and<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.680> can<00:05:52.860> also<00:05:53.039> raise<00:05:53.430> this

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
one seven oh and I can also raise this

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.450 
one seven oh and I can also raise this
up<00:05:53.849> to<00:05:54.029> twenty<00:05:54.389> one<00:05:54.419> let's<00:05:55.319> do<00:05:55.499> that<00:05:55.649> and<00:05:55.919> if

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
up to twenty one let's do that and if

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.579 
up to twenty one let's do that and if
you<00:05:56.639> raise<00:05:56.879> that<00:05:56.909> up<00:05:57.180> to<00:05:57.300> twenty<00:05:57.629> one<00:05:57.659> it'll

00:05:58.579 --> 00:05:58.589 
you raise that up to twenty one it'll

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:01.429 
you raise that up to twenty one it'll
raise<00:05:58.830> your<00:05:59.129> processor<00:05:59.849> and<00:06:00.029> lower<00:06:00.990> your<00:06:01.229> RAM

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:01.439 
raise your processor and lower your RAM

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:03.439 
raise your processor and lower your RAM
speed<00:06:01.800> so<00:06:02.189> that's<00:06:02.279> what<00:06:02.490> you<00:06:02.550> want<00:06:02.729> to<00:06:02.789> do<00:06:02.879> so

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
speed so that's what you want to do so

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.189 
speed so that's what you want to do so
go<00:06:03.599> ahead<00:06:03.659> and<00:06:03.839> keep<00:06:04.259> going<00:06:04.409> down<00:06:04.709> one<00:06:05.009> six

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
go ahead and keep going down one six

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.860 
go ahead and keep going down one six
seven<00:06:07.199> let's<00:06:07.680> say<00:06:08.060> um<00:06:09.060> there<00:06:09.419> we<00:06:09.539> go<00:06:09.659> and

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
seven let's say um there we go and

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.129 
seven let's say um there we go and
that's<00:06:10.229> as<00:06:10.469> close<00:06:10.709> to<00:06:10.979> my<00:06:11.330> RAM<00:06:12.330> frequency<00:06:13.020> as<00:06:13.110> a

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
that's as close to my RAM frequency as a

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.809 
that's as close to my RAM frequency as a
game<00:06:13.409> and<00:06:13.589> that's<00:06:13.860> barely<00:06:14.129> overclocked

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
game and that's barely overclocked

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.489

Miriam<00:06:15.240> is<00:06:15.360> not<00:06:15.539> going<00:06:15.689> to<00:06:15.749> affect<00:06:15.990> much<00:06:16.199> and

00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:16.499 
Miriam is not going to affect much and

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:18.980 
Miriam is not going to affect much and
my<00:06:17.069> overclock<00:06:17.459> is<00:06:17.669> at<00:06:17.879> three<00:06:18.180> point<00:06:18.419> five<00:06:18.689> one

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
my overclock is at three point five one

my overclock is at three point five one
four<00:06:19.349> which<00:06:20.069> gives<00:06:20.339> you<00:06:20.459> a<00:06:20.490> nice<00:06:20.759> little

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
four which gives you a nice little

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.100 
four which gives you a nice little
overclock<00:06:21.240> so<00:06:21.749> it's<00:06:22.080> matter<00:06:22.379> messing<00:06:23.009> with

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
overclock so it's matter messing with

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.550 
overclock so it's matter messing with
your<00:06:25.110> memory<00:06:25.709> feature<00:06:26.389> your<00:06:27.389> core<00:06:28.319> clock

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:33.509 
host frequency if you mess with these

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.929 
host frequency if you mess with these
three<00:06:33.810> things<00:06:34.050> you<00:06:34.589> can<00:06:34.620> get<00:06:34.979> a<00:06:35.009> pretty<00:06:35.729> nice

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:35.939 
three things you can get a pretty nice

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:37.610 
three things you can get a pretty nice
little<00:06:36.120> overclock<00:06:36.300> then<00:06:37.020> once<00:06:37.259> you're<00:06:37.439> done

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
little overclock then once you're done

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.279 
little overclock then once you're done
you<00:06:38.370> want<00:06:38.459> to<00:06:38.580> make<00:06:38.639> sure<00:06:38.879> that<00:06:39.330> you<00:06:39.479> save<00:06:39.810> your

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
you want to make sure that you save your

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:45.949 
you want to make sure that you save your
profile<00:06:43.129> okay<00:06:44.129> now<00:06:44.879> if<00:06:45.209> you<00:06:45.509> have<00:06:45.749> any

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:45.959 
profile okay now if you have any

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:48.469 
profile okay now if you have any
problems<00:06:46.740> with<00:06:46.919> your<00:06:47.249> overclock<00:06:47.819> which<00:06:48.330> you

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
problems with your overclock which you

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.059 
problems with your overclock which you
may<00:06:48.659> need<00:06:48.839> to<00:06:48.930> do<00:06:49.080> is<00:06:49.319> raise<00:06:49.620> some<00:06:49.889> of<00:06:49.979> these

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:50.069 
may need to do is raise some of these

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:53.899 
may need to do is raise some of these
voltages<00:06:50.639> even<00:06:50.939> higher<00:06:51.180> however<00:06:52.019> do<00:06:52.560> not<00:06:52.909> do

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:53.909 
voltages even higher however do not do

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:54.650 
voltages even higher however do not do
this<00:06:54.240> let<00:06:54.509> me

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660

here okay salads green right there these

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.000 
here okay salads green right there these
mean<00:06:59.700> that<00:07:00.210> it's<00:07:00.510> okay<00:07:00.660> to<00:07:00.930> run<00:07:01.470> you<00:07:01.830> can<00:07:01.980> run

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
mean that it's okay to run you can run

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.710 
mean that it's okay to run you can run
it<00:07:02.340> at<00:07:02.490> any<00:07:02.670> of<00:07:02.850> these<00:07:02.970> green<00:07:03.300> ones<00:07:04.370> but<00:07:05.540> do<00:07:06.540> not

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
it at any of these green ones but do not

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.350 
it at any of these green ones but do not
go<00:07:07.290> to<00:07:07.350> the<00:07:07.890> red<00:07:08.190> because<00:07:08.820> you<00:07:08.910> will<00:07:09.030> fry<00:07:09.210> your

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 
go to the red because you will fry your

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.470 
go to the red because you will fry your
setup<00:07:09.740> alright<00:07:10.770> that's<00:07:11.460> basically<00:07:11.940> that<00:07:12.210> let

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
setup alright that's basically that let

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.650 
setup alright that's basically that let
me<00:07:12.510> go<00:07:12.660> ahead<00:07:12.780> and<00:07:13.310> okay<00:07:14.310> and<00:07:14.540> actually<00:07:15.540> want

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 
me go ahead and okay and actually want

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.330 
me go ahead and okay and actually want
to<00:07:15.720> do<00:07:15.810> that<00:07:15.930> you<00:07:16.140> want<00:07:16.290> to<00:07:16.350> save<00:07:16.650> your<00:07:16.890> profile

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 
to do that you want to save your profile

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.550 
to do that you want to save your profile
then<00:07:17.790> if<00:07:17.940> you<00:07:18.090> have<00:07:18.270> to<00:07:18.450> reset<00:07:18.900> your<00:07:19.020> CMOS<00:07:19.320> for

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
then if you have to reset your CMOS for

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.020 
then if you have to reset your CMOS for
any<00:07:19.710> reason<00:07:20.010> you<00:07:20.130> can<00:07:20.160> just<00:07:20.520> go<00:07:20.700> to<00:07:20.820> low

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.030 
any reason you can just go to low

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.410 
any reason you can just go to low
profile<00:07:21.630> and<00:07:22.020> low<00:07:22.860> profile<00:07:23.340> so<00:07:23.910> I<00:07:23.940> just<00:07:24.150> loaded

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:24.420 
profile and low profile so I just loaded

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.240 
profile and low profile so I just loaded
in<00:07:24.600> my<00:07:24.750> profile<00:07:25.200> up<00:07:25.410> which<00:07:25.650> was<00:07:25.860> basically

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
in my profile up which was basically

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.940 
in my profile up which was basically
what<00:07:26.460> I<00:07:26.490> just<00:07:26.730> did<00:07:26.910> but<00:07:27.650> then<00:07:28.650> I'll<00:07:28.740> go<00:07:28.860> ahead

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:28.950 
what I just did but then I'll go ahead

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.730 
what I just did but then I'll go ahead
and<00:07:29.130> escape<00:07:29.490> out<00:07:29.700> of<00:07:29.730> this<00:07:29.910> save<00:07:30.900> and<00:07:31.200> exit

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 
and escape out of this save and exit

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.490 
and escape out of this save and exit
setup<00:07:32.100> and
