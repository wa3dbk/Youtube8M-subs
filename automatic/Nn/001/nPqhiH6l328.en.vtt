00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
think we've had in a final fantasy for

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.950 
think we've had in a final fantasy for
quite<00:02:58.190> some<00:02:58.370> time<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.820> this<00:02:59.480> one<00:02:59.690> comes<00:02:59.900> with

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
quite some time and this one comes with

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.630 
quite some time and this one comes with
its<00:03:00.140> own<00:03:00.290> minigame<00:03:00.800> where<00:03:00.950> you're<00:03:01.340> shooting

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
its own minigame where you're shooting

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
at dragons as they fly around the fifth

the invasion game which is a kind of

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.720 
the invasion game which is a kind of
real-time<00:03:09.080> strategy<00:03:09.590> game<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.160> it<00:03:10.580> just

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
real-time strategy game and it just

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.310 
real-time strategy game and it just
