00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.520
 beauty talks people who talk here with 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.800
 You're the best guys here. 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.080
 back with drugs or ginco existed 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.689
 People, I'm about to face this. 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.369
 dragon is flying over local 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.890
 I wanted to talk to you about 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.090
 Next topic 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.559
 the game even if there is then I stopped 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.630
 play a while since I was 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.300
 playing well light was also grabbed 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.890
 in destiny in the remastering of gta 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.370
 So I ended up giving a stop at the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.559
 joneide but I'm back here now I 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.120
 I have about 60 hours of game time 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.059
 so I can not talk better about the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.340
 game was the following the game already left does 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.809
 some time but I decided to address this 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.969
 theme here with you because a lot of people 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.010
 still asks me about the game and such 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.840
 people who have not yet bought 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.510
 prioritize other most famous games 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.540
 So let's just say a little 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.000
 As such, this game is what I thought it was. 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.490
 the following galera is not all game won 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.430
 like the game of the year 2014 this 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.790
 award I agree was because 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.490
 really the game is very well finished 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.680
 is a game that you easily pass from 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.530
 play ladies without feeling sick 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.689
 there is enough to do 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.490
 hundreds of secondary missions and when 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.829
 speaks of secondary missions in omissions 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.229
 Ahhh, there you go. 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.780
 key does not have enough to be 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.850
 made very well-crafted missions 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.689
 also have some plans for the game so 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.610
 nothing like that is very difficult neither players 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.340
 also can not succeed 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.860
 but there are plenty of benches in the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.259
 game and something that calls me a lot 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.650
 attention is also the quantity of items 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.930
 differentiated weapons that have not only weapons 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.690
 hard collectibles has a plethora of 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.120
 of items that can be collected in the game 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.790
 there and that it really works for 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.770
 example many times rpg games have the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.020
 collected on some types of stones 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.200
 that you collect and such that practically 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.060
 are not used and all that I have collected 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.280
 who do not play today I had to use 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.320
 something is an armor or is 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.940
 to improve a weapon or else by some 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.920
 another kind of thing until finally 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.380
 some missions so this is another one 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.970
 aspect that I quite liked 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.310
 Something else also that I liked a lot 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.200
 were the graphics so I will not say 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.220
 which are the best graphics in the world 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.590
 so if it's a rpg you have 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.650
 Very beautiful setting very well 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.290
 made known is not only in technical terms 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.890
 but also in the artistic part of much 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.490
 beautiful enemies the ambiance sceneries 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.260
 has deserted caves forests is years 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.540
 snow in mountains 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.700
 so there are a lot of scenarios there 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.340
 to be explored are scenarios 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.950
 gigantic and so it is not a world 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.800
 open if not an open world game 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.540
 You know, it's a game so it has aria. 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.510
 open for example you get there 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.820
 selected desert has an entire area 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.130
 Desert to explore there for 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.230
 example conserving the forest is you 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.050
 talk selects from the forest is 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.880
 wcom but so the scenarios they are not 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.590
 are interconnected only you can not by 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.459
 example in the desert for the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.160
 forest 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.650
 then it is as if it were large areas that 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.850
 you can explore and in these areas and 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.310
 Now I can talk to you with 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.060
 security are really immense luck 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.640
 too much to do then 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.590
 You're sure to lose a lot of 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.360
 hours in each of these areas and that 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.260
 it was also surprising that 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.410
 fact 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.989
 the game also features a system is 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.880
 cooperation between the characters you 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.860
 can ball hit the gang is raining 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.320
 much here then you will hear showed 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.470
 That's why it's raining too much in the 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.910
 arrival then let's continue here is 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.920
 you can ball differentiated tactics 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.260
 I have here two warriors came back 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.440
 playing warrior here has another one 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.420
 warrior with me has an archer and a 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.250
 magician so I can position by 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.800
 example face this dragon I can 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.230
 position the magician a little further 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.940
 For him how fragile I am here. 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.000
 I can position it a little further 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.160
 to try is to prevent him from taking damage and 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.020
 how it can attack from afar it will 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.910
 attack the enemy from afar at this time 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.190
 it's cover to position it away 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.720
 so you can do different tactics 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.310
 to face the enemies have a 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.290
 enemy who does not even need fees and will 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.870
 There you get scared of beating him normal. 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.700
 face-to-face beauty but we have 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.040
 enemies that demand more tactics like 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.420
 that dragon and for example make dragon 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.000
 It's not the first I got. 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.760
 facing the others faced 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.740
 and take a beating because most 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.330
 Dragons are elementary japan dragon 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.340
 which dragon fire food that 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.540
 fed ice and this is the right 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.120
 Only one I thought did not have one 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.880
 element no helena fodder same 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.700
 So I went up to him and was the only one 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.620
 I managed to get better and continued 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.810
 to talk about some more aspects of the game 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.450
 gameplay galley is a player of 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.210
 typical age of rpgs the character is not 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.190
 very free you know to keep jumping 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.650
 climbing things but he does have one 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:23.570
 certain freedom he can jump is the 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:25.040
 normal public is getting around 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.230
 usually for the scenario does not have a 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.960
 system of government and none of 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.600
 talking gameplay character 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.910
 normal basic character but it is very 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.950
 then works great 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.690
 well, the game style does not matter 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.370
 nothing about it 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.560
 You can also change you can 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.810
 control and different character of your 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.640
 team and I just put the archer 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.040
 you can also control others if 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.960
 you do not get caught just by controlling the 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.580
 character you created you can 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.980
 to control the other members who 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.840
 Do you have on your team? 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.270
 another interesting fact also about 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.610
 that the team members are you in the 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.680
 from the story you are advancing 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.210
 You meet various characters. 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.600
 so like this you will meet a 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.360
 character that has a 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.040
 by the ability to use heavy weapons 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.930
 against another that is the life of the use 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.720
 with the bow then you can recruit 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.570
 these characters and use them with 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.610
 you can with him is to advance in the 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.430
 using them on the way there 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.890
 I always use these steps 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.950
 characters and warrior bótons 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.960
 control mother boots more 11 madrid because 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.900
 there are many areas of the game that 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.720
 use thin and also votes a thief 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.670
 who is the archer here that he is 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.740
 responsible for opening some doors 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.990
 other things than the other characters 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.520
 you can not do this, it's also cool that 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.420
 every character has his skill 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.140
 Special 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.290
 My conclusion is just a game. 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.150
 Amazing 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.490
 It was very worth buying this one. 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.530
 game now I'm taking it firmer 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.350
 As I said a little more or less 60 hours. 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.510
 game is in braga died what I am 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.130
 with more or less 60 hours of play 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.020
 it was worth it was a game that 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.000
 I really recommend it only if you do not 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.460
 to like rpg that is not worth 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.770
 buy this game then who likes it 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.140
