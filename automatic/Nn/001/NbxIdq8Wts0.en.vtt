00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.890
 i 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.890
 and 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.610
 looks an idea 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.650
 and during the time for 23 years 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.860
 We have been developing has 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.080
 demonstrated and perfecting and today by 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.450
 today we have to say that only number one 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.210
 in the world to have achieved a 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.100
 product at a very acceptable price and that 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.100
 had the market need of it 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.960
 initially the manufacture of the panel 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.070
 luxe involves the use of materials 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.990
 premiums with technical characteristics 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.150
 special 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.980
 It has taken many years of 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.500
 research and investments very 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.870
 important and above all a plan of 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.400
 continuous improvement to get to have the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.870
 current quality standards and 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.080
 Product reliability of its multiple 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.080
 Applications 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.060
 Thanks to a strict plan of 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.979
 control of industrial processes a 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.299
 product testing protocol 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.310
 finished to guarantee the 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.100
 mechanical physical behavior of the same 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.600
 and the use of vision systems 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.299
 artificial to eliminate possible 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.789
 aesthetic defects of the panel is achieved 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.799
 reach in each production lot 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.270
 the high quality standards 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.270
 set for the panel looks 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.479
 in river and wayne state whitman boxes 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.860
 except electric gravel production 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.890
 national 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.399
 depending on the walkers white spencer 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.280
 wells hide and put them in rooms 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.979
 and tomato impact the four existing and 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.979
 by music of that time 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.310
 plus 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.969
 lots of jail are right 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.969
 locally 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.560
 there are more than 50 countries that currently 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.330
 the product is being distributed 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.450
 our customers are not only 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.480
 using for home manufacturing 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.790
 of home grind as it can be kitchen or 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.640
 It may be bathroom or closet but can be 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.450
 that the panel is also starting to 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.450
 distribute to clients for decoration 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.750
 in this study architecture we 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.870
 We specialize in making projects very 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.910
 creative and personalized in the idea 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.950
 it has to be built with materials and 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.930
 we find in the group luxe range 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.760
 alvic many solutions that together 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.040
 with creativity they give results 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.440
 optimal for customers to have 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.360
 succeeded because the same product was 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.640
 has sold alone we have not had it 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.460
 have argued many things so that 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.560
 are sold but it was once they have 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.970
 tried once they have worked and have 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.470
 seen the contribution that has the furniture 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.300
 They bought it from us and they follow us 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.710
 buying we have not found solutions 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.270
 very valid for the hospital sector 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.440
 also a teacher and even 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.810
 restoration 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.520
 the secret really are small things 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.840
 that added all of them back in 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.160
 that the product finally becomes 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.170
 special that has a superior quality 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.270
 what you can do other than try 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.340
 copy it I do not know to what lights it has 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.830
 become a universal product that 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.739
 It can be placed in various places in 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.680
 various facilities because it contributes 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.880
 let's say a lot of quality to any 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.250
 type of installation 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.380
 the world at this time knows harvey 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.380
 and a lot of blame for violation report
