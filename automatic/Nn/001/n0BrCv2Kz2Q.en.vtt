00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
don't describe every panel just what

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410 
don't describe every panel just what
happens<00:00:43.289> in<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> story<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.070> when<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
happens in the story so when I get to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.660 
happens in the story so when I get to
the<00:00:45.539> actual<00:00:45.719> drawing<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.590> print<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.129> my<00:00:47.280> script

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.650 
and read through it marking it wherever
I<00:00:50.010> think<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.520> might<00:00:50.699> be<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.850> good<00:00:51.030> idea<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.420> cut

when<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.709> break<00:02:20.040> down<00:02:20.219> my<00:02:20.400> pages<00:02:20.939> into<00:02:21.180> panels<00:02:21.599> I

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
when I break down my pages into panels I

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.500 
when I break down my pages into panels I
usually<00:02:22.290> do<00:02:22.469> small<00:02:22.799> sketches<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.430> some<00:02:24.030> call

nails<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.470> reason<00:02:25.739> for<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.189> they're

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
nails the reason for that is they're

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.699 
nails the reason for that is they're
faster<00:02:27.299> to<00:02:27.420> draw<00:02:27.689> and<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.230> get<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.409> feel

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
faster to draw and you can get a feel

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.740 
faster to draw and you can get a feel
for<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.010> layout<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.579> lot<00:02:29.790> easier<00:02:30.269> than<00:02:30.480> with<00:02:30.720> a

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
before I start drawing on them there are

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.580 
before I start drawing on them there are
two<00:03:01.530> reasons<00:03:01.769> for<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.129> one<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.440> boring<00:03:04.440> so

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
two reasons for that one it's boring so

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.500 
two reasons for that one it's boring so
I<00:03:04.799> want<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.069> get<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.340> done<00:03:05.549> get<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.030> over<00:03:06.329> with

lesson six so don't worry about that now
the<00:04:16.919> next<00:04:17.190> guideline<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:17.639> want<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.030> give<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.329> is

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
the next guideline I want to give you is

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.009 
the next guideline I want to give you is
variation<00:04:19.459> make<00:04:20.459> sure<00:04:20.699> every<00:04:21.150> panel<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.780> not

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
variation make sure every panel is not

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.420 
variation make sure every panel is not
the<00:04:22.349> same<00:04:23.030> variation<00:04:24.030> in<00:04:24.449> size<00:04:24.720> is<00:04:25.199> good<00:04:25.440> when

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
the same variation in size is good when

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.010 
the same variation in size is good when
I<00:04:26.520> started<00:04:26.909> out<00:04:27.000> making<00:04:27.150> comics<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.780> actually

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
I started out making comics I actually

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.170 
I started out making comics I actually
copied<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.680> bunch<00:04:28.860> of<00:04:28.979> page<00:04:29.310> layouts<00:04:29.760> just<00:04:30.030> like

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
copied a bunch of page layouts just like

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.290 
copied a bunch of page layouts just like
this<00:04:30.360> just<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.810> get<00:04:30.960> an<00:04:31.080> idea<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.530> what<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.949> do

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
this just to get an idea of what to do

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.209 
this just to get an idea of what to do
but<00:04:33.300> variation<00:04:33.750> within<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.469> frames<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:34.979> even

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:35.219 
but variation within the frames is even

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.760 
but variation within the frames is even
more<00:04:35.370> important<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.000> that<00:04:36.659> also<00:04:36.960> saves<00:04:37.620> you

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
more important and that also saves you

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.310 
more important and that also saves you
some<00:04:37.919> time

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
some time

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.890 
some time
if<00:04:38.500> you<00:04:39.100> already<00:04:39.220> had<00:04:39.640> two<00:04:40.150> close-ups<00:04:40.690> of<00:04:40.750> your

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
silhouettes for frame three because we

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.050 
silhouettes for frame three because we
know<00:04:47.410> what<00:04:47.590> they<00:04:47.710> look<00:04:47.890> like<00:04:47.920> now<00:04:48.220> no<00:04:48.880> need<00:04:49.000> to

outburst or something like that it might

outburst or something like that it might
not<00:04:57.250> be<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.610> best<00:04:57.820> time<00:04:58.150> for<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.480> silhouette

not be the best time for a silhouette
but<00:04:59.680> then<00:04:59.860> again<00:04:59.980> that<00:05:00.130> might<00:05:00.340> be<00:05:00.640> exactly

before we go on to lesson three about
character<00:05:06.820> design<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:07.360> want<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.870> give<00:05:08.050> you<00:05:08.080> a

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
character design I want to give you a

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.190 
character design I want to give you a
few<00:05:08.470> ideas<00:05:08.500> for<00:05:08.860> page<00:05:09.310> layouts<00:05:09.730> now<00:05:10.630> you<00:05:10.930> can't

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
few ideas for page layouts now you can't

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.380 
few ideas for page layouts now you can't
really<00:05:11.290> go<00:05:11.650> wrong<00:05:11.680> with<00:05:12.010> a<00:05:12.340> nine<00:05:12.580> panel<00:05:13.090> grid

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
really go wrong with a nine panel grid

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.930 
really go wrong with a nine panel grid
if<00:05:13.770> you<00:05:14.770> want<00:05:14.980> to<00:05:15.040> shake<00:05:15.250> things<00:05:15.490> up<00:05:15.610> a<00:05:15.760> bit

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
if you want to shake things up a bit

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.180 
if you want to shake things up a bit
make<00:05:16.210> some<00:05:16.450> variations<00:05:17.020> in<00:05:17.170> size<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.890> numbers

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
make some variations in size and numbers

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.460 
make some variations in size and numbers
of<00:05:18.220> panels<00:05:18.730> but<00:05:18.940> more<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.510> nine<00:05:19.720> panels<00:05:20.320> on<00:05:20.440> a

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
of panels but more the nine panels on a

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.120 
of panels but more the nine panels on a
page<00:05:20.740> tends<00:05:21.100> to<00:05:21.280> give<00:05:21.400> a<00:05:21.430> very<00:05:21.640> hectic<00:05:22.030> feel

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
page tends to give a very hectic feel

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.160 
page tends to give a very hectic feel
the<00:05:24.130> bigger<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:24.820> more<00:05:25.000> detailed<00:05:25.540> your<00:05:25.720> panels

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
the bigger and more detailed your panels

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.410 
the bigger and more detailed your panels
are<00:05:26.350> the<00:05:26.890> more<00:05:27.100> it<00:05:27.190> tends<00:05:27.400> to<00:05:27.490> slow<00:05:27.910> down<00:05:28.150> the

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
are the more it tends to slow down the

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.560 
are the more it tends to slow down the
reading<00:05:28.570> of<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:28.960> an<00:05:29.820> open<00:05:30.820> panel<00:05:31.120> here<00:05:31.540> and

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
reading of it an open panel here and

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.840 
reading of it an open panel here and
there<00:05:31.840> is<00:05:31.990> great<00:05:32.260> for<00:05:32.470> variation<00:05:33.010> but<00:05:33.580> works

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
there is great for variation but works

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.180 
there is great for variation but works
best<00:05:34.180> with<00:05:34.390> a<00:05:34.450> single<00:05:34.930> character<00:05:35.380> object<00:05:35.980> a

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
best with a single character object a

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.240 
best with a single character object a
car<00:05:36.760> or<00:05:37.060> a<00:05:37.090> building<00:05:37.390> in<00:05:37.660> full<00:05:37.900> view<00:05:38.170> you<00:05:39.100> can

car or a building in full view you can

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.000 
car or a building in full view you can
also<00:05:39.420> skew<00:05:40.420> your<00:05:40.600> grid<00:05:40.960> and<00:05:41.200> make<00:05:41.260> irregular

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
also skew your grid and make irregular

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.860 
also skew your grid and make irregular
panels<00:05:42.430> giving<00:05:42.730> off<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.030> idea<00:05:43.390> of<00:05:43.570> a<00:05:43.660> world
