policeman and all that stuff was

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.140 
policeman and all that stuff was
completely<00:01:04.680> contained<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.610> side<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
completely contained to the side of the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.719 
completely contained to the side of the
road<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.960> didn't<00:01:07.200> close<00:01:07.320> any<00:01:07.650> lanes<00:01:08.159> there

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
road they didn't close any lanes there

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.359 
road they didn't close any lanes there
was<00:01:08.880> no<00:01:09.210> obstruction<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.320> road<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
was no obstruction in the road but the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.820 
was no obstruction in the road but the
accident<00:01:12.000> still<00:01:12.299> created<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.020> ridiculous

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
accident still created this ridiculous

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.870 
accident still created this ridiculous
traffic<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.119> why<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.400> I<00:01:17.400> realized

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
traffic so why was that and I realized

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.340 
traffic so why was that and I realized
that<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> reason<00:01:18.659> why<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:18.930> was<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.200> this

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that the reason why there was all this

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.440 
that the reason why there was all this
traffic<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:20.040> simply<00:01:20.490> because<00:01:20.729> everyone<00:01:21.330> was

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
traffic is simply because everyone was

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.289 
traffic is simply because everyone was
stopping<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.170> look<00:01:22.439> at<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.860> accident<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.670> was

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
really that simple the fact that people

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.399 
really that simple the fact that people
stopped<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.479> take<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.689> quick<00:01:28.020> look<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.380> the

traffic<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.810> reality<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:37.770> traffic<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
traffic but in reality you are traffic I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
traffic but in reality you are traffic I
consider<00:01:39.720> myself<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.290> pretty<00:01:40.500> decent

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
consider myself to be a pretty decent

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
consider myself to be a pretty decent
driver<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.340> least<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.670> my<00:01:41.790> age<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.420> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
driver at least for my age but that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.450 
driver at least for my age but that
doesn't<00:01:42.960> change<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.259> fact<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.070> still

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
doesn't change the fact that I still

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.760 
doesn't change the fact that I still
stopped<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.119> look<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> accident<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.470> well

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
stopped to look at the accident as well

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.520 
stopped to look at the accident as well
just<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> other<00:01:48.240> drivers<00:01:48.780> at

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
just like all of the other drivers at

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
just like all of the other drivers at
the<00:01:49.890> time<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.130> couldn't<00:01:50.310> help<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:50.729> think<00:01:50.790> oh

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the time I couldn't help but think oh

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.789 
the time I couldn't help but think oh
man<00:01:51.360> all<00:01:51.540> these<00:01:51.689> stupid<00:01:51.930> drivers<00:01:52.409> causing

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
man all these stupid drivers causing

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.230 
man all these stupid drivers causing
this<00:01:52.860> traffic<00:01:53.310> by<00:01:53.399> looking<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.880> accident

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
this traffic by looking at the accident

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.109 
this traffic by looking at the accident
but<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.020> reality<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.770> too<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.030> those

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
but in reality I too was one of those

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.060 
but in reality I too was one of those
stupid<00:01:57.390> drivers<00:01:57.960> causing<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.439> traffic<00:01:58.649> and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
stupid drivers causing the traffic and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.510 
stupid drivers causing the traffic and
this<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.610> exactly<00:01:59.939> how<00:02:00.600> elohel<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:01.890> easy

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
this is exactly how elohel is it's easy

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.800 
this is exactly how elohel is it's easy
to<00:02:02.670> think<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.939> you're<00:02:03.119> not<00:02:03.329> part<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
to think that you're not part of the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
to think that you're not part of the
problem<00:02:04.079> because<00:02:04.770> there's<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.219> many<00:02:05.340> other

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
problem because there's so many other

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.670 
problem because there's so many other
sources<00:02:06.210> around<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.259> easy<00:02:07.530> to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
sources around you that are so easy to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.520 
sources around you that are so easy to
pinpoint<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.759> exact<00:02:09.179> problem<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.410> in

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
pinpoint the exact problem on but in

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.070 
pinpoint the exact problem on but in
reality<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.849> with<00:02:11.970> traffic<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.930> are

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
reality just like with traffic you are

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.030 
reality just like with traffic you are
not<00:02:13.260> stuck<00:02:13.709> in

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
not stuck in

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
hell you are elohel and in reality

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.819 
hell you are elohel and in reality
nobody<00:02:18.390> cares<00:02:18.780> how<00:02:18.930> good<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.409> think<00:02:19.439> you<00:02:19.739> are

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
nobody cares how good you think you are

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.709 
nobody cares how good you think you are
just<00:02:20.189> like<00:02:20.549> how<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> think<00:02:21.180> I'm<00:02:21.269> a<00:02:21.299> good<00:02:21.480> driver

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
just like how I think I'm a good driver

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.229 
just like how I think I'm a good driver
nobody<00:02:22.560> cares<00:02:22.769> about<00:02:22.859> that<00:02:23.189> they<00:02:23.700> only<00:02:23.879> care

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
nobody cares about that they only care

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.880 
nobody cares about that they only care
if<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.420> caused<00:02:24.689> the<00:02:24.900> traffic<00:02:25.290> by<00:02:25.409> looking<00:02:25.829> at

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
if you caused the traffic by looking at

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.679 
if you caused the traffic by looking at
the<00:02:26.069> accident<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.150> only<00:02:27.299> way<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.540> get

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
the accident and the only way to get

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.899 
the accident and the only way to get
past<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.439> to<00:02:28.680> be<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:28.980> one<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.370> rise<00:02:29.549> above

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
past that is to be the one to rise above

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.479 
past that is to be the one to rise above
and<00:02:30.150> not<00:02:30.180> stop<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.140> look<00:02:31.260> at<00:02:31.409> the<00:02:31.500> accident<00:02:32.010> if

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
and not stop to look at the accident if

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.949 
and not stop to look at the accident if
you<00:02:32.579> want<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.849> rise<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.450> win<00:02:33.599> your<00:02:33.720> game

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
you want to rise up and win your game

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.770 
you want to rise up and win your game
you<00:02:34.260> have<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.530> take<00:02:34.950> charge<00:02:35.400> not<00:02:36.209> bumble

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
you have to take charge not bumble

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.360 
you have to take charge not bumble
yourself<00:02:37.170> over<00:02:37.530> with<00:02:37.650> your<00:02:37.739> teammates<00:02:38.099> plays

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370

yourself over with your teammates plays
and<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.730> accidents<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.299> might<00:02:39.629> seem<00:02:39.900> severe

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
and the accidents that might seem severe

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.199

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
but if you can manage to look past them

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.000
