 Today we cover stitches April Heek can help you when you are near 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.460
 either quite a lot of machines for hindquarters and no buck has the app too 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.449
 knit so percent act to evening 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:15.749
 around Una if you close the 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:20.470
 Strength down around the strength of the stitch next to the influence because with 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.659
 The Heeker nail one can believe that no order 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:27.959
 the currently so reid i am now the same one when i am gentleman to 

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:31.389
 To learn the example of fine cuisine sting so very fine Ghana 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.489
 so now I will but indices Serbin chemistry rap reggae can 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.020
 and you do that so you leave if I have I'm on the switch now 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.020
 after allowing Dieter to simply hang the right-holders 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.600
 Sixt you should do the part that it's not the one 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.590
 Do not mind Jens takes one here 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.880
 best in the picture strength the clus should be the ems stitches that is 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.080
 if I now a very loose percent 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.090
 APA at Arndt we simply have a big Heichel NADA 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.540
 So now I have some names that about the Ennahda strength too 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.770
 corresponds to 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.770
 so and then I just go in the stitches 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.130
 I am now going out as PrÃ¼m from the front if that is more right now 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.480
 purely 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.910
 Dirk Lady nothing but some off and she the thread through both 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.120
 So basically Keppler, it's like putting it from 2 onwards 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.690
 except that the heeker needle is much faster 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.640
 and I should actually stay in the picture so that we see better 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 So just get into the scam with your opponent questions 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.420
 how can and by all 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.890
 great prices in the next some questions through 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.480
 Blow and stay through 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.370
 in the next time fast thread through the mash pull to blow 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.620
 and by at 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.870
 and again 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.190
 in the not always fast questions through and down 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.330
 envelope 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.130
