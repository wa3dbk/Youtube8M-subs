good<00:00:42.030> thing<00:00:42.090> about<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.860> when<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.070> product

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
good thing about this is when a product

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.720 
good thing about this is when a product
the<00:00:44.789> ipod<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> lot<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.600> people<00:00:45.809> say<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.730> apple

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the ipod a lot of people say that apple

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.069 
the ipod a lot of people say that apple
needed<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.120> bringing<00:00:48.450> out<00:00:48.570> something<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
needed to be bringing out something that

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.630 
needed to be bringing out something that
was<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.440> kind<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.070> continent

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
was going to be kind of like continent

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.490 
was going to be kind of like continent
to<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.789> network<00:00:51.090> market<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:53.180> as<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.539> it's

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
to the network market and as it is it's

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.869 
to the network market and as it is it's
i<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.039> pretty<00:00:56.250> safe<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> say<00:00:56.730> that

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
i think it's pretty safe to say that

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.299 
i think it's pretty safe to say that
neither<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.780> tablet<00:00:58.559> market<00:00:58.590> estate<00:00:59.190> is

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
neither the tablet market estate is

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.439 
neither the tablet market estate is
certainly<00:00:59.579> taking<00:00:59.699> over<00:00:59.969> from<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> network

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
certainly taking over from the network

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
certainly taking over from the network
market<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.250> case<00:01:02.280> then

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
market but if that's not the case then

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.440 
market but if that's not the case then
this<00:01:03.710> 11.6<00:01:04.710> inch<00:01:05.010> macbook<00:01:05.939> air<00:01:06.119> shoot

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
this 11.6 inch macbook air shoot

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.539 
this 11.6 inch macbook air shoot
certainly<00:01:06.990> completely<00:01:07.920> eradicate<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
certainly completely eradicate the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.700 
certainly completely eradicate the
network<00:01:08.909> market<00:01:09.270> because<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.380> technology

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
network market because the technology

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.969 
network market because the technology
that<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.850> purported<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.979> new

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
that is purported to be in this new

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.600 
that is purported to be in this new
macbook<00:01:14.640> air<00:01:14.760> model<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.450> certainly<00:01:16.610> quite

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
macbook air model is is certainly quite

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.820 
macbook air model is is certainly quite
revolutionary<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.509> terms<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.259> storage

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
revolutionary in terms of the storage

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560 
revolutionary in terms of the storage
capacity<00:01:20.580> that's<00:01:20.850> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.479> are

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
capacity that's going to have that are

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.719 
capacity that's going to have that are
not<00:01:21.780> capacity<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.680> type<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.369> storage

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
not capacity but the type of storage

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.429 
not capacity but the type of storage
it's<00:01:23.970> reported<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.170> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> be

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
it's reported that it's going to be

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.710 
it's reported that it's going to be
something<00:01:26.130> some<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:27.030> solid-state

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
something some of this a solid-state

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.319 
something some of this a solid-state
drive<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.640> not<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> conventional

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
drive but not the conventional

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.760 
drive but not the conventional
solid-state<00:01:30.750> drive<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.200> more<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> flash

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
solid-state drive it's more like a flash

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.969 
solid-state drive it's more like a flash
drive<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.340> more<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> stick<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.360> memory

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
drive it's more like a stick in memory

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.230 
drive it's more like a stick in memory
so<00:01:34.979> that's<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:35.729> interesting

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
so that's going to be really interesting

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.310 
so that's going to be really interesting
to<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> lot<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.960> people<00:01:37.140> are

a super fast transfer area and certainly

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.990 
a super fast transfer area and certainly
something<00:02:56.500> that's<00:02:56.650> going<00:02:56.919> to<00:02:56.980> be<00:02:57.040> welcome

the things that the lack of optical

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.439 
the things that the lack of optical
drives<00:03:43.900> ought<00:03:44.079> to<00:03:44.199> have<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.379> thing<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:44.919> I<00:03:45.449> think

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
drives ought to have a thing but I think

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.369 
drives ought to have a thing but I think
people<00:03:46.569> know<00:03:47.129> got<00:03:48.129> their<00:03:48.280> head<00:03:48.459> around<00:03:48.639> it<00:03:49.030> and

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
people know got their head around it and

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.199 
people know got their head around it and
certainly<00:03:50.379> moving<00:03:50.739> into<00:03:51.040> this<00:03:51.129> 11.6<00:03:52.000> inch

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
certainly moving into this 11.6 inch

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.490 
certainly moving into this 11.6 inch
model<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:52.599> think<00:03:52.810> it's<00:03:52.930> going<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.139> be<00:03:53.229> a<00:03:53.259> more

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
model I think it's going to be a more

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.830 
model I think it's going to be a more
welcome<00:03:53.979> model<00:03:54.430> than<00:03:54.579> what<00:03:54.729> the<00:03:54.819> 13.3<00:03:55.479> was

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
welcome model than what the 13.3 was
