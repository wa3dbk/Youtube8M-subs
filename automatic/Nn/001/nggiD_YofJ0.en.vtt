to<00:01:37.049> begin<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.950> would<00:01:38.310> probably<00:01:38.610> string

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
to begin with so I would probably string

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.910 
to begin with so I would probably string
the<00:01:39.360> racket<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> poly<00:01:40.140> hybrid<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.770> add<00:01:40.890> a

the racket with a poly hybrid to add a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.679 
the racket with a poly hybrid to add a
little<00:01:41.189> control<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.090> hit<00:01:42.240> with<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> again

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
little control if I hit with it again

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.289 
little control if I hit with it again
overall<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.710> was<00:01:43.950> definitely<00:01:44.340> impressed<00:01:44.759> with
