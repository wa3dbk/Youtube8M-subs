up<00:01:51.600> by<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> alarm<00:01:52.140> they're<00:01:52.439> grumpy<00:01:52.950> they<00:01:53.280> feel

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
up by the alarm they're grumpy they feel

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.069 
up by the alarm they're grumpy they feel
terrible<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:55.710> idea<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.750> say

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
terrible the idea of this is if if I say

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.580 
terrible the idea of this is if if I say
yes<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.250> want<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.700> woken<00:01:59.909> up<00:02:00.180> at<00:02:00.390> at<00:02:00.960> 8:30<00:02:01.409> in

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
yes I want to be woken up at at 8:30 in

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.770 
yes I want to be woken up at at 8:30 in
the<00:02:01.619> morning

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
the morning

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.539 
the morning
so<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> alarms<00:02:04.170> turned<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.040> time<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.399> set

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
so the alarms turned on the time is set

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.230 
so the alarms turned on the time is set
to<00:02:05.640> 8:30

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
to 8:30

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.130 
to 8:30
I<00:02:06.479> saw<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.840> different<00:02:07.140> days<00:02:08.239> smart<00:02:09.239> early

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
I saw the different days smart early

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.290 
I saw the different days smart early
wake<00:02:10.379> up

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
wake up

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.690 
wake up
so<00:02:11.930> all<00:02:12.050> this<00:02:12.140> does<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.350> if<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:13.310> recognizes

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
so all this does is if it recognizes

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.300 
so all this does is if it recognizes
from<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.540> movement<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:15.020> your<00:02:15.170> mattress<00:02:15.350> that

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
from the movement of your mattress that

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.070 
from the movement of your mattress that
you're<00:02:16.490> in<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.700> light<00:02:17.000> sleep<00:02:17.450> rather<00:02:17.720> than<00:02:18.050> a

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
you're in a light sleep rather than a

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.040 
you're in a light sleep rather than a
deep<00:02:18.320> sleep<00:02:18.760> in<00:02:19.760> 30<00:02:20.270> minutes

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
deep sleep in 30 minutes

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.630 
deep sleep in 30 minutes
period<00:02:21.470> running<00:02:21.740> up<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.890> when<00:02:22.160> your<00:02:22.280> alarm<00:02:22.490> is

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
period running up to when your alarm is

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.420 
period running up to when your alarm is
set<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:23.330> will<00:02:23.570> set<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.840> alarm<00:02:24.170> off<00:02:24.260> then<00:02:24.500> you

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
set it will set the alarm off then you

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.880 
set it will set the alarm off then you
can<00:02:25.580> change<00:02:25.790> one<00:02:25.910> hour<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.390> two<00:02:26.630> hours<00:02:26.740> as<00:02:27.740> well

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
can change one hour to two hours as well

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.060 
can change one hour to two hours as well
as<00:02:28.040> 10<00:02:28.310> minutes<00:02:28.640> or<00:02:29.330> turn<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.900> off<00:02:30.020> now<00:02:30.950> of

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
as 10 minutes or turn it off now of

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.590 
as 10 minutes or turn it off now of
course<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:32.350> if<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.560> gets<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:34.310> 8:30<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.390> then

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
course if if it gets to 8:30 and then

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.540 
course if if it gets to 8:30 and then
you're<00:02:35.810> zong<00:02:36.410> tout<00:02:36.740> you're<00:02:36.920> dead<00:02:37.250> you're

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
you're zong tout you're dead you're

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.880 
you're zong tout you're dead you're
unconscious<00:02:38.150> totally<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.350> will<00:02:39.500> just<00:02:39.650> set<00:02:39.800> the

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
unconscious totally it will just set the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.680 
unconscious totally it will just set the
alarm<00:02:40.040> off<00:02:40.100> anyway<00:02:40.460> so<00:02:40.520> you<00:02:40.820> can't<00:02:41.090> oversleep

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
alarm off anyway so you can't oversleep

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.790 
alarm off anyway so you can't oversleep
because<00:02:41.960> you<00:02:42.050> never<00:02:42.170> come<00:02:42.410> into<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.620> light

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
because you never come into a light

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.650 
because you never come into a light
sleep<00:02:42.980> what<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:43.820> would<00:02:43.910> do<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.060> let's<00:02:44.450> say

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
sleep what it would do for let's say

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.070 
sleep what it would do for let's say
8:10<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:46.580> started<00:02:47.270> viewer<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.510> bit<00:02:47.870> Restless

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
8:10 you started viewer a bit Restless

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.630 
8:10 you started viewer a bit Restless
it<00:02:48.440> detected<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:48.950> move<00:02:49.130> around<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.550> would

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
it detected you move around it would

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.130 
it detected you move around it would
just<00:02:49.820> say<00:02:49.940> they'll<00:02:50.090> I'm<00:02:50.210> off<00:02:50.330> then<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.720> in

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
just say they'll I'm off then and in

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.020 
just say they'll I'm off then and in
theory<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.860> wake<00:02:52.040> up<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.700> much<00:02:52.880> better

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
theory you wake up in a much better

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.260 
theory you wake up in a much better
state<00:02:53.210> I<00:02:54.040> can't<00:02:55.040> really<00:02:55.310> say<00:02:55.610> I've<00:02:55.670> had<00:02:55.970> chair

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
state I can't really say I've had chair

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.060 
state I can't really say I've had chair
to<00:02:56.420> test<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.900> because<00:02:57.140> I'm<00:02:57.440> watch<00:02:57.800> I've<00:02:57.920> been

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
to test it because I'm watch I've been

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.280 
to test it because I'm watch I've been
off<00:02:58.190> work<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.520> week<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.840> I'm<00:02:59.930> not<00:03:00.080> really

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
better ones now I've been using it for

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.800 
better ones now I've been using it for
almost<00:03:39.290> well<00:03:39.830> almost<00:03:39.980> a<00:03:40.190> week<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.660> bit

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
almost well almost a week and and a bit

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.070 
almost well almost a week and and a bit
more<00:03:41.840> used<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.260> suppose<00:03:43.660> let<00:03:44.660> me<00:03:44.750> show<00:03:45.020> you

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
more used to I suppose let me show you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.440 
more used to I suppose let me show you
for<00:03:45.470> example<00:03:45.520> it's<00:03:46.520> interesting<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:47.030> see<00:03:47.209> the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
for example it's interesting you see the

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.730 
for example it's interesting you see the
two<00:03:47.810> nice<00:03:48.080> back<00:03:49.180> I've<00:03:50.180> never<00:03:50.690> like<00:03:51.320> ever<00:03:51.500> got

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
two nice back I've never like ever got

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.560 
two nice back I've never like ever got
us<00:03:51.830> quite<00:03:52.100> a<00:03:52.130> satirist<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:53.000> one<00:03:53.209> underneath

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
us quite a satirist the one underneath

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.180 
us quite a satirist the one underneath
it<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.930> see<00:03:54.050> those<00:03:54.230> two<00:03:54.500> at<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.680> bottom<00:03:55.070> of

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
it you see those two at the bottom of

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.240 
it you see those two at the bottom of
the<00:03:55.310> screen<00:03:55.690> really<00:03:56.690> quite<00:03:56.990> sort<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.260> low<00:03:57.650> and

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
the screen really quite sort of low and

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.590 
the screen really quite sort of low and
even<00:03:58.490> though<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:59.120> one<00:03:59.209> in<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.330> middle<00:03:59.450> there

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
even though the one in the middle there

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.050 
even though the one in the middle there
is<00:03:59.660> quite<00:03:59.990> flat<00:04:00.380> it's<00:04:00.920> slightly<00:04:01.490> higher<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:01.760> I

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
is quite flat it's slightly higher so I

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.060 
is quite flat it's slightly higher so I
guess<00:04:02.270> I<00:04:02.390> wasn't<00:04:02.540> moving<00:04:02.810> around<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:03.230> bit<00:04:03.740> more

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
guess I wasn't moving around a bit more

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.710 
guess I wasn't moving around a bit more
