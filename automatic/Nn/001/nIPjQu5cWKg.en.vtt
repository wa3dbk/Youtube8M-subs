00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.620
hi everyone
today

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.440
I am going to tell you how to make

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.510
my favourite macaron cookies

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.040
it's not 'macaroon' or 'macaroni'
the desert is french

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.549
and they call is exactly like this:
'macaron'

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.980
the recipe is very easy

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.320
you just keep following it
in every little detail

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.420
from the ingredients' amounts
to its temperature

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.219
firstly, sift

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.739
the confectioners' sugar and almond flour
to get rid of any

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.610
big particles in it

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.630
especially sift well the almond flour
which can still contain

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.710
little pieces of almond nuts

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.160
by the way, it might be better
to measure these ingredients

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.290
when already sifted 
for better accuracy

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.200
combine these powders by whisking

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.120
and add egg whites - the half of them

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.190
leaving the rest egg whites for whisking

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.790
mix it thoroughly
to get a sugar-almond paste

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.620
the next step is to make
an italian meringue

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.740
add sugar to water and
put it to medium fire

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.140
when the syrup starts boiling
start whisking

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.680
the rest of egg whites
using the medium mixer speed

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.260
keep stirring the syrup to avoid

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.540
it burned

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.260
one the syrup temperature 
reaches 110℃

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.060
increase the egg whites whisking speed

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.600
up to maximum and
keep heating up the syrup

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.780
stop heating it up when
it is 118℃

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.600
and mix it in to whisking egg whites
as slowly as possible

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.600
while keeping whisking
on a slightly decreased speed

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.400
get the mixture cooled down
keeping whisking it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.360
until 'stiff peaks'

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.480
or as french say 'le bec d'oiseau'

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.560
like that

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.580
transfer the meringue to the bowl
with almond-sugar mixture

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.920
in three parts
thoroughly but accurately

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.560
quickly but tenderly

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.860
to get a gummy batter

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.080
transfer the batter to a pastry bag
pipe circles

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.040
to the baking sheet

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.880
keeping enough space between
the circles and trying

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.720
to maintain the same circle size

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.209
when finished piping,

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.749
firmly tab the baking sheet several times

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.159
against the counter

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.059
to release any air bubbles and

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.219
keep the surface of macaron more smooth

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.959
let the cookies sit at room temperature
for 15 minutes

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.169
and get the oven heated up to 150℃

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:31.889
during this time macaron's tops

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.269
get no longer sticky

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.189
to the touch

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.349
get the baking sheet into the oven

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.749
close the oven door and lower the temperature down to 140℃

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.660
the baking time is 10 minutes

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.840
on the 6th minute

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.749
it is better to open the oven

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.629
and turn the baking sheet around

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.089
so that cookies were baked evenly

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:53.609
once out of oven

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.839
get the baking sheet

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.649
moved away from heat

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:01.169
to some place to cool down

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.390
and while the cookies are cooling down

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.440
we can make a filling

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.600
and it can be any filling you like

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.740
some creme, or fruit-

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.440
or berries-based confiture filling

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.770
one of the simplest filling

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.070
is a chocolate ganache

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.160
I am going to make a white and black
chocolate ganache

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.380
the way you make them 
is exactly the same

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.400
bring cream just to boil

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.580
pour over chopped chocolate

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.380
stirring it with a whisker thoroughly

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.329
until smooth

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.499
add softened butter

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.319
stirring it in with a whisker

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:42.769
by the way, you can try

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.909
different colours of
white chocolate ganache by adding

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.489
any syrups or food colorants

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.349
black chocolate ganache is made

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.629
exactly the same way

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.149
for more elegant taste

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:02.129
I am adding a little of Grand Marnier liquor

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.249
just a little

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.389
when the ganache is cooled down

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.019
and set a little bit
get it into a pastry bag

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.340
and pipe it little by little

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.319
on the cookies parts

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:21.569
right into the centre

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:23.499
and cover it with a different cookie part

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:25.299
you can get as much filling as you like

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.280
some like it with more filling

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.260
others like it with just a little

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.320
you keep the macaron in a fridge

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.510
in a tightly closed box

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.080
that concludes the recipe

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.180
and you know what to do next
without me saying it

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.180
you can find the step-by-step recipe

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.080
