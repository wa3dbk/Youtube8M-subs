and<00:03:11.209> all<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.540> different<00:03:11.690> stuff<00:03:12.050> and<00:03:12.320> compare

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
and all the different stuff and compare

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.110 
and all the different stuff and compare
them<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:12.980> each<00:03:13.160> other<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.610> this<00:03:13.760> one<00:03:13.970> was

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
them to each other and this one was

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.520 
them to each other and this one was
rated<00:03:14.480> nine<00:03:14.690> out<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:14.959> ten<00:03:15.290> for<00:03:16.220> flavor<00:03:16.760> and

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
rated nine out of ten for flavor and

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.350 
rated nine out of ten for flavor and
performance<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:18.830> can't<00:03:19.820> wait<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.030> give<00:03:20.150> this<00:03:20.300> a

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
performance so can't wait to give this a

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.949 
performance so can't wait to give this a
try<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:22.160> reason<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.610> got<00:03:23.000> new<00:03:23.420> stuff<00:03:23.750> I

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
try and the reason I got new stuff I

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.780 
try and the reason I got new stuff I
switched<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.769> different<00:03:25.100> brand<00:03:25.310> or<00:03:25.549> tried<00:03:25.760> a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
switched to a different brand or tried a

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.120 
switched to a different brand or tried a
different<00:03:26.000> brand<00:03:26.330> out<00:03:26.510> because<00:03:26.870> stuff<00:03:27.830> I<00:03:27.980> was

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
different brand out because stuff I was

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.340 
different brand out because stuff I was
using<00:03:28.310> before<00:03:28.489> this<00:03:29.060> pure<00:03:29.450> protein<00:03:30.019> stuff

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
using before this pure protein stuff

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.880 
using before this pure protein stuff
that<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.650> got<00:03:30.830> in<00:03:31.070> an<00:03:31.640> L<00:03:31.940> Co<00:03:32.209> which<00:03:33.019> is<00:03:33.170> those<00:03:33.709> of

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
that I got in an L Co which is those of

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.020 
that I got in an L Co which is those of
you<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.070> don't<00:03:34.100> know<00:03:34.400> it's<00:03:34.580> basically<00:03:34.760> a

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
you that I don't know it's basically a

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.170 
you that I don't know it's basically a
small<00:03:35.510> Walmart<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:39.709> there's<00:03:40.370> pure<00:03:40.670> protein

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
small Walmart it there's pure protein

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.539 
small Walmart it there's pure protein
stuff<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.660> tastes<00:03:42.380> really<00:03:42.680> good<00:03:42.980> it's<00:03:43.310> great

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
stuff it tastes really good it's great

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.449 
stuff it tastes really good it's great
if<00:03:43.910> you're<00:03:44.030> going<00:03:44.299> for<00:03:44.540> taste<00:03:44.780> but<00:03:45.110> it<00:03:45.650> doesn't

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
if you're going for taste but it doesn't

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.569 
if you're going for taste but it doesn't
have<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:47.690> only<00:03:47.900> has<00:03:48.140> like<00:03:49.150> 12<00:03:51.190> 12<00:03:52.190> grams<00:03:52.430> of

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
have it only has like 12 12 grams of

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.200 
have it only has like 12 12 grams of
protein<00:03:53.030> which<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.739> really<00:03:54.739> low<00:03:54.950> and

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
protein which is really low and

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.580 
protein which is really low and
all<00:03:57.210> the<00:03:57.480> only<00:03:57.690> thing<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:58.050> was<00:03:58.170> getting<00:03:58.410> out<00:03:58.440> of

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
all the only thing I was getting out of

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.770 
all the only thing I was getting out of
it<00:03:58.710> was<00:03:58.800> taste<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.730> I<00:03:59.790> wasn't<00:03:59.970> getting<00:04:00.210> great

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
it was taste and I wasn't getting great

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.580 
it was taste and I wasn't getting great
games<00:04:01.110> or<00:04:01.380> anything<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:02.550> I<00:04:02.610> decided<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.060> up<00:04:03.590> mix

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
games or anything so I decided it up mix

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.670 
games or anything so I decided it up mix
switch<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.340> up<00:04:05.460> and<00:04:05.670> try<00:04:05.940> this<00:04:06.350> but<00:04:07.350> if<00:04:07.500> you

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
switch it up and try this but if you

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.680 
switch it up and try this but if you
just<00:04:07.860> want<00:04:08.100> good<00:04:08.520> taste<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.120> get<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.360> little

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
just want good taste and get a little

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.320 
just want good taste and get a little
more<00:04:09.870> protein<00:04:10.080> I<00:04:10.560> would<00:04:11.190> go<00:04:11.370> with<00:04:11.670> pure

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
more protein I would go with pure

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.450 
more protein I would go with pure
protein<00:04:12.780> but<00:04:12.990> otherwise<00:04:13.230> just<00:04:13.680> switch<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.370> up

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
protein but otherwise just switch it up

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.970 
protein but otherwise just switch it up
and<00:04:14.670> try<00:04:14.820> this<00:04:14.880> I<00:04:15.210> guess<00:04:15.680> so

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
and try this I guess so

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.130 
and try this I guess so
that's<00:04:17.370> about<00:04:17.550> it<00:04:17.790> guys<00:04:17.820> oh<00:04:18.450> well<00:04:18.840> thank<00:04:19.080> you
