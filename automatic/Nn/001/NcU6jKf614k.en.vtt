one of the glitches you just want to use

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.599 
one of the glitches you just want to use
the<00:00:16.410> first<00:00:16.650> recon<00:00:18.080> starter<00:00:19.080> class<00:00:19.289> because<00:00:19.980> it

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the first recon starter class because it

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.640 
the first recon starter class because it
might<00:00:21.180> be<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.390> glitch<00:00:21.660> class<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.320> itself

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
might be a glitch class in itself

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.109 
might be a glitch class in itself
because<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.189> yelling<00:00:23.369> class<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:24.029> do

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
because this is yelling class I can do

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.160 
because this is yelling class I can do
the<00:00:24.240> glitch<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> i<00:00:27.570> guess<00:00:27.720> i'll<00:00:27.869> start

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the glitch with so i guess i'll start

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.759 
the glitch with so i guess i'll start
with<00:00:28.380> probably<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.160> best<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:30.439> what<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.590> do

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
if jump over to these be boxes then jump

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.860 
if jump over to these be boxes then jump
onto<00:00:53.879> these<00:00:53.969> cans<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:55.850> yeah<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> really

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
cans even a little click it you can't

cans even a little click it you can't
jump<00:02:25.030> onto<00:02:25.420> hooks<00:02:25.540> it's<00:02:25.780> like<00:02:25.930> this<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> big

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
jump onto hooks it's like this a big

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.059 
jump onto hooks it's like this a big
cubed<00:02:26.890> barrier<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:29.140> when<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.349> say<00:02:29.530> cubed<00:02:29.890> I

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
cubed barrier and when I say cubed I

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.789 
cubed barrier and when I say cubed I
mean<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.459> whole<00:02:30.840> section<00:02:31.840> thing<00:02:32.290> here<00:02:32.560> is

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
mean this whole section thing here is

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.039 
mean this whole section thing here is
all<00:02:33.040> one<00:02:33.250> cube<00:02:33.610> because<00:02:34.360> like<00:02:34.599> you<00:02:34.750> can't<00:02:34.989> even

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
all one cube because like you can't even

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.170 
all one cube because like you can't even
walk<00:02:35.290> them<00:02:35.530> between<00:02:35.769> it's<00:02:36.220> this<00:02:36.370> one<00:02:36.640> barrier

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
walk them between it's this one barrier

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.050 
walk them between it's this one barrier
and<00:02:37.860> even<00:02:38.860> where<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.129> sticks<00:02:39.400> out<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.910> can

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
and even where it sticks out you can

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.910 
and even where it sticks out you can
just<00:02:40.209> walk<00:02:40.390> through<00:02:40.420> where<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:40.989> sticks<00:02:41.260> out<00:02:41.500> so

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
just walk through where it sticks out so

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.350 
just walk through where it sticks out so
it's<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:42.250> like<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.610> big<00:02:42.819> cube<00:02:43.209> bear<00:02:44.079> here<00:02:45.360> like

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
it's just like a big cube bear here like

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.129 
it's just like a big cube bear here like
a<00:02:46.510> little<00:02:47.850> Google<00:02:48.850> print<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.420> map<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:49.840> just

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
a little Google print of the map it just

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.309 
a little Google print of the map it just
shows<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.470> big<00:02:50.799> square<00:02:51.780> ok<00:02:52.780> another<00:02:52.959> way<00:02:53.109> to<00:02:53.170> get

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
shows a big square ok another way to get

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.949 
shows a big square ok another way to get
up<00:02:53.440> on<00:02:53.590> top<00:02:53.709> just<00:02:54.010> walk<00:02:54.220> up<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.639> truck

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
up on top just walk up to this truck

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.479 
up on top just walk up to this truck
it's<00:02:55.959> as<00:02:56.079> simple<00:02:56.230> as<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.950> jump<00:02:57.160> up<00:02:57.280> onto

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
it's as simple as that just jump up onto

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.809 
it's as simple as that just jump up onto
it<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.660> have<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.900> just<00:02:59.889> hit<00:03:00.040> X<00:03:00.280> repeatedly

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
it and you have to just hit X repeatedly

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.470 
it and you have to just hit X repeatedly
tell<00:03:01.480> you're<00:03:01.599> on<00:03:01.660> top<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:03.370> one<00:03:03.579> you<00:03:03.760> can<00:03:03.790> go

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
tell you're on top this one you can go

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.289 
tell you're on top this one you can go
over<00:03:04.540> here<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.280> even<00:03:06.280> jump<00:03:06.609> down<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.090> one

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
over here and even jump down to this one

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.220 
over here and even jump down to this one
and<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:09.790> can<00:03:09.819> jump<00:03:10.329> back<00:03:10.569> it's<00:03:10.870> kind<00:03:11.109> of<00:03:11.170> a
