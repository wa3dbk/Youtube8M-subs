comes<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.210> white<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.520> then<00:00:59.520> you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
comes out white and then you can see the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.840 
comes out white and then you can see the
the<00:01:03.510> color<00:01:03.780> particles<00:01:04.260> are<00:01:06.439> meant<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.850> change

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.030 

now<00:01:17.950> I<00:01:18.220> think<00:01:18.670> this<00:01:19.000> is<00:01:19.150> really<00:01:19.330> good<00:01:19.630> as<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.650> BB

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
now I think this is really good as a BB

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.610 
now I think this is really good as a BB
cream<00:01:21.160> because<00:01:21.490> it's<00:01:21.670> moisturizing<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:23.170> got

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
cream because it's moisturizing it's got

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.340 
cream because it's moisturizing it's got
good<00:01:23.860> color<00:01:24.340> coverage<00:01:24.970> without<00:01:25.210> being<00:01:25.720> too

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
good color coverage without being too

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:35.520 
good color coverage without being too
heavy<00:01:26.650> of<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:27.690> foundation<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:35.080> it<00:01:35.320> goes

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
heavy of a foundation and and it goes

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.160 
heavy of a foundation and and it goes
really<00:01:35.770> nicely<00:01:36.010> on<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.670> skin<00:01:37.050> however<00:01:38.050> the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
really nicely on the skin however the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.520 
really nicely on the skin however the
only<00:01:38.580> bad<00:01:39.580> side<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:40.300> is<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.690> it's<00:01:41.410> really

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
only bad side to it is that it's really

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.760 
only bad side to it is that it's really
really<00:01:42.070> dark<00:01:42.280> on<00:01:42.640> my<00:01:42.820> skin<00:01:43.090> as<00:01:43.180> you<00:01:43.300> can<00:01:43.450> say

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
really dark on my skin as you can say

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.030 
really dark on my skin as you can say
you've<00:01:44.770> got<00:01:44.800> that<00:01:45.190> orange<00:01:45.400> line<00:01:46.410> which<00:01:47.410> if<00:01:47.740> you

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
you've got that orange line which if you

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.560 
you've got that orange line which if you
don't<00:01:48.070> like<00:01:48.430> orange<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:50.280> isn't<00:01:51.280> great<00:01:51.790> now

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
don't like orange and isn't great now

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.170 
don't like orange and isn't great now
they<00:01:52.900> don't<00:01:53.080> have<00:01:53.259> a<00:01:53.650> lighter<00:01:54.520> one<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:54.790> went<00:01:55.030> in

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
they don't have a lighter one I went in

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.760 
they don't have a lighter one I went in
again<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.660> see<00:01:55.810> if<00:01:55.840> they<00:01:56.020> had<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.170> writer<00:01:56.470> one

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
again to see if they had a writer one

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.070 
again to see if they had a writer one
that<00:01:57.280> would<00:01:57.400> match<00:01:57.580> my<00:01:57.610> skin<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.330> they<00:01:58.750> didn't

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
that would match my skin and they didn't

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.719 
that would match my skin and they didn't
they<00:01:59.229> only<00:01:59.380> have<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.740> in<00:01:59.830> three<00:02:00.070> shades<00:02:00.369> one

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
they only have it in three shades one

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.640 
they only have it in three shades one
two<00:02:00.970> three<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:02.050> I<00:02:02.140> think<00:02:02.200> this<00:02:02.440> is<00:02:02.500> the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
two three and I think this is the

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.920 
two three and I think this is the
lighter<00:02:02.979> one<00:02:03.420> because<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.479> mean<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:04.840> think

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
lighter one because I mean I think

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.130 
lighter one because I mean I think
because<00:02:05.619> she<00:02:06.100> wouldn't<00:02:06.280> give<00:02:06.520> me<00:02:06.550> this<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
because she wouldn't give me this the

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.660 
because she wouldn't give me this the
darker<00:02:08.530> one<00:02:08.679> or<00:02:08.920> anything<00:02:09.280> she<00:02:09.459> would<00:02:09.550> have

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
darker one or anything she would have

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.160 
darker one or anything she would have
given<00:02:09.820> me<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.149> lightest<00:02:10.479> one<00:02:10.630> I<00:02:10.660> think<00:02:10.780> I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
given me the lightest one I think I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.070 
given me the lightest one I think I
don't<00:02:11.920> ya<00:02:12.130> one<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.850> lighter<00:02:13.030> one<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:14.700> and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
don't ya one to the lighter one and and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.810 
don't ya one to the lighter one and and
I<00:02:18.150> think<00:02:19.150> hopefully<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.560> summer<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.340> get

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
I think hopefully in the summer I get

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.300 
I think hopefully in the summer I get
more<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.209> town<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.750> go<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> bit<00:02:23.320> more<00:02:23.560> Brown<00:02:23.769> and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
more of a town I go a bit more Brown and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.130 
more of a town I go a bit more Brown and
I<00:02:26.100> would<00:02:27.100> wear<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.550> hopefully<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:28.450> wouldn't<00:02:29.019> be

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
I would wear it hopefully it wouldn't be

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.960 
I would wear it hopefully it wouldn't be
too<00:02:29.320> dark<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.800> my<00:02:29.950> skin<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.250> think<00:02:30.549> because<00:02:30.850> you

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
too dark on my skin I think because you

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.210 
too dark on my skin I think because you
know<00:02:31.120> my<00:02:31.690> skin<00:02:31.959> is<00:02:32.080> very<00:02:32.260> pale<00:02:32.620> at<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.860> minute

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
know my skin is very pale at the minute

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.160 
know my skin is very pale at the minute
because<00:02:33.730> we<00:02:33.850> haven't<00:02:34.120> quite<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.330> lot<00:02:34.480> son<00:02:34.870> until

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
because we haven't quite a lot son until

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.920 
because we haven't quite a lot son until
now<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.880> hasn't<00:02:37.090> really<00:02:37.390> changed<00:02:37.510> color<00:02:38.080> and

so<00:02:40.930> that's<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.980> only<00:02:42.040> downside<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.820> it<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.090> if

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.010 
and I think and the BB cream was 8 12
pounds<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.690> think<00:03:48.020> and<00:03:48.320> this<00:03:48.670> was<00:03:49.670> eight<00:03:50.540> pounds

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
pounds I think and this was eight pounds

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.979 
pounds I think and this was eight pounds
or<00:03:51.170> it's<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.470> other<00:03:51.590> way<00:03:51.770> when<00:03:51.890> I'm<00:03:52.989> I'm

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
or it's the other way when I'm I'm

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.690 
or it's the other way when I'm I'm
pretty<00:03:54.290> sure<00:03:54.440> this<00:03:54.620> would<00:03:54.770> be<00:03:54.860> eight<00:03:55.069> pounds<00:03:55.520> i

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
pretty sure this would be eight pounds i

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.310 
pretty sure this would be eight pounds i
think<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.950> i<00:03:58.270> love<00:03:59.270> it<00:03:59.390> as<00:03:59.540> you<00:03:59.630> can<00:03:59.780> see<00:04:00.020> I've

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
think and i love it as you can see I've

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.199 
think and i love it as you can see I've
used<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.950> lot<00:04:01.280> of<00:04:01.580> this<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.840> think<00:04:03.170> I<00:04:04.209> wanted

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
used a lot of this and I think I wanted

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.509 
used a lot of this and I think I wanted
something<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.690> would<00:04:05.930> set<00:04:06.320> my<00:04:07.280> foundation

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
something that would set my foundation

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.870 
something that would set my foundation
and<00:04:08.480> I<00:04:08.900> think<00:04:09.200> this<00:04:09.380> is<00:04:09.530> such<00:04:09.800> it's<00:04:10.430> just<00:04:10.670> such

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
and I think this is such it's just such

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.330 
and I think this is such it's just such
a<00:04:10.910> great<00:04:11.120> powder<00:04:11.630> I<00:04:12.170> really<00:04:12.650> like<00:04:12.830> it<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.280> you

a great powder I really like it and you
know<00:04:14.000> what<00:04:14.239> I<00:04:14.269> think<00:04:14.600> I<00:04:14.720> could<00:04:14.959> wear<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.320> BB

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
know what I think I could wear the BB

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.610 
know what I think I could wear the BB
cream<00:04:15.950> with<00:04:16.820> this<00:04:17.030> powder<00:04:17.329> because<00:04:18.140> it<00:04:18.410> makes

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
cream with this powder because it makes

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.400 
cream with this powder because it makes
it<00:04:18.859> Matt<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:19.730> it<00:04:20.180> goes<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.419> bit<00:04:20.720> more<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.230> my

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
it Matt and it goes a bit more to my

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.520 
it Matt and it goes a bit more to my
skin<00:04:21.709> color<00:04:21.890> see<00:04:22.340> I've<00:04:22.430> done<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.730> there<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.530> it

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
skin color see I've done it there and it

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.610 
skin color see I've done it there and it
just<00:04:24.830> makes<00:04:25.100> it<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.400> little<00:04:25.430> bit<00:04:25.820> less<00:04:26.000> darker

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
just makes it a little bit less darker

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.320 
just makes it a little bit less darker
for<00:04:27.620> that<00:04:27.770> reason<00:04:28.360> it's<00:04:29.360> a<00:04:29.630> double<00:04:30.380> function<00:04:30.650> I

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
for that reason it's a double function I

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.840 
for that reason it's a double function I
use<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:32.630> as<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.840> foundation<00:04:33.410> on<00:04:33.740> its<00:04:33.919> own<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.370> it

use it as a foundation on its own and it

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.810 
use it as a foundation on its own and it
is<00:04:35.000> such<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.360> great<00:04:35.600> foundation<00:04:36.130> because<00:04:37.130> it

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
is such a great foundation because it

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.690 
is such a great foundation because it
gives<00:04:39.100> it<00:04:40.100> just<00:04:40.160> gives<00:04:40.580> great<00:04:41.510> coverage<00:04:42.700> it's
