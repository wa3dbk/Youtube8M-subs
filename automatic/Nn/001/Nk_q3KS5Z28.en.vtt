00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.830
 being always the same is the woman 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.620
 It's worth three euros with 95 and good as 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.290
 other months because it comes pretty chubby 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.740

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.950

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.490
 they are not all of the uip in the same way 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.530
 but that each race has a way 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.730
 different I bought myself the black ones 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.980
 because I like black pasta and because 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.520
 I like it this way and well 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.300

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.990
 Many of you told me that in you 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.770

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.870

 they come in in your kiosks and you 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.940
 I have to say that some gifts are 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.280
 they get according to the autonomous communities or 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.540
 be that for example in the magazine woman 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.570

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.270
 better in your cities because it does not come 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.280
 but it's not because they were wrong 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.680
 but because they do so in some 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.440
 communities come and in others they do not 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.450

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.590
 Sometimes we benefit but good 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.390
