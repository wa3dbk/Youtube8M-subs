white<00:03:08.410> where<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.739> was<00:03:08.830> meant<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.100> go<00:03:09.160> but<00:03:09.550> he

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
white where it was meant to go but he

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.740 
white where it was meant to go but he
still<00:03:09.790> managed<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.090> pick<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.390> up<00:03:10.510> on<00:03:10.630> the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
still managed to pick it up on the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.840 
still managed to pick it up on the
bounce<00:03:11.760> wonderful<00:03:12.760> flick<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:15.370> efficient<00:03:15.790> the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
bounce wonderful flick so efficient the

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.280
