who<00:00:11.849> are<00:00:11.940> unfamiliar<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.780> what<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.500> traffic

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
who are unfamiliar with what a traffic

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.000 
who are unfamiliar with what a traffic
exchange<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:15.059> I'm<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.650> sharing<00:00:16.920> that

with you as well

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.929 
with you as well
now<00:00:18.660> traffic<00:00:19.050> exchange<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.859> basically<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> site

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
now traffic exchange is basically a site

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.800 
now traffic exchange is basically a site
where<00:00:21.859> members<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.850> own<00:00:24.119> different<00:00:24.630> web

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
where members that own different web

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.720 
where members that own different web
sites<00:00:25.080> decide<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.920> join<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.430> traffic

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
sites decide to join that traffic

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.150 
sites decide to join that traffic
exchange<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.720> they<00:00:27.869> decide<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.590> they're

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
exchange and they decide that they're

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.990 
exchange and they decide that they're
going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.550> view<00:00:30.090> each<00:00:30.449> other's<00:00:30.929> websites<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
going to view each other's websites and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.870 
going to view each other's websites and
usually<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.420> happens<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.489> site<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.670> run

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
usually what happens is the site is run

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.350 
usually what happens is the site is run
by<00:00:36.059> an<00:00:36.239> administrator<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.370> they<00:00:38.370> set<00:00:38.700> up<00:00:38.940> what

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
by an administrator and they set up what

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.950 
by an administrator and they set up what
is<00:00:39.719> called<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.649> site<00:00:41.129> rotator<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> site

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
is called a site rotator now the site

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.369 
is called a site rotator now the site
rotator<00:00:43.590> basically<00:00:44.370> rotates<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:46.050> sites

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
rotator basically rotates the the sites

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.880 
rotator basically rotates the the sites
of<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.920> different<00:00:47.309> members<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.379> traffic

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
of the different members in the traffic

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.970 
of the different members in the traffic
exchange<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.090> earn<00:00:51.449> credits<00:00:52.020> by<00:00:52.410> viewing

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
exchange so you earn credits by viewing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.930 
exchange so you earn credits by viewing
other<00:00:53.190> people's<00:00:54.120> websites<00:00:54.739> okay<00:00:55.770> now<00:00:56.160> some

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
other people's websites okay now some

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.229 
other people's websites okay now some
traffic<00:00:57.440> exchanges<00:00:58.440> are<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:59.280> intense

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
traffic exchanges are really intense

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.170 
traffic exchanges are really intense
they<00:01:00.600> involve<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.320> doing<00:01:01.770> math<00:01:02.100> putting<00:01:03.000> in

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
they involve you doing math putting in

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.119 
they involve you doing math putting in
codes<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.350> prove<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.680> you're<00:01:04.890> still

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
codes to prove that you're still

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.750 
codes to prove that you're still
watching<00:01:05.990> but<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.229> some<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.369> easy

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
watching but then some are really easy

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.969

one of the easiest and I think one of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.670 
one of the easiest and I think one of
the<00:01:13.890> best<00:01:14.130> performing<00:01:15.170> traffic<00:01:16.170> exchange

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
the best performing traffic exchange

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.120 
the best performing traffic exchange
sites<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.540> I'm<00:01:18.540> actually<00:01:18.840> providing<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.770> link

promote would be

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.350 
promote would be
and<00:02:13.090> then<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.960> earn<00:02:14.230> credits<00:02:15.040> by<00:02:15.820> basically

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
and then you earn credits by basically
