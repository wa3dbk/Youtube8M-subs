00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.210
 simply today simply not enough 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.860
 first too passive then we want 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.870
 we had the ball too easy 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.859
 returned second half time 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.180
 we stood better but could still 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.740
 unfortunately not so much with the ball today 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.300
 do not know how to start 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.019
 unsure where from 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.779
 The came actually have no reason 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.800
 this must now check off the thing and on 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.120
 watch the next game there it goes again 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.590
 to get a threesome and need each other 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.149
 deal with this for a long time now because I 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.610
 played well and it does not continue 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.140
 you have to look the mirror holder and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.309
 say we were just worse 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.530
 Brunswick deservedly won 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.210
 we lost the balls too easily 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.379
 and then in the decisive 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.190
 once the wrong one 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.500
 made a decision 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.879
 we just were not on the show today 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.960
 height in all respects was Brunswick 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.910
 in all respects better and what concerns 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.940
 deserves the defeat easy 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.600
 in a nutshell if you are the first half 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.760
 We have a half-time look 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.360
 addressed 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.619
 too little because passages hardly 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.479
 won battles 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.670
 many ball losses straight in the center 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.560
 or can or second league in 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.590
 Brunswick simply can not compete 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.000
 you have to say it very clearly and now 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.290
 we look to us all the surveys therefore 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.240
 we did not make a lost goal but lost 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.920
 that's football, that's right 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.470
 Did not get what we got 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 have made and forward has us 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.799
 just the punch was missing 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 and that's why the situation is absolute 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.060
 earned 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.150
 but who would not be fitting end 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.409
 that will analyze and be the mistakes 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.820
 then address the week 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.530
 work on it again that weekend 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.479
 make better again we know 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.200
 that we can do it every game 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.909
 otherwise it will be a derby we will 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.710
 analyze the game tomorrow in peace and quiet 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.380
 then it went is that monday at the latest 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.200
 then it has to be out of his mind 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.399
 that we are not here now then 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.910
 finish your home that's too 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.580
 perfectly normal though 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.500
 we have to work on ourselves today 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.180
 or have another week now 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.310
 and then it's next week in the bock 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.470
 we simply bump into paderborn 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.730
 know that you are future team 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.550
 and that we can win games in 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.810
 the second league and that's why us 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.740
 not here in their situation 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.230
 We will bring you out of the railway 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.000
 continue to believe our strengths and 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.980
 then next week a good one again 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.450
 Today we have seen 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.050
 how it will not work and next week 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.050
 do something better
