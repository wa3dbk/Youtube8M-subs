canvas shoes all right so this is my

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.870 
canvas shoes all right so this is my
interpretation<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.309> jeans<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
interpretation of the jeans and a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.030 
interpretation of the jeans and a
t-shirt<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.479> decided<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.110> play<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> t-shirt

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
t-shirt I decided to play up the t-shirt

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.429 
t-shirt I decided to play up the t-shirt
by<00:01:08.220> having<00:01:08.729> an<00:01:08.850> all-over<00:01:09.119> graphic<00:01:09.930> print<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
by having an all-over graphic print I

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.649 
by having an all-over graphic print I
just<00:01:10.890> think<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.240> makes<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> little<00:01:12.510> bit

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
just think that makes it a little bit

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.570 
just think that makes it a little bit
more<00:01:12.840> fun<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.590> keeping<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> simple<00:01:14.250> with

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
more fun and just keeping it simple with

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:44.539 
more fun and just keeping it simple with
some<00:01:14.790> skinny<00:01:15.060> jeans

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.919 

so<00:01:45.549> this<00:01:45.759> is<00:01:45.789> another<00:01:46.090> outfit<00:01:46.509> that<00:01:46.689> you<00:01:46.780> could

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
so this is another outfit that you could

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.029 
so this is another outfit that you could
wear<00:01:47.140> if<00:01:47.229> you<00:01:47.320> want<00:01:47.469> to<00:01:47.530> look<00:01:47.619> more<00:01:47.829> put

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
wear if you want to look more put

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.190

together<00:01:48.159> but<00:01:48.759> this<00:01:48.939> outfit<00:01:49.329> incorporates

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
together but this outfit incorporates

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.859 
together but this outfit incorporates
minor<00:01:50.710> details<00:01:51.219> like<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.850> polka<00:01:52.090> dots<00:01:52.329> on<00:01:52.539> the
