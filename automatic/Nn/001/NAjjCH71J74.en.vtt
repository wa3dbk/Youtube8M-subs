for<00:00:22.010> most<00:00:22.130> of<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.340> floating<00:00:22.520> shots<00:00:22.850> we<00:00:23.510> had

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
for most of the floating shots we had

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.340 
for most of the floating shots we had
two<00:00:24.140> of<00:00:24.350> us<00:00:24.500> holding<00:00:24.980> a<00:00:25.450> 2x4<00:00:26.450> and<00:00:26.690> we<00:00:27.170> were<00:00:27.290> able

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
two of us holding a 2x4 and we were able

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.430 
two of us holding a 2x4 and we were able
to<00:00:27.440> have<00:00:27.950> Zach<00:00:28.400> or<00:00:28.850> myself<00:00:29.360> stand<00:00:29.930> on<00:00:30.110> top<00:00:30.260> of

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
to have Zach or myself stand on top of

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.050 
to have Zach or myself stand on top of
that<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:30.830> then<00:00:31.250> we<00:00:31.310> were<00:00:31.400> able<00:00:31.490> to<00:00:31.670> mask<00:00:31.880> that

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
that and then we were able to mask that

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:46.479 
that and then we were able to mask that
out<00:00:32.330> with<00:00:32.510> our<00:00:32.660> blink<00:00:33.080> sleep<00:00:45.340> percent<00:00:46.340> of<00:00:46.430> the

out with our blink sleep percent of the
green<00:00:46.670> screen<00:00:46.820> over<00:00:47.090> here<00:00:47.300> where<00:00:47.450> Zach's

have<00:00:49.970> a<00:00:50.000> Dahlia<00:00:50.390> on<00:00:50.570> him<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.020> that<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:51.200> looks

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
have a Dahlia on him so that it looks

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.960 
have a Dahlia on him so that it looks
like<00:00:51.559> he's<00:00:51.800> moving<00:00:52.040> even<00:00:52.490> though<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.640> camera

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
like he's moving even though the camera

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.090 
like he's moving even though the camera
is<00:00:53.030> actually<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.420> thing<00:00:53.570> that's<00:00:53.720> moving<00:00:54.100> so

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
is actually the thing that's moving so

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.410 
is actually the thing that's moving so
I'm<00:00:55.220> getting<00:00:55.400> ready<00:00:55.579> to<00:00:55.670> dangle<00:00:55.970> here<00:00:56.270> on<00:00:56.360> the

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
I'm getting ready to dangle here on the

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
try oh there were some shots where we

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.380 
try oh there were some shots where we
had<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.470> track<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.040> background<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.700> paint

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.590 
had to track the background and paint
out<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.890> broomstick<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.400> we<00:01:43.970> were<00:01:44.060> able<00:01:44.420> to

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
out the broomstick and we were able to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.240 
out the broomstick and we were able to
do<00:01:44.690> that<00:01:44.780> with<00:01:44.960> mocha<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.560> after<00:01:45.920> effects

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
do that with mocha and after effects

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.010 
do that with mocha and after effects
when<00:01:46.760> working<00:01:46.940> with<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.270> green-screen<00:01:47.780> you

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
when working with the green-screen you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.300 
when working with the green-screen you
often<00:01:48.320> run<00:01:48.409> into<00:01:48.710> problems<00:01:49.100> such<00:01:49.280> as

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
often run into problems such as

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.120 
often run into problems such as
reflections<00:01:50.180> on<00:01:50.530> reflective<00:01:51.530> items<00:01:51.860> that

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
reflections on reflective items that

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.160 
reflections on reflective items that
will<00:01:52.670> mess<00:01:53.000> up<00:01:53.150> your<00:01:53.210> key<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:53.689> here<00:01:53.869> we<00:01:53.990> have

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
will mess up your key so here we have

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.960 
will mess up your key so here we have
this<00:01:54.320> reflective<00:01:54.770> board<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.340> we're<00:01:55.670> able<00:01:55.760> to

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
this reflective board and we're able to

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.090 
this reflective board and we're able to
get<00:01:56.090> around<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.990> reflection<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.950> green

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
get around the reflection of the green

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.160 
get around the reflection of the green
screen<00:01:58.250> by<00:01:58.640> rotoscoping<00:01:59.390> so<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.720> roto<00:01:59.930> tool

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
screen by rotoscoping so the roto tool

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.480 
screen by rotoscoping so the roto tool
is<00:02:00.320> something<00:02:00.409> that<00:02:00.650> hey<00:02:00.920> don't<00:02:01.220> use<00:02:01.400> that

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
is something that hey don't use that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.070 
is something that hey don't use that
often<00:02:01.670> but<00:02:02.060> this<00:02:02.240> time<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:02.479> was<00:02:02.630> able<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.810> find<00:02:02.990> a

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
often but this time I was able to find a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.840 
often but this time I was able to find a
pretty<00:02:03.259> good<00:02:03.409> use<00:02:03.590> for<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:04.100> rotoscope<00:02:04.369> tool

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
pretty good use for the rotoscope tool

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.880 
pretty good use for the rotoscope tool
and<00:02:05.240> now<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.780> back<00:02:06.049> plate<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:06.320> we<00:02:06.530> added

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
and now the back plate that we added

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.880 
and now the back plate that we added
this<00:02:07.040> shot<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:07.670> was<00:02:08.269> actually<00:02:08.600> still<00:02:08.869> shot<00:02:09.200> but

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
this shot to was actually still shot but

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.380 
this shot to was actually still shot but
we<00:02:10.040> were<00:02:10.130> able<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.519> add<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.790> little<00:02:11.120> bit<00:02:11.209> more

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
we were able to add a little bit more

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.570 
we were able to add a little bit more
realism<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.170> shot<00:02:12.410> by<00:02:12.920> not<00:02:13.100> only<00:02:13.190> adding<00:02:13.519> a

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
realism to the shot by not only adding a

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.850 
realism to the shot by not only adding a
camera<00:02:13.940> shake<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:14.570> also<00:02:14.690> use<00:02:14.959> projection

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
camera shake we also use projection

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.590 
camera shake we also use projection
mapping<00:02:16.280> which<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:16.970> have<00:02:17.060> tutorial<00:02:17.420> if<00:02:17.540> you

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
mapping which I have tutorial if you

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.750 
mapping which I have tutorial if you
want<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.810> check<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:17.989> out<00:02:18.079> and<00:02:18.489> we<00:02:19.489> were<00:02:19.579> able<00:02:19.700> to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
want to check it out and we were able to

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.520 
want to check it out and we were able to
a<00:02:19.820> different<00:02:20.299> perspective<00:02:20.510> changes<00:02:21.260> when<00:02:21.410> our

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
a different perspective changes when our

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.229 
a different perspective changes when our
camera<00:02:21.860> shook<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:22.640> although<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.030> looks<00:02:23.150> a

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
camera shook so although it looks a

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.819 
camera shook so although it looks a
little<00:02:23.299> bit<00:02:23.450> intimidating<00:02:24.019> it's<00:02:24.470> actually

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
little bit intimidating it's actually

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.259 
little bit intimidating it's actually
not<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.100> difficult<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.060> check<00:02:26.180> it

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
not that difficult in you and check it

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.190 
not that difficult in you and check it
out<00:02:26.390> on<00:02:26.600> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
out on the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.530 
out on the
so<00:02:28.800> for<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.040> shot<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.460> Zack<00:02:29.700> floating<00:02:30.150> across

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
so for the shot of Zack floating across

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.720 
so for the shot of Zack floating across
the<00:02:30.780> entire<00:02:31.020> pool<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.920> set<00:02:32.280> him<00:02:32.400> up<00:02:32.490> in<00:02:32.580> front

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the entire pool we set him up in front

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.770 
the entire pool we set him up in front
of<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.880> screen<00:02:33.090> screen<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.480> was<00:02:33.570> standing

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
of the screen screen I was standing

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.450 
of the screen screen I was standing
behind<00:02:33.870> them<00:02:34.230> holding<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.710> pole<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.280> would

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
behind them holding this pole that would

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.000 
behind them holding this pole that would
allow<00:02:35.670> his<00:02:35.880> feet<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.270> be<00:02:36.420> sticking<00:02:37.380> out<00:02:37.530> then

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
allow his feet to be sticking out then

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.710 
allow his feet to be sticking out then
we<00:02:38.100> had<00:02:38.280> him<00:02:38.430> run<00:02:38.610> across<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.000> pool<00:02:39.210> with<00:02:39.540> this

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
we had him run across the pool with this

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.720 
we had him run across the pool with this
stick<00:02:40.020> making<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.860> splash<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> water<00:02:41.430> that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
stick making a splash in the water that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.030 
stick making a splash in the water that
we<00:02:41.820> later<00:02:42.030> Compton<00:02:42.630> we<00:02:43.080> also<00:02:43.230> had<00:02:43.500> Zack<00:02:43.830> run

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
we later Compton we also had Zack run

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.620

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
tracking dye which I used to actually

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.980 
tracking dye which I used to actually
match<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.090> motion<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:48.540> we<00:02:48.570> get<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.780> very

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
match the motion then we get a very

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.600 
match the motion then we get a very
organic<00:02:49.410> feel<00:02:49.800> we<00:02:50.040> have<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:50.340> tracking

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
organic feel we have this tracking

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.060 
organic feel we have this tracking
