00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.990
 the first step to achieve this year 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.540
 in art spread a black enamel a 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.279
 single color all nails not enamel 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.279
 it must necessarily be opaque 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.449
 then choose a bright color like a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.100
 blue pink or yellow and roll it out 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.469
 inside the black outline 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.010
 don't worry about covering the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.010
 upper edge 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.680
 to completely eliminate traces of 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.220
 black enamel I'm going to perform a second one 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.220
 past 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.549
 once the colored nail polish 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.159
 dry I go to resume the enamel 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.329
 black and design the top edge in 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.329
 correspondence of the bezel 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.390
 finally with a glaze from the art 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.580
 thin white tip I go to 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.580
 draw the details on the nail 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.550
 to make the idea of ​​the reflection 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.410
 on the nail I draw an elongated drop 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.310
 and a small dot on one of the two 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.310
 nail villages 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.090
