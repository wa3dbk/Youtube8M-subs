00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.680 
had one in a long time it's a redheaded
feisty<00:02:02.340> little<00:02:02.490> princess<00:02:03.000> right<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.570> she

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
feisty little princess right and she

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.910

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.970 
so I think it catches everybody you know
emotionally<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.170> think<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.830> the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
emotionally and I think that this is the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.280 
emotionally and I think that this is the
perfect<00:02:18.480> attraction<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.569> put<00:02:19.780> into<00:02:20.019> paradise
