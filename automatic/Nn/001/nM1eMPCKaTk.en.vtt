00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.410
 There are several Argentine provinces that 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.139
 are affected by the flood of the river 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.719
 parana but the most affected of all 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.690
 they are current we are in 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.519
 itati and you saw before the break 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.660
 an advance of Perin blanket that 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.039

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.960

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.830

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.750
 civil municipalities that come together to 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.359
 help two cities steps from the homeland 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.720
 itati and this is the report of our 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.720
 special envoys 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.850
 30 years ago we are doing the trimming 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.399
 from the river 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.129
 but the water was already very close and not 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.109
 we have to wait to get out he gets to 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.579
 the house overboard last year arrived 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.320
 up to the height of the door 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.969
 and now this year we do not wait when 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.760
 we say that the water is approaching nothing 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.829
 we look for we speak with intendant and we 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.309
 He sent the truck and we brought the 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.759
 things 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:10.649
 the unusual flood of the parana already flooded 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:13.689
 the riparian zone on the coast in itatí 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.990
 Corrientes town famous for the 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.509
 virgin and its basilica destiny of thousands of 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.149
 pilgrims who visit the city year after year 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.350
 place we are having evacuated in the 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:29.310
 municipal hall of itatí and in different 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.100
 hostels in the town of itatí 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.799
 It is quite complicated at the moment 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.659
 the situation we are waiting for the peak 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.689
 of the rising for Sunday that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.579
 it would be 7 meters to 8 while the neighborhood 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.820
 most harmed is the Uighur neighborhood there 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.720
 where the jobs are being done 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.720
 of evacuation for people 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.850
 it would not be the coming the waterfront the more 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.120
 complicated but the neighborhoods surrounding 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.640
 river coast locals 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.680
 prepare to receive the maximum peak of 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.890
 the flood in the next few hours 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.580
 I have my children, my lady 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.390
 and I see the launch and we saw the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.510
 fishing is very much in our work 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.209
 everyone 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.720
 routine work we do and now it 's 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.519
 stopped 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.310
 and now we stand by the Xunta 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.879
 River's growing families and salts 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.909
 I stay here to the house until 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.909

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.319
