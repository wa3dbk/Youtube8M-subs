00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.560
 walk such I am so feminine and this time 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:06.999
 we are here to talk about a topic that I 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.440
 I know that many are starting this 

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:10.900
 moment especially those that just give 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.610
 an opportunity for the end 4 and as 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.560
 they are going in what the marketing hard 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.570
 life with the spiral in a way and 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.940
 It will also come out what is call of duty 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.350
 wow fans I think it's pronounced so 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.630
 I really want to talk about the 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.700
 point of view what I have lived the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.380
 good game experience really me 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.699
 I did not play, I did not have the opportunity to 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.670
 play exclusive because there are many that 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.140
 they rate it that I'm not really going to 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.969
 Give the opportunity to play really 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.829
 they do not give it true anymore 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.719
 well I think I'm going to tell you that it was a 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.449
 most player he had from milestone bus and 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.850
 really albertis friends told me that 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.039
 see the rose and it has been pension and that all 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.229
 this thing but you do not have to say it for 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.429
 week for the virtual by the way for 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.469
 what you think of giving the 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.269
 opportunity to film live or buy 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.409
 the two but for the people who do not have 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.409
 money just like me 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.390
 really see the trailers of 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.370
 multiplayer because I know a lot 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.890
 people buy what games for him 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.230
 you have to choose everything we all buy the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.310
 bowling by the multi there was really 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.020
 lately I almost did not pass the modes 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.430
 story I do not know why really 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.470
 I only gave myself with the multiplayer 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.620
 and when they do not have internet put by 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.410
 timor ok but really the 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.810
 opportunity to 24 must say the good 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.870
 and the really bad thing to me what I still 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.850
 all I was shocked is that that clip is that 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.950
 we are giving a part simply of 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
 what's left is enough frozen 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.390
 and that's something normal in the game be it 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.370
 if you are a player for 54th place 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.890
 should sound these trips that will give you 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.840
 whenever you are doing the best 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.670
 destiny departures and that is not a 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.250
 problem in your internal connections and 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.630
 those those problems in barrel 4 a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.550
 least I did not like it was that bar 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.680
 spinal taras so fast the hard light 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.720
 in fact she delayed what was her 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.910
 departure but I really never liked that 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.500
 they will pull out so fast to reflect the 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.360
 jce and do not go to repair what were the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.370
 errors game of his first game 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.530
 just for making it logical competence 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.200
 the call of duty and really in it 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.090
 they protect one we press 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.129
 a pretty good game mode for the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.670
 people who like fighting and how 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:17.470
 wants to live the experience of being a 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.060
 soldier because really for the people 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.890
 who likes to be killing up was without 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.050
 rachitas really the bar defined for 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.720
 they really I think I give the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.120
 opportunity this year place the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.099
 opportunity what is obviously the call 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.140
 of progress advances war has really 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.030
 seemed like a really great game 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.819
 they say it's a copy of you townhall of 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.459
 that to see that really put then not 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.959
 they like I do not know why simply if 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.670
 we have not tested it first of all 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.459
 we have to play it see how only 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.230
 control the movements and all this for 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.269
 really know if we will like it or not 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.430
 I really select what to cook 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.580
 this game let's hope and do not disappoint me 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.040
 I really do not know how 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.950
 hard life I did not like much if Ã¡lvarez and 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.390
 watching it through the trailer and 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.610
 all those things has not called me much 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.010
 the attention to change what is this 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.840
 call of duty which is that it has something 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.820
 innovative because really special 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.290
 halloween duty so there are not many people 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.960
 that criticizes why there are people who 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.120
 criticizes that because not as des with 66 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.150
 opinion to see how we can say this is not 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.920
 reinvent not surprisingly and justly 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.080
 when our in the new call of duty 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.810
 dilemma of appropriating a copy I do not know 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.370
 which is really unrealistic because it is 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.490
 You know that people can never have 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.160
 glad to true proved no more than everything 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.350
 I think it's the call of duty opportunity 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.060
 advance wars and obviously for 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.670
 playstation3 because I was I do not have the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.560
 consoles because I'm poor 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.090
 and hopefully good to see how not 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.920
 you really detect us in those 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.870
 moments then barrels good for 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.260
 say no but the expensive multi white 2 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.750
 also but not good but comparing 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.030
 for the congost it was much better for the 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.280
 that I say that he exceeded it in everything 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.590
 true because really already according to what 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.860
 they say in pisco golf 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.150
 it was bad can not it was a bad game for 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.910
 say it some way because really 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.400
 I have the opportunity to convert 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.160
 and well, really wait for the 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.170
 digital 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.269
 vanguard version of barney finn 4 and 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.250
 let's put it to destination I think it's 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.600
 pronounce like this let's get into this car 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.799
 game really let's see what 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.150
 we look forward to these two games 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.100
 If they want some more advance 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.300
 detailed about all that yes they want 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.770
 that speaks a little more two about this 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.590
 topic can give you comments here 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.590
 coming back in a next video bye bye
