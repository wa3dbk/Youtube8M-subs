high-end<00:00:36.840> system<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.480> see<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
high-end system so as you can see the

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.610

the<00:00:41.550> computers<00:00:42.000> installed<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.960> big

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the computers installed in this big

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.369 
the computers installed in this big
Thermaltake<00:00:44.460> speedo<00:00:44.850> case<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:46.140> really

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
Thermaltake speedo case which really

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.200 
Thermaltake speedo case which really
helps<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.149> computer<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.800> cool<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.210> that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
helps this computer to cool and that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.069 
helps this computer to cool and that
temperature<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.110> really<00:00:52.649> low<00:00:53.149> even<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
temperature is really low even the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.069 
temperature is really low even the
system<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> highly<00:00:56.550> overclock<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
system is a highly overclock so the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.009 
system is a highly overclock so the
system<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.469> powered<00:00:58.829> by<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.329> 7i<00:01:00.980> 920<00:01:01.980> Intel<00:01:02.399> CPU

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
overclock 23.8 new Hertz there are three

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.010 
overclock 23.8 new Hertz there are three
modules<00:01:07.260> each<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.340> 2gig<00:01:09.530> ddr3<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.720> here's<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
modules each of 2gig ddr3 and here's the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.980 
modules each of 2gig ddr3 and here's the
funny<00:01:13.470> thing<00:01:13.560> their<00:01:14.130> crossfire<00:01:15.090> setup<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.750> lot

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
funny thing their crossfire setup a lot

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.499 
funny thing their crossfire setup a lot
to<00:01:16.549> HD<00:01:17.750> 5870<00:01:19.130> middle<00:01:20.130> cards<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.330> is

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
to HD 5870 middle cards so this is

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.070 
to HD 5870 middle cards so this is
really<00:01:21.869> fast<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:23.270> here<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> power<00:01:24.659> supply

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
really fast and here is the power supply

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.219 
really fast and here is the power supply
as<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.159> see<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.850> huge<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.479> 1.1

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
as you can see it's really huge it's 1.1

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.859 
as you can see it's really huge it's 1.1
kilowatt<00:01:28.680> power<00:01:28.829> supply<00:01:29.400> which<00:01:30.329> provides

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
kilowatt power supply which provides

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
kilowatt power supply which provides
more<00:01:31.049> than<00:01:31.229> enough<00:01:31.530> juice<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.520> system

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
more than enough juice for this system

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.140 
more than enough juice for this system
to<00:01:33.240> run<00:01:33.360> stable<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.049> smooth<00:01:34.549> I'm<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.850> sure<00:01:36.000> if

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
to run stable and smooth I'm not sure if

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.960 
to run stable and smooth I'm not sure if
you<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> actual<00:01:37.500> SSD<00:01:38.220> setup<00:01:38.729> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
you can see but the actual SSD setup is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.460 
you can see but the actual SSD setup is
right<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.590> as<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.490> see<00:01:42.350> there<00:01:43.350> are

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
right here so as you can see there are

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.230 
right here so as you can see there are
two<00:01:44.570> SSD<00:01:45.570> drives<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.409> as<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.950> said<00:01:47.240> they're

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
two SSD drives and as I said they're

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.520 
two SSD drives and as I said they're
both<00:01:48.479> 80<00:01:48.869> gig<00:01:49.320> Intel<00:01:49.890> x.25<00:01:50.880> drives<00:01:51.320> also<00:01:52.320> on

both 80 gig Intel x.25 drives also on
the<00:01:52.649> system<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.250> ran<00:01:53.520> another<00:01:54.299> raid

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659

gigabyte hard drives and there can
install<00:02:01.020> here<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.460> let's<00:02:03.060> go<00:02:03.210> back<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.509> Windows

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170

and<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.369> see<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.790> little<00:02:05.880> boot<00:02:06.180> up

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and as you can see it's a little boot up

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.800 
and as you can see it's a little boot up
and<00:02:06.920> let<00:02:07.920> me<00:02:08.069> show<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.789> lunch<00:02:09.209> actually<00:02:09.420> few

and let me show you a lunch actually few
applications<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.470> you'll<00:02:11.160> see<00:02:11.430> how<00:02:11.610> fast

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
applications and you'll see how fast

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.930 
applications and you'll see how fast
this<00:02:12.090> is

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
this is

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.860

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970

Sun<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.570> really<00:03:36.019> boost<00:03:36.590> boost<00:03:37.370> the

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
Sun and really boost boost the

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.110 
Sun and really boost boost the
performance<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.810> watch<00:03:39.049> they<00:03:39.320> stay<00:03:39.650> no<00:03:40.120> it's

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
performance so watch they stay no it's

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.190 
performance so watch they stay no it's
connecting<00:03:41.769> so<00:03:42.769> as<00:03:43.070> I<00:03:44.060> said<00:03:44.390> this<00:03:44.570> is<00:03:44.630> not<00:03:44.930> on<00:03:45.110> a

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
connecting so as I said this is not on a

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.940 
connecting so as I said this is not on a
SSD<00:03:45.709> on<00:03:45.980> button<00:03:46.610> regular<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.989> 500<00:03:48.620> gigabyte

hard<00:03:48.980> drives<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:50.049> really<00:03:51.049> goes<00:03:51.290> fast

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
hard drives and really goes fast

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.580

Oh

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.700 

I<00:03:55.620> guess<00:03:56.310> they'll<00:03:56.489> bill
