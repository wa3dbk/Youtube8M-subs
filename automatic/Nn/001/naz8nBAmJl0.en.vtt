start<00:01:33.840> running<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.350> ideas<00:01:34.560> because<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> can

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
start running out of ideas because I can

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.460 
start running out of ideas because I can
only<00:01:35.579> share<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.270> many<00:01:36.450> tips<00:01:36.720> before<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> start

chance<00:02:33.570> because<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.290> know<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.560> moves

chance because you know the moves
they're<00:02:34.920> gonna<00:02:35.040> make<00:02:35.280> as<00:02:35.550> they're<00:02:36.540> making

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
to rock out with the V set this thing is

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.790 
to rock out with the V set this thing is
just<00:02:45.030> crazy<00:02:45.360> for<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:46.290> other<00:02:46.440> high<00:02:46.560> kill

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
just crazy for the other high kill

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.410 
just crazy for the other high kill
streaks<00:02:47.010> like<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.250> k-9<00:02:47.580> unit<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.090> swarm

I<00:02:48.660> really<00:02:49.170> don't<00:02:49.320> think<00:02:49.410> they're<00:02:49.680> as

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
I really don't think they're as

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.770 
I really don't think they're as
necessary<00:02:50.490> because<00:02:50.790> every<00:02:51.090> time<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.300> get<00:02:51.480> them

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
necessary because every time I get them

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.080 
necessary because every time I get them
the<00:02:52.470> enemy<00:02:52.770> team<00:02:52.950> backs<00:02:53.220> out<00:02:53.490> so<00:02:53.700> they<00:02:53.820> get<00:02:53.910> no

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
the enemy team backs out so they get no

the enemy team backs out so they get no
kills<00:02:54.360> at<00:02:54.480> all<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.840> they're<00:02:54.990> just<00:02:55.110> kind<00:02:55.260> of

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
kills at all and they're just kind of

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.170 
kills at all and they're just kind of
pointless<00:02:55.860> when<00:02:56.430> you're<00:02:56.580> using<00:02:56.760> like<00:02:56.970> lower

kill streaks enemies don't tend it back
out<00:02:59.160> as<00:02:59.340> often<00:02:59.790> because<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.900> not<00:03:01.110> as

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
they're definitely more likely to back

they're definitely more likely to back
out<00:03:08.130> just<00:03:08.160> because<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.000> much<00:03:09.120> more

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
out just because it's so much more

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.210

and<00:03:12.180> with<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.510> stealth<00:03:12.720> chopper<00:03:12.990> it's<00:03:13.710> super

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
and with the stealth chopper it's super

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.830 
and with the stealth chopper it's super
good<00:03:14.190> because<00:03:14.490> it<00:03:14.640> flies<00:03:14.820> in<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> air<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
good because it flies in the air and the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.360 
good because it flies in the air and the
enemies<00:03:16.170> can't<00:03:16.440> see<00:03:16.740> it<00:03:16.800> on<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.010> mini-map<00:03:17.280> to

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
enemies can't see it on the mini-map to

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.160 
enemies can't see it on the mini-map to
take<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.760> out<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:18.570> racks<00:03:18.960> up<00:03:19.140> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
take it out and it just racks up the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.080 
take it out and it just racks up the
kills<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.680> this<00:03:19.770> gameplay<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.580> got<00:03:20.880> me<00:03:21.060> a

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
kills in this gameplay it got me a

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.000 
kills in this gameplay it got me a
majority<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.660> my<00:03:21.870> kills<00:03:22.200> probably<00:03:22.620> more<00:03:22.770> kills

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
majority of my kills probably more kills

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.100 
majority of my kills probably more kills
than<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.220> got<00:03:23.370> myself<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.570> did<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:24.930> much

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
than I got myself and it did so much

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.510 
than I got myself and it did so much
work<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.620> then<00:03:25.770> for<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.010> lightning<00:03:26.280> strike

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
work and then for the lightning strike

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.730 
work and then for the lightning strike
you<00:03:26.910> can't<00:03:27.180> go<00:03:27.270> wrong<00:03:27.420> because<00:03:27.690> it's<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.350> solid

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
you can't go wrong because it's a solid

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.290 
you can't go wrong because it's a solid
streak<00:03:29.070> when<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.370> first<00:03:29.580> pull<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:29.970> out<00:03:30.060> and

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
streak when you first pull it out and

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.690 
streak when you first pull it out and
actually<00:03:30.870> shows<00:03:31.530> them<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:31.950> red<00:03:32.100> dots<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:32.580> the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
actually shows them the red dots on the

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.090 
actually shows them the red dots on the
map<00:03:32.880> for<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.840> first<00:03:34.140> swipe<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:34.770> it's<00:03:34.950> like<00:03:35.070> a

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
map for the first swipe so it's like a

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.570 
map for the first swipe so it's like a
little<00:03:35.460> UAV<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.530> obviously<00:03:37.530> like<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.220> mortar

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
little UAV and obviously like a mortar

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.860 
little UAV and obviously like a mortar
strike<00:03:38.880> but<00:03:39.330> it's<00:03:39.420> called<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.630> lightning

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
strike but it's called a lightning

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.150 
strike but it's called a lightning
strike<00:03:40.020> in<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.260> game<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.950> could<00:03:41.070> do<00:03:41.130> a

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
strike in this game and that could do a

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.280 
strike in this game and that could do a
lot<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.430> work<00:03:41.580> if<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.910> use<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.180> properly<00:03:42.360> you

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
lot of work if you use it properly you

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.570 
lot of work if you use it properly you
want<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.500> make<00:03:43.620> sure<00:03:43.740> you<00:03:43.830> pick<00:03:44.040> kill<00:03:44.280> streaks

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
want to make sure you pick kill streaks

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.640 
want to make sure you pick kill streaks
that<00:03:44.820> suit<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.630> map<00:03:45.780> you're<00:03:45.930> playing<00:03:46.230> on<00:03:46.440> this

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
that suit the map you're playing on this

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.020 
that suit the map you're playing on this
is<00:03:46.800> kind<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.010> obvious<00:03:47.190> but<00:03:47.520> you<00:03:47.640> see<00:03:47.850> people

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
is kind of obvious but you see people

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.300 
is kind of obvious but you see people
all<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.270> time<00:03:48.360> use<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.230> wrong<00:03:49.650> kill<00:03:49.980> streaks

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
all the time use the wrong kill streaks

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.190 
all the time use the wrong kill streaks
on<00:03:50.520> like<00:03:50.850> weird<00:03:51.210> Maps<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.690> don't<00:03:51.840> want<00:03:51.960> to<00:03:52.050> use

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
on like weird Maps you don't want to use

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.380 
on like weird Maps you don't want to use
a<00:03:52.410> like<00:03:53.100> chopper<00:03:53.520> gunner<00:03:53.670> on<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.910> map<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.270> has

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
a like chopper gunner on a map that has

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.270 
a like chopper gunner on a map that has
buildings<00:03:54.900> inside<00:03:55.230> or<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.920> don't<00:03:56.010> want<00:03:56.190> to

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
buildings inside or you don't want to

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.640 
buildings inside or you don't want to
use<00:03:56.430> kill<00:03:56.850> streaks<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.690> don't<00:03:57.990> suit<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.470> map

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
use kill streaks that don't suit the map

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.920 
use kill streaks that don't suit the map
properly<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.550> look<00:04:00.120> at<00:04:00.240> your<00:04:00.420> map<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:00.810> then

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
properly so look at your map and then

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.500 
properly so look at your map and then
change<00:04:01.260> your<00:04:01.380> kill<00:04:01.980> streaks<00:04:02.250> accordingly<00:04:02.760> so

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
change your kill streaks accordingly so

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.060 
change your kill streaks accordingly so
for<00:04:03.720> example<00:04:04.140> if<00:04:04.260> you're<00:04:04.380> playing<00:04:04.410> an<00:04:04.770> indoors

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
for example if you're playing an indoors

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.530 
for example if you're playing an indoors
map<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:05.700> want<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.910> use<00:04:06.000> things<00:04:06.300> like<00:04:06.360> the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
map you want to use things like the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.020 
map you want to use things like the
sentry<00:04:06.930> gun<00:04:06.960> or<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.500> IMS<00:04:07.950> kill<00:04:08.610> streaks<00:04:08.880> that

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
sentry gun or the IMS kill streaks that

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.060 
sentry gun or the IMS kill streaks that
work<00:04:09.240> indoors<00:04:09.780> if<00:04:10.080> it's<00:04:10.230> open<00:04:10.500> map<00:04:10.650> you<00:04:10.920> can

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
work indoors if it's open map you can

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.560 
work indoors if it's open map you can
obviously<00:04:11.400> use<00:04:11.580> kill<00:04:11.940> streaks<00:04:12.150> like<00:04:12.270> I<00:04:12.360> said

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
obviously use kill streaks like I said

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.510 
obviously use kill streaks like I said
the<00:04:12.990> chopper<00:04:13.380> gunner<00:04:13.560> or<00:04:13.680> any<00:04:14.070> other<00:04:14.310> air

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
the chopper gunner or any other air

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.490 
the chopper gunner or any other air
support<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.690> one<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.959> those<00:04:16.080> tips<00:04:16.320> that

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
support it's one of those tips that

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.710 
support it's one of those tips that
people<00:04:16.920> should<00:04:17.400> know<00:04:17.580> but<00:04:18.270> you<00:04:18.359> see<00:04:18.540> all<00:04:18.570> the

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
people should know but you see all the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.349 
people should know but you see all the
time<00:04:19.010> they're<00:04:20.010> just<00:04:20.040> not<00:04:20.340> following<00:04:20.850> them<00:04:21.030> so

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
time they're just not following them so

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.909 
time they're just not following them so
use<00:04:21.540> kill<00:04:21.810> streaks<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.229> work<00:04:22.410> while<00:04:22.620> on<00:04:22.830> the

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
use kill streaks that work while on the

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:23.570 
use kill streaks that work while on the
right<00:04:23.040> map

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
right map

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.760 
right map
and<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:24.330> same<00:04:24.539> goes<00:04:24.780> for<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.080> weapons<00:04:25.439> use<00:04:25.740> a

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
and the same goes for the weapons use a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.589 
and the same goes for the weapons use a
weapon<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.310> also<00:04:26.669> fits<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.180> map<00:04:27.389> pretty

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
weapon that also fits the map pretty

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.689 
weapon that also fits the map pretty
