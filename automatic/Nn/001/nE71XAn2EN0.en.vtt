00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.830
 I'm going to make a cracker paste for 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.990
 I need them 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.410
 flour spelled from his 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.590
 oat olive oil sea ​​salt 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.570
 unrefined last of a mixture of herbs 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.509
 and flowers and a mixture of spicy 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.930
 sweet preferably in chili here I 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.510
 cumin of a cardamom of coriander 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.970
 quarter-life mustard seeds 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.260
 all the molding together to achieve 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.860
 this pie dough 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.830
 I will first placed in my container 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:44.000
 spelled flour about 150 g of 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.320
 spelled flour and we will put 30 g 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.100
 oat bran 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:56.510
 Then I will add the herbs 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.680
 salt spices so we add all the 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.930
 dry elements together and then I'm going 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.930
 sand and dough with olive oil 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.380
 so instead of butter it's very 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.590
 interesting to use olive oil 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.170
 for all cooking because it's 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.500
 an oil that supports up to 200 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.480
 degrees of temperature 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.650
 while butter beyond 130 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.800
 degrees there are already molecules that get 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.540
 then transforms one sand well see 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.300
 even with both hands and there only 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.270
 I'm going to add the water to form the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.390
 ball of dough a little bit of water go there 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.390
 slowly 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.760
 and here I add a little bit more 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.940
 so be careful with these flours and its 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.670
 whole grains they go more 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.850
 swollen than a white flour and so 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.430
 more pump water here so here we 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.900
 has a nice ball that we could leave 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.479
 to rest about a quarter of an hour twenty 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.810
 minutes but that's where I'm going to go down 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.070
 immediately on the eyelash 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.840
 dough and then so we'll bake it to 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.450
 assen 160 degrees for about 20 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.459
 minutes not too hot what we 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.380
 wants is that this crash hour be 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.710
 so crispy and not 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.290
 cui burnished olive oil can be 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.870
 use it for cooking and for 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.730
 seasonings of course she is rich 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.340
 in omega 9 the famous fatty acids 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.010
 monounsaturated but we also have all 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.560
 other oils 1 that come from 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.630
 other oilseeds like for example 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.260
 rapeseed oil and then time in 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.570
 time can be used for some 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.970
 pasta with sweet pies hosts the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.920
 organic margarine that is no 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.520
 hydrogenated so we have our paw to 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.410
 cracker here I'm doing a little nick 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.690
 in the middle so that even in the middle his 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.020
 thigh well it is so well 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.790
 crispy and there we go 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:08.640
 bake it then the crackers are 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:13.020
 cooked and then I'll be able to 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.930
 to break them we will present the plate at 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.900
 aperitif time with small 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.400
 creams to eat with as per 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.800
 example a tufted herb cream 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.920
 simply tofu mixed with 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.050
 parsley garlic lemon juice from the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.980
 soya sauce 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.930
 these little time cracks ci can also 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.330
 a full tale accompany a salty dish 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.140
 for example a dish with a fish 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.440
 grilled vegetables one is raw and cooked and 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.120
 then that brings us the cereal 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.770
 since we really have all the density 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.440
 nutritional cereals 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.230
 here with the 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.910
 fibers and micronutrients from 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.640
 spelled since we have a flour 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.230
 complete and then also the oat bran 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.210
 which is very rich in fiber and 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.760
 micronutrients 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.680
 that's another way of consuming the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.680
 cereals and in addition with olive oil
