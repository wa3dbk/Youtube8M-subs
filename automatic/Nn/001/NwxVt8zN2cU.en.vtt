glasses I just kind of see a white line
so<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> know<00:00:19.230> that's<00:00:19.470> writing<00:00:19.740> there<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.070> I

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
so I know that's writing there but I

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.910 
so I know that's writing there but I
can't<00:00:20.400> read<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.699> my<00:00:21.180> eyesight<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.960> not<00:00:22.199> very

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
can't read it my eyesight is not very

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.009 
can't read it my eyesight is not very
good<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.609> really<00:00:24.029> really<00:00:24.269> need<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
good so I really really need to have the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.810 
good so I really really need to have the
glasses<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.920> being<00:00:26.160> said<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.519> think

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
glasses on that being said I think

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.300 
glasses on that being said I think
glasses<00:00:26.939> look<00:00:27.449> nice<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.930> most<00:00:28.560> people<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.130> lot

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
glasses look nice on most people a lot

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.679 
glasses look nice on most people a lot
of<00:00:29.369> my<00:00:29.429> friends<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.300> point<00:00:30.330> or

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
of my friends have at one point or

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.790 
of my friends have at one point or
another<00:00:30.720> said<00:00:31.140> they<00:00:31.289> don't<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.769> way

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
another said they don't like the way

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.280 
another said they don't like the way
they<00:00:32.009> look<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.430> their<00:00:32.610> glasses<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:34.020> found

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
they look in their glasses I have found

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.130 
they look in their glasses I have found
that<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.739> think<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:36.120> glasses<00:00:36.570> look<00:00:36.750> better<00:00:36.960> in

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
that I think the glasses look better in

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.630 
that I think the glasses look better in
most<00:00:37.260> cases<00:00:37.559> than<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> contacts<00:00:38.370> maybe

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
most cases than the contacts maybe

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.950 
most cases than the contacts maybe
that's<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:38.969> because<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.510> used<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.809> looking

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
that's just because I'm used to looking

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.720 
that's just because I'm used to looking
at<00:00:40.200> myself<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> glasses<00:00:41.250> all<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.489> time

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
at myself with the glasses all the time

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.970 
at myself with the glasses all the time
so<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:43.020> seeing<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.440> other<00:00:43.649> people

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
so I just like seeing that other people

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.080 
so I just like seeing that other people
but<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.399> don't<00:00:45.030> understand<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.760> stigma<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:47.910> you

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
but I don't understand the stigma if you

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.970 
but I don't understand the stigma if you
will<00:00:48.270> associated<00:00:48.989> with<00:00:49.140> wearing<00:00:49.440> glasses<00:00:49.649> I

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
will associated with wearing glasses I

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
will associated with wearing glasses I
think<00:00:50.460> they<00:00:50.760> look<00:00:50.969> nice<00:00:51.180> I'm<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.870> terribly

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
think they look nice I'm not a terribly

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.590 
think they look nice I'm not a terribly
big<00:00:52.350> fan<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.039> current<00:00:53.550> trend<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.149> glasses

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
big fan of the current trend in glasses

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
big fan of the current trend in glasses
of<00:00:54.780> having<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.230> really<00:00:55.320> thick<00:00:55.860> rims<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.670> I

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
of having really really thick rims but I

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.790 
of having really really thick rims but I
prefer<00:00:57.059> thinner<00:00:57.480> frames<00:00:57.809> obviously<00:00:58.530> these

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
prefer thinner frames obviously these

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.069 
prefer thinner frames obviously these
are<00:00:59.010> very<00:00:59.550> thin<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.030> got<00:01:00.359> these<00:01:00.510> glasses<00:01:00.660> when

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
are very thin I got these glasses when

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.219 
are very thin I got these glasses when
having<00:01:01.440> thin<00:01:02.070> rims<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.670> no<00:01:02.969> rims<00:01:03.300> was<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
having thin rims or no rims was the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.960 
having thin rims or no rims was the
fashionable<00:01:04.769> thing<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.729> was

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
fashionable thing to do and that was

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.800 
fashionable thing to do and that was
like<00:01:06.890> seven<00:01:07.890> eight<00:01:08.310> years<00:01:08.790> ago<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.510> I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
like seven eight years ago now so I

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.000 
like seven eight years ago now so I
probably<00:01:10.049> need<00:01:10.229> new<00:01:10.500> glasses

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
probably need new glasses

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.370 
probably need new glasses
also<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.700> coating<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.360> my<00:01:12.510> lenses<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.110> peeling

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
also the coating on my lenses is peeling

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530 
also the coating on my lenses is peeling
which<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.850> bothersome<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.030> frustrating

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
which is bothersome and frustrating

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.510 
which is bothersome and frustrating
glasses<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.650> inconvenient<00:01:17.189> for

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
glasses can be a bit inconvenient for

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.859 
glasses can be a bit inconvenient for
instance<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.479> really<00:01:18.720> need<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
instance right now I really need to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.749 
instance right now I really need to
clean<00:01:19.080> my<00:01:19.200> glasses<00:01:19.590> looking<00:01:20.130> at<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> bright

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
clean my glasses looking at the bright

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.039 
clean my glasses looking at the bright
lights<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.060> stuff<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.420> noticed<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.869> they're

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
lights and stuff I noticed that they're

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.140 
lights and stuff I noticed that they're
much<00:01:22.619> dirtier<00:01:23.100> than<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.400> thought<00:01:23.580> few<00:01:23.939> minutes

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
much dirtier than I thought few minutes

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.880 
much dirtier than I thought few minutes
ago<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.540> while<00:01:24.840> my<00:01:24.990> glasses<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.500> pretty<00:01:25.650> good

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
ago and while my glasses are pretty good

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
at sticking to my face and my head there

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.440 
at sticking to my face and my head there
are<00:01:28.560> certain<00:01:28.950> situations<00:01:29.490> where<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:30.329> are

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
are certain situations where they are

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.179 
are certain situations where they are
likely<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.810> come<00:01:31.049> off<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.590> most<00:01:31.770> frustrating

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
likely to come off the most frustrating

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.620 
likely to come off the most frustrating
example<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.790> roller<00:01:33.000> coasters

there are a lot of roller coasters that
say<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.400> should<00:01:35.610> probably<00:01:35.759> take<00:01:35.970> your

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
say you should probably take your

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
glasses out before you get on this ride

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.649 
glasses out before you get on this ride
and<00:01:37.680> there's<00:01:38.369> only<00:01:38.490> been<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:38.909> instance<00:01:39.420> where

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and there's only been one instance where

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.569 
and there's only been one instance where
I<00:01:39.689> thought<00:01:39.930> taking<00:01:40.380> my<00:01:40.470> glasses<00:01:40.710> off<00:01:41.009> helped

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
I thought taking my glasses off helped

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.030 
I thought taking my glasses off helped
but<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.570> really<00:01:43.200> bumpy<00:01:43.649> wooden

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
but it was a really really bumpy wooden

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.740 
but it was a really really bumpy wooden
roller<00:01:44.250> coaster<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> gave<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> headache<00:01:45.450> I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
roller coaster that gave me a headache I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.080 
roller coaster that gave me a headache I
do<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.229> because<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.619> signs<00:01:46.829> say<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.759> but

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
do it because the signs say to do it but

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.819 
do it because the signs say to do it but
I<00:01:48.360> don't<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.170> feel<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.680> necessary

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
I don't really feel like it's necessary

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.830 
I don't really feel like it's necessary
most<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.340> time<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:50.820> glasses<00:01:51.090> stick

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
most the time because my glasses stick

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.389 
most the time because my glasses stick
pretty<00:01:52.079> well<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.380> my<00:01:52.470> head<00:01:52.649> also<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:53.340> are

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
pretty well to my head also there are

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.469 
pretty well to my head also there are
times<00:01:53.549> when<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.180> your<00:01:54.270> face

times when you have to get your face
really<00:01:54.810> close<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.200> something<00:01:55.409> or<00:01:55.740> someone
