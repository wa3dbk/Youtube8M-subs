coin<00:01:12.909> is<00:01:13.120> that<00:01:13.270> games<00:01:13.510> are<00:01:13.659> an<00:01:13.780> interactive

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
coin is that games are an interactive

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.340 
coin is that games are an interactive
medium<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:15.180> design<00:01:16.180> is<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:16.660> backbone<00:01:16.840> of<00:01:17.080> any

design one of the biggest weaknesses I

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.900 
design one of the biggest weaknesses I
see<00:01:22.869> in<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.110> industry<00:01:23.229> is<00:01:23.800> a<00:01:24.130> lot<00:01:24.430> of<00:01:24.580> writers

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
see in the industry is a lot of writers

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.660 
see in the industry is a lot of writers
don't<00:01:25.180> have<00:01:25.450> they<00:01:26.110> don't<00:01:26.140> have<00:01:26.350> design<00:01:26.860> skills

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
don't have they don't have design skills

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.249 
don't have they don't have design skills
and<00:01:28.240> a<00:01:28.330> lot<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.479> designers<00:01:28.900> don't<00:01:29.080> have

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
and a lot of designers don't have

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.300 
and a lot of designers don't have
writing<00:01:29.619> skills

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
writing skills

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.060 
writing skills
to<00:01:31.240> become<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.630> truly<00:01:31.930> I<00:01:32.170> think<00:01:32.440> a<00:01:32.470> successful

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
to become a truly I think a successful

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.620 
to become a truly I think a successful
writer<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.520> really<00:01:33.880> need<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.119> understand

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
writer you really need to understand

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.810 
writer you really need to understand
both<00:01:34.840> disciplines<00:01:35.440> these<00:01:35.950> two<00:01:36.280> things<00:01:36.550> are

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
both disciplines these two things are

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.990 
both disciplines these two things are
increasingly<00:01:37.540> becoming<00:01:38.250> interdependence<00:01:39.250> in

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
increasingly becoming interdependence in

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.600 
increasingly becoming interdependence in
games<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.780> they<00:01:41.110> will<00:01:41.289> continue<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.039> be<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:42.580> in

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
games and they will continue to be so in

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.240 
games and they will continue to be so in
the<00:01:42.940> future<00:01:43.330> so<00:01:43.600> there<00:01:43.960> is<00:01:44.080> no<00:01:44.289> magic<00:01:44.590> bullets

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
the future so there is no magic bullets

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.340 
the future so there is no magic bullets
it's<00:01:45.700> very<00:01:46.119> very<00:01:46.360> difficult<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.840> make<00:01:47.080> it<00:01:47.229> in

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
it's very very difficult to make it in

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.920 
it's very very difficult to make it in
the<00:01:47.560> industry<00:01:47.890> strictly<00:01:48.759> as<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:48.910> writer<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.570> I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
the industry strictly as a writer and I

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.510 
the industry strictly as a writer and I
think<00:01:50.259> very<00:01:50.440> few<00:01:50.560> people<00:01:50.770> have<00:01:51.160> been<00:01:51.280> hired

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
think very few people have been hired

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.279 
think very few people have been hired
strictly<00:01:52.090> as<00:01:52.180> writers<00:01:52.570> right<00:01:52.810> off<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.110> bat

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
strictly as writers right off the bat

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.620 
strictly as writers right off the bat
although<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.190> becoming<00:01:54.670> more<00:01:54.910> common<00:01:55.210> so

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
although it is becoming more common so

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.020 
although it is becoming more common so
learn<00:01:55.840> as<00:01:56.080> much<00:01:56.410> about<00:01:56.649> design<00:01:56.830> as<00:01:57.399> possible

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
learn as much about design as possible

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.969 
learn as much about design as possible
and<00:01:58.810> there's<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.170> lot<00:01:59.320> of<00:01:59.350> great<00:01:59.590> books<00:01:59.770> out

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
and there's a lot of great books out

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.139

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
there to read there's a lot of great

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.440 
there to read there's a lot of great
programs<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.780> universities<00:02:02.410> to<00:02:02.590> go<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:03.450> get
