00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:13.989 
a little bit more about the SD card so
let's<00:00:12.799> just<00:00:13.249> start<00:00:13.369> off<00:00:13.429> with<00:00:13.489> the<00:00:13.669> same

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
these SIM cards out numerous times I

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:52.569 
these SIM cards out numerous times I
switch<00:00:51.320> phones<00:00:51.530> constantly<00:00:52.070> I've<00:00:52.160> never<00:00:52.399> had

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
an issue with these sim cards well I did

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.090 
an issue with these sim cards well I did
once<00:00:54.649> but<00:00:55.489> you<00:00:55.609> just<00:00:55.820> simply<00:00:56.090> go<00:00:56.300> to<00:00:56.329> the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
once but you just simply go to the

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.979 
once but you just simply go to the
carrier<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.359> they'll<00:00:59.359> give<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.629> new<00:00:59.660> one

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
carrier and they'll give you a new one

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.740 
carrier and they'll give you a new one
it's<00:01:00.109> really<00:01:00.289> easy<00:01:00.440> to<00:01:00.620> do<00:01:00.769> so<00:01:01.059> and<00:01:02.059> basically

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
it's really easy to do so and basically

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.170 
it's really easy to do so and basically
yeah<00:01:03.230> once<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:04.400> insert<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.850> you'll<00:01:04.940> hear<00:01:05.090> like

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
yeah once you insert it you'll hear like

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.810 
yeah once you insert it you'll hear like
a<00:01:05.270> click<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.500> if<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:06.950> want<00:01:07.160> to<00:01:07.220> eject<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:07.730> you
