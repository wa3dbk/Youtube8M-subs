00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
hands on the steering wheel as I press

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.079 
hands on the steering wheel as I press
the<00:00:56.330> spring<00:00:56.720> to<00:00:57.350> accelerate<00:00:57.949> I<00:00:58.190> started<00:00:58.940> using

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
the spring to accelerate I started using

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.490 
the spring to accelerate I started using
the<00:00:59.300> ring<00:00:59.449> initially<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:00.080> now<00:01:00.110> they<00:01:00.350> have<00:01:00.470> a

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
the ring initially and now they have a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.960 
the ring initially and now they have a
new<00:01:00.589> type<00:01:00.949> called<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.339> ghost<00:01:01.610> which<00:01:01.820> I've

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
new type called the ghost which I've

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.180 
new type called the ghost which I've
actually<00:01:02.420> absolutely<00:01:02.540> loved<00:01:03.140> because<00:01:03.559> it's

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
actually absolutely loved because it's

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.740 
actually absolutely loved because it's
actually<00:01:04.489> on<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.850> back<00:01:05.150> of<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.540> steering

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
actually on the back of the steering

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.060 
actually on the back of the steering
wheel<00:01:06.050> so<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:06.290> don't<00:01:06.530> have<00:01:06.650> to<00:01:06.800> use<00:01:06.950> your

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
wheel so you don't have to use your

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.590 
wheel so you don't have to use your
thumbs<00:01:07.340> now<00:01:07.640> what<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:07.940> do<00:01:08.060> is<00:01:08.090> you<00:01:08.240> hold<00:01:08.390> on

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
thumbs now what you do is you hold on

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.719 
thumbs now what you do is you hold on
your<00:01:08.810> steering<00:01:09.080> wheel<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.590> most<00:01:10.340> of<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:10.580> that

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
your steering wheel and most of you that

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.760 
your steering wheel and most of you that
are<00:01:10.820> disabled<00:01:11.210> know<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.600> us<00:01:12.140> holding<00:01:12.530> on<00:01:12.650> our

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
are disabled know that us holding on our

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.290 
are disabled know that us holding on our
steering<00:01:13.040> wheels<00:01:13.190> is<00:01:13.310> very<00:01:13.580> important<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.150> us

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
steering wheels is very important to us

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.360 
steering wheels is very important to us
and<00:01:14.510> now<00:01:15.050> we're<00:01:15.200> actually<00:01:15.320> using<00:01:15.770> our<00:01:15.860> fingers

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
and now we're actually using our fingers

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.789 
and now we're actually using our fingers
to<00:01:17.030> control<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.960> acceleration<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.710> the

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
to control the acceleration of the

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.789 
to control the acceleration of the
vehicle<00:01:19.659> and<00:01:20.659> then<00:01:20.810> not<00:01:21.080> only<00:01:21.290> can<00:01:21.470> we<00:01:21.500> use<00:01:21.560> our

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
vehicle and then not only can we use our

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.380 
vehicle and then not only can we use our
fingers<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.159> excel<00:01:22.430> to<00:01:22.820> control<00:01:23.270> the

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
fingers to excel to control the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.760 
fingers to excel to control the
acceleration<00:01:23.780> we<00:01:24.080> could<00:01:24.200> actually<00:01:24.380> use<00:01:24.620> our

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
acceleration we could actually use our

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.940 
acceleration we could actually use our
fingers<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.360> our<00:01:26.360> paddle<00:01:26.720> shift<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.230> upshift

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
fingers to our paddle shift in upshift

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.860 
fingers to our paddle shift in upshift
and<00:01:28.070> downshift<00:01:28.160> if<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:28.880> drop<00:01:29.300> a<00:01:29.330> sports<00:01:29.660> car

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
and downshift if you drop a sports car

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.500 
and downshift if you drop a sports car
that<00:01:30.020> has<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.200> feature<00:01:30.620> so<00:01:31.520> one<00:01:32.390> thing

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
that has that feature so one thing

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.030 
that has that feature so one thing
that's<00:01:32.600> really<00:01:32.720> exciting<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.770> fact<00:01:33.800> that

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
that's really exciting is the fact that

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.940 
that's really exciting is the fact that
I<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.370> actually<00:01:34.820> now<00:01:35.000> downshift<00:01:35.810> my<00:01:36.410> vehicle

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
I can actually now downshift my vehicle

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.340 
I can actually now downshift my vehicle
while<00:01:37.580> I<00:01:37.610> have<00:01:37.940> my<00:01:38.090> hand<00:01:38.390> on<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.870> brake<00:01:39.080> and

again for those sports car enthusiasts
you<00:01:41.930> know<00:01:42.050> how<00:01:42.200> important<00:01:42.650> how<00:01:42.800> much<00:01:42.920> fun<00:01:43.220> it

you know how important how much fun it
is<00:01:43.370> to<00:01:43.610> drive<00:01:43.790> a<00:01:43.820> car<00:01:44.120> that<00:01:44.390> allows<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:45.350> that

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
is to drive a car that allows you that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.940 
is to drive a car that allows you that
feature<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:47.140> only<00:01:48.140> thing<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:48.590> have<00:01:48.830> to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
feature the only thing that I have to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.590 
feature the only thing that I have to
say<00:01:49.130> about<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.550> gwido<00:01:49.730> hand<00:01:50.030> controls<00:01:50.390> that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
say about the gwido hand controls that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.930 
say about the gwido hand controls that
may<00:01:51.560> prohibit<00:01:51.800> some<00:01:52.250> people<00:01:52.550> from<00:01:52.730> moving

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
may prohibit some people from moving

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.460 
may prohibit some people from moving
forward<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.480> buying<00:01:53.750> them<00:01:53.930> is<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.200> fact<00:01:54.380> that

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
forward and buying them is the fact that

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.260 
forward and buying them is the fact that
they<00:01:54.650> cost<00:01:54.920> around<00:01:55.810> $8,500<00:01:56.810> installed<00:01:58.270> now

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
they cost around $8,500 installed now

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.650 
they cost around $8,500 installed now
the<00:01:59.330> question<00:01:59.810> is<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.950> worth<00:02:01.070> it

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
the question is is it worth it

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.000 
the question is is it worth it
well<00:02:02.660> if<00:02:03.080> you're<00:02:03.260> somebody<00:02:03.590> like<00:02:03.620> me<00:02:03.740> who

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
well if you're somebody like me who

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.500 
well if you're somebody like me who
drives<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.400> sports<00:02:04.670> car<00:02:04.910> and<00:02:05.120> wants<00:02:05.390> that
