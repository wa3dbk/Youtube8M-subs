lava so sometimes the cactus stay on the
cactus<00:00:47.480> but<00:00:48.480> that's<00:00:48.690> not<00:00:48.960> always<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.469> case<00:00:49.649> it

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
cactus but that's not always the case it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
cactus but that's not always the case it
will<00:00:50.460> still<00:00:50.820> collect<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.690> eighty<00:00:51.989> percent

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
will still collect like eighty percent

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
place blocks over there and break those

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.890 
place blocks over there and break those
blocks<00:02:32.109> like<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.530> just<00:02:32.590> did<00:02:32.980> okay<00:02:33.370> low<00:02:34.329> just

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
blocks like I just did okay low just

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.710 
blocks like I just did okay low just
place<00:02:35.139> all<00:02:35.410> these<00:02:35.739> blocks<00:02:36.209> now<00:02:37.209> once<00:02:37.540> you're

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
place all these blocks now once you're

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.780 
place all these blocks now once you're
done<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.200> want<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.500> break<00:02:38.739> or<00:02:39.069> I'll<00:02:39.549> always

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
done you want to break or I'll always

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.840 
done you want to break or I'll always
have<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.630> block<00:02:41.019> break1<00:02:41.530> have<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.220> block<00:02:42.579> there

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
have a block break1 have a block there

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.120 
have a block break1 have a block there
and<00:02:43.030> break<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.420> next<00:02:43.720> one<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:44.709> you'll<00:02:44.980> have

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
and break the next one so you'll have

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:54.240 
and break the next one so you'll have
something<00:02:45.190> like<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:53.680> break<00:02:54.010> all

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
something like this and just break all

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.490 
something like this and just break all
these<00:02:54.609> now<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.299> actually<00:02:55.780> want<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.989> go<00:02:56.200> into

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
each one of these blocks just like this

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.320 
each one of these blocks just like this
whoops

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
book each sand on each sand blocks just

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.569 
book each sand on each sand blocks just
like<00:03:28.860> this<00:03:33.200> there<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.440> go<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.980> then<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.549> next

thing you want to do is build right
between<00:03:40.319> these<00:03:40.769> blocks<00:03:41.190> like<00:03:41.519> this<00:03:42.379> but<00:03:43.379> then

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
between these blocks like this but then

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.470 
between these blocks like this but then
you<00:03:43.860> want<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.129> leave<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:44.610> one<00:03:44.909> and<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.329> want

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
want to place down blocks like that say

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.240 
want to place down blocks like that say
get<00:03:53.849> them<00:03:53.970> right<00:03:54.209> there<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:56.060> one<00:03:57.060> right<00:03:57.569> here

doing that you want to play signs all
around<00:04:20.160> these<00:04:20.579> blocks<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:22.440> let's<00:04:22.860> just<00:04:23.130> do

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
around these blocks so let's just do

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.100 
around these blocks so let's just do
that<00:04:23.400> sorry<00:04:24.120> if<00:04:24.330> there's<00:04:24.599> background<00:04:24.930> noise

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
that sorry if there's background noise

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:37.629 
that sorry if there's background noise
but<00:04:28.130> ok<00:04:29.130> let's<00:04:29.669> just<00:04:29.880> do<00:04:30.030> this<00:04:30.210> real<00:04:30.270> quickly

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:45.170 

last<00:04:38.639> one<00:04:42.200> there<00:04:43.200> you<00:04:43.410> go<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:44.400> next<00:04:44.729> thing<00:04:44.940> you

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
last one there you go the next thing you

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.000 
last one there you go the next thing you
