bit to do a braid the way it looks best

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420 
bit to do a braid the way it looks best
is<00:00:33.750> by<00:00:33.930> starting<00:00:34.290> as<00:00:34.559> close<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> part<00:00:35.280> as

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
is by starting as close to the part as

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.900 
is by starting as close to the part as
you<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.840> what<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.530> start<00:00:38.219> as<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:38.730> you

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
you can what you do is start as if you

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.700 
you can what you do is start as if you
were<00:00:39.030> starting<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.600> plat<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> small

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
were starting a plat so with a small

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.639 
were starting a plat so with a small
section<00:00:41.190> divided<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.730> into<00:00:41.910> three<00:00:42.649> even

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
section divided it into three even

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.880 
section divided it into three even
pieces<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> same<00:00:46.230> movement<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
pieces so it's the same movement as a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.709 
pieces so it's the same movement as a
plat<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.489> you're<00:00:47.640> adding<00:00:47.789> extra<00:00:48.329> hair<00:00:48.510> each

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
plat but you're adding extra hair each

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.930 
plat but you're adding extra hair each
time<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.730> do<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> normal<00:00:51.149> cross<00:00:51.329> over<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
time so do the normal cross over and

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.520 
time so do the normal cross over and
then<00:00:53.940> once<00:00:54.120> you've<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.539> three<00:00:54.899> pieces<00:00:55.110> have

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
then once you've all three pieces have

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.430 
then once you've all three pieces have
been<00:00:55.710> crossed<00:00:56.039> over<00:00:56.539> you<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.750> add<00:00:57.899> another

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
been crossed over you just add another

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.740 
been crossed over you just add another
section<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.359> the<00:01:00.359> outside<00:01:00.989> piece<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.710> hair<00:01:02.750> so

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
section to the outside piece of hair so

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.390 
section to the outside piece of hair so
each<00:01:04.080> time<00:01:04.379> making<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.890> thicker<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.189> I've

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
each time making it thicker so I've

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
each time making it thicker so I've
added<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.909> piece<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.229> now<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.650> to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
added to this piece and now we have to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.460 
added to this piece and now we have to
add<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.189> piece<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.960> don't<00:01:10.170> add<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
add to this piece so you don't add to

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.840 
add to this piece so you don't add to
the<00:01:10.560> middle<00:01:10.710> piece<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.189> only<00:01:11.400> add<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the middle piece you only add to the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.120 
the middle piece you only add to the
pieces<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.479> outside<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:13.890> cross

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
pieces on the outside and then we cross

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.749 
pieces on the outside and then we cross
all<00:01:14.369> those<00:01:14.549> three<00:01:14.850> over<00:01:16.310> now<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.369> trick<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
all those three over now the trick is to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789 
all those three over now the trick is to
try<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.360> keep<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.840> tight<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.320> with

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
try and keep it as tight as you can with

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.560 
try and keep it as tight as you can with
your<00:01:20.070> fingers<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.939> make<00:01:21.180> sure<00:01:21.210> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
your fingers just to make sure it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.740 
your fingers just to make sure it
doesn't<00:01:21.900> fall<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.430> again<00:01:23.759> grab<00:01:24.540> another

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
doesn't fall out so again grab another

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.390 
doesn't fall out so again grab another
little<00:01:25.049> section<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.619> add<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
little section and add that to the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.749 
little section and add that to the
outside<00:01:26.790> piece<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.210> hair<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:29.930> cross<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.110> over

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
outside piece of hair and cross it over

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.340 
outside piece of hair and cross it over
so<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> same<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> plat<00:01:34.079> but

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
so it's just the same as a plat but

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.350 
so it's just the same as a plat but
before<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.829> cross<00:01:35.070> either<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> pieces

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
before you cross either of the pieces

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.690 
before you cross either of the pieces
over<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.110> add<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> new<00:01:37.619> section<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.159> hair<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.549> it

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
over you add a new section of hair to it

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670 
over you add a new section of hair to it
now<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:39.450> down<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.110> braid<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.530> get

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
now as you go down the braid will get

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.210 
now as you go down the braid will get
thicker<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.159> thicker<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:43.740> idea<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
thicker and thicker so the idea of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.399 
thicker and thicker so the idea of
starting<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.970> close<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:45.659> part<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.170> you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
starting is close to your part as you

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.050 
starting is close to your part as you
can<00:01:46.680> means<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.340> you've<00:01:47.460> already<00:01:47.670> got<00:01:47.820> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
can means that you've already got this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.730 
can means that you've already got this
fine<00:01:48.329> pattern<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.290> start<00:01:49.560> right

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
fine pattern for you if you start right

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.470 
fine pattern for you if you start right
down<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.159> then

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
down here then

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.600 
down here then
just<00:01:50.780> plain<00:01:51.080> ham<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:51.620> really<00:01:52.040> helps<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.370> hold

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
just plain ham this really helps to hold

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.340 
just plain ham this really helps to hold
the<00:01:52.760> hairstyle<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.360> place<00:01:53.600> by<00:01:53.840> starting<00:01:54.230> as

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
the hairstyle in place by starting as

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.710 
the hairstyle in place by starting as
close<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.860> part<00:01:55.070> as<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.340> can<00:01:55.580> so<00:01:56.330> each

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
close to the part as you can so each

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.930 
close to the part as you can so each
time<00:01:57.080> adding<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.160> little<00:01:58.370> bit<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.520> extra<00:01:58.730> hair

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
time adding a little bit of extra hair

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.550 
time adding a little bit of extra hair
to<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.180> outside<00:01:59.360> section<00:01:59.960> before<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:00.350> cross

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
to that outside section before you cross

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.890 
to that outside section before you cross
it<00:02:00.710> over<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:01.820> need<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.300> add<00:02:02.420> some<00:02:02.660> to<00:02:02.780> this

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
it over so I need to add some to this

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.120 
it over so I need to add some to this
section<00:02:04.090> before<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.300> cross<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.600> over<00:02:06.010> so<00:02:07.010> this

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
section before I cross it over so this

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.420 
section before I cross it over so this
is<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.640> same<00:02:07.880> movement<00:02:08.210> as<00:02:08.980> any<00:02:09.980> other<00:02:10.160> braid

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
is the same movement as any other braid

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.710 
is the same movement as any other braid
if<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.670> wanted<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.000> do<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.120> braid<00:02:11.360> straight

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
if you wanted to do a braid straight

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.900 
if you wanted to do a braid straight
down<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.140> head<00:02:12.350> or<00:02:12.680> two<00:02:13.280> braids<00:02:13.580> on<00:02:13.760> either

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
down the head or two braids on either

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.430 
down the head or two braids on either
side<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.180> could<00:02:14.450> do<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.720> same<00:02:14.900> again<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.320> the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
side you could do the same again on the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.500 
side you could do the same again on the
other<00:02:15.560> side<00:02:15.860> with<00:02:16.790> this<00:02:16.940> one<00:02:17.120> I'm<00:02:17.270> just<00:02:17.330> going

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
other side with this one I'm just going

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.930 
other side with this one I'm just going
to<00:02:17.570> keep<00:02:17.780> adding<00:02:17.960> here<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.650> moving<00:02:19.190> right

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
to keep adding here and moving right

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.540 
to keep adding here and moving right
around<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.450> head<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:20.870> I'll<00:02:20.960> just<00:02:21.170> turn<00:02:22.160> Chloe

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
around the head so I'll just turn Chloe

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.870 
around the head so I'll just turn Chloe
as<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:22.940> move<00:02:23.900> further<00:02:24.110> around<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.650> head<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.760> now

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
as I move further around the head so now

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.700 
as I move further around the head so now
that<00:02:25.940> I'm<00:02:26.120> getting<00:02:26.240> down<00:02:26.570> around<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.530> ear

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
that I'm getting down around the ear

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.330 
that I'm getting down around the ear
here<00:02:28.160> I'll<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:28.490> spin<00:02:28.910> her<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.150> little<00:02:29.450> bit<00:02:30.340> but

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
here I'll just spin her a little bit but

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.180 
here I'll just spin her a little bit but
when<00:02:31.460> you're<00:02:31.610> doing<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:32.770> child's<00:02:33.770> hair<00:02:33.950> like

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
when you're doing a child's hair like

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.070 
when you're doing a child's hair like
this<00:02:34.400> just<00:02:34.880> make<00:02:35.030> sure<00:02:35.180> you've<00:02:35.300> got<00:02:35.510> room<00:02:36.050> to

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
this just make sure you've got room to

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.440 
this just make sure you've got room to
move<00:02:36.380> around<00:02:36.710> them<00:02:37.010> so<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.280> it's<00:02:37.790> easy<00:02:38.120> for

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
move around them so that it's easy for

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.230 
move around them so that it's easy for
you<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.690> move<00:02:38.870> as<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:40.550> braid<00:02:40.790> moves<00:02:41.060> around

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
you to move as the braid moves around

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.210 
you to move as the braid moves around
the<00:02:41.540> head<00:02:41.720> otherwise<00:02:42.440> if<00:02:42.620> you've<00:02:42.740> got<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:42.980> stop

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
the head otherwise if you've got to stop

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.360 
the head otherwise if you've got to stop
and<00:02:43.250> start<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.910> can<00:02:44.060> kind<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:45.040> let<00:02:46.040> go<00:02:46.070> hold

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
and start you can kind of let go hold

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.790 
and start you can kind of let go hold
some<00:02:46.640> bits<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.120> might<00:02:47.270> get<00:02:47.480> loose<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:48.050> just

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
some bits and it might get loose so just

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.110 
some bits and it might get loose so just
make<00:02:48.950> sure<00:02:48.980> you've<00:02:49.220> got<00:02:49.370> plenty<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.670> room<00:02:49.910> to

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
make sure you've got plenty of room to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.960 
make sure you've got plenty of room to

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
move and make sure when you're adding to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.580 
move and make sure when you're adding to
the<00:02:53.060> bottom<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.660> outside<00:02:54.050> section<00:02:54.260> when

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
the bottom to the outside section when

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.660

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.090 
all the hair from the bottom so there's
no<00:02:57.770> hairs<00:02:58.610> left<00:02:58.880> hanging<00:02:59.180> out<00:02:59.480> so<00:03:00.380> this<00:03:00.770> is<00:03:00.920> the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.960 
at this bit of hair into that outside
section<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:06.500> cross<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:06.920> over<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.400> now<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.790> need

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
section and cross it over and now I need

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.850 
section and cross it over and now I need
to<00:03:08.120> add<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:08.600> section<00:03:09.110> so<00:03:09.350> grab<00:03:09.620> with<00:03:09.739> it

ear
you<00:03:16.819> start<00:03:17.120> angling<00:03:17.629> the<00:03:17.780> braid<00:03:18.069> down<00:03:19.069> so<00:03:19.970> as

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
you start angling the braid down so as

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.710 
you start angling the braid down so as
if<00:03:20.239> it<00:03:20.330> was<00:03:20.450> heading<00:03:20.750> underneath<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.560> ear<00:03:22.720> so

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
if it was heading underneath the ear so

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.369 
if it was heading underneath the ear so
I'm<00:03:24.110> around<00:03:24.379> here<00:03:24.650> now<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.659> don't<00:03:26.780> once
