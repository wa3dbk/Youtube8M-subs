 it is crazy about its editors, of course we hope to encourage more 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.859
 it's like a dream 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:11.949
 8 8 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.710
 but not for the second room that has a ticket 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.000
 but that is one reason the project fraction 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.119
 the police had to close earlier this year 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 a profit of more than 23 billion dollars 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.140
 6 too bad for twente you have 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.940
 this time you will see that otherwise 54 go and stand will also be deployable 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:38.410
 6 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.410
 assisted 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.780
 p 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.050
 nice sight 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.750
 this game is a bit against i have learned to make 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.520
 good afternoon 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.129
 I think you can do it yourself at it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.340
 you should see 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.340
 same 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.730
 it is not only a pity about iran 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.480
 the jury 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.760
 if you are here 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 the number of jobs 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.540
 I think it makes it completely 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.330
 the offer may have been included 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.410
 if you then not too long 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.740
 Analysts had provided Sydney the Young See 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.220
 8 in rosmalen 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.330
 to be classified differently 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.980
 az 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.620
 nothing to do 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.010
 35 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.310
 7 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.040
 then take your m 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.830
 the last 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.890
 the family 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.390
 think about standing 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.490
 Veenendaal report they are on 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.980
 she says that 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.760
 to go see dance 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.200
 the only thing that i can regge is 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.680
 takes place later 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 in addition, it would be an internal meeting of the committee 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.620
 the figure for consumer confidence they know he 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.869
 not in sight 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.469
 the program 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.089
 not on that day 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.089
 at more than 3000 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.219
 sure his case has been dealt with 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:28.109
 the sentiment on wall street I note and that is not good to talk about 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:31.959
 the 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.029
 utrecht this year 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.169
 the widening of the ring 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.619
 7 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.909
 defense speaks for itself 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:40.589
