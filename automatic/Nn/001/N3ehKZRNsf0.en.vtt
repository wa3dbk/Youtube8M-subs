00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
have to watch out for though cuz

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.410 
have to watch out for though cuz
obviously<00:01:42.930> would<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.380> annoying<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.420> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
obviously would be annoying but it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
obviously would be annoying but it
shouldn't<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.409> huge<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.860> deal<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
shouldn't be that huge of a deal but I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.160 
shouldn't be that huge of a deal but I
said<00:01:47.909> lead-up<00:01:48.180> infernape<00:01:48.659> does<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.899> case<00:01:49.020> he

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
said lead-up infernape does in case he

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.330 
said lead-up infernape does in case he
want<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> leave<00:01:49.470> up<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.649> teacher<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.130> get<00:01:50.220> up

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
want to leave up a teacher and get up

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
want to leave up a teacher and get up
rocks<00:01:50.640> right<00:01:50.820> off<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> bat<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.479> did<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:52.350> he

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
rocks right off the bat so I did but he

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.230 
rocks right off the bat so I did but he
let<00:01:52.740> off<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.950> latios<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.640> guess<00:01:53.790> predicting

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
let off with latios I guess predicting

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.120 
let off with latios I guess predicting
that<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> switch<00:01:55.530> right<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.890> go

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
that so I have to switch right out go

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.160 
that so I have to switch right out go
into<00:01:56.340> tyranitar<00:01:56.969> cuz<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.180> figured<00:01:57.450> maybe<00:01:57.659> I

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
into tyranitar cuz I figured maybe I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.569 
into tyranitar cuz I figured maybe I
could<00:01:58.439> take<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> surf<00:01:58.860> well<00:01:59.070> enough<00:01:59.280> even

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
could take a surf well enough even

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.530 
could take a surf well enough even
though<00:01:59.640> i<00:01:59.670> don't<00:01:59.820> have<00:01:59.969> made<00:02:00.090> special<00:02:00.360> defense

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
though i don't have made special defense

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.179 
though i don't have made special defense
investment<00:02:00.990> really<00:02:01.530> don't<00:02:01.680> take<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> weld<00:02:02.070> all

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
investment really don't take a weld all

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.469 
investment really don't take a weld all
that<00:02:02.369> knows<00:02:02.520> these<00:02:02.670> life<00:02:02.850> forms<00:02:02.880> i<00:02:03.240> figured

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
that knows these life forms i figured

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.660 
that knows these life forms i figured
okay<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:03.780> others<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.469> surf<00:02:04.619> again<00:02:04.740> so

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
okay so others can go for surf again so

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.639 
okay so others can go for surf again so
i'm<00:02:05.729> gonna<00:02:05.880> go<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.030> wrote<00:02:06.329> him<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:07.079> take<00:02:07.409> said

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
i'm gonna go to wrote him to take said

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.749 
i'm gonna go to wrote him to take said
surf<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.039> then<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.220> should<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.399> able<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> take

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
surf and then it should be able to take

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.249 
surf and then it should be able to take
a<00:02:08.910> drink<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.239> meteor<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
a drink of meteor and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.339 
a drink of meteor and
since<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.159> this<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:12.000> my<00:02:12.150> Rotom<00:02:12.480> with<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.659> t-wave

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
since is this is my Rotom with a t-wave

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.080 
since is this is my Rotom with a t-wave
I<00:02:13.590> should<00:02:13.860> just<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:14.189> T<00:02:14.340> wave<00:02:14.549> them<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.879> then

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
I should just be on T wave them and then

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.910 
I should just be on T wave them and then
you<00:02:15.780> know<00:02:15.870> go<00:02:16.049> from<00:02:16.260> there<00:02:16.409> but<00:02:16.530> he<00:02:16.620> hit<00:02:16.739> me<00:02:16.769> a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
dead yeah but I go to landers to figure

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.880 
dead yeah but I go to landers to figure
to<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.209> my<00:02:39.329> best<00:02:39.480> pivot<00:02:39.840> right<00:02:39.989> now<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:40.799> it

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
to be my best pivot right now but it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.410 
to be my best pivot right now but it
goes<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.099> Callao<00:02:41.459> some<00:02:41.700> forces<00:02:42.030> switch<00:02:42.209> right

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
goes in Callao some forces switch right

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.080 
goes in Callao some forces switch right
out<00:02:42.569> into<00:02:42.840> uh<00:02:43.109> I<00:02:43.620> believe<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.400> just<00:02:44.430> go<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.670> sell

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
out into uh I believe I just go to sell

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.729 
out into uh I believe I just go to sell
be<00:02:45.329> because<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.109> figured<00:02:46.170> that'd<00:02:46.500> be<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.620> best

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
be because I figured that'd be the best

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.319 
be because I figured that'd be the best
place<00:02:46.950> do<00:02:47.159> but<00:02:47.340> he<00:02:47.400> double<00:02:47.760> switches<00:02:48.120> up<00:02:48.239> to

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
place do but he double switches up to

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.970 
place do but he double switches up to
tornadus<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.959> guess<00:02:49.200> predicting<00:02:49.650> me<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.829> go

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
tornadus I guess predicting me to go

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.800 
tornadus I guess predicting me to go
into<00:02:50.159> Celebi<00:02:50.609> but<00:02:51.239> what<00:02:51.389> he<00:02:51.450> doesn't<00:02:51.569> know<00:02:51.750> is

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
into Celebi but what he doesn't know is

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.030 
into Celebi but what he doesn't know is
I'm<00:02:51.989> scarf<00:02:52.290> at<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.590> same<00:02:52.739> time<00:02:52.859> I<00:02:52.920> don't

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
I'm scarf at the same time I don't

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.920 
I'm scarf at the same time I don't
really<00:02:53.310> want<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.489> stay<00:02:53.639> inside<00:02:53.790> I'll<00:02:54.420> just

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
really want to stay inside I'll just

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.869 
really want to stay inside I'll just
reveal<00:02:55.290> my<00:02:55.530> scarf<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.159> just<00:02:56.280> go<00:02:56.370> for<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:56.700> turn

right<00:02:57.030> off<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.239> bat<00:02:57.389> I<00:02:57.599> figured<00:02:58.290> since<00:02:58.470> he<00:02:58.620> is

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
right off the bat I figured since he is

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.830 
right off the bat I figured since he is
a<00:02:58.920> Santine<00:02:59.670> he<00:02:59.879> may<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:00.120> be<00:03:00.450> running<00:03:00.599> the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
a Santine he may just be running the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.270 
a Santine he may just be running the
acrobatic<00:03:01.319> set<00:03:01.470> be<00:03:01.590> talk<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:01.920> me<00:03:01.980> right<00:03:02.129> off

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
acrobatic set be talk to me right off

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.069 
acrobatic set be talk to me right off
the<00:03:02.310> bat<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:02.819> I'm<00:03:02.879> not<00:03:03.000> really<00:03:03.120> sure<00:03:03.209> what<00:03:03.959> he's

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
the bat so I'm not really sure what he's

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.140 
the bat so I'm not really sure what he's
doing<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:04.409> I<00:03:04.470> figure<00:03:04.739> if<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.849> break<00:03:05.879> in

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
doing but I figure if I break in

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.369 
doing but I figure if I break in
magnezone<00:03:06.569> he's<00:03:06.750> gonna<00:03:06.870> be<00:03:07.019> enticed<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
magnezone he's gonna be enticed to

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.229 
magnezone he's gonna be enticed to
switch<00:03:07.680> out<00:03:07.859> not<00:03:08.519> wanting<00:03:08.819> to<00:03:08.849> take<00:03:09.090> a

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
switch out not wanting to take a

switch out not wanting to take a
electric<00:03:10.079> move<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.889> I<00:03:11.099> was<00:03:11.220> getting<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.489> flash

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
electric move so I was getting a flash

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.580 
electric move so I was getting a flash
can<00:03:12.060> freaking<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.510> switch<00:03:12.720> out<00:03:12.900> he<00:03:13.319> does<00:03:13.440> get

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
can freaking that switch out he does get

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.589 
can freaking that switch out he does get
on<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.739> t<00:03:13.859> tar<00:03:14.099> which<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.730> pretty<00:03:15.030> fantasma

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
on the t tar which is pretty fantasma

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.670 
on the t tar which is pretty fantasma
coal<00:03:15.750> because<00:03:15.900> another<00:03:16.169> one<00:03:16.319> will<00:03:16.410> take<00:03:16.530> them

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
coal because another one will take them

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.960 
coal because another one will take them
out<00:03:16.799> so<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.099> just<00:03:17.220> go<00:03:17.340> for<00:03:17.400> another<00:03:17.549> one<00:03:17.790> and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
out so I just go for another one and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.909 
out so I just go for another one and
nothing<00:03:18.419> I<00:03:18.599> seen<00:03:18.810> will<00:03:18.900> really<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:19.500> taking

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
nothing I seen will really like taking

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.199 
nothing I seen will really like taking
it<00:03:20.040> likes<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.400> where<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:20.609> still<00:03:20.819> takes<00:03:21.000> about

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
it likes is where it still takes about

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.180 
it likes is where it still takes about
thirty<00:03:21.720> forty<00:03:22.109> percent<00:03:22.379> from<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.829> flash

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
thirty forty percent from that flash

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.280 
thirty forty percent from that flash
cannon<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:23.790> I'm<00:03:24.060> not<00:03:24.299> really<00:03:24.359> too<00:03:24.870> bothered<00:03:25.230> by

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
cannon so I'm not really too bothered by

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.710 
cannon so I'm not really too bothered by
that<00:03:25.500> but<00:03:25.829> even<00:03:26.730> if<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.849> u-turn<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.329> obvious

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
that but even if the u-turn is obvious

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.360 
that but even if the u-turn is obvious
from<00:03:27.810> him<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.230> really<00:03:28.739> can't<00:03:28.949> stay<00:03:29.160> in<00:03:29.190> there

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
from him I really can't stay in there

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.069 
from him I really can't stay in there
just<00:03:29.579> in<00:03:29.730> case<00:03:29.760> he<00:03:30.000> does<00:03:30.030> go<00:03:30.540> for<00:03:30.720> super<00:03:30.900> power

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
just in case he does go for super power

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.349 
just in case he does go for super power
cuz<00:03:31.859> he<00:03:32.370> doesn't<00:03:32.669> know<00:03:32.730> I'm<00:03:32.849> choice<00:03:33.060> yet

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
cuz he doesn't know I'm choice yet

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.470 
cuz he doesn't know I'm choice yet
apparently<00:03:33.810> she<00:03:33.989> shouldn't<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:34.799> it's<00:03:35.129> like<00:03:35.480> it

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
apparently she shouldn't so it's like it

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.849 
apparently she shouldn't so it's like it
might<00:03:36.780> not<00:03:36.900> be<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.139> best<00:03:37.290> situation<00:03:37.440> from<00:03:37.829> the

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
might not be the best situation from the

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.490 
might not be the best situation from the
do<00:03:38.099> but<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:39.030> yeah<00:03:39.629> it<00:03:39.750> hurts<00:03:40.019> me<00:03:40.169> with<00:03:40.290> the

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
do but it yeah it hurts me with the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.050 
do but it yeah it hurts me with the
u-turn<00:03:41.220> probably<00:03:41.609> doesn't<00:03:41.790> matter<00:03:41.910> too<00:03:42.030> much

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
u-turn probably doesn't matter too much

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.610 
u-turn probably doesn't matter too much
because<00:03:42.329> he<00:03:42.419> just<00:03:42.629> goes<00:03:42.780> into<00:03:43.049> his<00:03:43.139> on<00:03:43.260> landers

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
because he just goes into his on landers

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.069 
because he just goes into his on landers
just<00:03:43.859> goes<00:03:44.010> for<00:03:44.160> HBIC<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.639> take<00:03:44.790> me<00:03:44.940> out<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.299> he

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
just goes for HBIC to take me out and he

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.330 
just goes for HBIC to take me out and he
doesn't<00:03:46.319> have<00:03:46.410> life<00:03:46.620> orb<00:03:46.859> and<00:03:47.010> he's<00:03:47.129> probably

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
doesn't have life orb and he's probably

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.740 
doesn't have life orb and he's probably
a<00:03:48.109> mmm<00:03:49.109> shear<00:03:49.560> force<00:03:49.829> set<00:03:50.069> just<00:03:50.280> because<00:03:50.750> why

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
a mmm shear force set just because why

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.629 
a mmm shear force set just because why
else<00:03:51.780> would<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.079> run<00:03:52.290> normal<00:03:52.620> landorus<00:03:52.980> let

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
else would you run normal landorus let

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.099 
else would you run normal landorus let
me<00:03:53.790> go<00:03:53.909> into<00:03:54.120> Infernape<00:03:54.359> may<00:03:54.690> be<00:03:54.750> scared<00:03:55.049> about

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
me go into Infernape may be scared about

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.250 
me go into Infernape may be scared about
the<00:03:55.290> prospect<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.739> an<00:03:55.859> HP<00:03:56.129> ice<00:03:56.280> cuz<00:03:57.260> infer

the prospect of an HP ice cuz infer

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.050 
the prospect of an HP ice cuz infer
names<00:03:58.470> like<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.680> run<00:03:58.859> that<00:03:59.010> plus<00:03:59.400> he's<00:03:59.879> only

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
names like to run that plus he's only

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.050 
names like to run that plus he's only
seeing<00:04:00.299> you<00:04:00.480> turn<00:04:00.690> off<00:04:00.870> me<00:04:01.079> so<00:04:01.669> yeah<00:04:02.669> if<00:04:02.819> i<00:04:02.940> go

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
seeing you turn off me so yeah if i go

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.849 
seeing you turn off me so yeah if i go
for<00:04:03.180> fire<00:04:03.389> punch<00:04:03.629> it<00:04:03.900> looks<00:04:04.260> like<00:04:04.349> another<00:04:04.560> one

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
for fire punch it looks like another one

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.379 
for fire punch it looks like another one
like<00:04:05.040> might<00:04:05.430> take<00:04:05.609> him<00:04:05.699> out<00:04:05.849> but<00:04:06.030> i<00:04:06.090> thought<00:04:06.239> he

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
like might take him out but i thought he

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.330 
like might take him out but i thought he
might<00:04:06.510> want<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.780> switch<00:04:06.840> out<00:04:07.139> here<00:04:07.829> I<00:04:08.040> don't

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
might want to switch out here I don't

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.979 
might want to switch out here I don't
know<00:04:08.400> why<00:04:08.579> you'd<00:04:08.699> actually<00:04:08.849> switch<00:04:09.180> out<00:04:09.389> but<00:04:09.750> i

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
know why you'd actually switch out but i

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.039 
know why you'd actually switch out but i
figured<00:04:10.889> i<00:04:11.129> might<00:04:11.819> not<00:04:12.269> want<00:04:12.479> to<00:04:12.540> try<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:12.959> do

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
figured i might not want to try and do

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.390 
figured i might not want to try and do
that<00:04:13.079> but<00:04:13.379> he<00:04:13.470> just<00:04:13.590> goes<00:04:13.769> her<00:04:13.919> stealth<00:04:14.159> rocks

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
that but he just goes her stealth rocks

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.649 
that but he just goes her stealth rocks

I<00:04:21.940> can<00:04:22.450> kneel<00:04:22.570> Keldeo<00:04:22.990> just<00:04:23.500> fine<00:04:23.680> but<00:04:23.980> he<00:04:24.160> goes

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
I can kneel Keldeo just fine but he goes

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.130 
I can kneel Keldeo just fine but he goes
into<00:04:24.550> tornadus<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.180> he<00:04:25.240> goes<00:04:25.360> for<00:04:25.570> rain<00:04:25.870> dance

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
into tornadus and he goes for rain dance

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.490 
into tornadus and he goes for rain dance
which<00:04:26.320> really<00:04:26.890> made<00:04:27.190> no<00:04:27.430> sense<00:04:27.730> like<00:04:28.270> if<00:04:28.570> he

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
which really made no sense like if he

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.900 
which really made no sense like if he
had<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.860> fighting<00:04:30.190> movie<00:04:30.490> should<00:04:30.670> have<00:04:30.790> gone

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
had the fighting movie should have gone

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.730 
had the fighting movie should have gone
for<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.330> or<00:04:31.930> does<00:04:32.230> not<00:04:32.350> even<00:04:32.500> gone<00:04:32.590> to

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
for it or does not even gone to

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.990 
for it or does not even gone to
tornadoes<00:04:33.160> but<00:04:33.280> now<00:04:33.370> he<00:04:33.430> goes<00:04:33.580> in<00:04:33.730> this<00:04:33.820> is

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
tornadoes but now he goes in this is

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.160 
tornadoes but now he goes in this is
where<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.210> figured<00:04:34.420> he'd<00:04:34.660> predict<00:04:34.930> me<00:04:35.080> to

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
where I figured he'd predict me to

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.330 
where I figured he'd predict me to
predict<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.410> bullet<00:04:35.710> punch<00:04:35.890> so<00:04:36.130> I'm<00:04:36.250> just

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
predict the bullet punch so I'm just

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.070 
predict the bullet punch so I'm just
gonna<00:04:36.430> stay<00:04:36.640> and<00:04:36.790> go<00:04:36.850> for<00:04:37.000> stone<00:04:37.150> edge<00:04:37.270> plus<00:04:37.930> he

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
gonna stay and go for stone edge plus he

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.680 
gonna stay and go for stone edge plus he
might've<00:04:38.320> thought<00:04:38.410> he<00:04:38.500> was<00:04:38.650> faster<00:04:38.860> so<00:04:39.690> yeah

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
might've thought he was faster so yeah

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.120 
might've thought he was faster so yeah
that's<00:04:40.900> kind<00:04:41.200> of<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.350> end<00:04:41.470> of<00:04:41.560> that<00:04:41.680> says<00:04:41.950> or

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
that's kind of the end of that says or

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.620 
that's kind of the end of that says or
and<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.640> rise<00:04:42.820> of<00:04:42.850> my<00:04:43.000> teacher<00:04:43.300> because<00:04:43.570> I

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
and the rise of my teacher because I

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.120 
and the rise of my teacher because I
just<00:04:43.810> dig<00:04:43.930> most<00:04:44.170> ownage<00:04:44.410> when<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.890> was<00:04:45.010> getting

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
go to landers like you probably should

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.240 
go to landers like you probably should
have<00:04:46.720> been<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.930> first<00:04:47.230> place<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.860> just<00:04:48.040> takes

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
have been the first place and just takes

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
hundred women kill my voltage which in

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.730 
hundred women kill my voltage which in
the<00:05:25.510> end<00:05:25.540> really<00:05:25.840> didn't<00:05:26.170> matter<00:05:26.230> if<00:05:26.470> I<00:05:26.530> died

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
leaf storm or psychic didn't kill I

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.900 
leaf storm or psychic didn't kill I
would<00:05:33.010> have<00:05:33.100> had<00:05:33.190> infernape<00:05:33.550> with<00:05:33.670> mock

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910

punched<00:05:34.270> revenge<00:05:34.600> kill<00:05:34.840> him<00:05:34.960> so<00:05:35.700> actually<00:05:36.700> I

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
punched revenge kill him so actually I

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.190 
punched revenge kill him so actually I
probably<00:05:37.120> just<00:05:37.300> gone<00:05:37.510> for<00:05:37.660> psychic<00:05:37.960> just<00:05:38.140> to

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
probably just gone for psychic just to

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.470 
probably just gone for psychic just to
be<00:05:38.260> safe<00:05:38.470> and<00:05:38.800> then<00:05:39.280> like<00:05:39.910> I<00:05:40.000> said<00:05:40.060> it<00:05:40.300> didn't

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
be safe and then like I said it didn't

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.910 
be safe and then like I said it didn't
kill<00:05:40.660> which<00:05:40.840> is<00:05:40.930> mock<00:05:41.080> punch<00:05:41.320> but<00:05:41.560> instead<00:05:41.860> I

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
kill which is mock punch but instead I

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.860 
kill which is mock punch but instead I
go<00:05:42.100> take<00:05:42.310> my<00:05:42.430> wagons<00:05:42.880> in<00:05:42.970> volts<00:05:43.300> which<00:05:43.450> so
