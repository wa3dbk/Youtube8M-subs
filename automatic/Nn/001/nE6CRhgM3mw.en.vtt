itself exposing the edge of the fabric

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.710 
itself exposing the edge of the fabric
now<00:00:48.590> this<00:00:48.770> is<00:00:48.950> where<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:50.120> if<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:50.450> want<00:00:50.629> to

now this is where you if you want to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.150 
now this is where you if you want to
take<00:00:50.900> some<00:00:51.140> time<00:00:51.470> align<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.489> satin<00:00:53.360> edge<00:00:54.160> on

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
take some time align the satin edge on

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.319 
take some time align the satin edge on
the<00:00:55.370> back<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.890> line<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.400> satin<00:00:58.790> edge<00:00:58.910> on<00:00:59.210> the

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
the back and line the satin edge on the

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.840 
the back and line the satin edge on the
front<00:00:59.739> this<00:01:00.739> will<00:01:01.040> make<00:01:01.780> certain<00:01:02.780> that<00:01:03.350> your

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
front this will make certain that your

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.090 
front this will make certain that your
fabric<00:01:05.649> corner<00:01:06.649> will<00:01:07.009> be<00:01:07.040> mitered<00:01:09.040> okay<00:01:10.040> so

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
fabric corner will be mitered okay so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.350 
fabric corner will be mitered okay so
I'm<00:01:10.399> lining<00:01:10.759> everything<00:01:11.210> up<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:11.840> it's<00:01:11.960> square

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
I'm lining everything up so it's square

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.240 
I'm lining everything up so it's square
then<00:01:14.360> with<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.660> ruler<00:01:15.170> you're<00:01:15.470> going<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.800> draw<00:01:16.040> a

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
then with a ruler you're going to draw a

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.960 
then with a ruler you're going to draw a
45<00:01:16.940> inch<00:01:17.300> angle<00:01:18.110> from<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.100> corner<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:19.880> I'm

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
45 inch angle from the corner so I'm

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.510 
45 inch angle from the corner so I'm
going<00:01:20.149> to<00:01:20.210> align<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.690> 45<00:01:21.200> inch<00:01:21.380> angle<00:01:22.009> and

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
going to align the 45 inch angle and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.969 
going to align the 45 inch angle and
draw<00:01:23.090> this<00:01:23.479> corner<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.890> use<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.850> marking<00:01:26.300> pin

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
draw this corner and use the marking pin

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.449 
draw this corner and use the marking pin
and<00:01:27.979> line<00:01:28.429> up<00:01:28.640> that<00:01:28.789> 45<00:01:29.300> degree<00:01:29.600> line<00:01:30.340> there<00:01:31.340> we

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:31.459 
and line up that 45 degree line there we

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:32.669 
and line up that 45 degree line there we
go

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
go

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:39.190 
go
and<00:01:34.899> Mark<00:01:36.160> now<00:01:37.160> I'm<00:01:37.459> not<00:01:37.940> marking<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:38.990> very

can see that that has been sown

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.420 
can see that that has been sown
perfectly<00:02:26.750> then<00:02:26.959> you'd<00:02:27.140> start<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.470> stitch<00:02:27.860> at

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
perfectly then you'd start to stitch at

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.199 
perfectly then you'd start to stitch at
that<00:02:28.730> corner<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.569> you<00:02:29.989> continue<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.680> go<00:02:30.950> back

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
that corner and you continue to go back

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.050 
that corner and you continue to go back
so<00:02:32.209> again<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:33.650> fold<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.160> fabric<00:02:34.579> back<00:02:34.790> on

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
so again you fold the fabric back on

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.900 
so again you fold the fabric back on
itself<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.750> draw<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.230> 45<00:02:36.860> degree<00:02:37.310> angle<00:02:37.730> and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
itself and draw that 45 degree angle and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.960 
itself and draw that 45 degree angle and
stitch<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.810> that's<00:02:39.799> how<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.099> add<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.370> satin

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
stitch and that's how you add a satin

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.200 
stitch and that's how you add a satin
binding<00:02:41.209> on<00:02:41.629> a<00:02:41.660> fleece<00:02:42.170> blanket
