going to give you two approaches to this
progression<00:01:00.699> that<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:02.739> offer<00:01:02.949> really

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
progression that just offer really

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.990 
progression that just offer really
different<00:01:03.789> concepts<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:04.900> how<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.230> might

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
different concepts of how you might

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.740 
different concepts of how you might
accompany<00:01:07.000> or<00:01:07.240> use<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:08.200> guitar<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.640> our<00:01:10.330> first

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
approach is going to be a spacious

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.679 
approach is going to be a spacious
leaving<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.340> lot<00:01:15.520> of<00:01:15.549> quite<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.150> bit<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.479> space

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
leaving a lot of quite a bit of space

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.539 
leaving a lot of quite a bit of space
using<00:01:17.530> chords<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.070> are<00:01:18.159> in<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.340> first

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
using chords that are in the first

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:19.440 
using chords that are in the first
position

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450

real kind of driving dum-dum-dum-dum
bass<00:01:30.040> line<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:32.380> approach<00:01:32.740> is<00:01:33.040> following

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
bass line and this approach is following

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.789 
bass line and this approach is following
along<00:01:33.520> with<00:01:33.729> that<00:01:34.149> although<00:01:35.020> it's<00:01:35.200> leaving<00:01:35.649> a

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
along with that although it's leaving a

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.399 
along with that although it's leaving a
lot<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:35.979> space<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.869> really<00:01:37.990> nice<00:01:38.229> if

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
lot of space so it's really nice if

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.490 
lot of space so it's really nice if
you've<00:01:38.560> got<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.799> nice<00:01:39.729> lyric<00:01:40.210> or<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.630> little<00:01:41.350> bit

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
you've got a nice lyric or a little bit

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.469 
you've got a nice lyric or a little bit
of<00:01:41.619> a<00:01:41.680> busier<00:01:42.009> melody<00:01:42.430> going<00:01:42.610> on<00:01:42.880> this<00:01:43.329> is

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
of a busier melody going on this is

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.819 
of a busier melody going on this is
going<00:01:43.600> to<00:01:43.659> be<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.810> great<00:01:44.049> approach<00:01:44.350> for<00:01:44.649> you<00:01:44.710> to

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
going to be a great approach for you to

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.940 
going to be a great approach for you to
take<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:46.000> second<00:01:46.420> approach<00:01:46.659> really<00:01:47.350> contrast

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
take the second approach really contrast

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.340 
take the second approach really contrast
that<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.340> we've<00:01:48.430> taken<00:01:48.960> some<00:01:49.960> chords<00:01:50.229> that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
that and we've taken some chords that

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.660 
that and we've taken some chords that
are<00:01:50.469> going<00:01:50.619> way<00:01:50.860> higher<00:01:51.130> up<00:01:51.159> on<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.549> neck

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
are going way higher up on the neck

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.969 
are going way higher up on the neck
they're<00:01:52.360> tighter<00:01:52.780> voicings<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.619> intervals

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
they're tighter voicings the intervals

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.660 
they're tighter voicings the intervals
are<00:01:54.130> closer<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.909> I've<00:01:55.689> added<00:01:55.899> some<00:01:56.670> unusual

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
are closer and I've added some unusual

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.940 
are closer and I've added some unusual
color<00:01:57.969> tones<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:59.110> you're<00:01:59.290> not<00:01:59.439> really<00:01:59.680> used

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
color tones that you're not really used

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.209 
color tones that you're not really used
to<00:02:00.130> hearing<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.899> that's<00:02:02.110> different<00:02:02.950> and

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
to hearing so that's different and

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.700 
to hearing so that's different and
there's<00:02:04.149> a<00:02:04.240> pretty<00:02:04.960> much<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.170> flowing

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
there's a pretty much a flowing

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.730 
there's a pretty much a flowing
strumming<00:02:06.579> pattern<00:02:07.509> in<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.689> right<00:02:07.869> hand<00:02:08.229> so

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
strumming pattern in the right hand so

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.280 
strumming pattern in the right hand so
the<00:02:08.890> two<00:02:09.039> approaches<00:02:09.430> are<00:02:09.580> really<00:02:10.030> different

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
the two approaches are really different

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.290 
the two approaches are really different
