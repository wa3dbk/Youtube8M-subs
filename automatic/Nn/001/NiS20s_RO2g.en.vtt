little bit hard to work there are a lot
of<00:00:21.359> dead<00:00:21.600> fish<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.199> side<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.439> the

riverbanks and the gulls are feeding

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.310 
riverbanks and the gulls are feeding
quite<00:00:24.960> happily<00:00:26.510> the<00:00:27.510> population<00:00:28.199> of

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
quite happily the population of

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.750 
quite happily the population of
fishermen<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> river<00:00:29.220> banks<00:00:29.550> right<00:00:29.699> now

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
fishermen on the river banks right now

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.020 
fishermen on the river banks right now
is<00:00:30.150> very<00:00:30.539> low<00:00:31.040> that<00:00:32.040> tells<00:00:32.309> me<00:00:32.520> one<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
is very low that tells me one of a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.330 
is very low that tells me one of a
couple<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.360> things<00:00:33.620> are<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.800> they<00:00:34.950> think<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
couple of things are that they think the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.160 
couple of things are that they think the
salmon<00:00:35.700> run<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.000> finished<00:00:36.390> or<00:00:36.719> they<00:00:37.140> just

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
salmon run is finished or they just

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.900 
salmon run is finished or they just
don't<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.920> fish<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> high<00:00:38.520> waters

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
don't like to fish in the high waters

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.290 
don't like to fish in the high waters
because<00:00:39.090> they<00:00:39.239> think<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.570> not<00:00:39.750> doable

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
because they think it's not doable

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.549 
because they think it's not doable
well<00:00:42.300> both<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.510> those<00:00:42.750> ideas<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.410> actually

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
well both of those ideas are actually

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.680 
well both of those ideas are actually
quite<00:00:44.040> wrong<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:44.879> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> show<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.300> in

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
quite wrong and I'm going to show you in

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.630 
quite wrong and I'm going to show you in
this<00:00:45.840> video<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.800> little<00:00:47.280> bit<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.399> footage

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
this video this little bit of footage

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.250 
this video this little bit of footage
that<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> got<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.480> some<00:00:48.719> salmon<00:00:48.930> being

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
that I got you on some salmon being

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.680 
that I got you on some salmon being
caught<00:00:49.500> there's<00:00:50.039> still<00:00:50.280> lots<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.730> salmon<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
caught there's still lots of salmon and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.709 
caught there's still lots of salmon and
many<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.620> them<00:00:52.770> are<00:00:52.920> still<00:00:53.100> healthy<00:00:53.640> shiny<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
many of them are still healthy shiny and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.410 
many of them are still healthy shiny and
chrome<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:56.520> thing<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> when<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.210> water

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
chrome the thing is that when the water

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
chrome the thing is that when the water
raises<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.770> kind<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
raises like this you kind of get a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.029 
raises like this you kind of get a
separation<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.969> two<00:01:00.210> different<00:01:00.510> fish<00:01:01.039> there's

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
separation of two different fish there's

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.950 
separation of two different fish there's
the<00:01:02.219> old<00:01:02.430> ones<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.239> already<00:01:03.660> spawned

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the old ones that have already spawned

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960 
the old ones that have already spawned
or<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> middle<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.920> spawning<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.850> are

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
or in a middle of spawning that are

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.940 
or in a middle of spawning that are
dying<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.570> getting<00:01:06.659> away<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.290> really<00:01:07.770> not

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
dying and getting away and really not

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.149 
dying and getting away and really not
healthy<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.610> worth<00:01:08.820> catching<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.510> eating

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
healthy and not worth catching or eating

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.280 
healthy and not worth catching or eating
but<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> second<00:01:11.909> group<00:01:12.060> who<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.960> that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
but then the second group who is that

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
but then the second group who is that
are<00:01:13.409> still<00:01:13.680> strong<00:01:14.100> still<00:01:15.090> away<00:01:15.360> from<00:01:15.600> their

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
are still strong still away from their

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.570 
are still strong still away from their
spawning<00:01:15.990> grounds<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.650> still<00:01:17.040> fresh<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
spawning grounds and still fresh in the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.670 
spawning grounds and still fresh in the
rivers<00:01:17.909> are<00:01:18.360> shooting<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> rapids<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
rivers are shooting the rapids in the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
rivers are shooting the rapids in the
higher<00:01:19.920> water<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> constant<00:01:21.210> move

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
higher water on the constant move

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.990 
higher water on the constant move
they're<00:01:22.110> not<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> holding<00:01:22.979> pools<00:01:23.280> like

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
they're not in the holding pools like

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.780 
they're not in the holding pools like
the<00:01:24.180> older<00:01:24.570> tired<00:01:25.140> fit<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> best<00:01:29.310> place<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the older tired fit so the best place is

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.179 
the older tired fit so the best place is
to<00:01:29.909> get<00:01:30.119> these<00:01:30.329> fish<00:01:30.659> are<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.680> pick<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.890> spot

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
to get these fish are to pick a spot

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.340 
to get these fish are to pick a spot
where<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> water<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.240> still<00:01:33.600> flowing<00:01:33.869> fairly

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
where the water is still flowing fairly

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.249 
where the water is still flowing fairly
fast<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.520> closer<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> shore<00:01:36.540> there's<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
fast but closer to the shore there's a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.319 
fast but closer to the shore there's a
little<00:01:37.530> bit<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.829> deeper<00:01:38.250> slower<00:01:38.909> moving

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
little bit of a deeper slower moving

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.899 
little bit of a deeper slower moving
area<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.810> water<00:01:40.020> sometimes<00:01:40.890> behind<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.549> rock<00:01:41.700> or

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
area to water sometimes behind a rock or

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.389 
area to water sometimes behind a rock or
something<00:01:41.939> will<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.450> good<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.920> put<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> pair

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
something will be good to put on a pair

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.539 
something will be good to put on a pair
of<00:01:44.430> polarized<00:01:45.390> glasses<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.950> stand<00:01:47.220> dead

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
of polarized glasses and just stand dead

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.359 
of polarized glasses and just stand dead
still<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.180> stare<00:01:48.630> at<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.810> water<00:01:49.159> every<00:01:50.159> few

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
still and stare at the water every few

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.130 
still and stare at the water every few

healthy and there's lots of chum some of
them<00:06:09.850> are<00:06:10.090> even<00:06:10.240> borderline<00:06:10.930> chrome<00:06:11.290> as<00:06:11.500> well

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
them are even borderline chrome as well

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.910

the<00:06:13.270> still<00:06:13.510> holding<00:06:13.900> waters<00:06:14.260> is<00:06:14.440> full<00:06:14.620> of<00:06:14.740> fish

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920 
the still holding waters is full of fish

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.620 
the still holding waters is full of fish
too<00:06:15.220> but<00:06:15.580> most<00:06:15.820> of<00:06:15.970> them<00:06:16.120> have<00:06:16.450> already

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
too but most of them have already

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.990 
too but most of them have already
spawned<00:06:17.080> out<00:06:17.290> and<00:06:17.530> are<00:06:17.680> half<00:06:17.920> dead<00:06:18.220> so<00:06:18.880> if

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
spawned out and are half dead so if

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.640 
spawned out and are half dead so if
you're<00:06:19.180> looking<00:06:19.300> to<00:06:19.480> catch<00:06:19.780> the<00:06:20.020> good<00:06:20.170> healthy

polarized glasses will help you spot the

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
fish do the best you can to drop the

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
fish's face and a lot of the times they

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.170 
fish's face and a lot of the times they
will<00:06:43.300> strike<00:06:44.400> now<00:06:45.400> when<00:06:45.550> the<00:06:45.640> water<00:06:45.820> gets<00:06:46.060> a

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
will strike now when the water gets a

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.090 
will strike now when the water gets a
little<00:06:46.300> bit<00:06:46.480> higher<00:06:46.690> and<00:06:46.990> murky<00:06:47.350> so<00:06:47.740> you<00:06:47.800> can't

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
little bit higher and murky so you can't

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.740 
little bit higher and murky so you can't
see<00:06:48.370> the<00:06:48.520> fish<00:06:48.730> the<00:06:49.060> fish<00:06:49.240> will<00:06:49.420> still<00:06:49.630> be

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
see the fish the fish will still be

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.230 
see the fish the fish will still be
traveling<00:06:50.260> the<00:06:50.350> same<00:06:50.620> path<00:06:51.010> so<00:06:51.880> what<00:06:52.000> you<00:06:52.090> want

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
traveling the same path so what you want

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.640 
traveling the same path so what you want
to<00:06:52.330> do<00:06:52.420> then<00:06:52.600> is<00:06:52.630> just<00:06:52.960> keep<00:06:53.170> dipping<00:06:53.530> your

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
to do then is just keep dipping your

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.800 
to do then is just keep dipping your
line<00:06:54.070> in<00:06:54.310> over<00:06:54.730> and<00:06:54.880> over<00:06:55.150> letting<00:06:55.630> the

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
line in over and over letting the

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.720 
line in over and over letting the
currents<00:06:56.170> sweep<00:06:56.470> it<00:06:56.680> down<00:06:56.890> the<00:06:57.070> river<00:06:57.250> over

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
currents sweep it down the river over

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.880 
currents sweep it down the river over
and<00:06:57.880> over<00:06:58.120> hopefully<00:06:58.810> it'll<00:06:59.260> get<00:06:59.470> right<00:06:59.770> in

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
and over hopefully it'll get right in

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.410 
and over hopefully it'll get right in
front<00:07:00.040> of<00:07:00.100> their<00:07:00.220> face<00:07:00.430> where<00:07:00.820> they'll<00:07:01.030> see<00:07:01.300> it

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.420 
front of their face where they'll see it

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.960 
front of their face where they'll see it
and<00:07:01.600> get<00:07:02.020> mad<00:07:02.320> and<00:07:02.620> bite<00:07:02.980> it<00:07:03.160> without<00:07:03.790> any

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
and get mad and bite it without any

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:09.120 
and get mad and bite it without any
hesitation<00:07:04.180> that<00:07:06.960> concludes<00:07:07.960> my<00:07:08.140> report<00:07:08.169> for

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.130 
hesitation that concludes my report for

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.999 
hesitation that concludes my report for
November<00:07:09.700> 2nd<00:07:10.560> 2014

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:12.009 
November 2nd 2014

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.159 
November 2nd 2014
hopefully<00:07:12.969> I<00:07:12.999> can<00:07:13.119> get<00:07:13.330> up<00:07:13.479> a<00:07:13.569> few<00:07:13.779> more<00:07:13.869> times

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169 
hopefully I can get up a few more times

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:15.809 
hopefully I can get up a few more times
to<00:07:14.469> get<00:07:14.710> some<00:07:14.860> more<00:07:15.009> footage<00:07:15.189> before<00:07:15.460> the
