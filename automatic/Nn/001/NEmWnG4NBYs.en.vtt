didn't<00:01:19.200> get<00:01:19.290> tilled<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.740> because<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
didn't get tilled up because of the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.429 
didn't get tilled up because of the
non-stop<00:01:20.759> rain<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.210> fall<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
non-stop rain this fall but on the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.130 
non-stop rain this fall but on the
milder<00:01:22.860> days<00:01:23.299> it<00:01:24.299> sends<00:01:24.600> up<00:01:24.780> new<00:01:24.990> heads<00:01:27.140> these

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
milder days it sends up new heads these

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.190 
milder days it sends up new heads these
ones<00:01:28.320> obviously<00:01:28.530> can't<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.130> used<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:30.299> some<00:01:31.079> of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
ones obviously can't be used but some of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.899 
ones obviously can't be used but some of
them<00:01:31.259> could<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.400> another<00:01:32.610> mild

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909

15 Celsius a curious to see how this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.210 
15 Celsius a curious to see how this
