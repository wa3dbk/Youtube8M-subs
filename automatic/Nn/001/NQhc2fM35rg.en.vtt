throughout the game now before you might
be<00:00:54.870> thinking<00:00:55.170> ok<00:00:55.379> them<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.739> probably<00:00:55.980> pretty

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
be thinking ok them it's probably pretty

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.860 
be thinking ok them it's probably pretty
easy<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.879> disarm<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> traps<00:00:57.510> how<00:00:57.660> big<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
easy just disarm the traps how big a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.310 
easy just disarm the traps how big a
deal<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.320> well<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.309> truth<00:00:59.780> it<00:01:00.780> actually

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
deal is that well in truth it actually

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.979 
deal is that well in truth it actually
uses<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:01.980> what's<00:01:02.250> called<00:01:02.340> adrenaline<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
uses up what's called adrenaline and the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.570 
uses up what's called adrenaline and the
horror<00:01:04.229> monitor<00:01:04.589> has<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> certain<00:01:05.220> amount<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
horror monitor has a certain amount of

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.370 
horror monitor has a certain amount of
adrenaline<00:01:05.990> inside<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.140> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
adrenaline inside of it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.469 
adrenaline inside of it
so<00:01:07.740> whenever<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.369> use<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.820> horror<00:01:09.030> monitor

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
so whenever you use the horror monitor

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.750 
so whenever you use the horror monitor
once<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.900> adrenaline<00:01:10.380> goes<00:01:10.560> down<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
once the adrenaline goes down so the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.310 
once the adrenaline goes down so the
more<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.060> use<00:01:12.090> your<00:01:12.420> horror<00:01:12.630> monitor<00:01:13.020> rely<00:01:13.290> on

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
more you use your horror monitor rely on

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960 
more you use your horror monitor rely on
it<00:01:13.530> too<00:01:13.680> heavily<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.700> you're<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:14.880> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
it too heavily the more you're going to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.030 
it too heavily the more you're going to
be<00:01:15.090> left<00:01:15.299> open<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:16.170> being<00:01:16.409> able<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.740> disarm

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
be left open to not being able to disarm

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.859 
be left open to not being able to disarm
these<00:01:17.220> traps<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> plus<00:01:18.090> there's<00:01:18.299> also<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
these traps and plus there's also I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.300 
these traps and plus there's also I
guess<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.350> could<00:01:19.500> call<00:01:19.619> them<00:01:19.740> traps<00:01:20.040> within

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
guess you could call them traps within

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.340 
guess you could call them traps within
traps<00:01:20.759> meaning<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.360> there's<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.080> fake

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
traps meaning that there's like fake

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.770 
traps meaning that there's like fake
traps<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.070> they<00:01:23.189> use<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.970> make<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.600> use

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
traps that they use just to make you use

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.560 
traps that they use just to make you use
up<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.140> adrenaline<00:01:25.619> by<00:01:25.770> mistake<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
up your adrenaline by mistake so in that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
up your adrenaline by mistake so in that
sense<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.409> really<00:01:28.500> neat<00:01:29.159> too<00:01:29.310> because<00:01:29.549> each

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
sense it's really neat too because each

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.520 
sense it's really neat too because each
trap<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.360> said<00:01:30.540> has<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> different<00:01:31.200> sort<00:01:31.439> of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
trap like I said has a different sort of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.780 
trap like I said has a different sort of
cutscene<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.310> there's<00:01:32.460> over<00:01:32.549> like

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
cutscene and I think there's over like

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
cutscene and I think there's over like
two<00:01:32.939> hundred<00:01:33.090> traps<00:01:33.420> overall<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.259> game

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
two hundred traps overall in this game

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.440 
two hundred traps overall in this game
so<00:01:34.710> something<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.850> really<00:01:36.180> enjoyed

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
so something like that I really enjoyed

one<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.380> few<00:03:13.680> games<00:03:13.950> i've<00:03:14.190> actually<00:03:14.370> seen

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
one of the few games i've actually seen

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.039 
one of the few games i've actually seen
where<00:03:14.849> you<00:03:14.880> can<00:03:15.090> actually<00:03:15.269> literally<00:03:15.750> die

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
where you can actually literally die

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.259 
where you can actually literally die
from<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.500> heart<00:03:16.530> attack<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:18.000> have<00:03:18.120> like

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
from a heart attack and you have like

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.520 
from a heart attack and you have like
sure<00:03:18.389> they<00:03:18.480> have<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.630> heart<00:03:18.870> attack<00:03:18.930> meter<00:03:19.319> so

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
sure they have a heart attack meter so

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.220 
sure they have a heart attack meter so
the<00:03:19.650> more<00:03:19.859> are<00:03:20.120> traps<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.269> don't<00:03:21.569> disarm<00:03:22.049> and

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
the more are traps you don't disarm and

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.050 
the more are traps you don't disarm and
you<00:03:22.290> actually<00:03:22.470> get<00:03:22.950> affected<00:03:23.370> by<00:03:23.489> them<00:03:23.730> they

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
you actually get affected by them they

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.699 
you actually get affected by them they
could<00:03:24.269> either<00:03:24.450> damage<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:24.989> physically<00:03:25.500> to

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
could either damage you physically to

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.110 
could either damage you physically to
where<00:03:25.859> you're<00:03:25.950> hyper<00:03:26.160> couldn't<00:03:26.549> go<00:03:26.639> down<00:03:26.849> or

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
where you're hyper couldn't go down or

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.289 
where you're hyper couldn't go down or
you<00:03:27.379> can<00:03:28.379> get<00:03:28.530> damaged<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.819> when<00:03:29.940> your<00:03:30.090> heart

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
you can get damaged and when your heart

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.360 
you can get damaged and when your heart
and<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:30.690> scares<00:03:31.049> you<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.319> if<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.620> if<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.220> let

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
and it scares you and if you if you let

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.960 
and it scares you and if you if you let
your<00:03:32.519> heart<00:03:32.730> rate<00:03:33.329> go<00:03:33.540> up<00:03:33.690> too<00:03:33.900> high<00:03:33.930> then<00:03:34.859> you

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
your heart rate go up too high then you

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.710 
your heart rate go up too high then you
actually<00:03:35.970> die<00:03:36.120> have<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.269> heart<00:03:36.450> attack

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
actually die have a heart attack

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.900 
actually die have a heart attack
and<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.680> get<00:03:37.859> damaged<00:03:38.250> too<00:03:38.459> much<00:03:38.639> not<00:03:38.879> only

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
and if you get damaged too much not only

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.720 
and if you get damaged too much not only
could<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.419> possibly<00:03:40.109> die<00:03:40.440> from<00:03:41.129> just<00:03:41.190> having

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
could you possibly die from just having

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.819 
could you possibly die from just having
your<00:03:42.030> hit<00:03:42.510> points<00:03:42.840> reaching<00:03:43.199> zero<00:03:43.470> but<00:03:43.709> you

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
your hit points reaching zero but you

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.030 
your hit points reaching zero but you
can<00:03:43.980> also<00:03:44.129> died<00:03:44.549> as<00:03:44.879> well<00:03:45.180> from<00:03:46.049> bleeding<00:03:46.889> to

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
can also died as well from bleeding to

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.530 
can also died as well from bleeding to
death<00:03:47.069> because<00:03:47.549> of<00:03:47.910> course<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.299> game<00:03:48.449> is

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
death because of course the game is

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.960 
death because of course the game is
called<00:03:48.660> ill<00:03:48.900> bleed<00:03:49.079> so<00:03:49.410> expect<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.160> see<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> lot

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
called ill bleed so expect to see a lot

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.339 
called ill bleed so expect to see a lot
of<00:03:51.000> quite<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.269> bit<00:03:51.449> of<00:03:51.540> gore<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:51.959> game<00:03:52.169> too

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
of quite a bit of gore in this game too

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.409 
of quite a bit of gore in this game too
I<00:03:52.410> mean<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.680> very<00:03:52.709> very<00:03:53.250> exaggerated<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.269> mean

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
I mean it's very very exaggerated I mean

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.240 
I mean it's very very exaggerated I mean
when<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.750> take<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.959> hit<00:03:55.290> it's<00:03:55.829> like<00:03:55.859> a<00:03:55.949> tidal

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
when you take a hit it's like a tidal

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.280 
when you take a hit it's like a tidal
wave<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.699> blood<00:03:56.910> comes<00:03:57.180> out<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.629> and<00:03:57.810> yet

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
wave of blood comes out of you and yet

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.069 
wave of blood comes out of you and yet
you<00:03:58.409> live<00:03:58.769> still<00:03:59.129> while<00:04:00.030> at<00:04:00.180> least<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.989> know

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
you live still while at least you know

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.750 
you live still while at least you know
you<00:04:01.650> don't<00:04:01.769> think<00:04:01.829> in<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.159> many<00:04:02.400> hits<00:04:02.609> you

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
you don't think in that many hits you

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.709 
you don't think in that many hits you
live<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:04.680> camera<00:04:05.040> controlling<00:04:05.730> this<00:04:05.909> at<00:04:06.599> the

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:06.719 
live the camera controlling this at the

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.720 
live the camera controlling this at the
camera<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.349> controls<00:04:07.739> are<00:04:07.829> kinda<00:04:08.310> iffy

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
camera and the controls are kinda iffy

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.160 
camera and the controls are kinda iffy
there's<00:04:09.060> times<00:04:09.390> where<00:04:09.629> you<00:04:09.719> want<00:04:09.750> think<00:04:10.049> the

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
there's times where you want think the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.050 
there's times where you want think the
camera<00:04:10.500> won't<00:04:10.709> cooperate<00:04:10.980> right<00:04:11.640> with<00:04:11.909> you

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
camera won't cooperate right with you

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.630 
camera won't cooperate right with you
and<00:04:12.269> then<00:04:12.780> there's<00:04:12.989> times<00:04:13.290> where<00:04:13.769> the

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
and then there's times where the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.219 
and then there's times where the
controls<00:04:15.030> can<00:04:15.180> be<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.299> little<00:04:15.540> sticky<00:04:15.840> but

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
controls can be a little sticky but

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.650 
controls can be a little sticky but
overall<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.919> it<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.850> is<00:04:18.000> well<00:04:18.269> done<00:04:18.449> and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
overall it it is it is well done and

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.990 
overall it it is it is well done and
they<00:04:18.750> are<00:04:18.780> responsive<00:04:19.560> but<00:04:19.769> I<00:04:19.829> think<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:20.850> it

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
they are responsive but I think that it

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.860 
they are responsive but I think that it
could<00:04:21.239> have<00:04:21.299> been<00:04:21.509> better<00:04:21.949> better<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:24.630> sound

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
could have been better better the sound

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.260 
could have been better better the sound
for<00:04:25.110> this<00:04:25.229> eye<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.830> probably<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.490> strongest

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
for this eye is probably the strongest

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.510 
for this eye is probably the strongest
point<00:04:27.690> as<00:04:27.930> far<00:04:28.229> as<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.500> presentation<00:04:28.770> goes<00:04:29.310> it

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
point as far as the presentation goes it

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.460 
point as far as the presentation goes it
has<00:04:29.699> some<00:04:29.910> really<00:04:30.150> nice<00:04:30.449> creepy<00:04:30.840> music<00:04:31.289> it's

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
has some really nice creepy music it's

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.320 
has some really nice creepy music it's
it's<00:04:31.860> pretty<00:04:32.039> sparse<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.699> music<00:04:33.030> it's<00:04:33.180> not

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
it's pretty sparse the music it's not

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.999 
it's pretty sparse the music it's not
the<00:04:33.630> whole<00:04:33.840> lot<00:04:34.259> of<00:04:34.349> rightie<00:04:34.560> that<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:34.919> would

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
the whole lot of rightie that you would

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.800 
the whole lot of rightie that you would
get<00:04:35.160> maybe<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:35.550> other<00:04:35.669> games<00:04:35.940> but<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.599> sound

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
get maybe in other games but the sound

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.200 
get maybe in other games but the sound
effects<00:04:37.080> definitely<00:04:37.650> are<00:04:37.830> scary<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.520> they

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
effects definitely are scary and they

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.580 
effects definitely are scary and they
will<00:04:39.389> creep<00:04:39.599> you<00:04:39.720> out<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.050> even<00:04:40.169> like<00:04:40.440> the

at night when I was when I first got
this<00:04:45.360> game<00:04:45.570> back<00:04:45.720> in<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> early<00:04:46.050> 2000s<00:04:48.050> like<00:04:49.050> I

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
this game back in the early 2000s like I

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.540 
this game back in the early 2000s like I
said<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.440> boss<00:04:49.620> music<00:04:50.039> is<00:04:50.099> really<00:04:50.310> cool<00:04:50.520> I

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
said the boss music is really cool I

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.580 
said the boss music is really cool I
think<00:04:50.699> it's<00:04:50.940> really<00:04:51.030> fitting<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:52.410> voice

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
think it's really fitting the voice

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.370 
think it's really fitting the voice
acting<00:04:53.160> there's<00:04:53.940> some<00:04:54.180> dodgy<00:04:54.509> voice<00:04:54.930> acting

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
acting there's some dodgy voice acting

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.560 
acting there's some dodgy voice acting
in<00:04:55.500> this<00:04:55.620> as<00:04:55.919> pretty<00:04:56.699> hit<00:04:56.970> or<00:04:57.000> miss<00:04:57.150> I<00:04:57.509> would

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
in this as pretty hit or miss I would

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.629 
in this as pretty hit or miss I would
say<00:04:57.870> overall<00:04:58.229> it's<00:04:58.440> probably<00:04:58.979> best<00:04:59.250> describes

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
say overall it's probably best describes

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.790 
say overall it's probably best describes
is<00:04:59.789> cheesy<00:05:00.120> but<00:05:00.900> you<00:05:01.080> actually<00:05:01.229> get<00:05:01.590> some<00:05:01.770> of

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
is cheesy but you actually get some of

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.339 
is cheesy but you actually get some of
the<00:05:01.949> original<00:05:02.160> sonic<00:05:03.000> team<00:05:03.210> cast<00:05:03.990> members

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
the original sonic team cast members

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.230 
the original sonic team cast members
doing<00:05:04.560> some<00:05:04.710> of<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.860> voices<00:05:05.010> in<00:05:05.280> here<00:05:05.430> so<00:05:05.669> that

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
alone is pretty cool the graphics for

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:10.939 
alone is pretty cool the graphics for
the<00:05:09.720> time<00:05:09.930> of<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.110> Dreamcast<00:05:10.530> were<00:05:10.650> really

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949

colorful<00:05:16.260> I<00:05:17.960> would<00:05:18.960> say<00:05:19.169> though<00:05:19.349> that<00:05:19.590> the

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
colorful I would say though that the

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.080 
colorful I would say though that the
only<00:05:19.860> kind<00:05:20.099> of<00:05:20.220> weird<00:05:20.430> thing<00:05:20.639> was<00:05:20.820> is<00:05:20.940> that

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
only kind of weird thing was is that

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.420 
only kind of weird thing was is that
during<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.479> actual<00:05:22.190> cutscenes<00:05:23.190> in<00:05:23.280> this

during the actual cutscenes in this

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.500 
during the actual cutscenes in this
because<00:05:23.550> there<00:05:23.729> are<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.820> lot<00:05:23.940> of<00:05:23.970> cutscenes<00:05:24.419> and

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
because there are a lot of cutscenes and

though with any of the characters they
just<00:05:31.440> they<00:05:31.620> stalk<00:05:31.979> but<00:05:32.250> their<00:05:32.550> lips<00:05:32.820> remain

the time you get to I would say about

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.279 
the time you get to I would say about
level<00:05:49.560> 2<00:05:49.830> it<00:05:50.490> really<00:05:50.970> takes<00:05:51.599> things<00:05:51.900> over<00:05:52.169> the

level 2 it really takes things over the
top<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:52.740> really<00:05:52.889> doesn't<00:05:53.220> matter<00:05:53.400> pretty

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
top and really doesn't matter pretty

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.120 
top and really doesn't matter pretty
cheesy<00:05:54.120> manner<00:05:54.509> it's<00:05:54.810> it's<00:05:55.500> definitely<00:05:55.710> a

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
cheesy manner it's it's definitely a

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.370 
cheesy manner it's it's definitely a
quirky<00:05:56.669> title<00:05:57.090> I'll<00:05:57.210> say<00:05:57.419> that<00:05:57.690> if<00:05:57.990> anything

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
quirky title I'll say that if anything

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.740 
quirky title I'll say that if anything
else<00:05:58.590> I<00:05:58.710> mean<00:05:58.830> it<00:05:59.009> it<00:05:59.310> intentionally<00:06:00.150> tries<00:06:00.509> to

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
else I mean it it intentionally tries to

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.320 
else I mean it it intentionally tries to
make<00:06:00.900> you<00:06:01.050> laugh<00:06:01.199> during<00:06:01.620> some<00:06:02.009> points<00:06:02.400> but

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
make you laugh during some points but

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.290 
make you laugh during some points but
all<00:06:03.570> doing<00:06:03.930> it<00:06:04.110> in<00:06:04.259> this<00:06:04.380> sort<00:06:04.650> of<00:06:04.770> sinister

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
all doing it in this sort of sinister

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.410 
all doing it in this sort of sinister
kind<00:06:06.300> of<00:06:06.590> menacing<00:06:07.590> way<00:06:07.979> which<00:06:08.340> yeah

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
kind of menacing way which yeah

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.410 
kind of menacing way which yeah
I<00:06:09.450> have<00:06:10.080> to<00:06:10.170> say<00:06:10.320> it's<00:06:10.470> pretty<00:06:10.950> neat<00:06:11.240> you<00:06:12.240> get

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
I have to say it's pretty neat you get

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.330 
I have to say it's pretty neat you get
three<00:06:12.660> different<00:06:12.690> endings<00:06:13.320> for<00:06:13.590> this<00:06:13.740> you<00:06:14.220> get

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
three different endings for this you get

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.760 
three different endings for this you get
a<00:06:14.400> bad<00:06:14.640> ending<00:06:15.060> the<00:06:15.810> average<00:06:16.200> ending<00:06:16.530> and<00:06:16.680> then

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
a bad ending the average ending and then

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.070 
a bad ending the average ending and then
the<00:06:16.860> good<00:06:17.040> ending<00:06:17.310> so<00:06:17.880> I<00:06:18.420> thought<00:06:18.810> that<00:06:18.960> was

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
the good ending so I thought that was

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.990 
the good ending so I thought that was
pretty<00:06:19.260> neat<00:06:19.500> you<00:06:19.800> have<00:06:19.980> to<00:06:20.160> actually<00:06:20.700> makes

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
pretty neat you have to actually makes

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.370 
pretty neat you have to actually makes
you<00:06:21.090> think<00:06:21.240> there's<00:06:21.510> different<00:06:21.630> ways<00:06:21.930> of

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
you think there's different ways of

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.500 
you think there's different ways of
doing<00:06:22.500> different<00:06:23.490> playthroughs<00:06:24.120> so

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
doing different playthroughs so

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.120 
doing different playthroughs so
depending<00:06:25.080> on<00:06:25.170> how<00:06:25.260> you<00:06:25.320> do<00:06:25.560> your<00:06:25.590> playthrough

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
depending on how you do your playthrough

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.950 
depending on how you do your playthrough
and<00:06:26.340> the<00:06:26.460> game<00:06:26.640> will<00:06:27.090> reflect<00:06:27.450> what<00:06:27.690> kind<00:06:27.900> of

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
and the game will reflect what kind of

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.050 
and the game will reflect what kind of
ending<00:06:28.200> they<00:06:28.350> receive<00:06:28.680> and<00:06:29.610> of<00:06:29.670> course<00:06:29.880> the

yourself sadly there was no a sequel
made<00:06:39.660> for<00:06:39.870> this<00:06:39.990> this<00:06:40.110> was<00:06:40.260> made<00:06:40.440> by<00:06:40.470> a<00:06:40.620> company

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
made for this this was made by a company

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.940 
made for this this was made by a company
called<00:06:40.980> crazy<00:06:41.490> games<00:06:41.880> which<00:06:42.330> I<00:06:42.930> believe<00:06:43.410> I'm

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
called crazy games which I believe I'm

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.950 
called crazy games which I believe I'm
not<00:06:44.280> sure<00:06:44.490> if<00:06:44.970> it's<00:06:45.180> in<00:06:45.270> the<00:06:45.390> same<00:06:45.570> company<00:06:45.930> but

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
not sure if it's in the same company but

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.090 
not sure if it's in the same company but
I<00:06:46.110> think<00:06:46.350> they<00:06:46.440> might<00:06:46.560> have<00:06:46.620> had<00:06:46.800> and<00:06:46.980> had

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
I think they might have had and had

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.580 
I think they might have had and had
doing<00:06:47.310> another<00:06:47.520> game<00:06:47.700> called<00:06:48.030> new<00:06:48.210> stinger<00:06:48.690> or

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
doing another game called new stinger or

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.720 
doing another game called new stinger or
something<00:06:49.950> like<00:06:50.070> that<00:06:50.130> I<00:06:50.280> haven't<00:06:50.550> played

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
something like that I haven't played

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.070 
something like that I haven't played
that<00:06:50.970> game<00:06:51.120> yet<00:06:51.330> although<00:06:51.480> I've<00:06:51.660> been<00:06:51.690> wanting

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
that game yet although I've been wanting

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.680 
that game yet although I've been wanting
to<00:06:52.130> but<00:06:53.130> this<00:06:53.250> game<00:06:53.430> is<00:06:53.550> much<00:06:54.090> better<00:06:54.390> from

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
to but this game is much better from

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.330 
to but this game is much better from
what<00:06:54.840> I've<00:06:55.020> what<00:06:55.530> I've<00:06:55.650> seen<00:06:55.830> of<00:06:56.040> actual

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
what I've what I've seen of actual

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.530 
what I've what I've seen of actual
gameplay<00:06:56.490> boosting<00:06:57.090> or<00:06:57.180> this<00:06:57.300> one<00:06:57.450> is

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.540 
gameplay boosting or this one is

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.170 
gameplay boosting or this one is
probably<00:06:57.750> a<00:06:58.170> lot<00:06:58.440> better<00:06:58.470> than<00:06:58.950> and<00:06:59.130> sadly<00:06:59.910> it

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
probably a lot better than and sadly it

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.200 
probably a lot better than and sadly it
was<00:07:00.570> actually<00:07:01.050> planned<00:07:01.410> for<00:07:02.400> an<00:07:02.610> import<00:07:02.970> to
