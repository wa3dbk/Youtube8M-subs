cutting<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> non-value-added<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:41.520> make

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
cutting out the non-value-added we make

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.670 
cutting out the non-value-added we make
companies<00:01:42.090> more<00:01:42.270> efficient<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:43.320> reduce

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
companies more efficient they reduce

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.200 
companies more efficient they reduce
their<00:01:43.890> costs<00:01:44.220> internally<00:01:44.729> they<00:01:44.880> improve

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
their costs internally they improve

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.440 
their costs internally they improve
their<00:01:45.240> capacity<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:45.960> produce<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:47.360> they're<00:01:48.360> in

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
their capacity to produce and they're in

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.999 
their capacity to produce and they're in
a<00:01:48.509> better<00:01:48.630> profit<00:01:49.140> position<00:01:49.560> once<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:49.950> do

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
a better profit position once they do

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.380 
a better profit position once they do
that<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.729> think<00:01:50.759> there's<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.149> lot<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that so I think there's a lot of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.510 
that so I think there's a lot of
misconceptions<00:01:52.259> about<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.649> word<00:01:52.890> lean<00:01:53.220> but

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
misconceptions about the word lean but

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.490 
misconceptions about the word lean but
essentially<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.140> main

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
essentially it's it's just main

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
essentially it's it's just main

it's going to be very competitive for

years to come and that's you know

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.250 
years to come and that's you know
certainly<00:02:32.480> why<00:02:32.630> we've<00:02:32.810> got<00:02:32.960> to<00:02:33.080> drive

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
certainly why we've got to drive

certainly why we've got to drive
efficiencies<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.070> our<00:02:34.160> operation<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.940> think

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
efficiencies in our operation I think

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.030 
efficiencies in our operation I think
it's<00:02:35.510> really<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.140> kind<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.650> got<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:36.890> look

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
it's really that you kind of got to look

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.310 
it's really that you kind of got to look

we do from customer service to the way

we do from customer service to the way

that we interact with our clients and

that we interact with our clients and
what<00:02:54.290> kind<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.500> products<00:02:54.920> would<00:02:55.010> deliver<00:02:55.280> the

what kind of products would deliver the

what kind of products would deliver the

market and make sure that everything's

in<00:02:57.680> line<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:58.190> really<00:02:58.430> use<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.640> team

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
in line and you really use that team

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.120 
in line and you really use that team
approach<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.750> we've<00:03:00.230> done<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:00.890> think

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
approach and we've done that and I think

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.000 
approach and we've done that and I think
it<00:03:01.459> can<00:03:01.610> be<00:03:01.780> successful<00:03:02.780> for<00:03:02.930> any<00:03:03.110> small<00:03:03.770> to

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
it can be successful for any small to

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.740 
it can be successful for any small to
large<00:03:04.160> firm<00:03:04.520> that<00:03:04.790> wants<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.180> be<00:03:05.420> successful

in<00:03:06.020> today's<00:03:06.110> tough<00:03:06.800> environment<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.490> think

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
in today's tough environment I think

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.570 
in today's tough environment I think
what<00:03:08.540> really<00:03:08.780> exposed<00:03:09.260> itself<00:03:09.560> today<00:03:09.770> is<00:03:10.160> this

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
what really exposed itself today is this

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.010 
what really exposed itself today is this
is<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.790> lot<00:03:10.940> easier<00:03:11.090> process<00:03:11.480> than<00:03:11.810> people

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
is a lot easier process than people

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.050 
is a lot easier process than people
think<00:03:12.170> that's<00:03:12.800> just<00:03:12.890> going<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.190> begin<00:03:13.459> they

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
think that's just going to begin they

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.460 
think that's just going to begin they
got<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.300> measure<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:14.810> they<00:03:14.930> can<00:03:15.050> manage<00:03:15.350> it

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
got to measure it so they can manage it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.560 
got to measure it so they can manage it
begin<00:03:16.220> small<00:03:16.550> work<00:03:16.850> your<00:03:17.030> way<00:03:17.150> up<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.390> that's

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
begin small work your way up and that's

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.509 
begin small work your way up and that's
exactly<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.019> pre<00:03:18.200> did<00:03:18.440> that's<00:03:18.860> exactly<00:03:19.310> right

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
exactly the pre did that's exactly right

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.090 
exactly the pre did that's exactly right
even<00:03:19.910> in<00:03:20.030> helping<00:03:20.239> their<00:03:20.390> cycle<00:03:20.750> time<00:03:21.100> reduce

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
even in helping their cycle time reduce

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.440 
even in helping their cycle time reduce
their<00:03:22.250> cycle<00:03:22.519> time<00:03:22.640> increase<00:03:23.239> customer

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
their cycle time increase customer

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.210 
their cycle time increase customer
satisfaction<00:03:23.630> yeah<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.680> think<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.010> key<00:03:25.190> is

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
satisfaction yeah and I think the key is

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.400 
satisfaction yeah and I think the key is
every<00:03:25.550> company<00:03:26.000> wants<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.420> grow<00:03:26.600> what<00:03:26.870> every

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
every company wants to grow what every

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.110 
every company wants to grow what every
company<00:03:27.830> wants<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.220> drop<00:03:28.400> more<00:03:28.580> money<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:28.910> the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
company wants to drop more money to the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.640 
company wants to drop more money to the
bottom<00:03:29.420> line<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:30.140> think<00:03:30.380> what's<00:03:30.560> really

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
bottom line and I think what's really

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.400 
bottom line and I think what's really
important<00:03:31.550> is<00:03:31.670> that<00:03:31.700> senior<00:03:32.390> management<00:03:33.019> from

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
important is that senior management from

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.979 
important is that senior management from
the<00:03:33.560> President<00:03:34.040> on<00:03:34.130> down<00:03:34.510> recognize<00:03:35.510> that<00:03:35.780> and

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
the President on down recognize that and

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.660 
the President on down recognize that and
the<00:03:36.110> key<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.470> change<00:03:36.769> is<00:03:36.950> empowering<00:03:37.489> the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
the key to change is empowering the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.670 
the key to change is empowering the
employees<00:03:38.180> because<00:03:38.780> that's<00:03:39.019> who<00:03:39.290> does<00:03:39.500> all

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
employees because that's who does all

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.000
