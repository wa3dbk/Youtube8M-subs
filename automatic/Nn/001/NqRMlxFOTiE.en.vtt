00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.750
 the market will continue to evolve

 pace despite 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.130
 quality is known 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.130
 which has developed in the global economy 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.150
 if so then 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.970
 will do the Magomeds asking

 building a case of houses and sports became 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.120
 one of the priorities 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.490
 energy in recent years 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.479
 some polysilicon defects if you 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.470
 want to do it

 them 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.190
 tried to find due to the fact that

 breed corporation technology 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.450
 respect him 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.530
 on base here

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:10.789
 panel assembly 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.239
 and then build the power plant

 working on solar 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.029
 building a factory occupying as a rule 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.589
 not more than three years

 designing each other that is for 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:22.959
 four years, you can go to the project 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:23.889
 power 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.049
 this enterprise is that rare case 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.589
 when she gets into the starting complex on

 solar cell manufacturing 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:31.600
 10 years ago 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.510
 for the first time, of course, while accurate models and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.830
 applying a new way

 wiring plastic 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.499
 at the same time well, someone patented 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:41.699
 technology so-called 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.839
 photo polymer which allowed 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.509
 do and not just such

 oversized win he had 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.079
 do not use as substrate 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.519
 just glass but

 power cndr cushion bassinet 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:56.690
 this is our country to refuse 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.800
 of the most durable latitudes planned 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.550
 what in 10 years in Russia 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.080
 power generation and 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.660
 renewable sources 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.340
 will increase several times
