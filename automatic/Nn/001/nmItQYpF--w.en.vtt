screws on the front and two on the

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.090 
screws on the front and two on the
inside<00:01:01.449> of<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.870> durometer<00:01:02.260> these<00:01:02.620> sissies

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
inside of the durometer these sissies

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.050 
inside of the durometer these sissies
I've<00:01:03.910> already<00:01:04.180> released<00:01:04.750> them

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.369 
take it off the pulley on the bottom too
but<00:03:08.890> this<00:03:09.069> works<00:03:09.340> just<00:03:09.610> fine

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
but this works just fine

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.440 
but this works just fine
working<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:12.249> back

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.250 

for<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.870> belt<00:03:16.110> off

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.420 

okay<00:03:19.739> now<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.340> take<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:22.160> drum

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
okay now you can take this drum

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:35.890 
okay now you can take this drum
just<00:03:24.730> pull<00:03:24.969> it<00:03:25.120> through<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.900> set<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.319> aside

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.350 

that<00:03:36.290> Bell<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.799> cracked<00:03:37.250> but<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.150> actually

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
that Bell is cracked but I actually

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.740 
that Bell is cracked but I actually
reused<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.230> works<00:03:39.500> fine<00:03:40.150> just<00:03:41.150> unclip<00:03:41.720> that

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
reused it works fine just unclip that

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.949 
reused it works fine just unclip that
from<00:03:42.319> either<00:03:42.439> side

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
from either side

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.050 
from either side
that's<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.290> electrical<00:03:46.069> harness<00:03:46.430> on<00:03:46.610> them<00:03:46.790> on

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
that's the electrical harness on them on

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.880 
that's the electrical harness on them on
the<00:03:47.360> motor<00:03:48.819> unplug<00:03:49.819> that<00:03:50.439> now<00:03:51.439> that's<00:03:51.650> all

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
fingers you unclip it you have to push

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.280 
fingers you unclip it you have to push
down<00:04:00.769> with<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.250> flathead<00:04:01.640> screwdriver<00:04:02.290> it's

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
down with a flathead screwdriver it's

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.470 
down with a flathead screwdriver it's
not<00:04:03.470> really<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:03.890> out<00:04:04.040> pushing<00:04:04.849> out<00:04:05.000> motion

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
not really the out pushing out motion

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.869 
not really the out pushing out motion
it's<00:04:05.659> pushing<00:04:06.109> down<00:04:06.379> and<00:04:07.370> push<00:04:07.609> down

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
it's pushing down and push down

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.839 
it's pushing down and push down
extremely<00:04:08.450> hard<00:04:09.170> with<00:04:09.980> all<00:04:10.190> your<00:04:10.400> might<00:04:10.609> and

down<00:04:20.140> on<00:04:20.620> it

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
down on it

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.900 
down on it
and<00:04:22.200> those<00:04:22.530> clips<00:04:22.889> pop<00:04:23.190> loose<00:04:23.690> push<00:04:24.690> down

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.709 

this<00:04:29.420> takes<00:04:30.170> a<00:04:30.350> few<00:04:30.590> minutes

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:31.719 
this takes a few minutes

took<00:04:32.049> me<00:04:32.199> a<00:04:32.289> few<00:04:32.319> minutes<00:04:32.649> per<00:04:33.039> clip

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
took me a few minutes per clip

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.760 
took me a few minutes per clip
you<00:04:35.150> know<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.419> don't<00:04:35.599> really<00:04:35.780> pop<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.259> out<00:04:36.439> you

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
they're not very easy to get off

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.180 
they're not very easy to get off
pretty<00:05:15.069> stubborn

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
pretty stubborn

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:24.240 
pretty stubborn
first<00:05:16.790> down<00:05:17.060> really<00:05:17.780> hard

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.150 

okay<00:05:25.000> see<00:05:25.060> how<00:05:25.480> these<00:05:25.660> this<00:05:26.410> blue<00:05:26.650> thing<00:05:26.860> is

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.320 
okay see how these this blue thing is
sitting<00:05:27.670> in<00:05:27.910> there

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
sitting in there

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.870 
sitting in there
that's<00:05:29.720> where<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.020> needs<00:05:30.169> to<00:05:30.289> sick

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.179 

I<00:05:32.910> think<00:05:33.060> it's<00:05:33.180> not<00:05:33.450> just<00:05:33.480> on<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.900> bottom

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:36.189 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.879 

really<00:05:36.729> install<00:05:37.149> it<00:05:37.330> wrong<00:05:37.569> but<00:05:38.409> it<00:05:38.529> does<00:05:38.709> need

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
really install it wrong but it does need

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.510 
really install it wrong but it does need
to<00:05:39.069> sit<00:05:39.550> in<00:05:39.849> these<00:05:39.999> brackets<00:05:40.830> just<00:05:41.830> like<00:05:42.039> you

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
to sit in these brackets just like you

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.070 
to sit in these brackets just like you
see<00:05:42.759> here<00:05:42.969> and<00:05:43.119> you<00:05:43.209> clip<00:05:43.419> anyone

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
see here and you clip anyone

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.839 
see here and you clip anyone
yeah<00:05:45.500> there's<00:05:45.710> the<00:05:45.889> new<00:05:46.009> one<00:05:46.220> it's<00:05:46.370> actually

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
yeah there's the new one it's actually

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.270 
yeah there's the new one it's actually
sort<00:05:47.150> of<00:05:47.240> facing<00:05:47.509> up<00:05:47.870> more<00:05:48.169> and<00:05:48.650> a<00:05:49.069> harness

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
sort of facing up more and a harness

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.059 
sort of facing up more and a harness
there's<00:05:49.669> more<00:05:49.879> on<00:05:50.000> top<00:05:50.240> than<00:05:50.509> on<00:05:50.629> the<00:05:50.750> side<00:05:51.069> but

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:52.069 
there's more on top than on the side but

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:55.909 
there's more on top than on the side but
it's<00:05:52.340> not<00:05:52.669> so<00:05:53.210> that's<00:05:53.419> the<00:05:53.629> way<00:05:53.750> it<00:05:53.900> goes

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
it's not so that's the way it goes

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.939 
it's not so that's the way it goes
that's<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.669> way<00:05:56.819> it<00:05:57.270> went<00:05:57.389> three<00:05:57.689> now<00:05:58.199> that<00:05:58.409> is

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
that's the way it went three now that is

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.920 
that's the way it went three now that is
as<00:05:59.159> a<00:05:59.189> half<00:05:59.639> inch<00:05:59.909> piece<00:06:00.270> of<00:06:00.330> heater<00:06:00.659> hose

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
as a half inch piece of heater hose

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.469 
as a half inch piece of heater hose
because<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.770> inside<00:06:02.159> busted<00:06:02.789> and<00:06:02.969> I<00:06:03.060> reuse

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
because the inside busted and I reuse
