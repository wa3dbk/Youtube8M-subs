00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
okay so today I'm going to show you my

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.919 
okay so today I'm going to show you my
my<00:00:07.109> setup<00:00:07.620> here<00:00:08.240> I've<00:00:09.240> got<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.719> plans<00:00:10.080> off<00:00:10.800> of

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
my setup here I've got the plans off of

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.430 
my setup here I've got the plans off of
window<00:00:12.929> farms<00:00:13.200> org<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.719> they<00:00:15.719> basically<00:00:16.170> have

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
window farms org and they basically have

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.490 
window farms org and they basically have
a<00:00:16.880> hydroponic<00:00:17.880> setup<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.260> can<00:00:19.380> grow

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
a hydroponic setup so that you can grow

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.070 
a hydroponic setup so that you can grow
plants<00:00:19.949> indoors<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:21.330> uses<00:00:21.510> recycled

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
plants indoors and it uses recycled

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.750 
plants indoors and it uses recycled
parts<00:00:22.910> now<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.970> already<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:25.760> glass

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
parts now I already have this this glass

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.519 
parts now I already have this this glass
here<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.210> I've<00:00:27.300> used<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.840> use<00:00:27.990> as<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> fish

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
here that I've used to use as a fish

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.970 
here that I've used to use as a fish
tank<00:00:29.179> the<00:00:30.179> pump<00:00:30.630> died<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> long<00:00:31.289> time<00:00:31.349> ago<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.830> I

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
tank the pump died a long time ago so I

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.799 
tank the pump died a long time ago so I
had<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> go<00:00:32.250> buy<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> new<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.030> basically<00:00:33.690> I

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
had to go buy a new one and basically I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.990 
had to go buy a new one and basically I
just<00:00:33.989> use<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.710> plans<00:00:35.040> from<00:00:35.370> version<00:00:35.790> 2

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
just use that the plans from version 2

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.280 
just use that the plans from version 2
point<00:00:36.300> 0<00:00:36.950> because<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> didn't<00:00:38.280> want<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:39.050> use<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
point 0 because I didn't want to use the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.130 
point 0 because I didn't want to use the
more<00:00:40.440> complex<00:00:40.829> version<00:00:41.100> 3<00:00:41.790> setup<00:00:42.750> which<00:00:42.930> I'll

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
more complex version 3 setup which I'll

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.610 
more complex version 3 setup which I'll
try<00:00:43.500> next<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.370> successful<00:00:45.260> one<00:00:46.260> one

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
try next if this is successful one one

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.750 
try next if this is successful one one
of<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.770> other<00:00:46.890> things<00:00:46.980> i<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.430> about<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
of the other things i like about the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.139 
of the other things i like about the
version<00:00:48.059> 2<00:00:48.239> point<00:00:48.539> 0<00:00:48.629> ver<00:00:48.780> versus<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> 3<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.789> that

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
version 2 point 0 ver versus a 3 is that

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.270 
version 2 point 0 ver versus a 3 is that
it<00:00:51.329> does<00:00:51.480> use<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> tank<00:00:52.500> down<00:00:52.739> below<00:00:53.070> because

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
it does use a tank down below because

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.479 
it does use a tank down below because
although<00:00:54.149> i'm<00:00:54.510> doing<00:00:54.930> hydroponics<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:56.129> start

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
although i'm doing hydroponics to start

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.430 
although i'm doing hydroponics to start
out<00:00:56.719> ultimately<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.260> an

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
out ultimately I want this to be an

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.160 
out ultimately I want this to be an
aquaponics<00:00:59.100> setup<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.670> fish<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.329> plants

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
aquaponics setup with fish and plants

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.979 
aquaponics setup with fish and plants
and<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.160> introducing<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.629> few

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and you know introducing as few

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.800 
and you know introducing as few
nutrients<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.619> necessary<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.030> fact<00:01:06.240> I'm

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
nutrients as necessary and in fact I'm

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960 
nutrients as necessary and in fact I'm
hoping<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.350> my<00:01:07.560> worms<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.400> feed<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.760> fish

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
hoping to use my worms to feed the fish

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.710 
hoping to use my worms to feed the fish
so<00:01:09.330> we'll<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.659> how<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.780> goes<00:01:11.090> anyway<00:01:12.090> what

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
so we'll see how that goes anyway what

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.510 
so we'll see how that goes anyway what
I'm<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.110> right<00:01:13.140> now<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.340> want

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
I'm going to do right now is I just want

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.170 
I'm going to do right now is I just want
to<00:01:14.549> test<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.939> air<00:01:15.119> pump<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.320> plans<00:01:16.590> call<00:01:16.890> for

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
to test the air pump the plans call for

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.219 
to test the air pump the plans call for
4<00:01:18.180> 3<00:01:18.570> 1.5<00:01:19.400> liter<00:01:20.630> bottles<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.810> are<00:01:21.869> stacked

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
4 3 1.5 liter bottles that are stacked

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.340 
4 3 1.5 liter bottles that are stacked
one<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.500> top<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> other<00:01:23.100> vertically<00:01:24.350> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
one on top of the other vertically and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.499 
one on top of the other vertically and
right<00:01:26.280> now<00:01:26.430> I'm<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.970> test<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
right now I'm just going to test the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.219 
right now I'm just going to test the
height<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.560> air<00:01:28.740> pump<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.329> I<00:01:30.329> noticed

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
height of the air pump and I noticed

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.039 
height of the air pump and I noticed
that<00:01:31.320> as<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.220> add<00:01:33.060> more<00:01:33.090> water<00:01:33.750> into

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
that as you as you add more water into

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.770 
that as you as you add more water into
the<00:01:34.290> tank<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:35.280> water<00:01:35.759> coming<00:01:36.509> out<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> air

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the tank the water coming out of the air

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.830 
the tank the water coming out of the air
pump<00:01:37.020> goes<00:01:37.200> higher<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.850> initially<00:01:39.540> started

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
pump goes higher so I initially started

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.100 
pump goes higher so I initially started
about<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.159> nothing<00:01:41.790> came<00:01:41.970> out<00:01:42.119> nothing<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
about here nothing came out nothing and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.810 
about here nothing came out nothing and
then<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.350> around<00:01:43.470> there<00:01:43.799> water<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.549> start

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
then right around there water to start

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.760 
then right around there water to start
to<00:01:44.939> come<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.509> stopped<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.619> thought

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
to come up and I stopped and I thought

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.580 
to come up and I stopped and I thought
that's<00:01:46.920> good<00:01:47.220> enough<00:01:47.689> but<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.930> found<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that's good enough but I found that the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.130 
that's good enough but I found that the
height<00:01:49.770> wasn't<00:01:50.220> wasn't<00:01:50.729> enough<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.840> I've<00:01:52.110> just

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
height wasn't wasn't enough so I've just

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.160 
height wasn't wasn't enough so I've just
filled<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.100> way<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.930> now<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> think

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
filled it up all the way and now I think

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.899 
filled it up all the way and now I think
we're<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.920> able<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.189> achieve<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
we're going to be able to achieve the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.719 
we're going to be able to achieve the
height<00:01:57.329> necessary<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:57.990> three<00:01:58.200> bottles

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
height necessary for three bottles

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.039 
height necessary for three bottles
there's<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.820> fridge<00:02:00.090> magnet<00:02:00.659> that's<00:02:00.810> why<00:02:00.960> I've

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
there's a fridge magnet that's why I've

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.139 
there's a fridge magnet that's why I've
got<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> set<00:02:01.530> near<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.829> fridge<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:02.969> and

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
got the set near the fridge up here and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.969 
got the set near the fridge up here and
that<00:02:03.299> sort<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> reflects<00:02:04.079> how<00:02:04.320> high<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:04.829> need

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
that sort of reflects how high we need

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770 
that sort of reflects how high we need
to<00:02:05.070> go<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.579> right<00:02:06.240> now<00:02:06.270> I'm<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
to go so right now I'm just going to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.060 
to go so right now I'm just going to
turn<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.079> air<00:02:07.770> pump<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.310> we're

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
turn on the air pump and we're

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
turn on the air pump and we're
we're<00:02:10.070> going<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.250> check<00:02:10.460> it<00:02:10.640> out<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.760> see<00:02:10.940> how

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
we're going to check it out and see how

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.340 
we're going to check it out and see how
this<00:02:11.330> air<00:02:11.540> lift<00:02:11.780> mechanism<00:02:11.960> works<00:02:14.260> okay<00:02:15.260> so

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
this air lift mechanism works okay so

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.670 
this air lift mechanism works okay so
this<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.950> tube<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.430> when<00:02:17.330> it's<00:02:17.450> all<00:02:17.570> done

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
this is the tube and when it's all done

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.200 
this is the tube and when it's all done
there's<00:02:18.680> going<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.980> be<00:02:19.040> probably<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.700> bamboo

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
there's going to be probably a bamboo

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.360 
there's going to be probably a bamboo
stick<00:02:20.870> or<00:02:21.200> something<00:02:21.350> holding<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.950> nice<00:02:22.130> and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
stick or something holding it nice and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.190 
stick or something holding it nice and
straight<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:23.150> needs<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.510> get<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:23.960> height

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
straight it needs to get to this height

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.070 
straight it needs to get to this height
here<00:02:24.470> where<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.250> magnet<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.840> then<00:02:26.960> I'll

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
here where the magnet is and then I'll

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.080 
here where the magnet is and then I'll
just<00:02:27.110> lop<00:02:27.860> off<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.250> wrist<00:02:28.400> you'll<00:02:28.790> see<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
just lop off the wrist you'll see the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.080 
just lop off the wrist you'll see the
set<00:02:29.270> up<00:02:29.360> later<00:02:29.570> once<00:02:29.810> it's<00:02:30.020> done<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:31.340> anyway

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
set up later once it's done but anyway

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.470 
set up later once it's done but anyway
right<00:02:32.300> now<00:02:32.480> we're<00:02:32.600> just<00:02:32.630> going<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.930> turn<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.200> on

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.730 

okay<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.810> can<00:02:38.930> see<00:02:39.280> water's<00:02:40.280> coming<00:02:40.310> up

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
okay so you can see water's coming up

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.740 
okay so you can see water's coming up
making<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.770> mess<00:02:42.950> all<00:02:43.100> over<00:02:43.190> my<00:02:43.490> kitchen<00:02:43.850> floor

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.460 

and<00:02:47.750> I've<00:02:47.960> got<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.170> two<00:02:48.590> buck<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:50.470> yeah

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
and I've got the two buck and yeah

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.270 
and I've got the two buck and yeah
that's<00:02:51.770> working<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:52.670> perfect<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.680> think<00:02:55.160> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
that's working so perfect so I think the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.770 
that's working so perfect so I think the
next<00:02:55.310> step<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.850> finish<00:02:56.120> off<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.540> project

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
next step is to finish off the project

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.980 
next step is to finish off the project
and<00:02:57.290> exam<00:02:58.190> get<00:02:58.640> some<00:02:58.910> plants<00:02:59.330> happening<00:02:59.720> so

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
and exam get some plants happening so

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.430 
and exam get some plants happening so
that'll<00:03:00.200> be<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.380> next<00:03:00.590> video<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:02.260> one<00:03:03.260> more

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
that'll be the next video and one more

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.210 
that'll be the next video and one more
thing<00:03:03.470> if<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.010> can<00:03:04.160> just<00:03:04.550> listen<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.210> that<00:03:05.240> I

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
thing if you can just listen to that I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.640 
thing if you can just listen to that I
think<00:03:07.220> that's<00:03:07.370> that's<00:03:07.700> pretty<00:03:07.880> loud<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:09.530> it

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
think that's that's pretty loud and it

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.140 
think that's that's pretty loud and it
will<00:03:09.770> get<00:03:09.890> annoying<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.490> have<00:03:10.610> that<00:03:10.790> running

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
will get annoying to have that running

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.800 
will get annoying to have that running

vitamin<00:03:32.630> bottle<00:03:32.960> and<00:03:35.260> cut<00:03:36.260> out<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:37.130> top

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
vitamin bottle and cut out the the top

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.630 
vitamin bottle and cut out the the top
four<00:03:39.230> little<00:03:39.410> holes<00:03:39.650> on<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:39.980> bottom<00:03:40.100> just

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
four little holes on the bottom just

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.540 
four little holes on the bottom just
like<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.940> instructions<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.800> in<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:43.220> plan

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
like the instructions and in the plan

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.280 
like the instructions and in the plan
for<00:03:43.940> version<00:03:44.210> to<00:03:44.360> say<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:46.990> i'm<00:03:47.990> just<00:03:48.080> going<00:03:48.260> to

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
for version to say and i'm just going to

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.750 
for version to say and i'm just going to
turn<00:03:48.440> on<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.620> pump<00:03:48.890> real<00:03:49.070> quick<00:03:49.250> with<00:03:49.730> the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
turn on the pump real quick with the

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.240 
turn on the pump real quick with the
filter<00:03:50.330> off<00:03:50.570> and<00:03:51.020> then<00:03:51.560> with<00:03:51.740> it<00:03:51.770> on<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.160> you

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
filter off and then with it on so you

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:00.130 
filter off and then with it on so you
can<00:03:52.310> hear<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.820> difference

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.449 

so<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.500> can<00:04:01.650> hear<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:01.800> it's<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.160> little<00:04:02.190> bit

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
so you can hear that it's a little bit

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.920 
so you can hear that it's a little bit
loud<00:04:02.730> um<00:04:03.230> kind<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.260> annoying<00:04:05.420> and<00:04:06.420> i'll<00:04:06.599> spit

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
loud um kind of annoying and i'll spit

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:15.820 
loud um kind of annoying and i'll spit
on

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.340 

and<00:04:16.430> that's<00:04:16.610> actually<00:04:16.820> I'm<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.360> lot<00:04:17.720> quieter

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.510 

there's<00:04:21.350> there<00:04:21.709> might<00:04:21.890> be<00:04:21.920> a<00:04:22.040> couple<00:04:22.220> of<00:04:22.430> other

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
there's there might be a couple of other
