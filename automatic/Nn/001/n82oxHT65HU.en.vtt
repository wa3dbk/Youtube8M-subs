00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:12.446
 Welcome to the League of Legends Champion Spotlight, featuring, Jax, the Grandmaster at Arms. 

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:23.290
 Jax is a melee fighter and duelist, adept at killing one target at a time while surviving enemy attacks around. 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:36.837
 His passive is Relentless Assault. Every time Jax hits a basic attack, he gets an attack speed bonus for a few seconds. This bonus stacks multiple times, up to a limit. 

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:46.179
 Leap Strike causes Jax to launch into the minion, monster, champion, or ward target, either ally or enemy. If the target is an enemy, Jax deals damage to him. 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.353
 Maximizo Leap Strike at level 13 for mobility and damage, taking a point at level 3 in the jungle or level 1 on the lane. 

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:57.758
 Empower causes Jax's next basic attack to deal bonus damage. 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.664
 This ability resets Jax's attack time, meaning you can use it for a free attack. 

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:10.704
 Additionally, if you activate Empower before Leap Strike, it will deal damage over Leap Strike. 

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:15.842
 For maximum damage, maximize Empower at level 9 with your first point at level 2. 

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:22.382
 Counter-Strike gives Jax a buff for a few seconds, causing him to deflect any attack against him for a short time. 

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:29.923
 At the end of this duration Jax stuns and takes damage from all nearby enemies. Counter-Strike takes damage based on how many attacks Jax has deflected. 

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:36.163
 Take an early point and maximize last. When in jungle, take level 1. 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:47.510
 Jax's ultimate is Grandmaster's Might. Passively, it deals bonus damage for the third consecutive attack that Jax makes, although this counter resets if Jax takes too long to attack. 

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:52.850
 When activated, it immediately receives bonus damage in attack damage and ability power for a few seconds. 

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:57.280
 Jax game as jungler, starting with Counter-Strike and a Vampiric Scepter. 

00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:02.020
 When you reach level 3 and get Leap Strike and kill the Lizard Elder, try to make a gank. 

00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:06.330
 I see Annie the enemy in the mid lane. I approach the brush and notice my companion. 

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:12.260
 Use Ghost, Active Counter-Strike, and Leap Strike on Reach. I'm stunned and continue to do more damage with Empower. 

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:16.770
 As soon as my partner uses Flash to reach the stun, we get the first blood. 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.980
 Look specifically for ganks in which your lane is being pulled into the tower. Note that the enemy team is at the top of the lane bot. 

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:28.550
 Even though I'm on the other side of the map, this placement represents free kills. 

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:34.590
 As soon as I show up, I turn on Counter-Strike and walk to the brush. Seeing Vayne running, I use Leap Strike and I kill Empower. 

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:42.830
 Then I'm looking for my next target, picking the one with less life, Warwick. Although he has used Flash, he still gets to kill with the Lizard's buff. 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:50.700
 After Gangplank retreats I go to Dragon. Using Wriggle's Lantern, I use ward on the most used route for my opponents to gankar me and I overturn the Dragon. 

00:02:50.704 --> 00:03:01.680
 Relentless Assault's massive attack speed correlates well with bonus damage from Wriggle's Lantern, Empower, and Grandmaster's Might, resulting in a much faster Dragon death than any other champion. 

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:09.790
 When fighting head-to-head, take special care in reserving Leap Strike and Counter-Strike, as they are your only tools to catch enemies on the run. 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.500
 As soon as Ganko Yorick on the lane top, I start with a basic attack and an immediate Empower, giving me two almost instant attacks. 

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.900
 As he starts to run, I link Counter-Strike to the stun. 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:26.040
 Yorick survives the Leap Strike, so I approach with Ghost for another Empower and the active passive for Grandmaster's Might, earning a kill. 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:30.810
 Remember that Leap Strike can be used in your wards as a way to escape. 

00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:34.750
 As soon as a teamfight begins, both Warwick and Gangplank focus on their ultimatums. 

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:40.320
 While I was sure to die normally, I leave a sight ward and leave Cannon Barage with Leap Strike. 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.920
 As they continue to follow me, active Counter-Strike to smooth out more damage. 

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:52.230
 Since they will not give up, I leave a second ward through the wall of Baron Nashor, jump to it, and barely escape with less than 100 lives. 

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:56.800
 In teamfights, try not to go forward since you are better damaging than initiator. 

00:03:56.803 --> 00:04:01.780
 Yorick and Warwick jump into Annie, then use Leap Strike and start beating them. 

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:05.780
 After picking up two kills, I move to the most important target of the fight: Vayne. 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:11.680
 Between Leap Strike and Ghost, I hold myself close to her, forcing her to run while my team cleans the rest of the fight. 

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:19.390
 Despite using Condemn, I knock her down inside her base, forcing her companions to back away, and allowing my allies to focus on the enemy Nexus. 

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:25.260
 When fighting for capture points in Dominion, focus on enemy defenders and let your teammates capture. 

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:32.540
 As soon as we fight in the Boneyard I activate Counter-Strike and immediately jump into Lee Sin with Leap Strike and Empower, taking him quickly. 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:38.640
 Now four against one, I'm going to Leona. My aggression pulls her close as Karma begins to capture. 

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:44.150
 Leona comes back to interrupt Karma but becomes an easy kill, giving us a clean control of the point. 

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:50.490
 Jax's skill set makes him one of the best duelers in the game. I go into a fight against Tryndamere. 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.730
 I hit a basic attack and then immediately activate Empower to take a second hit. 

00:04:54.728 --> 00:05:02.700
 My third active attack Grandsmaster's Might and I active Counter-Strike to smooth his damage, taking Tryndamere to life 1 while I have not lost any. 

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:11.210
 He uses Exhaust on me and connects his ultimate, so I run until Undying Rage ends. Hit a Leap Strike as soon as it ends, taking the kill and control of Refinery. 

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:20.390
 For runes, I get Fixed Attack Damage Marks, Fixed Armor Seals, Attack Speed ​​Glyphs, and Fixed Attack Damage Quintessences. 

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:27.490
 This combination is aimed at giving me a high jungle speed and great damage through my basic attacks and physical abilities. 

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:35.500
 In Classic, my Masteries are 26/4/0, taking all that is possible in increase of physical damage in Offense and reduction of damage of minions in Defense. 

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:40.240
 Also get Smite and Ghost to jungle, mastering the two. 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.650
 In Dominion, I put the 30 points in Offense, adding magic penetration and replacing Smite with Ignite. 

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:54.620
 In Classic start with a Vampiric Scepter when in jungle, add Boots of Speed ​​and upgrade to Wriggle's Lantern. 

00:05:54.621 --> 00:06:02.030
 Then consider Mercury's Treads or Ninja Tabi, depending on which type of damage is most relevant. Take Phage first while doing a Trinity Force. 

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:12.100
 Always be sure to survive the enemy team, consider items like Atma's Impaler and Guardian Angel for physical damage or Hexdrinker and Quicksilver Sash against spells. 

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:16.040
 When you want more damage, look for Hextech Gunblade and Guinsoo's Rageblade. 

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:22.580
 In Dominion, you will have similar purposes. Start with Prospector's Blade, Boots of Speed, and two Health Potions. 

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:25.920
 Choose between Ninja Tabi or Mercury's Treads based on the type of damage. 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.020
 Then consider a number of damage options like Trinity Force, Hextech Gunblade, and Guinsoo's Rageblade. 

00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:34.830
 If necessary, choose defensive options like Odyn's Veil, and Guardian Angel. 

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:44.500
