00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.950
 as pope, modestly went into an attempt 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.780
 j om hood or once in the first session 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.789
 I intervened then I have a deep crisis of moves 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.630
 and the first reaction was to sporza one time she neatly credited 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.320
 bye 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.320
 spurs 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.520
 true romance 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.260
 so cash teams 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.120
 and then it is decided 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.120
 with a bit faster 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.620
 the latter is now 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.810
 watch the clock stand out 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.230
 the Hague 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.230
 is over 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:26.929
 he is a scout anp 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.319
 per hour 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.999
 He skipped them 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.999
 sits back comfortably 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:39.109
 both are real 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.329
 that something happened 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.529
 nobody expected 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.699
 maybe right 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.589
 but certainly not kasparov 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.519
 certainly not all journalists 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.999
 now the audience 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.999
 this was so unexpected 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.489
 when I'm playing here 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.239
 in a few hours 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:34.499
 remarkable 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:38.209
 and i think that gives a little bit to the voltage when in the mast caspar 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.239
 wrong one 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.969
 it was suddenly the clock of broken windows 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.579
 tyler elements in the 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.109
 I am upset I say 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.109
 first he must put it down there we will continue 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.389
 and from Newport koksijde at the time is very strange 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.080
 that has turned around 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.849
 and put his signature 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.489
 the papers more or less in our direction us are broken and my direction animals 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.969
 the rider 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.979
 do you know about it on degrees 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.649
 I have also been a little seduced to be who held out his hand so simply 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.469
 I give you the chance to congratulate me 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.469
 encryption hand 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:30.529
 for supporters
