movement<00:02:15.890> but<00:02:16.730> if<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:16.940> get<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> pole<00:02:17.390> you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
movement but if you get to a pole you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.420 
movement but if you get to a pole you
can<00:02:17.570> just<00:02:17.870> feel<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.110> movement<00:02:18.500> then<00:02:19.280> that's

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
can just feel that movement then that's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.740 
can just feel that movement then that's
just<00:02:19.490> negates<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.030> here<00:02:20.240> off<00:02:20.360> on<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.570> ball

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
just negates it here off on the ball

of<00:02:33.260> what's<00:02:33.530> taking<00:02:33.680> place<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.370> therefore<00:02:34.580> it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
of what's taking place and therefore it

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.090 
of what's taking place and therefore it
should<00:02:35.570> enhance<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.350> ability<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.740> make<00:02:36.890> big

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
should enhance the ability to make big

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.780 
should enhance the ability to make big
plays<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:41.620> think<00:02:42.620> ultimately<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.250> makes<00:02:43.550> a

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
plays I think ultimately it makes a

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.570 
plays I think ultimately it makes a
difference<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.450> think<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.560> mean<00:02:45.890> you're

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
difference I think so I mean you're

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.770 
difference I think so I mean you're
gonna<00:02:46.880> have<00:02:47.060> distractions<00:02:47.420> during<00:02:47.660> the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
gonna have distractions during the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.120 
gonna have distractions during the
ballgame<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.290> know<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.440> crowds<00:02:48.739> going<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.010> be

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
ballgame you know the crowds going to be

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.770 
ballgame you know the crowds going to be
in<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.400> other<00:02:49.910> players<00:02:50.180> gonna<00:02:50.360> be<00:02:50.450> yelling<00:02:50.600> at

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
in it other players gonna be yelling at

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.449 
in it other players gonna be yelling at
you<00:02:50.959> and<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.200> got<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.380> remain<00:02:51.650> focused<00:02:52.100> on

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
you and you got to remain focused on

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.920 
you and you got to remain focused on
what<00:02:52.670> your<00:02:52.850> goal<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:53.450> think<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:53.810> was

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
what your goal is and I think that was

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.960 
what your goal is and I think that was
the<00:02:53.959> main<00:02:54.200> goal<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:54.410> your<00:02:54.980> metronome<00:02:55.340> you

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
the main goal of your metronome you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.690 
the main goal of your metronome you
still<00:02:56.209> got<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.480> go<00:02:56.540> out<00:02:56.660> there<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.930> hit<00:02:57.140> guys

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
still got to go out there and hit guys

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.600 
still got to go out there and hit guys
you<00:02:58.700> still<00:02:58.940> gotta<00:02:59.180> catch<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.900> ball<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.610> think

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
you still gotta catch the ball I think

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.990 
you still gotta catch the ball I think
it<00:03:01.760> helps<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:02.090> focus<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.320> point<00:03:03.709> where

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
it helps you focus to the point where

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.350 
it helps you focus to the point where
you<00:03:05.000> can<00:03:05.239> help<00:03:05.959> yourself<00:03:06.140> win<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.920> ballgame
