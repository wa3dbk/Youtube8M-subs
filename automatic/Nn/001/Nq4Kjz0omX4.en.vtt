00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.570
 I am a heterosexual personal trainer 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.160
 good he wants to share with you hundred this is happening that is to return 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.299
 to also have a tour of my house 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.299
 percent 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.089
 fruits 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.629
 percent beatings percent figo same handle 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.599
 you are going to prepare them to harvest 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.269
 eva is free of chemicals and that then 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:33.970
 I wanted to share it 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.719
 ii with pair of goals to the benefits actually 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.410
 You must have your own avatar 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.420
 then would come the citation space that can be 10 meters per day that 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.220
 It can also be much smaller 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.690
 or you can also do p the first is that 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.730
 rice production 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.550
 the more dry 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.010
 he can close the weekend is 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.890
 per hundred bases of the product bottles in flowerpots 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.100
 where you are going to go putting different seeds and beans to identify easier 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.640
 what the flat seed needs to grow is simply a fertile land 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.580
 or the return to the earth yes that you have a garden 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.040
 the return because 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.080
 on the surface the first five ten centimeters 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.680
 it is presumed that the nutrients per hundred are no longer many because the grass 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.400
 what you have 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.250
 percent we have incorporated all their nutrients then what is done is given 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.630
 back to earth 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.020
 he carries 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.930
 the plus or minus percent 15 20 centimeters are turned around i do not have 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.420
 that to be below they happen to be up 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.290
 and the earth was above the state because the nutrient happens to be down 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.670
 It has been good on earth, it is fundamental to turn these around 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.460
 rake to a shovel 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.300
 and Saturday in any case 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.930
 percent and if you do not have a garden it could not be closer than much more 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.680
 easy 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.150
 and we need it to be five hours of sunshine per day 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.380
 minimum percent 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.189
 i percent 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.289
 something like that 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:12.999
 good the benefits 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.629
 must have an organic garden 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.979
 is fundamentally are 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.349
 what are you going to have the vegetables 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.439
 in your own home you do not have to go 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.010
 nowhere does he buy a year or every Chinese not waste time going out 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:28.979
 the second benefit 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:34.279
 is who, like the percent vegetable and the vegetables, are you going to cut it 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.279
 just moment of its maturation 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:40.769
 ed 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.459
 all the nutrients to the maximum say is not like a vegetable the fruit 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:51.279
 the one that eagles soldiers bought to cut much earlier because if they could not 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:53.779
 then in this case a van 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.249
 the moment that is right, yes 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.119
 i also the benefit that they have another flavor of course and another aroma the 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:02.959
 tomatoes another type of uranium 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.909
 percent another benefit is that it is enough to incorporate only nutrients from the 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.099
 vegetables and the nocturnal vegetables 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.449
 but it is not being incorporated into infinite number 500 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.289
 no fertilizers 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:18.350
 because the why 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.650
 everything is not being done to commit a crime 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.650
 only add water 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.859
 if it continues like this it explains how they are made 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.809
 but which are made with other plants converted for example and we have been 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:31.989
 relegated 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.089
 will be five 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.649
 the ants trade consent to be prepared natural 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:38.599
 for one hundrerd 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.709
 and the other benefit is also that later affecting or less money because or 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.329
 skip 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.949
 getting on 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.489
 of the truth that you have in your own home 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.949
 beyond this 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.430
 that it is a factor of well-being to have natural and discarded products 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:55.379
 planted and harvested by you 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.379
 he has a therapeutic effect because he works the earth 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.779
 the witnesses d take care of the plants 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.639
 the different batches and in the process 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.069
 Commodore, how the locks of the 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.869
 insects ants 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:14.869
 it is something really therapeutic highly recommended 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.400
 so good 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.759
 by the way and leave the victory and showing in the following videos 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.150
 the different 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.629
 the different steps 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:28.209
 of the process of delimiting the garden does not matter if we have space 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:31.680
 he also for a hundred of the care 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.560
 turning the earth 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.930
 the mass do they are 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.170
 the small one in semis and boxes and planting different containers 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.289
 for example if there were new 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.830
 you do orchards as we say 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.330
 the shareholder will not stand the cold or the wind 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.550
 at night then what are we doing 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.849
 Initially exposing small and mythical containers 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.529
 it's like I said 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.550
 in containers of any type of product 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.880
 in drums cut in half 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.610
 - these are more stable 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.720
 has been notorious showing different videos to the future today 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.460
 but also to the process and that we are excited 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.479
 thank you very much for certain remember I am heterosexual personal trainer 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.900
 Hidalgo is to find 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.650
 between another in pointed 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.060
 we can not see
