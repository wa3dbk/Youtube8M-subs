00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.230
 for the vast majority of people 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.330
 living on the shores of Rybinsky 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.030
 reservoir issue of lowering it 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.040
 level or draining just doesn't exist 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.240
 any fish soup soup shihon su or 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.519
 Cherepovchaninu even 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.800
 talking about it seems pointless 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.300
 but this topic continues to haunt the minds not 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.550
 only some malak jean 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.160
 nostalgic for a small homeland but also 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.810
 public figures and scholars on this 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.000
 week in Rybinsk held public 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.670
 lower level hearings 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.980
 reservoirs their initiator became 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.079
 commission working group on ecology 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.460
 on national security issues 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.890
 Public Chamber of the Russian Federation 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.420
 with us to our city organizers 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.420
 brought a whole team of specialists 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.370
 who their performances were supposed to 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.510
 convince those present that the slide 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.390
 Rybinsk Sea 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.640
 it is necessary and reasonable to lower the mountain 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.360
 and I believe it is appropriate to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.550
 Negative not displayed not on 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 electricity generation 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.100
 since at planned indulging at 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.489
 planned 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.210
 technical damming equipment 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.140
 after reducing the level will be increased 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.670
 water pressure on water turbines 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.060
 electricity quantity work 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.259
 energy has not dramatically reduced 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.270
 freed from the water of the territory 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.220
 according to plan, experimenters should through 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.979
 some time will turn into meadows and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.440
 forests have already conducted the first experiments that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.740
 show that very quickly 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.800
 on the former sandy bottom you recover 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.330
 vegetative and we can achieve that 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.020
 day will be her luga 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.179
 and oak trees for valuable opponents 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.340
 man-made sea drains are assured 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.530
 recreate in its place 2 Malaccan 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.869
 the utmost possible return of these lands 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.880
 to life will require colossal 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.880
 financial means and thoughts present 6 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.830
 we would not let the reservoir down we would not even let it down 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.310
 make a mark of 98 then we are almost two thousand 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.909
 square kilometers of desert get 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.180
 without everything 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.450
 without gifts covered by sand 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.250
 because it's there then everything is deposited for 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.070
 60 years of existence Rybinsky 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.510
 reservoirs this is sandy deposits not 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.750
 are down to a depth of five and a half 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.220
 meters the aquatic ecosystem is disturbed 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.200
 highly productive fish will disappear 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.019
 spawning grounds will be destroyed 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.390
 lowering sea ​​levels will affect life 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.920
 a significant part of people will arise 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.500
 water supply problems 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.150
 a lot of technical problems 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.070
 water intakes of cities 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.260
 the facilities are all designed for level 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.299
 Rybinsk Reservoir Cherepovets 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.730
 Rybinsk there poshekhone 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.920
 Vselegonsk and all water intake facilities 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.900
 all technical built and counting 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.910
 to this level on level fluctuations from 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.459
 102 to 98 that is, below 98 everything is already all 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.329
 the night must be exposed all redo everything 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.660
 rebuild 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.670
 This is also a colossal investment problem. 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.920
 Rybinsk reservoir very much 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.870
 no one can deny this 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.640
 shaking the air with ideas 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.859
 which is difficult to implement 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.069
 need to try to keep what is already 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.069
 exists
