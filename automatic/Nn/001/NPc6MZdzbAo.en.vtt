00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.210
 hello to all these apple style and today we will see how it goes windows 7 on our nh 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:10.040
 the first to see what are the advantages on this model in particular we see 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.489
 what are the known features introduced by this operating system 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:15.349
 then 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.900
 as for the graphic interface the 20 windows view does not 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.260
 notice 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.100
 particular differences as the interface always changes the same 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.260
 only the taskbar that has been completely redesigned now 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.790
 the icons represent both the applications we have for thesis 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.920
 applications we can offer 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 as for windows xp users, surely they will find themselves 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.290
 in front of an operating system completely designed to redesign 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.490
 revolutionized 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.390
 it's much nicer to look at and certainly easier to use 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.210
 as for the windows 7 performance, it's much more 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.660
 fast than its predecessors and at the same time it is much safer too 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.860
 if it is not completely free from viruses 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.970
 now I like the new graphic interface features 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.170
 of windows 7 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.170
 for managing windows and open applications 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.970
 this one as it seems to tear praise 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.970
 and let's take a closer look at the taskbar 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.940
 highlighted icons represent open applications 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.450
 in this way the desktop is much cleaner and tidy 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.090
 bersani to see some function 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.370
 the first one that I show you if you want to move the mouse to an icon 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.940
 open application and shows us a quick preview of the contents of the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.360
 window 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.910
 then we can drag a window has a corner of the right and sial screen 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.040
 left 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.990
 to have actors sizing half screen in this way 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.889
 it is useful to compare internet site documents and so on 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.270
 another function that I really like 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.640
 they are made simply by dragging the window in the top of the right top 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.610
 and the application automatically goes to full screen 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.900
 these functions c speed up the work a little let's say 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:17.019
 then another very practical function is called shake and allows us to shake 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.569
 at the window, to reduce to an icon all the others that maybe not at that moment 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.459
 we need them 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.459
 then a function that has been redesigned 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.060
 is the desktop display of windows 7 is now located near the clock and is implemented 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.039
 in this way 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.239
 drag the mouse 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.389
 at the corner where the button is and the windows become for a few seconds 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.509
 transparent recites let us take a quick look at the content 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:46.179
 of the desktop 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:52.659
 widgets are customizable so we can put them where we want it isn't 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.169
 plus its the barro like windows vista 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:57.839
 that's why we like it a lot 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:01.929
 however in my opinion windows 7 has a very good operating system for sure 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:04.389
 better than windows vista and windows xp 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.689
 installing it on the mac was very easy thanks to the boot camp assistant 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:15.449
 and to the question how come installed windows 7 on the mac I simply answer 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.120
 but still if 10 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.269
 you can do 99% of the things you do with windos except one 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.520
 softly 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.640
 asp titles like gta 4 with the of dutyful assassin's creed and unfortunately they don't have 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.999
 their version 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:30.449
 for marco s 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.179
 so you need to install windos if we want to do some parts of each 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:35.419
 much 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.569
 as for my general opinion the performances on these put 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.919
 they are very good 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.519
 it is very fast and I found myself doing some good luck every now and then but 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.609
 on the other hand we are always talking about windows 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.549
 anyway this was apple style do not hesitate to ask me your questions and me 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.879
 I recommend sign up I will try to answer you e 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.709
 see you at the next video
