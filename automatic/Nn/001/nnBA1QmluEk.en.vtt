00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello youtube friends how is my 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.750
 name is alejandro and I hope that you 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.120
 very good channel wherever you are 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.070
 watching this fucking video today 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.000
 I will show you how you can use 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.670
 the characters of the story mode for 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.220
 that you can play what is multiplayer or 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.680
 to play online as they say no of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.900
 a very easy and very simple way what 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.539
 first thing you have to do is go to 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.960
 your story mode choose the character 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.880
 what do you want to send to the multiplayer and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.680
 Well here we have clover first 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.559
 what you have to do, gentlemen is to give 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.420
 gta online then give him play people 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.820
 online and then you have to choose the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.620
 first box that is forward and you 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.360
 you have to give the option yes so that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.670
 I sent you to anyone 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.540
 to any server where they are playing 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.690
 people obviously in multiplayer not 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.390
 after you do this 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.120
 you have to go to a place where you are 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.670
 completely alone channel go to a place 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.190
 honest is completely alone so that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.350
 do not kill yourself because if they kill you you go to 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.170
 lose the character in such a way 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.900
 fast to this this gray to more serves you 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.470
 only one time 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.210
 after that it does not work for you anymore 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.100
 get out again not as good as they can 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.760
 see I'm already here the mountain appears with 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.430
 my character and what I'll do what 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.659
 I have to do is give it to the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.090
 xbox live store 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.219
 then you have to give him that if now 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.439
 you give it that if it automatically takes a 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:39.170
 because a little bit in loading what we 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.549
 gives time to leave gta online 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.399
 Look how I'm going to do a 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.140
 way very very quickly what if now 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.109
 what do I give him if he's loading and 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.030
 I will quickly apply it to start 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.250
 I'm going to give online card I'll give 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.280
 jeta online leave and I'll give you 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.530
 if this is to take us again 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.479
 to story mode 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.439
 this you have to do in a way 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.329
 pretty but pretty fast pretty 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.329
 quick if you do not leave if you do not do not use it 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.009
 if not then you get locked in the game or things 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:13.060
 well the truth this clips as I tell you 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.129
 it does not help us the truth is not very 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.989
 it does not help you but simply 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.530
 Well, you can have fun, I do not know, taking you 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.209
 a photo or anything else 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.980
 teaching your friends the character 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.129
 I even think that the character does not 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.269
 can see they are invisible 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.129
 just you if you see it but they do not 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.590
 you can see it good as you can see here 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.780
 I'm already in the story mode I do not know why 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.430
 what the hell has a form appeared 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.010
 inside this plane 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.409
 crashed I do not know why but sometimes 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.859
 appears inside the house of michael or 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.900
 inside the frankie house or where 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.629
 you have to give or do not know I do not know depending 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.719
 where 69 story is not good what you have 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.459
 What to do here is to give up 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:59.250
 here you have to give xbox store 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.469
 again so you can enter the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.930
 character to multiplayer in a way 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:06.689
 easy I hope you have understood the truth 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.599
 this clicks the truth is a little I do not know is 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.889
 a bit complicated but apart from everything 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.109
 you also have to do a little 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.540
 quick the truth is difficult to explain 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.519
 but you have to do it very fast 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.409
 just pause the video if you 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.090
 obstacles and you see that you did not understand is something 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.169
 puts pause and see what I'm doing 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.150
 You need me to explain it to you 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.370
 just with seeing the buttons that you 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.620
 I'm moving, you're going to be able to do this 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.719
 glitch and good gentlemen already already being 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.209
 against ball here as you can see already 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:35.189
 I entered what is the multiplayer and 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.200
 I'm playing online with this 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.019
 character that is clover and good gentlemen 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.400
 I already say goodbye with this, do not forget 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.049
 forget they left like commenting and 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.340
 share this video with all your 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.950
 friends so they can 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.410
 play with your favorite character the way 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.319
 story in the multiplayer and good as 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.470
 I tell you it's keyboardist, it's really not useful 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.780
 A lot does not work at all if you 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.370
 you die in is the first time he dies 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.440
 is automatically you're going to lose 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.470
 character you 're going to become invisible 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.710
 a moment and then cut when you're 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.530
 invisible 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.030
 because it will no longer be as fun but 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.860
 I believe this and I say goodbye I hope that 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.100
 are very well see you in the next 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.100
 video
