a<00:02:44.090> motorcycle<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.540> guess<00:02:45.780> team<00:02:46.710> that<00:02:46.980> he<00:02:47.100> has

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
a motorcycle I guess team that he has

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.580 
a motorcycle I guess team that he has
these<00:02:48.150> other<00:02:48.360> shoes<00:02:48.630> they<00:02:48.810> wear<00:02:48.960> it's<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.380> team

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
these other shoes they wear it's a team

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.530 
these other shoes they wear it's a team
shoe<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.490> that's<00:02:50.700> why<00:02:50.880> they<00:02:51.030> were<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.180> limited

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
shoe so that's why they were so limited

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.270 
shoe so that's why they were so limited
I<00:02:51.930> think<00:02:52.140> there's<00:02:52.320> only<00:02:52.410> four<00:02:52.710> thousand<00:02:53.100> pairs

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
I think there's only four thousand pairs

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.400 
I think there's only four thousand pairs
made<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:55.320> they<00:02:55.890> were<00:02:55.950> limited<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:57.260> if<00:02:58.260> you

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
made and they were limited so if you

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.390 
made and they were limited so if you
passed<00:02:58.650> up<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:58.980> them<00:02:59.390> shame<00:03:00.390> on<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.870> but<00:03:01.400> but
