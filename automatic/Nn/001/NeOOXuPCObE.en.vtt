I<00:04:27.780> would<00:04:28.290> say<00:04:28.500> setup<00:04:28.890> was<00:04:29.040> pretty<00:04:29.310> easy

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
I would say setup was pretty easy

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.070 
I would say setup was pretty easy
definitely<00:04:30.090> not<00:04:30.300> one<00:04:30.450> of<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.600> hardest<00:04:30.930> things

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
definitely not one of the hardest things

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.890 
definitely not one of the hardest things
I've<00:04:31.260> done<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.330> looks<00:04:33.510> pretty<00:04:33.720> good<00:04:33.810> on

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
I've done and it looks pretty good on

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.640 
I've done and it looks pretty good on
the<00:04:34.050> desk<00:04:35.630> after<00:04:36.630> using<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.960> docking<00:04:37.290> station

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
the desk after using the docking station

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.420 
the desk after using the docking station
for<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.890> whole<00:04:38.040> day

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
for a whole day

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.880 
for a whole day
I<00:04:38.460> can<00:04:39.000> already<00:04:39.210> say<00:04:39.480> definitely<00:04:39.930> one<00:04:40.230> by<00:04:40.440> one

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
I can already say definitely one by one

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.430 
I can already say definitely one by one
it<00:04:41.550> really<00:04:41.790> makes<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.120> ducking<00:04:42.480> process<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:43.140> lot

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
it really makes a ducking process a lot

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.870 
it really makes a ducking process a lot
more<00:04:43.470> transparent<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.370> less<00:04:44.610> time-consuming

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
more transparent and less time-consuming

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.540 
more transparent and less time-consuming
I<00:04:45.660> was<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.410> little<00:04:46.740> weary<00:04:46.980> at<00:04:47.130> first<00:04:47.370> about

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
I was a little weary at first about

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.220 
I was a little weary at first about
buying<00:04:47.910> it<00:04:48.090> because<00:04:48.240> friends<00:04:48.780> in<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.960> past

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
buying it because friends in the past

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.960 
buying it because friends in the past
have<00:04:49.800> told<00:04:50.130> me<00:04:50.250> they<00:04:50.340> didn't<00:04:50.610> like<00:04:50.790> the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
have told me they didn't like the

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.210 
have told me they didn't like the
plastic<00:04:51.240> builds<00:04:51.780> before<00:04:52.170> or<00:04:52.650> that<00:04:52.920> their<00:04:53.100> old

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
plastic builds before or that their old

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.070 
plastic builds before or that their old
connector<00:04:53.580> status<00:04:54.030> were<00:04:54.150> kind<00:04:54.360> of<00:04:54.480> weird<00:04:54.660> but

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
connector status were kind of weird but

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.960 
connector status were kind of weird but
I<00:04:55.140> definitely<00:04:55.620> recommend<00:04:55.890> this<00:04:56.130> model<00:04:56.340> I<00:04:56.730> used

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
I definitely recommend this model I used

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.760 
I definitely recommend this model I used
to<00:04:57.090> kind<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.390> shy<00:04:57.570> away<00:04:57.600> from<00:04:57.840> work<00:04:58.170> at<00:04:58.350> my<00:04:58.500> desk

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
to kind of shy away from work at my desk
