that was pretty clever further like the
point<00:04:08.510> where<00:04:08.660> it<00:04:08.720> looked<00:04:08.900> like<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.110> character

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
point where it looked like the character

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.680 
point where it looked like the character
was<00:04:09.470> looking<00:04:09.799> out<00:04:09.890> of<00:04:10.040> binoculars<00:04:10.610> and<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:11.510> also

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
was looking out of binoculars and I also

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.420 
was looking out of binoculars and I also
like<00:04:12.049> that<00:04:12.079> scene<00:04:12.500> where<00:04:12.799> one<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.370> the

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
like that scene where one of the

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.979 
like that scene where one of the
characters<00:04:13.790> is<00:04:13.970> like<00:04:14.180> floating<00:04:14.540> through<00:04:14.959> the

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
characters is like floating through the

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.300 
characters is like floating through the
water<00:04:15.319> I<00:04:15.620> don't<00:04:15.799> really<00:04:15.920> know<00:04:16.070> how<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.220> explain

it but you see it on the screen right
now<00:04:18.440> now<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:18.979> the<00:04:19.220> critiques<00:04:19.609> of<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.790> video

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
now now to the critiques of the video

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.789 
now now to the critiques of the video
one<00:04:20.690> thing<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:20.930> kind<00:04:21.350> of<00:04:21.410> bothered<00:04:21.739> me

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
one thing that kind of bothered me

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.110 
one thing that kind of bothered me
throughout<00:04:22.130> was<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.639> was<00:04:22.729> played<00:04:22.970> in

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
throughout was that it was played in

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.760 
throughout was that it was played in
black<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.479> white<00:04:23.570> for<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.840> flashback<00:04:24.350> I<00:04:24.530> feel

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
black and white for the flashback I feel

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.529 
black and white for the flashback I feel
like<00:04:24.950> if<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.310> had<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.520> white<00:04:25.940> vignette<00:04:26.389> around

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
like if you had a white vignette around

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.600 
like if you had a white vignette around
the<00:04:26.780> screen<00:04:26.990> instead<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:27.680> played<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.190> center

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
the screen instead and played the center

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.310 
the screen instead and played the center
of<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:28.789> video<00:04:29.030> in<00:04:29.240> color<00:04:29.479> it<00:04:29.930> would<00:04:30.080> have<00:04:30.169> got

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
of the video in color it would have got

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.710 
of the video in color it would have got
the<00:04:30.440> point<00:04:30.680> across<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:31.520> same<00:04:31.760> way<00:04:31.970> however<00:04:32.539> it

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
the point across the same way however it

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.820 
the point across the same way however it
would<00:04:32.840> have<00:04:32.960> looked<00:04:33.139> a<00:04:33.289> little<00:04:33.500> bit<00:04:33.680> better

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
would have looked a little bit better

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.700 
would have looked a little bit better
also<00:04:34.789> I<00:04:35.030> don't<00:04:35.240> really<00:04:35.450> get<00:04:35.690> why<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.560> have

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
also I don't really get why you have

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.920 
also I don't really get why you have
pg-13<00:04:37.460> at<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.700> beginning<00:04:38.120> and<00:04:38.330> it's<00:04:38.570> sort<00:04:38.780> of

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
pg-13 at the beginning and it's sort of

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.960 
pg-13 at the beginning and it's sort of
in<00:04:39.020> a<00:04:39.139> low-quality<00:04:39.860> text<00:04:40.550> it<00:04:40.639> doesn't<00:04:40.850> really

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
in a low-quality text it doesn't really

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.180 
in a low-quality text it doesn't really
add<00:04:41.150> up<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.450> the<00:04:41.600> better<00:04:42.139> quality<00:04:42.620> work<00:04:42.919> that

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
add up to the better quality work that

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.860 
add up to the better quality work that
was<00:04:43.280> shown<00:04:43.430> throughout<00:04:43.789> the<00:04:43.940> video<00:04:44.210> and<00:04:44.570> my

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
was shown throughout the video and my

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.360 
was shown throughout the video and my
final<00:04:45.110> point<00:04:45.380> to<00:04:45.530> make<00:04:45.650> I<00:04:45.830> feel<00:04:46.070> like<00:04:46.190> the

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
final point to make I feel like the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.950 
final point to make I feel like the
shots<00:04:46.639> were<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:46.940> little<00:04:47.210> too<00:04:47.419> fast<00:04:47.660> and

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
shots were a little too fast and

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.529 
shots were a little too fast and
uncomfortably<00:04:48.860> close<00:04:49.190> but<00:04:49.729> besides<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.180> I

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
uncomfortably close but besides that I

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.500 
uncomfortably close but besides that I
honestly<00:04:50.900> think<00:04:51.349> that<00:04:51.500> this<00:04:51.770> was<00:04:52.039> a<00:04:52.510> Killa

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
honestly think that this was a Killa

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.129 
honestly think that this was a Killa
Killa<00:04:54.380> video<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:55.220> great<00:04:55.669> job<00:04:55.820> funny<00:04:56.090> films

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.839 

I<00:05:00.810> thought<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:02.080> mood<00:05:02.740> of<00:05:02.979> the<00:05:03.039> film<00:05:03.400> was<00:05:03.550> very

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
I thought the mood of the film was very

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.700 
I thought the mood of the film was very
well<00:05:04.060> established<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:04.990> actually<00:05:05.139> like<00:05:05.530> the

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
well established I actually like the

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.070 
well established I actually like the
black<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:06.129> white<00:05:06.280> however<00:05:07.120> I<00:05:07.180> would<00:05:07.389> have<00:05:07.719> I

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
black and white however I would have I

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.080 
black and white however I would have I
would<00:05:08.409> have<00:05:08.560> kept<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.009> video<00:05:09.249> in<00:05:09.490> color<00:05:09.819> but

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
would have kept the video in color but

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.830 
would have kept the video in color but
have<00:05:10.389> saturated<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.669> image<00:05:12.669> quality<00:05:12.849> so

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
have saturated the image quality so

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.689 
have saturated the image quality so
we're<00:05:13.990> giving<00:05:14.259> it<00:05:14.469> more<00:05:14.800> of<00:05:14.919> a<00:05:14.979> darker<00:05:15.430> look

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
we're giving it more of a darker look

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.550 
we're giving it more of a darker look
throughout<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.330> film<00:05:16.599> instead<00:05:17.229> of<00:05:17.349> having

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
throughout the film instead of having

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.409 
throughout the film instead of having
just<00:05:17.740> black<00:05:18.189> and<00:05:18.219> white<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.699> brick<00:05:18.939> film<00:05:19.180> runs

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
just black and white the brick film runs

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.330 
just black and white the brick film runs
for<00:05:19.719> about<00:05:19.779> five<00:05:20.199> minutes<00:05:20.529> and<00:05:20.889> it's<00:05:21.069> another

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
for about five minutes and it's another
