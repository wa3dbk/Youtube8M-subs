00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.239
 the Bible 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:11.939
 the word of God 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:13.869
 but what is it really about 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.369
 all books all weights 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.960
 here is a thought 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.500
 you knew there is a central story in the whole Bible like a kilo that 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.449
 he went through the beginning 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.859
 It allows to demonstrate 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.399
 in the beginning I think he observed 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.399
 And he saw that it was good 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.980
 valdez 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.150
 then he created man and woman 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
 so they were related to the tenerife 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 and explained I create a separation between rivers 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.040
 a plan 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.990
 largest of the pickets 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.330
 he started calling person 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.430
 the chosen people of God 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.460
 parentheses around the world 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.590
 for sin 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.060
 he had thrown himself 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.560
 but as I said before 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.660
 God had a plan a great plan 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.010
 this is where Jesus comes in 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.380
 a small child born in a manger 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.660
 a man who performed miracles maybe nothing and preached and taught 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.210
 Jesus 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.799
 he gave his life on the cross 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.839
 to pay once and for all for our sins 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.550
 and it was the sacrifice of Jesus 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.590
 what he took forever 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.520
 the separation 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 that here make prices the name because of sin 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.380
 the bible says that he hates the recre sharaf 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.649
 and all of us who believed in him will live with him in his kingdom for the 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.250
 eternity 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.250
 all nations all peoples 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.670
 and I followed the one that speaks to you at the beginning 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.480
 that thread that walk everything through the bible that day and it is 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.470
 love imposition on the perfect and complete 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.560
 all humanity 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.640
 with love big enough to cover the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.669
 a nun 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.669
 which includes you 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.199
 it's a great story 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:22.199
 here is all 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.829
 so yes 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.849
 it's your turn 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.849
 it is still written 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:34.589
 he took the kilo 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.249
 And keep going
