never did my homework like maybe from
math<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.170> got<00:00:58.559> into<00:00:58.800> trouble

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
math but that was it I got into trouble

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.560 
math but that was it I got into trouble
a<00:00:59.190> lot<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.430> times<00:00:59.640> because<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.000> didn't<00:01:00.239> make<00:01:00.420> my

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
a lot of times because I didn't make my

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.599 
a lot of times because I didn't make my

homework because I'm a lazy ass but I

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.490

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
to like me like for real but I know that

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.020 
to like me like for real but I know that
I'm<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.570> pretty<00:04:11.900> nice<00:04:12.170> person<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:12.950> I<00:04:13.310> like<00:04:13.790> to

I'm a pretty nice person I I like to

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.580 
I'm a pretty nice person I I like to
talk<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.600> people<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.140> like<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.410> socialize

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.170 
so I think that's really like a
must-have<00:04:18.230> in<00:04:18.680> high<00:04:19.100> school<00:04:19.400> go<00:04:19.760> make<00:04:20.000> some
