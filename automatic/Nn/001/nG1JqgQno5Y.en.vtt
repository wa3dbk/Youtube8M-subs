00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.889
 were very very innovative but if inductive the add-ons 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.460
 Norm that probably aims in March crashes city their production stopped something 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.230
 and who on the blu-ray player Cilli their goal is the third round for each 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.599
 Age group because that works 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.070
 Mass produced the first time 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.689
 and with our Percy themes Digital power is what we are 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.179
 digital living costs 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.739
 can produce 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.899
 Percent that can not be achieved with abnormal electrical installation 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:34.350
 and the cornerstone of this is the small chip that makes up the Early 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.350
 Pay less he stands on the credit cards and the very smallest 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.270
 cheapest and most common words Nemetschek can find the man 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.070
 we managed to get this technology married to 230 volts 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.320
 there are 8 points behind it 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.980
 and that is why we are very very cheap we are very very small and we want 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.070
 Build it around every electrical device like many emotions from the Spaichinger 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.600
 to implant 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.309
 about enough homecoming their books 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.059
 times 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.689
 whatever me a few pages and then you are satisfied well and now 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.520
 Corps Blue Dog Basel are heard 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.600
 now they have succeeded with this sign 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.700
 in such a painting a few commune 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.010
 to install the lamp glamor and here in the height and place is the chips 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.509
 more and what to look for from this chip only this chip 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.700
 more electronics is not necessary 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.640
 we have these lights clamp 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.530
 Percent on top of it built so that they are an electrician Thon and special 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.410
 Training courses and so on - and now expected leaders can tell everything apart 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.450
 it can be done differently 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.470
 This yellow is there to control the lights 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.030
 this belief is the shadow for the Schur Lusine for the awnings race 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.100
 the regrets are for the air conditioners for the heaters for the fans 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.170
 the Houghton are for the security systems 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.310
 the and alarm systems the greens 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.970
 a Sennfeld access 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.070
 Doors would ring intercom door openers 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.240
 then I'll have Mosaic 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.670
 the New York ears 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.780
 we have white goods refrigerators jury Rossoneri continues and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.550
 if that is not enough and you want to have special wishes one free 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.079
 programmable Jucker 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.430
 and now it is so that they are virtually all vertices and now, for example 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.960
 Funds Dieter Liechti must meet 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.110
 we are already photo WP on this tip so even just a kid out shopping 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.220
 go and so on 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.440
 and that says I'm working, what can they do us now like adults 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.540
 People unfortunately only shared this 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.330
 Show the yellow sign that Federer had at the normal mix 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.879
 so so i have NTD installation here for example of a living room 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.199
 that is the discover lamp 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.419
 that's for example a lamp rethinking bushes does not matter 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.060
 Classically, let yourself be already at the man or sockets in the room 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.270
 and we have a light switch only one more switch no longer this one 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.129
 Batteries percent raised 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.309
 already at the door 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:00.780
 our clients are me experts like me 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.099
 who use Werner Kerschbaum's customers 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.489
 but for example my mother the 75 is Thomas Döhler and can do it easily 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.310
 would like to have 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.850
 she goes into the room and that will be a cross if she has to 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.989
 would have to come absolutely easy nice try cooking APA 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:19.369
 us that is so there is a normal does not fail them processes old that 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:20.579
 Light normally 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.200
 and that can turn off again there is no question from it is as usual 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.020
 hands 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.880
 because our percent is our system 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.700
 only then becomes a mass product 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.489
 if you are suffering in the first step and that is actually done 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.430
 does not notice 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.819
 and then over time the extra features in the country 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.819
 Now, for example, there is additional feature not quite fit 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.579
 do the program and I can 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.549
 every lamp 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.279
 but that is saved the chip turn Weinmann in the compact length 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:54.290
 is long then I go to the mounting ears of window regulators from the car knows 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.049
 and so daring I have no legionella nothing more off the track makes easy 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.069
 everything so the system 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.689
 he does not want to have a computer scientist when we buy a new lamp 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.969
 This idea is good that we are already selling equipment with the chip 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:13.909
 they would be awarded with Digital Jump Randi 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.699
 This is, for example, a floor lamp that you - so impose 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:20.719
 these posts are registered 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.029
 she says everything is okay we are programmed 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:24.180
 I can do it now 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.260
 again naive as my from the IJU among other things just switch off as you do 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.360
 that is used and you can do it 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.909
 no moralist 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.990
 looks for now comes the first nice additional feature I've got 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.919
 a new Phnom Penh in my 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.080
 why percent more just plugged in a socket and I can do it 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.009
 now 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.729
 usually with the others instead of the hard to explain 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.650
 it needs such a feature one looked at the outlet 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.610
 that's a programmer and so on 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.509
 and that's just not an immediate plus in this system just 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.449
 with her over very good 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.490
 more or with a light bulb for example or ship directly into the car 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.710
 Saleh is after so cheap can the system be 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.110
 so I can now this floor lamp 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.499
 in Bremen 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:10.819
 and I can still very important now is not only room leaving all the lights 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.499
 and then digital household will surely not only land three but 20 lamps one 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:16.530
 you want to have many different moods 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.070
 all central 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.820
 without the idol back Nolan 2 000 grams not everything 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.039
 there was only a short special company to come 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.199
 so they have seen me sitting on the sofa for example now and Cleese 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.389
 LED bulbs we made the lamp on and although here can so Far 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.849
 my wife comes inside 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.529
 when picking up a book, the light turns on and when he's seen the time 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:41.059
 Room leaves 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:42.930
 my lamp would go out too 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.169
 but that is the ATS remarkable Hovestadt Ellinor have to each other exactly 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.370
 Werdohl and promptly does not make that all goes much further 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.970
 So the chips are so smart that they notice 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.939
 that the electricity is cheap to run into the washing machine and so on 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:00.490
 that is because there is really something coming to us 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.330
 with no real standby 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.330
 we can note when the network is flickering and overloaded and percent 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.919
 the power consumption if you turn off automatically among the three 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.919
 one hardly gets hurt one, we all know it 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.020
 what at the moment Pröll we install one hundred percent emergency accommodations one takes 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.509
 to give it the finishing touch 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:23.460
 we're talking to those with Intel for the injured tendon 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.349
 operate in the Norwegian Aaltonen in very large numbers in Europe there 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.349
 there are ten billion electrical appliances the 100 need 

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:35.289
 We talk to them about that percent comes quickly to the market and we 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.449
 hope that in 2008 the first devices with the offender power source 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.839
 the market in the very very tense of the capital Dublin gave it to points 

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.849
 expanded and who knows maybe one or the other spectators 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.919
 in two three years he says what did I have momentum and massive mount 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:49.909
 Everest
