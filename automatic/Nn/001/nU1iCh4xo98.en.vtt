00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hi there, you are watching a channel made in 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.240
 the garage we now came to the rescue 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.440
 our good friend 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.929
 in order to repair it 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.870
 the car naturally broke down 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.240
 generator on the way we arrived now with 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.240
 new generator and will u change 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.890
 car vaz 2115 on his way 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.699
 broke the generator he gave before this here 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.350
 it's 10 11 volts we changed the tablet 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.149
 him 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.699
 now I will have a generator 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:00.019
 because he his even possible him 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.370
 then from the Romans lived Jill and lived and 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.390
 before all work is necessary 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.630
 throw off the negative terminal 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.409
 battery and everything to start 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.340
 remove the belt 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.820
 Well, loosen the nuts there I take off, loosen 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.690
 tension together we will be less 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.679
 do when usually base before not about 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.659
 unscrew now this one was for that 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.880
 to loosen the generator tension and 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.539
 see the generator ahead as we have it already 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.640
 showed 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.470
 several other kind but we need here 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.929
 Generally remove this here because we 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.340
 9 we are going to get rid of him until the end 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:39.720
 turn off and pull out the tensioner remove 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.549
 alternator tension bar now 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.969
 you need to disconnect the wires there alone 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.490
 chip 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:47.810
 mom just and throw off and one bolt 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.939
 unscrew it and take off the bread 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.329
 loosen the tension of the generator and degas and 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:59.250
 engine side and remove the belt 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.649
 bottom of the generator is another year 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.480
 it is necessary to mount the generator 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:09.790
 unscrew show you we can not but 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.920
 we you figure it out on bolt 13 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.480
 generator which is located below so 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.750
 just unbearable so you have to 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.220
 I will remove fasteners 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.350
 who kept not happy orsk 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:28.750
 block which fastened for this to us 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.100
 will have to unscrew the protection here it is protection 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.340
 we will have to unscrew the two bolts 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.540
 bottom and as opponents and boot off 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.700
 here are the keys 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:48.400
 self-tapping screw for autumn remove the boot left 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:51.610
 also bend down lowered protection lowered 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.540
 plastic on the horizontal bar unscrew mount 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.890
 generator 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.890
 there bolts 15 take out the generator 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.380
 let's move the new generator 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.380
 so why 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.000
 previous generator we had 80 amps 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.420
 2112 and here we have this generator too 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.860
 2112 but 90 amps set everything in 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.910
 reverse order 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.420
 throw strap do not start 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.420
 tension generator 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:54.370
 Here this bolt tension regulate with 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:56.920
 this tighten about it the belt should be 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.969
 stretched so that about fell 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.719
 in the middle 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:03.879
 on the floor of the nail try not to drag 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:08.129
 belt so how if you drag something 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:11.590
 you can kill the bearings in the generator 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:16.060
 we start the car for the first time new 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.669
 worm generator on the character 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.850
 not good it is well the voltage is normal 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.350
 13 and 8 as it should be , well, actually if 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.800
 do n't even know to turn on the light there yet 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.250
 something to learn there all heating Th 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 let's include in short one can well 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.800
 13 10 food candle included 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.640
 12 7 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.640
 but basically ok 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.729
 video does work charging thanks 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.660
 see us subscribe to new 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.660
 video bye
