00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.400
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.710
 chess game on this occasion os 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.540
 I bring a game that played one of the 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.690
 best players that have been in the 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:16.790
 history in manuel vÃ¡squez against others 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.270
 you're going to play noel moscow in 1935 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:23.240
 white begin in 4 c 5 responds 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.270
 to the player who was driving the black with 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:32.240
 the Sicilian defense to which the 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:36.320
 horse f3 horse c6 of 4 cx of 4 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.320
 horse for four horses c 6 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.850
 horse c3 of 6 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:49.800
 at the end of 26 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:53.790
 what cut 6 pins lady does 7 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.989
 Four horse to five 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:02.100
 efe five masters press and start with 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.100
 C4 horse activities threaten the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.670
 bishop 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.670
 to the film for 0-4 and call for 6-4 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.630
 of 6 ie6 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.650
 here we have the position in which the ace 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.260
 that the loyal line takes advantage is not 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.840
 other than the sacrifice in the column f 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:33.300
 of the tower that sacrifices the tower 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.740
 tower by horse precisely for 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.390
 enter with the queen in h 5 and already the 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.020
 Black women do not have the ability to cover themselves 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.159
 because now they have to capture here 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.250
 They have sacrificed the white tower 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.149
 that he plays lady h5 check and the player 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.180
 who was driving the blacks I can root 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.370
 of 8 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:05.900
 it's worth if he plays kings 7 or king of 7 is still 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:09.110
 worse these lines square king of 8 the 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.160
 white was van damme to efe 7 here the 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.270
 white 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.850
 giving a check 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:22.920
 and a double to torrent is worth with the damos 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.410
 and we might think that at the end of seven 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.980
 it's better play but now after 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.599
 we will see that you do not forgive file 7 for 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.390
 cover the worst and they can not give a 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.550
 double to king and tower but it is not the best 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.540
 played in fact here all the variants 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.500
 They are already losers for Black 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.630
 and the strong black at the end of seven now 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.220
 we will see what happens with the cinema 7 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:58.210
 I take with lady csi check 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.390
 now they are threatening tower and network the 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.620
 Black player does 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.440
 roots 7 with which which captures the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.230
 tower and here the game is already lost 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.680
 the black little thing that they have to 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.140
 do or can do go though I still 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.930
 the game because three are concluded 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.099
 more plays 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.859
 and they continued with h6 bishop threatening 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.659
 this bishop to give a check to it 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.659
 they are threatening 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.440
 to the tower the tower to the lady forgiveness 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.990
 here the bishop is threatening to give a 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.940
 try to eat this at last giving a 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.490
 hawk and then to this horse when 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.090
 eat the tower but the ones he leaves 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:52.340
 that threat simply as a horse 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.530
 that's checkmate lady is 6 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.990
 lady for a 8 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:04.870
 and finally by three hacker vih-1 and the 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.090
 Blacks surrendered because we see that the 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.830
 White has 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.470
 quality and also two pawns better and 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.870
 with this is enough material advantage 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.680
 to win the game we return to the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.680
 previous position 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.389
 we have seen what happens with the bishop of 7 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:44.319
 It is worthwhile that I gave here the double check 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:48.580
 tower and king and if blacks instead 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:51.520
 do at the end is 7 to defend this 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.220
 pawn that does not arise this 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.639
 combination then simply the white 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.009
 play horse f5 great play of the 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.639
 white that are threatening a mate 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:08.500
 here it is worth now they are threatening and 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:11.249
 besides this horse is inedible because 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.459
 if they do not open the diagonal 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:16.459
 and this lady is really dead 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:26.510
 Black the way they have of 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:30.650
 defend this is lady 7 or so 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:34.190
 tower 8 to defend the threat of mate 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:39.110
 if they make a tower 8 then calmly 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:41.710
 could happen horse by 6 doing it 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.710
 a double 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.639
 and tower and now yes bishop by b6 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.290
 or is it simply 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.490
 at the end of six check blacks do not 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.250
 There is no alternative but to cover 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.480
 covers with the lady loses the lady if she 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.300
 cover with the bishop 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.630
 at the end you feel leave the column 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.120
 open and comes into play the tower tower 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.160
 of one giving him a check not to 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.100
 one that would 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.010
 at the end of seven and we can see that he counted 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.530
 by seven the checkmate good friends 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:26.670
