00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
whole idea is a for me was a direct

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.780 
whole idea is a for me was a direct
comment<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.910> Francis<00:00:30.300> Bacon<00:00:31.399> in<00:00:32.399> general<00:00:32.700> and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
comment to Francis Bacon in general and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.880 
comment to Francis Bacon in general and
Francis<00:00:33.090> Bacon<00:00:33.390> Pope's<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.899> particular<00:00:36.890> it's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
Francis Bacon Pope's in particular it's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.850 
Francis Bacon Pope's in particular it's
not<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> secret<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.399> I'm<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.700> big<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.620> big<00:00:40.620> fan<00:00:40.829> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
not a secret that I'm a big a big fan of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.670 
not a secret that I'm a big a big fan of
and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.120> use<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:43.320> use<00:00:43.469> him

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
and I think I can use in I can use him

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.940 
and I think I can use in I can use him
as<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.899> source<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.989> inspiration<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:46.559> it's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
as a source of inspiration because it's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.850 
as a source of inspiration because it's
it's<00:00:47.370> already<00:00:47.579> history<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.620> you<00:00:49.620> just

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
it's already history it's like you just

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.950 
it's already history it's like you just
can<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.760> take<00:00:51.329> whatever<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.930> want

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
can go there and take whatever you want

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.439 
can go there and take whatever you want
from<00:00:52.230> Francis<00:00:52.350> Bacon<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> idea<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
from Francis Bacon that is the idea is

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.400 
from Francis Bacon that is the idea is
to<00:00:55.760> add<00:00:56.760> something<00:00:57.360> or<00:01:00.020> used<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> very

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
to add something or used in a very

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.700 
to add something or used in a very
intelligent<00:01:01.620> anyway<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:03.149> me<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.809> always

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
intelligent anyway for me I was always

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.289 
intelligent anyway for me I was always
obsessed<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.430> Pope<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:08.299> thinking

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
obsessed with this Pope and thinking

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.789 
obsessed with this Pope and thinking
what<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.600> mean<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.770> me<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.170> an<00:01:13.290> iconic

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
what that mean for me it was an iconic

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.700 
what that mean for me it was an iconic
image<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:17.509> for<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> whole<00:01:18.869> idea<00:01:19.170> behind<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
image of for the whole idea behind the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.880 
image of for the whole idea behind the
20th<00:01:20.070> century<00:01:20.430> which<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.860> clash<00:01:22.860> between

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
20th century which was a clash between

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.530 
20th century which was a clash between
ideologies<00:01:25.340> sort<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.430> big<00:01:26.790> goodbye<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
ideologies sort of big goodbye to the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.249 
ideologies sort of big goodbye to the
old<00:01:27.829> regime<00:01:31.729> but<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.820> think<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> 21st<00:01:33.659> century

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
old regime but I think the 21st century

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.319 
old regime but I think the 21st century
we<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.590> moving<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.159> very<00:01:35.280> new<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.180> very

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
we are moving to a very new in a very

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.719 
we are moving to a very new in a very
where<00:01:36.540> direction<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.170> moving<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
where direction we are moving to to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.350 
where direction we are moving to to
medicine

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
medicine

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.889 
medicine
it's<00:01:39.630> about<00:01:39.930> our<00:01:40.140> body<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:40.710> are<00:01:40.799> obsessed<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
it's about our body we are obsessed and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.580 
it's about our body we are obsessed and
dysmorphic<00:01:42.899> somehow

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
dysmorphic somehow

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.190 
dysmorphic somehow
so<00:01:46.310> probably<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> 20%<00:01:47.850> will<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> century<00:01:49.079> of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so probably the 20% will be a century of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.200 
so probably the 20% will be a century of
biology<00:01:49.939> of<00:01:50.990> wood<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.490> basically<00:01:53.490> dr.<00:01:53.759> Joseph

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
biology of wood and basically dr. Joseph

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.359 
biology of wood and basically dr. Joseph
which<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.570> obviously<00:01:57.350> dr.<00:01:58.350> Josef<00:01:58.590> Mengele<00:01:58.619> was

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
which is obviously dr. Josef Mengele was

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.749 
which is obviously dr. Josef Mengele was
a<00:01:59.399> famous

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
a famous

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.749 
a famous

research at Casa vacanam Institute in

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.630 
research at Casa vacanam Institute in
Berlin<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.450> Casa<00:02:05.229> become<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.560> suit<00:02:05.740> is<00:02:05.890> exactly

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
Berlin and Casa become a suit is exactly

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.570 
Berlin and Casa become a suit is exactly
the<00:02:06.850> story<00:02:07.119> of<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.739> Medical<00:02:08.739> Research<00:02:09.069> Center

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
the story of a Medical Research Center

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.130 
the story of a Medical Research Center
started<00:02:10.090> as<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.269> very<00:02:10.840> positive<00:02:12.959> project<00:02:13.959> and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
started as a very positive project and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.830 
started as a very positive project and
turn<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.800> into<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.099> malefic<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.360> horrible

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
turn it into a malefic and and horrible

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.820 
turn it into a malefic and and horrible
and<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:18.550> think<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.819> will<00:02:19.120> be<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:22.830> very

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
and I think it will be the the very

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.900 
and I think it will be the the very
much.this<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:26.190> problem<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.400> 21st

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
much.this the problem in the 21st

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.119 
much.this the problem in the 21st
century<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.330> know<00:02:28.420> how<00:02:28.750> medicine<00:02:29.620> can<00:02:30.099> be

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
century you know how medicine can be

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.890 
century you know how medicine can be
corrupted<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.910> turned<00:02:31.209> our<00:02:31.690> lives<00:02:32.019> into<00:02:32.319> a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
corrupted and turned our lives into a

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.130 
corrupted and turned our lives into a
nightmare<00:02:35.040> so

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.740 

I<00:02:42.170> guess<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:43.070> I'm<00:02:43.640> going<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:44.270> that<00:02:44.510> direction

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
I guess it's I'm going in that direction

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.810 
I guess it's I'm going in that direction
I'm<00:02:45.380> not<00:02:45.530> saying<00:02:45.800> it's<00:02:45.980> only<00:02:46.190> about<00:02:46.490> that<00:02:46.640> but

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
I'm not saying it's only about that but

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.970 
I'm not saying it's only about that but
is<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:48.290> was<00:02:48.500> in<00:02:48.800> my<00:02:49.010> mind<00:02:49.220> when<00:02:49.520> I<00:02:50.650> was<00:02:51.650> taught

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
is that was in my mind when I was taught

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.540 
is that was in my mind when I was taught
to<00:02:52.010> put<00:02:52.370> images<00:02:52.610> together<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:54.280> refer<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.430> this

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
to put images together and refer to this

you mix this Google cliches into I try

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.060 
you mix this Google cliches into I try
to<00:04:01.459> mix<00:04:01.700> this<00:04:01.850> into<00:04:02.030> something<00:04:02.450> new<00:04:03.070> that's

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
to mix this into something new that's

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.430 
to mix this into something new that's
something<00:04:04.580> new<00:04:04.760> which<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:06.170> end<00:04:06.290> my

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
something new which is in the end my

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.250 
something new which is in the end my
work<00:04:06.650> my<00:04:07.250> idea<00:04:07.580> is<00:04:07.670> not<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:08.180> be<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.810> cleaner<00:04:09.230> to

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
work my idea is not to be a cleaner to

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.000 
work my idea is not to be a cleaner to
be<00:04:09.500> not<00:04:09.709> a<00:04:09.739> cliche<00:04:10.190> but<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:11.209> like<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.080> compose<00:04:12.830> it

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
be not a cliche but I like to compose it

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.659 
be not a cliche but I like to compose it
out<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:16.060> cliche<00:04:17.500> because<00:04:18.500> I<00:04:18.530> guess<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.400> visual

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
out of cliche because I guess the visual

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.789 
out of cliche because I guess the visual
impact<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.299> also<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.750> emotional<00:04:21.200> is<00:04:21.350> strong

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
impact and also the emotional is strong

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.830 
impact and also the emotional is strong
I<00:04:21.919> mean<00:04:22.040> people<00:04:22.310> recognize<00:04:22.850> something<00:04:23.630> so

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
I mean people recognize something so

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.770 
I mean people recognize something so
they<00:04:23.960> have<00:04:24.140> a<00:04:24.169> click<00:04:24.860> there<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:25.250> I<00:04:28.600> guess<00:04:29.600> this

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
they have a click there and I guess this

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.400 
they have a click there and I guess this
is<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:29.930> base<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.680> my<00:04:30.800> process<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:32.690> of<00:04:33.169> course

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
is the base of my process and of course

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.620 
is the base of my process and of course
I<00:04:33.500> can't<00:04:33.740> go<00:04:33.890> into<00:04:34.040> a<00:04:34.160> long<00:04:34.729> explanation<00:04:34.790> but<00:04:35.570> a

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
I can't go into a long explanation but a

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.750 
I can't go into a long explanation but a
nineteen<00:04:36.050> yen<00:04:36.229> is<00:04:36.350> boring<00:04:36.740> it's<00:04:37.190> just<00:04:37.280> my

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
nineteen yen is boring it's just my

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.620 
nineteen yen is boring it's just my
laboratory

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
laboratory

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.570 
laboratory
I<00:04:38.800> personally<00:04:39.800> was<00:04:40.010> never<00:04:40.220> really<00:04:40.430> interested

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
I personally was never really interested

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.300 
I personally was never really interested
in<00:04:40.910> other<00:04:41.240> people's<00:04:41.600> laboratory<00:04:45.160> but<00:04:46.160> it

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
in other people's laboratory but it

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.419 
in other people's laboratory but it
starts<00:04:46.669> usually<00:04:47.360> within<00:04:47.600> a<00:04:47.870> very<00:04:48.050> simple<00:04:48.530> non

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:52.429 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:56.269 

yeah<00:04:54.349> and<00:04:55.349> then<00:04:55.499> you<00:04:55.589> put<00:04:55.739> you<00:04:55.889> put<00:04:55.919> the

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:56.279 
yeah and then you put you put the

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.529 
yeah and then you put you put the
materials<00:04:56.669> together<00:04:56.819> and<00:04:57.119> you<00:04:57.209> see<00:04:57.389> what<00:04:57.509> you

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
materials together and you see what you

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.359 
materials together and you see what you
have<00:04:57.809> there<00:04:57.839> and<00:04:58.469> you<00:04:58.619> see<00:04:58.769> if<00:04:58.889> you<00:04:58.979> can<00:04:59.189> turn

00:04:59.359 --> 00:04:59.369 
have there and you see if you can turn

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:02.809 
have there and you see if you can turn
something<00:04:59.759> into<00:05:00.619> if<00:05:01.619> you<00:05:01.769> turn<00:05:02.099> if<00:05:02.519> you<00:05:02.580> can

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
something into if you turn if you can

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.379 
something into if you turn if you can
turn<00:05:02.969> that<00:05:03.029> into<00:05:03.209> into<00:05:04.080> something<00:05:05.209> visual<00:05:06.209> but

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
turn that into into something visual but

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.369 
turn that into into something visual but
strongly<00:05:06.959> visual<00:05:07.409> not<00:05:07.529> just<00:05:07.800> something

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:09.379 
strongly visual not just something

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:14.239 
strongly visual not just something
texture<00:05:10.379> I<00:05:10.409> guess<00:05:10.739> is<00:05:11.099> in<00:05:11.639> the<00:05:11.909> end<00:05:13.249> probably

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:14.249 
texture I guess is in the end probably

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:16.249 
texture I guess is in the end probably
one<00:05:14.639> of<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.879> most<00:05:15.029> important<00:05:15.539> subject<00:05:15.929> in<00:05:16.019> my

developed<00:06:49.349> and<00:06:49.529> we<00:06:49.829> were<00:06:50.099> able<00:06:50.309> to<00:06:50.489> take

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:54.439 
developed and we were able to take
better<00:06:52.499> photograph<00:06:53.099> color<00:06:53.610> photograph<00:06:54.179> and

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:54.449 
better photograph color photograph and

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.040 
better photograph color photograph and
we<00:06:54.629> were<00:06:55.079> able<00:06:55.289> to<00:06:56.119> capture<00:06:57.119> the<00:06:57.479> the<00:06:57.689> texture

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
we were able to capture the the texture

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.880 
we were able to capture the the texture
of<00:06:58.139> our<00:06:58.589> time

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
of our time

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.080 
of our time
then<00:07:01.890> immediately<00:07:02.160> we<00:07:02.490> start<00:07:02.730> to<00:07:02.820> have<00:07:02.970> this
