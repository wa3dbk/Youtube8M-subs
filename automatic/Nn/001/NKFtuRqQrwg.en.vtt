that across one finger now an important

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.640 
that across one finger now an important
thing<00:02:29.790> when<00:02:30.030> doing<00:02:30.329> gradients<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:33.140> not<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.409> dab

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
thing when doing gradients is not to dab

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.250 
thing when doing gradients is not to dab
for<00:02:35.069> too<00:02:35.310> long<00:02:35.549> what<00:02:36.120> will<00:02:36.269> happen<00:02:36.659> is<00:02:36.810> this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
for too long what will happen is this

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.339

to the next nails once this has had a
chance<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.709> dry<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.010> can<00:02:53.189> go<00:02:53.489> back<00:02:53.760> over<00:02:54.090> it

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
chance to dry you can go back over it

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.479 
chance to dry you can go back over it
again<00:02:54.329> with<00:02:54.750> another<00:02:55.349> layer<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:56.129> then<00:02:56.310> it

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
again with another layer and then it

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.129 
again with another layer and then it
will<00:02:56.700> brighten<00:02:57.030> up<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.480> way<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.629> want<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.959> to

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
will brighten up the way you want it to

look<00:02:58.669> I'm<00:02:59.669> going<00:02:59.879> to<00:02:59.939> do<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.269> same<00:03:00.540> with<00:03:01.260> pink

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
look I'm going to do the same with pink

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
okay now taking this other piece of

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.920 
okay now taking this other piece of
sponge<00:03:34.400> will<00:03:35.400> pick<00:03:35.580> up<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.850> color<00:03:38.720> ok<00:03:39.720> and

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
sponge will pick up that color ok and

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.470 
sponge will pick up that color ok and
I'm<00:03:40.140> going<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.320> place<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.560> over<00:03:40.860> my<00:03:41.480> ring

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
next step ok so here's my gradients as

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.500 
next step ok so here's my gradients as
bright<00:03:54.630> as<00:03:54.780> they<00:03:54.990> are<00:03:55.320> going<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:56.310> be<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.850> I

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
stamp over those gradients starting with

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.530 
stamp over those gradients starting with
this<00:04:27.060> plate<00:04:27.360> from<00:04:27.600> whence<00:04:27.810> donia<00:04:28.310> plate<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.940> 16

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
this plate from whence donia plate to 16

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.270 
this plate from whence donia plate to 16
and<00:04:30.840> I'm<00:04:31.230> going<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.440> start<00:04:31.680> with<00:04:31.890> these<00:04:32.040> little
