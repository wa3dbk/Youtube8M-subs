embassy from

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.490 
embassy from
there's<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.699> there's<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.269> good<00:00:57.420> example<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
there's a there's a good example of the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.760 

so<00:01:03.760> this<00:01:03.940> is<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.239> spawn<00:01:04.510> point<00:01:04.809> for<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.199> for

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
so this is the spawn point for the for

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.410 
so this is the spawn point for the for
the<00:01:05.799> Mercs<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.369> 32<00:01:06.790> players<00:01:07.000> right

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
the Mercs and the 32 players right

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.600 
the Mercs and the 32 players right
across<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.900> map<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:08.229> can<00:01:08.380> see<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.400> line

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
across the map you can see the the line

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.060 
across the map you can see the the line
in<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.940> background<00:01:10.420> which<00:01:10.990> is<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.409> which<00:01:11.860> is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
in the background which is the which is

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.680

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
the spawn point for the commandos and

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.320 
the spawn point for the commandos and

always kind of existed but it was

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.580 
always kind of existed but it was
blocked<00:01:56.180> off<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.539> at<00:01:56.869> this<00:01:57.049> point<00:01:57.320> we're<00:01:57.560> now

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
blocked off and at this point we're now

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.429 
blocked off and at this point we're now
we've<00:01:58.340> now<00:01:58.549> opened<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.119> up<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.420> now<00:01:59.630> have<00:02:00.200> that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
reticle there's lots of rooftop accesses

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.229 
reticle there's lots of rooftop accesses
now<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:52.980> one<00:03:53.189> of<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.400> things<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.640> we<00:03:53.819> really

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
now so one of the things that we really

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
wanted to push board was allow the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.490 
wanted to push board was allow the
momentum<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.209> mobility<00:03:57.840> through<00:03:58.079> level

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
momentum in the mobility through level

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.990 
momentum in the mobility through level
in<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.920> way<00:03:59.069> that<00:03:59.250> didn't<00:03:59.489> exist<00:03:59.730> in<00:03:59.909> the

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
in a way that didn't exist in the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.330 
in a way that didn't exist in the
previous<00:04:00.299> in<00:04:00.629> the<00:04:00.780> previous<00:04:01.079> level<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:02.220> at

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
previous in the previous level so at

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.369 
previous in the previous level so at
that<00:04:02.459> point<00:04:02.519> like<00:04:02.790> directly<00:04:03.329> behind<00:04:03.510> us<00:04:03.870> we

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
that point like directly behind us we

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.050 
that point like directly behind us we
have<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.560> lot<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:04.829> individuals<00:04:05.459> hanging<00:04:05.760> out<00:04:05.879> up

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
have a lot of individuals hanging out up

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.360 
have a lot of individuals hanging out up
on<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.359> roof<00:04:06.540> these<00:04:07.500> guys<00:04:07.739> are<00:04:07.950> basically

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
on the roof these guys are basically

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.899 
on the roof these guys are basically
defending<00:04:09.060> our<00:04:09.829> core<00:04:10.829> location<00:04:11.040> being<00:04:11.579> the
