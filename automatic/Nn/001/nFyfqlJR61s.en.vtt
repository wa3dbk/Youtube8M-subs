 what is the origin of that where does it come from 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.079
 this being so demonic well history 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.869
 dictates that this would serve in a universe 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.840
 called macrocosm in it only 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.539

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.100
 everything in our current universe and 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.200
 then he launched 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.630
 all died when he drowned in his 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.880
 own vomit this allowed that to 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.700
