00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
it you know but i'm assuming that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
it you know but i'm assuming that
they're<00:01:18.270> gonna<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.689> wow<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.930> know

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
they're gonna be like wow you know

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.859 
they're gonna be like wow you know
people<00:01:19.470> are<00:01:19.560> not<00:01:19.680> gonna<00:01:19.770> biome<00:01:20.250> 13<00:01:20.790> 350<00:01:21.630> soul

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
people are not gonna biome 13 350 soul

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.380 
people are not gonna biome 13 350 soul
they're<00:01:22.290> probably<00:01:22.439> low<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> prize<00:01:23.130> like

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
they're probably low with a prize like

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.310 
they're probably low with a prize like
eventually<00:01:24.390> they're<00:01:24.689> gonna<00:01:24.750> lower<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> price

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
eventually they're gonna lower the price

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.920 
eventually they're gonna lower the price
so<00:01:25.590> i<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.670> 150<00:01:27.390> bucks<00:01:27.689> by<00:01:27.780> these

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
so i think like 150 bucks by these

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.080 
so i think like 150 bucks by these
headsets<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.619> gonna<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> good<00:01:29.430> value<00:01:29.909> a
