black arm even the pistol and I gave him

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.830 
black arm even the pistol and I gave him
one<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> new<00:00:32.700> coins<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.239> came<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
one of the new coins that came with the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.000 
one of the new coins that came with the
Lego<00:00:34.760> Batmobile<00:00:39.020> yeah<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.800> there

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
Lego Batmobile yeah you can see it there

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.369 
Lego Batmobile yeah you can see it there
and<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.059> did<00:00:42.239> kind<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.540> give<00:00:42.690> him<00:00:42.809> red<00:00:43.050> around

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
and it did kind of give him red around

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.690 
and it did kind of give him red around
the<00:00:43.469> eyes<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.649> red<00:00:44.129> around<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> mouth

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
the eyes and red around the mouth

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.180 
the eyes and red around the mouth
because<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.780> cheek<00:00:46.079> muscle<00:00:46.559> gets<00:00:46.770> burned<00:00:47.039> off

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
because the cheek muscle gets burned off

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.180 
because the cheek muscle gets burned off
and<00:00:48.200> I'm<00:00:49.200> guessing<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> eyes<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:50.010> red

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and I'm guessing the eyes are red

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.549 
and I'm guessing the eyes are red
because<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.600> eyes<00:00:51.750> been<00:00:52.079> exposed

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
because it's like the eyes been exposed

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.709 
because it's like the eyes been exposed
to<00:00:52.800> oxygen<00:00:52.949> because<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.239> doesn't<00:00:54.570> have

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
to oxygen because it doesn't have

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.330 
to oxygen because it doesn't have
eyelids<00:00:55.140> anymore

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.459 

next<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.000> whole<00:01:00.149> cluster<00:01:00.600> basically<00:01:01.410> I
