00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
with warm water and I'm going to drop

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.270 
with warm water and I'm going to drop
the<00:01:06.390> tile<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.590> don't<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.979> put<00:01:08.130> any

the tile in it you don't have to put any
cleaners<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.909> anything<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.170> basically

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
cleaners or anything in it so basically

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.899 
cleaners or anything in it so basically
what<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> water<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.189> doing<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.700> its

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
what the water is doing is its

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.480 
what the water is doing is its
dissolving<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.260> paper<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
dissolving the the paper and the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.640 
dissolving the the paper and the
adhesive<00:01:15.000> I'm<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> let<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.259> sit<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
adhesive I'm going to let that sit in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.890 
adhesive I'm going to let that sit in
there<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:17.070> an<00:01:17.280> hour<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.119> bucket

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
there for about an hour or so a bucket

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.039 
there for about an hour or so a bucket
this<00:01:19.080> size<00:01:19.290> would<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.710> ideal<00:01:20.930> especially<00:01:21.930> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this size would be ideal especially is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.929 
this size would be ideal especially is
especially<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:22.950> typically<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.790> would

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
especially because typically you would

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.510 
especially because typically you would
replace<00:01:24.330> more<00:01:25.080> than<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.560> tile<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.460> our

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
replace more than one tile for our

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.560 
replace more than one tile for our
demonstration<00:01:27.119> we're<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.509> use

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
demonstration we're just going to use

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.510 
demonstration we're just going to use
one<00:01:27.659> tile<00:01:28.080> notice<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> bubbling<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
one tile notice the bubbling on the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.080 
one tile notice the bubbling on the
tiles

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
tiles

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
tiles
that's<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> adhesive<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> paper

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that's the adhesive and the paper

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.830 
that's the adhesive and the paper
breaking<00:01:32.189> down<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> water<00:01:32.790> coming<00:01:33.689> back

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
breaking down on the water coming back

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.359 
breaking down on the water coming back
about<00:01:34.140> an<00:01:34.320> hour<00:01:34.439> later<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.479> see<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
about an hour later I see that the

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.630 
about an hour later I see that the
adhesive<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:39.000> soft<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.930> papers<00:01:40.350> loose<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:41.009> my

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
adhesive is soft the papers loose in my

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.760 
adhesive is soft the papers loose in my
hand<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.689> I'm<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.960> begin<00:01:43.079> scraping<00:01:43.649> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
hand so I'm going to begin scraping it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.350 
hand so I'm going to begin scraping it
so<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.310> might<00:01:44.520> give<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.850> little<00:01:45.000> bit<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
so this might give you a little bit of a

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.260 
so this might give you a little bit of a
hard<00:01:45.570> time<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.380> scrape<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.770> all<00:01:46.950> off<00:01:46.979> again<00:01:47.490> you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
