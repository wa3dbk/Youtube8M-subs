00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello again vip market 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.389
 ultra buy and valera and we go for your 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.429
 kitchen with new kitchen drill yes 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.139
 really today housewives and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.860
 just women who love very much 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.070
 Cook 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.789
 amaze create create can go out 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.850
 in his kitchen with his new unit 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.550
 name is bosch msm 67pe 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.519
 and see what it can be useful 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.650
 so go and under the box she 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.350
 hiding blender itself 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.270
 it is made of plastic and rubberized 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.200
 plastic the main part is made of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.980
 metal whisk, too, by the way enough 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.960
 reliable plastic here is also strong 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.969
 ice crushers 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.890
 measuring cup with marks up to 700 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.329
 milliliters 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.670
 well, and a special container for grinding 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.270
 all our glasses all capacitive parts they 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.260
 cover themselves with such caps 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.090
 the main feature is that they are 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.240
 heat resistant you lose by no means 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.670
 case well and everything but very good 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.680
 let's say with German precision 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.330
 Well, perhaps the most important attribute without 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.700
 which no review can do 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.170
 instruction on the use of this device 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.320
 why not paying attention because 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.110
 that among the reviews it says a lot 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.810
 that the device often breaks out of 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.780
 building however it is not true the fact is that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.939
 it's very powerful at 750 watts and just 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.060
 need to understand what you can do with this 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.360
 the device that they should not do 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.579
 powermax 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.229
 refers to the immersion blender and 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.400
 perhaps one of the best representatives 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.619
 of its class 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.770
 what is the evidence of this before 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.759
 altogether this is a very competent system 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.590
 fixing the thing is that in all 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.240
 the rest of the blenders goes just plugin 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.070
 design hold design yet 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.380
 fixed by a special mechanism need 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.509
 clamp on both sides and detach 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.180
 the item you need so you 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.980
 can change the whisk without question 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.200
 chopper and vice versa like this 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.720
 shipped everything is very clearly fixed 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.090
 elements are not going anywhere 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.399
 loose it means it will last 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.500
 you have quite a long box 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.480
 conveniently pressed and made of 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.330
 rubberized plastic in this way 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.040
 they are not under any circumstances 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.959
 externally influenced and will serve you 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.740
 long enough 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.820
 even calmly wash will not affect their 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.270
 performance 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.360
 all without question sinks enough 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.220
 span and for such glasses maybe 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.730
 2 more glasses although I have to say 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.739
 what 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.930
 I would like to have a glass 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.720
 more since all the same this blender 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.690
 powerful enough because its power is 750 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.910
 watt is present here turbo mode well 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.800
 about ergonomics here questions and 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.080
 no complaints whatsoever because 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.020
 rubberized plastic it will always help 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.700
 you so that the blender does not jump out of hand 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.830
 first of all the color range is 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.450
 separate topic for this unit 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.080
 since it is made of gray and black 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.170
 tones the main advantage in the kitchen 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.120
 the fact that it does not get dirty and keep your 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.570
 appearance and will serve you enough 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.420
 long 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.370
 as for the items with which 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.650
 have to work here censure 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.980
 there is absolutely no plastic 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.049
 very strong very so strong with something 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.030
 even reminds you know the Soviet such 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.280
 plastic is still in its time which serves 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.799
 20 years here 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.390
 made all the items from very 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.150
 good quality metal skire all 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.790
 this steel is clean here well and the blades should 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.980
 last for a long time anyway by 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.590
 reviews no questions and complaints 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.080
 definitely did not occur 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.940
 For now, then all the elements 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.700
 chrome this means that they are by no means 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.790
 way does not rust well and in general then with 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.260
 if desired, they can be pumped therefore 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.890
 on this blender 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.290
 you can rely give you no longer enough 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.590
 place the blender on the wall 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.690
 bosch never ceases to amaze 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.900
 create and create and amaze 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.160

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.620
