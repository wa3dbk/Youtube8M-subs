it<00:00:00.240> looks<00:00:00.420> like<00:00:00.510> it<00:00:00.630> might<00:00:00.750> soon<00:00:01.079> be<00:00:01.290> possible

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
it looks like it might soon be possible

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.519 
it looks like it might soon be possible
to<00:00:02.129> make<00:00:02.310> sperm<00:00:02.850> out<00:00:03.210> of<00:00:03.419> human<00:00:03.780> skin<00:00:04.200> cells

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
to make sperm out of human skin cells

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:05.360 
to make sperm out of human skin cells
huh

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
huh

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:14.570 
huh
I'll<00:00:05.879> believe<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.509> when<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.660> biopsy<00:00:07.440> it<00:00:13.580> John

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
I'll believe it when I biopsy it John

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.430 
I'll believe it when I biopsy it John
Hannah<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:15.059> think-tank<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:15.960> we're<00:00:16.289> talking

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
Hannah on think-tank so we're talking

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.519 
Hannah on think-tank so we're talking
about<00:00:16.740> making<00:00:17.279> both<00:00:17.789> semen<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.630> also<00:00:19.230> eggs

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
about making both semen and also eggs

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.759 
about making both semen and also eggs
out<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:21.300> skin<00:00:21.570> cells<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:22.140> two<00:00:22.350> people

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
out of the skin cells of two people

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.990 
out of the skin cells of two people
right<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> interesting<00:00:23.640> thing<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
right and the interesting thing is

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000 
right and the interesting thing is
theoretically<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.109> could<00:00:25.230> make<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.650> sperm

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
theoretically you could make the sperm

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.800 
theoretically you could make the sperm
cells<00:00:26.340> out<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.550> two<00:00:26.760> women's<00:00:27.210> skin<00:00:27.539> cells

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
cells out of two women's skin cells

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.200 
cells out of two women's skin cells
right<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.439> egg<00:00:28.619> cells<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.250> eggs<00:00:29.820> out<00:00:30.179> of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
right and the egg cells and eggs out of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330 
right and the egg cells and eggs out of
two<00:00:30.480> men's<00:00:30.810> skin<00:00:31.170> cells<00:00:31.410> which<00:00:31.920> previously

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
two men's skin cells which previously

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.190 
two men's skin cells which previously
had<00:00:32.640> been<00:00:32.669> extremely<00:00:33.120> difficult<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.870> do<00:00:33.989> or

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
had been extremely difficult to do or

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.900 
had been extremely difficult to do or
impossible<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.550> there's<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> lot<00:00:35.820> of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
impossible and so there's a lot of

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.340 
impossible and so there's a lot of
consequences<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.020> want<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> run

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
consequences of that but we want to run

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.420 
consequences of that but we want to run
you<00:00:37.500> through<00:00:37.530> some<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.980> research<00:00:38.309> that's

in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.920> body<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.940> an<00:00:51.000> interesting

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
in the body and we have an interesting

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.700 
in the body and we have an interesting
quote<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> scientists<00:00:52.649> who

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
quote from one of the scientists who

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.410 
quote from one of the scientists who
said<00:00:52.920> we've<00:00:53.430> also<00:00:53.610> discovered<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.390> of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
said we've also discovered that one of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.880 
said we've also discovered that one of
the<00:00:54.539> things<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.960> happens<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.469> these<00:00:55.620> germ

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the things that happens in these germ

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.099 
the things that happens in these germ
cells<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.579> epigenetic<00:00:56.879> mutations<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
cells is that epigenetic mutations the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.689 
cells is that epigenetic mutations the
cell<00:00:58.320> mistakes<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.800> occur<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.160> age<00:00:59.370> are

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
cell mistakes that occur with age are

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.490 
cell mistakes that occur with age are
wiped<00:00:59.940> out<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.870> means<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> cells

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
wiped out that means the cells

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.680 
wiped out that means the cells
regenerated<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.340> reset<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.300> while<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> rest

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
regenerated and reset so while the rest

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.420 
regenerated and reset so while the rest
of<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> cells<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.379> body<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.799> aged<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
of the cells in the body of aged and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.760 
of the cells in the body of aged and
contain<00:01:05.790> genetic<00:01:06.210> mistakes<00:01:06.659> these<00:01:07.290> ones

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
contain genetic mistakes these ones

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.010 
contain genetic mistakes these ones
don't<00:01:08.340> right<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.210> that's<00:01:09.330> interesting<00:01:09.720> I

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
don't right and so that's interesting I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.539 
don't right and so that's interesting I
mean<00:01:10.110> there's<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.409> five<00:01:10.680> different<00:01:11.040> groups

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
mean there's like five different groups

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.240 
mean there's like five different groups
that<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.150> could<00:01:12.420> benefit<00:01:12.990> um<00:01:13.500> there<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
that this could benefit um there of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.460 
that this could benefit um there of
course<00:01:14.460> concerns<00:01:15.299> anytime<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.259> talk<00:01:16.409> about

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
course concerns anytime you talk about

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.490 
course concerns anytime you talk about
at<00:01:17.280> changing<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.210> way<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.780> create<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
at changing the way that we create a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
at changing the way that we create a
person<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> stork<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.299> not

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
person you know if the stork is not

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.060 
person you know if the stork is not
involved<00:01:22.080> people<00:01:22.229> are<00:01:22.439> gonna<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.740> scared

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
involved people are gonna be scared

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.260 
involved people are gonna be scared
they're<00:01:23.310> gonna<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.549> worried<00:01:23.759> about<00:01:23.820> designer

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
they're gonna be worried about designer

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.460 
they're gonna be worried about designer
babies<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:24.990> may<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.170> worried<00:01:25.409> about

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
babies there may be worried about

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.190 
babies there may be worried about
subverting<00:01:26.250> nature<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.180> creating<00:01:27.600> mutants

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
subverting nature you creating mutants

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200 
subverting nature you creating mutants
or<00:01:28.320> something<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> lot<00:01:30.090> of

or something like that but for a lot of
groups<00:01:30.390> which<00:01:30.540> we're<00:01:30.659> gonna<00:01:30.750> talk<00:01:30.960> about<00:01:30.990> this

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
groups which we're gonna talk about this

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.740 
groups which we're gonna talk about this
could<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.920> huge<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.729> could<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:32.880> historic<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
could be huge it could be historic and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.840 
could be huge it could be historic and
just<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.619> know<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.860> even<00:01:34.890> groups<00:01:35.340> who<00:01:35.520> could

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
just you know not even groups who could

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.819 
just you know not even groups who could
have<00:01:36.030> babies<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.479> weren't<00:01:36.900> otherwise<00:01:37.409> like

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
have babies that weren't otherwise like

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.929 
have babies that weren't otherwise like
able<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.340> babies<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.729> could<00:01:38.850> think

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
able to have babies you could think

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.429 
able to have babies you could think
about<00:01:39.060> they're<00:01:39.600> saying<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> lot<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.259> them

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
about they're saying that a lot of them

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.960 
about they're saying that a lot of them
didn't<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:40.920> mutation<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.670> you'd<00:01:41.820> be

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
didn't have mutation so you'd be

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.819 
didn't have mutation so you'd be
deleting<00:01:42.540> some<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> genetic<00:01:43.380> mutations

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
deleting some of the genetic mutations

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:44.960 
deleting some of the genetic mutations
that<00:01:43.950> would<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.159> passed<00:01:44.369> down<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.729> say<00:01:44.909> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that would be passed down they say it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.149 
that would be passed down they say it
doesn't<00:01:45.240> happen<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.720> all<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.049> them<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.680> it's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
doesn't happen for all of them but it's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.889 
doesn't happen for all of them but it's
a<00:01:47.340> majority<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> them<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.540> could<00:01:48.689> also

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
a majority of them so that could also

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.050 
a majority of them so that could also
create<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.350> healthier<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.130> healthier<00:01:50.549> baby<00:01:50.729> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
create a healthier a healthier baby and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.190 
create a healthier a healthier baby and
you<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.540> would<00:01:51.689> kind<00:01:52.140> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
you know and that would kind of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.020 
you know and that would kind of
alleviate<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.950> lot<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.549> other<00:01:53.759> problems

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
alleviate a lot of other problems

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.690 
alleviate a lot of other problems
another<00:01:54.630> host<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.170> problems<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.710> are<00:01:56.399> seeing

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
another host of problems that are seeing

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.429 
another host of problems that are seeing
you<00:01:56.850> know<00:01:56.969> kinda<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.299> childbirth<00:01:57.600> yeah<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you know kinda with childbirth yeah and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.499 
you know kinda with childbirth yeah and
so<00:01:58.560> even<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.280> women<00:01:59.700> who<00:01:59.820> might<00:02:00.030> want<00:02:00.360> to

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
so even just for women who might want to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
so even just for women who might want to
conceive<00:02:00.930> later<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.439> life<00:02:01.649> there's<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.430> is

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
conceive later in life there's there is

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.429 
conceive later in life there's there is
a<00:02:02.610> risk<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.270> because<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.840> increased

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
a risk of that because of the increased

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.730 
a risk of that because of the increased
likelihood<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:05.189> mutation

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
likelihood of mutation

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.699 
likelihood of mutation
DNA<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:07.180> becomes<00:02:07.479> more<00:02:07.659> dangerous<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:08.410> if<00:02:08.590> you

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
DNA it becomes more dangerous but if you

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:09.900 
DNA it becomes more dangerous but if you
use<00:02:08.830> something<00:02:09.069> like<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.429> if<00:02:09.610> they<00:02:09.759> can

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
use something like this if they can

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.550 
use something like this if they can
actually<00:02:10.090> turn<00:02:10.660> into<00:02:10.840> something<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.349> can<00:02:11.470> go

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
actually turn into something you can go

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.290 
actually turn into something you can go
to<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.680> hospital<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.099> use<00:02:12.280> then<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.000> could<00:02:13.150> be

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
to a hospital and use then it could be

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.330 
to a hospital and use then it could be
much<00:02:13.599> safer<00:02:14.140> for<00:02:14.170> women<00:02:14.380> in<00:02:14.739> their<00:02:14.830> 40s<00:02:15.190> 50s

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
much safer for women in their 40s 50s

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.890 
much safer for women in their 40s 50s
and<00:02:15.760> even<00:02:15.819> later<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.360> possibly<00:02:16.750> have

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and even later to possibly have

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.240 
and even later to possibly have
especially<00:02:17.260> now<00:02:17.620> as<00:02:17.770> women<00:02:18.010> are<00:02:18.099> having

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
especially now as women are having

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.920 
especially now as women are having
babies<00:02:18.520> later<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.060> later<00:02:19.150> in<00:02:19.360> life<00:02:19.390> yeah<00:02:19.750> yeah

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
babies later and later in life yeah yeah

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.360 
babies later and later in life yeah yeah
we<00:02:20.200> need<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.410> tell<00:02:20.739> you<00:02:20.860> when<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.069> meet<00:02:21.190> this

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
we need to tell you when you meet this

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.850 
we need to tell you when you meet this
exactly<00:02:21.940> exactly<00:02:22.750> now<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.170> course<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:23.800> not

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
exactly exactly now of course it's not

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.650 
exactly exactly now of course it's not
just<00:02:23.920> for<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.610> mean<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.880> have<00:02:24.910> men<00:02:25.450> who

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
just for that I mean you have men who

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.750 
just for that I mean you have men who
might<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:25.989> been<00:02:26.140> turned<00:02:26.920> infertile<00:02:27.489> as<00:02:27.730> a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
might have been turned infertile as a

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.460 
might have been turned infertile as a
result<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.300> disease<00:02:28.690> as<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.959> result<00:02:29.319> of

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
result of disease as a result of

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.440 
result of disease as a result of
accidents<00:02:29.880> radiation<00:02:30.880> all<00:02:31.030> sorts<00:02:31.390> of

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
accidents radiation all sorts of

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.430 
accidents radiation all sorts of
different<00:02:31.690> things<00:02:31.720> can<00:02:31.989> result<00:02:32.260> in

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
different things can result in

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.620 
different things can result in
infertility<00:02:32.800> right<00:02:33.430> um<00:02:33.640> even<00:02:34.090> potentially

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
infertility right um even potentially

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.699 
infertility right um even potentially
the<00:02:34.690> clothing<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.050> wear<00:02:35.140> things<00:02:35.349> like<00:02:35.530> that

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
the clothing you wear things like that

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.860 
the clothing you wear things like that
and<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.370> if<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.760> can<00:02:36.940> create<00:02:37.239> an<00:02:37.360> alternate

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
and so if you can create an alternate

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.470 
and so if you can create an alternate
route<00:02:38.049> for<00:02:38.500> otherwise<00:02:39.269> theoretically<00:02:40.269> able

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
route for otherwise theoretically able

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.330 
route for otherwise theoretically able
to<00:02:40.750> procreate<00:02:41.080> people<00:02:41.530> then<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.100> will<00:02:42.250> help

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
to procreate people then that will help

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.470 
to procreate people then that will help
them<00:02:42.580> out<00:02:42.700> as<00:02:42.819> well<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.000> you're<00:02:43.209> talking<00:02:43.299> about

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
them out as well so you're talking about

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.330 
them out as well so you're talking about
older<00:02:43.690> women<00:02:43.720> you're<00:02:44.440> talking<00:02:44.799> about<00:02:44.860> men<00:02:45.160> or

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
older women you're talking about men or

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.610 
older women you're talking about men or
women<00:02:45.819> who<00:02:45.940> have<00:02:45.970> become<00:02:46.450> infertile<00:02:46.930> possibly

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
women who have become infertile possibly

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.770 
women who have become infertile possibly
it<00:02:48.370> has<00:02:48.519> also<00:02:48.670> caused<00:02:49.060> interest<00:02:49.480> from<00:02:49.600> gay

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
it has also caused interest from gay

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.059 
it has also caused interest from gay
groups<00:02:50.080> because<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.530> possibility<00:02:51.040> of

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
groups because of the possibility of

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.340 
groups because of the possibility of
making<00:02:51.280> egg<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.790> sperm<00:02:51.970> cells<00:02:52.299> from<00:02:52.930> parents

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
making egg and sperm cells from parents

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.490 
making egg and sperm cells from parents
of<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.860> same<00:02:54.130> sex<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.480> overall<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.230> mean

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
of the same sex and so overall I mean

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.110 
of the same sex and so overall I mean
there<00:02:56.650> are<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.830> concerns<00:02:57.250> as<00:02:57.549> there<00:02:57.940> always

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
there are the concerns as there always

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.270 
there are the concerns as there always
are<00:02:58.420> usually<00:02:58.900> from<00:02:59.080> religious<00:02:59.560> folk<00:02:59.799> that

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
are usually from religious folk that

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.250 
are usually from religious folk that
this<00:03:00.459> is<00:03:00.610> going<00:03:00.790> against<00:03:01.239> nature<00:03:01.269> or<00:03:01.840> that

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
this is going against nature or that

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.259 
this is going against nature or that
it's<00:03:02.380> going<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.560> create<00:03:02.709> like<00:03:03.160> Gattaca<00:03:04.060> or

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
it's going to create like Gattaca or

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.789 
it's going to create like Gattaca or
something<00:03:04.720> like<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:04.900> makes<00:03:05.349> a<00:03:05.440> designer

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
something like that makes a designer

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.259 
something like that makes a designer
babies<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.519> stuff<00:03:06.670> like<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:07.000> we'd<00:03:07.120> be<00:03:07.239> able

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
babies and stuff like that we'd be able

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.880 
babies and stuff like that we'd be able
to<00:03:07.450> choose<00:03:07.810> kind<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.110> like<00:03:08.260> aesthetics<00:03:08.739> or

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
to choose kind of like aesthetics or

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.220 
to choose kind of like aesthetics or
intelligence<00:03:09.549> stuff<00:03:09.880> like<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.329> but<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:10.900> think

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
intelligence stuff like that but I think

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.660 
intelligence stuff like that but I think
like<00:03:11.410> especially<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.040> mean<00:03:12.220> they're<00:03:12.519> talking

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
like especially I mean they're talking

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.819 
like especially I mean they're talking
about<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.299> is<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:14.200> UK<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:14.530> they<00:03:14.739> would

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
about so this is in the UK so they would

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.170 
about so this is in the UK so they would
have<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.070> pass<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.280> lot<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.640> loss<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:15.970> make<00:03:16.090> sure

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
have to pass a lot of loss to make sure

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.789 
have to pass a lot of loss to make sure
this<00:03:16.299> happened<00:03:16.630> but<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.750> think<00:03:17.049> kind<00:03:17.500> of<00:03:17.560> doing

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
this happened but I think kind of doing

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.800 
this happened but I think kind of doing
some<00:03:18.010> research<00:03:18.160> into<00:03:18.579> this<00:03:18.820> like<00:03:19.060> they<00:03:19.570> have

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
some research into this like they have

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.960 
some research into this like they have
really<00:03:20.079> specific<00:03:20.260> laws<00:03:20.769> as<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.040> what<00:03:21.579> would<00:03:21.820> be

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
really specific laws as to what would be

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.789 
really specific laws as to what would be
able<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.359> and<00:03:22.989> of<00:03:23.140> course<00:03:23.350> like<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.650> all

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
able to and of course like that all

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:24.840 
able to and of course like that all
advanced<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.430> will<00:03:24.519> probably<00:03:24.640> become

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
advanced and it will probably become

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.849 
advanced and it will probably become
more<00:03:25.180> broad<00:03:25.390> in<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.630> future<00:03:25.959> but<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.470> lot<00:03:26.709> of

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
more broad in the future but a lot of

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.410 
more broad in the future but a lot of
them<00:03:27.010> are<00:03:27.130> gonna<00:03:27.220> be<00:03:27.310> super<00:03:27.549> specific<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:28.299> that

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
them are gonna be super specific so that

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.479 
them are gonna be super specific so that
it<00:03:28.540> would<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:29.109> know<00:03:29.230> not<00:03:29.590> let<00:03:29.829> couples<00:03:30.280> do

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
it would you know not let couples do

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.039 
it would you know not let couples do
that<00:03:30.640> where<00:03:30.880> they'd<00:03:31.030> be<00:03:31.150> picking<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.840> that's

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
that where they'd be picking and that's

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.270 
that where they'd be picking and that's
not<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.380> kind<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.620> research<00:03:32.950> that<00:03:33.010> they're

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
not the kind of research that they're

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.979 
not the kind of research that they're
doing<00:03:33.459> they're<00:03:33.670> just<00:03:33.700> animated<00:03:34.420> right

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
doing they're just animated right

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.420 
doing they're just animated right
they're<00:03:35.230> just<00:03:35.260> trying<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.950> make<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.280> so<00:03:36.400> that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
they're just trying to make it so that

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.190 
they're just trying to make it so that
other<00:03:36.730> people<00:03:37.030> get<00:03:37.120> on<00:03:37.239> babies<00:03:37.569> who<00:03:37.660> normally

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
other people get on babies who normally

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.599 
other people get on babies who normally
wouldn't<00:03:38.380> have<00:03:38.470> babies<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.010> also<00:03:39.220> make

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
wouldn't have babies and also make

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:40.890 
wouldn't have babies and also make
healthier<00:03:39.970> babies<00:03:40.269> like<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.480> don't<00:03:40.660> see<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
healthier babies like I don't see the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.490 
healthier babies like I don't see the
issue<00:03:41.019> here<00:03:41.380> babies<00:03:42.720> babies<00:03:43.720> yeah<00:03:43.959> yeah

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
issue here babies babies yeah yeah

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.039 
issue here babies babies yeah yeah
exactly<00:03:44.650> like<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.489> people<00:03:46.090> will<00:03:46.359> use<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.600> story

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
exactly like it people will use a story

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.530 
exactly like it people will use a story
like<00:03:47.230> this<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.370> talk<00:03:48.730> about<00:03:49.030> their<00:03:49.209> fears

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
like this to to talk about their fears

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.420 
like this to to talk about their fears
of<00:03:49.750> designer<00:03:50.049> babies<00:03:50.470> but<00:03:50.650> whether<00:03:51.130> you<00:03:51.310> can

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
of designer babies but whether you can

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.580 
of designer babies but whether you can
go<00:03:51.579> in<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:51.880> tweak<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.329> DNA<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.810> change<00:03:53.290> eye

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
go in and tweak the DNA to change eye

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.500 
go in and tweak the DNA to change eye
color<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:54.069> IQ<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:54.760> things<00:03:54.910> like<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.359> it

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
color and IQ and things like that is it

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.410 
color and IQ and things like that is it
is<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.660> totally<00:03:56.079> separate<00:03:56.470> thing<00:03:56.530> from<00:03:56.799> this

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
is a totally separate thing from this

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.390 
is a totally separate thing from this
there<00:03:58.420> are<00:03:58.450> related<00:03:59.350> conversations<00:03:59.590> but<00:04:00.310> you

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
there are related conversations but you

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.280 
there are related conversations but you
can<00:04:00.549> have<00:04:00.700> one<00:04:00.910> without<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.239> other<00:04:01.389> or<00:04:01.810> vice

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
can have one without the other or vice

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.910 
can have one without the other or vice
versa

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
versa

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.250 
versa
and<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.489> think<00:04:03.549> considering<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.569> huge

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
and I think considering the the huge

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.449 
and I think considering the the huge
number<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:05.709> different<00:04:06.010> groups<00:04:06.100> that<00:04:06.340> this

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
number of different groups that this

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.280 
number of different groups that this
could<00:04:06.639> potentially<00:04:07.209> help<00:04:07.359> you<00:04:07.900> would<00:04:08.019> imagine

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
could potentially help you would imagine

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.110 
could potentially help you would imagine
that<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.920> religious<00:04:09.430> folk<00:04:09.850> the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
that the religious folk the

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.640 
that the religious folk the
Conservatives<00:04:10.750> would<00:04:10.870> be<00:04:10.989> happy<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:11.530> we're

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
Conservatives would be happy that we're

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.080 
Conservatives would be happy that we're
even<00:04:11.769> talking<00:04:11.889> about<00:04:12.220> having<00:04:12.430> more<00:04:12.760> babies

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
even talking about having more babies

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.099 
even talking about having more babies
they're<00:04:13.269> always<00:04:13.389> worried<00:04:13.720> about<00:04:13.750> women

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
they're always worried about women

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.629 
they're always worried about women
putting<00:04:14.650> off<00:04:14.889> and<00:04:15.130> not<00:04:15.250> having<00:04:15.609> children

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
putting off and not having children

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.710 
putting off and not having children
about<00:04:16.630> having<00:04:16.900> abortions<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.470> things

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
about having abortions and things

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.660 
about having abortions and things
here<00:04:18.230> we're<00:04:18.410> talking<00:04:18.560> about<00:04:18.769> creating<00:04:19.370> more

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
here we're talking about creating more

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.330 
here we're talking about creating more
children<00:04:20.390> more<00:04:20.600> life<00:04:20.840> just<00:04:21.440> as<00:04:21.620> God<00:04:21.920> or<00:04:22.190> the

children more life just as God or the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.220 
children more life just as God or the
gods<00:04:22.370> have<00:04:22.970> said<00:04:23.180> they<00:04:23.330> want<00:04:23.540> it<00:04:23.750> or<00:04:23.870> something

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
gods have said they want it or something

actual the research that this group is

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.980 
actual the research that this group is
doing<00:04:28.160> it's<00:04:28.430> still<00:04:28.670> incredibly<00:04:29.120> preliminary
