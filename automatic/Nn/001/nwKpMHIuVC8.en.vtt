00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.340 
that aspect of it and looks it looks
pretty<00:01:20.850> interesting<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.509> me<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
pretty interesting to me but for the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
pretty interesting to me but for the
campaign<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> think<00:01:23.670> both<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.299> them

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
campaign you know I think both of them

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.120 
campaign you know I think both of them
are<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.110> go<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.380> different<00:01:25.740> ways

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
are going to really go to different ways

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.830 
are going to really go to different ways
where<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:26.759> call<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.240> duty<00:01:27.270> has<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
where I think call of duty has the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.420 
where I think call of duty has the
advantage<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> campaign<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.189> it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
advantage with the campaign because it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.520 
advantage with the campaign because it
has<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.850> lot<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> those<00:01:30.240> wow<00:01:30.570> moments<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:31.290> man

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
has a lot of those wow moments like man

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
has a lot of those wow moments like man
that's<00:01:31.710> crazy<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.460> something<00:01:32.790> happens<00:01:33.150> where

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that's crazy but something happens where

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.580 
that's crazy but something happens where
the<00:01:33.420> tent<00:01:33.659> collapsed<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.140> parking<00:01:34.229> garage

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the tent collapsed in the parking garage

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.830 
the tent collapsed in the parking garage

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
beams and one of the levels that this

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.120 
beams and one of the levels that this
huge<00:02:44.150> skyscraper<00:02:44.840> came<00:02:45.140> crashing<00:02:45.709> down<00:02:45.739> I'm

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
huge skyscraper came crashing down I'm

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.040 
huge skyscraper came crashing down I'm
at<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.640> players<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.180> looks<00:02:47.810> like<00:02:47.930> they

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
at the players it looks like they

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.540 
at the players it looks like they
completed<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.590> objective<00:02:49.010> on<00:02:49.190> there<00:02:49.370> and

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
completed the objective on there and

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.190 
completed the objective on there and
brought<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.000> down<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:50.540> both<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.720> these<00:02:50.930> games

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
brought that down so both of these games

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.690 
brought that down so both of these games
are<00:02:51.380> going<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.590> be<00:02:51.650> featuring<00:02:51.950> some<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.580> know

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
are going to be featuring some you know

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.460 
are going to be featuring some you know
kind<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.209> destructible<00:02:53.780> environments

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
kind of the destructible environments

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.380 
kind of the destructible environments
but<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.070> think<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.400> again<00:02:55.550> call<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.209> gonna

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
but I think that again call it is gonna

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.640 
but I think that again call it is gonna
be<00:02:56.480> for<00:02:56.600> those<00:02:56.720> people<00:02:56.840> who<00:02:57.019> want<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.590> be

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
be for those people who want to be

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.860 
be for those people who want to be
playing<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:58.130> lot<00:02:58.430> very<00:02:58.910> competitively<00:02:59.540> we're

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
playing a lot very competitively we're

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.390 
playing a lot very competitively we're
better<00:03:00.260> fuel<00:03:00.470> because<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.830> have<00:03:00.920> vehicles

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
better fuel because you have vehicles

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.770 
better fuel because you have vehicles
because<00:03:01.610> it's<00:03:01.790> more<00:03:01.940> open<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.510> can<00:03:02.540> have

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
because it's more open you can have

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.540 
because it's more open you can have
other<00:03:02.989> players<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.500> think<00:03:03.530> up<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.860> 64<00:03:04.280> players

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
other players I think up to 64 players

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.699 
other players I think up to 64 players
total<00:03:04.820> and<00:03:05.570> also<00:03:05.900> you're<00:03:06.200> gonna<00:03:06.320> have<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.590> new

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
total and also you're gonna have the new

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.110 
total and also you're gonna have the new
commander<00:03:07.310> mode<00:03:07.489> where<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:07.700> actually<00:03:07.910> be

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
commander mode where you actually be

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.030 
commander mode where you actually be
able<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.330> use<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> tablet<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.680> control

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
able to use a tablet to control

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.380 
able to use a tablet to control
different<00:03:10.250> aspects<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:10.910> multiplayer<00:03:11.330> game

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
different aspects of a multiplayer game

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.720 
different aspects of a multiplayer game
sending<00:03:12.380> missiles<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.890> certain<00:03:13.250> spot<00:03:13.489> or

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
sending missiles to a certain spot or

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.009 
sending missiles to a certain spot or
telling<00:03:14.030> your<00:03:14.150> troops<00:03:14.360> they<00:03:14.480> need<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.690> go<00:03:14.810> here

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
telling your troops they need to go here

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.110 
telling your troops they need to go here
and<00:03:15.230> kind<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:15.980> know<00:03:16.010> managing<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.730> game<00:03:16.910> I

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
and kind of you know managing the game I

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.640 
and kind of you know managing the game I
think<00:03:17.510> battlefield<00:03:17.989> 4's<00:03:18.170> multiplayer<00:03:18.590> is

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
know you can play once a month jump in

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.020 
know you can play once a month jump in
your<00:03:24.110> part<00:03:24.320> we<00:03:24.410> still<00:03:24.560> have<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.920> lot<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:25.340> fun<00:03:25.670> so

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
both of them are going to be pretty good

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.780 
both of them are going to be pretty good
but<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.680> know<00:03:27.799> that<00:03:28.010> before<00:03:28.370> is<00:03:28.459> multiplayer

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
the two and that is battlefield 4 and so

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.830 
the two and that is battlefield 4 and so
you<00:03:34.820> have<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.000> main<00:03:35.150> thing<00:03:35.329> for<00:03:35.360> bad<00:03:35.600> looking
