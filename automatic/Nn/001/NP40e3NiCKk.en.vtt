00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.179
 Take personal op right fine 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.000
 we are here with our backyard paper 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.590
 wings and today the tip about images for 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.420
 You who have a kindle paper white or 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.160
 has curiosity and everything else 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.380
 not always the device as you well 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.850
 know the digital book reader then the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.470
 Your screen does not have much what 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.810
 wait for pictures there's no way you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.260
 opens the book Gulliver's Travels by 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.820
 example you only have the text of the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.289
 when an image has an image in 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.369
 black and white because his screen is 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.719
 black and white 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.420
 only a lot of people leave it as if 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.309
 was not able to play back images 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.140
 but it reproduces well an example here of the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.899
 the walking dead comic you can 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.600
 to see that the digital book reader 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.520
 looks great for reproducing images 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 this is a whole by tapping and holding on 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.780
 image or twice 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.820
 so it stays in full screen you 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.129
 can see that it gives quietly to see 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.020
 Neither black and white images are obvious right 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.750
 however you can put your pictures 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.580
 here then what's the secret, well, I'll go 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.100
 show where the image folder is 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.740
 first it stays there at the end of the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.590
 your kindle can see that here at the end 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.869
 a pictures folder appears but here it has 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.820
 easier way when you turn on the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.430
 paste the pictures in the corner 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.420
 enter 99 or five than the last page 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.640
 to unite 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.869
 he has already advanced on the last menu page 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.540
 of your kindle 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.479
 Let's open the images here are 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.130
 the images we have like you 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.189
 enable this menu of images in your 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.409
 kindle easy to show you here created 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.270
 the slides folder teaching this when 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.990
 you connect your kindle computer 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.659
 this appears here local disk kindle pw 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.619
 that your dvd player finally 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.960
 you open your kindle sure you create 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:58.439
 bet it says 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.420
 and ma gs images right you create as if 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.070
 was any folder ready in the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.469
 the moment you open the kindle and created 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.570
 this folder you can already put 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.580
 in there and ready images 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.500
 a reminder to you that if you want 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.510
 put the image exactly as I did 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.500
 here in full screen you have to rotate 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.840
 the image 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.060
 she lies in the kindle he does not 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.690
 recognizes whether you are doing so or 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.120
 like this 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.580
 then this image I circled so that she 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.010
 stay on purpose then in the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.870
 computer I see the time that way there 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.120
 I used the turning tool to stay 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.920
 pie on the computer and it gets right 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.290
 no kindle because kindle only has layout 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.570
 as you can see vertical 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.950
 So the image does not fall. 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.350
 you 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.200
 going back there we go in the pictures folder 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.989
 I created something that you see 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.600
 photos without rotation 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.820
 Come on, these photos here they are. 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.520
 available on the channel drive in jp 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.590
 barred string drive in the description of the 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.870
 video description has the link for you 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.760
 download it if you want and you can see 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.950
 that photo if you do not vote 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.290
 with white space tapping and 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.030
 holding the photo does not have a menu if 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.220
 play twice does not play either 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.820
 or you can see that the photo appears 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.700
 however at the top is you think then it is 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.920
 just run the photo that looks beautiful right? 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.790
 more or less these photos here are with 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.400
 rotation 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.660
 Look what happened they stayed 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.610
 larger 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.040
 but today I have the white belt in 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.200
 because they are a little 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.290
 lower than kindle resolution 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.239
 even the size and it will happen 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.000
 will not stay on land interdicted easy 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.880
 you can see here perfectly 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.620
 that the resolution of the photos is high even 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.180
 on his black and white screen 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.370
 if you want to upload some photos 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.620
 to show the guys the kindle can be 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.209
 an option is a simple option but it is 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.440
 so come on 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.810
 remembering that the layout of seeing your 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.310
 I had to take the photo in a vertical 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.660
 gambiarra 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.450
 I'm going to take a picture here normal 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.640
 cap take direct cap you can 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.920
 to see that it is in full page is because 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.650
 this banner here I did in the resolution 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.810
 correct by photoshop by its publisher 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.220
 photo favorite is finally in size 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.079
 kindle exact 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.540
 so you have to decrease or expand 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.209
 the photo exactly in the frame in size 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.549
 correct if you want to have the 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.650
 Correct size is very cool 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.910
 It was really cool, even if you want to 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.530
 leave like this 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.450
 you just hit a catch of 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.669
 kindle screen to make a print 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.420
 screen on your kindle you put your finger 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.120
 on the screen 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.980
 sing and play with the other one here 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.830
 can see that it hits a print screen 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.830
 he looks great doing the two finger together 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.810
 finger is well in the corner saw is almost in the 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.250
 tip that nabor money puts the 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.480
 two fingers together 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.700
 each time he does this he hits a 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.040
 print screen beauty where will it open 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.620
 You 're going to go there on your computer. 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.020
 connects your kindle and it will stop 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.880
 direct here already takes its principle 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.860
 indentation of kindle memory with 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.170
 print screen hands you do what you do 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.090
 I want you to edit you do what 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.650
 I just showed you that you 're going to have the 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.400
 correct size you only give edit in the 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.100
 Image 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.710
 There you use size as a base. 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.320
 very cool and here is an example of blood 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.100
 screen and alternates against the bat with the 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.450

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.210
 You can see that he tricks to 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.550
 Damn he had it in high resolution 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.640

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.220

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.040
 during anything that is 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.180
 making and print folder is great 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.860
 screens I created 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.510

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.710
 connects your kindle to your computer with 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.420
 blocked screen 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.640
 Do you already see the folder as print screens? 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.710
