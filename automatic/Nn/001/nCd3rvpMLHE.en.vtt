00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
now yeah so is he playing the same

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.629 
now yeah so is he playing the same
character<00:04:58.319> so<00:04:59.319> it's<00:04:59.500> for<00:04:59.680> most<00:05:00.160> of<00:05:00.310> this<00:05:00.430> not

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
character so it's for most of this not

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.189 
character so it's for most of this not
all<00:05:00.699> the<00:05:00.819> bad<00:05:00.970> guys<00:05:01.000> died<00:05:01.449> from<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.780> originals

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
all the bad guys died from the originals

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.629 
all the bad guys died from the originals
but<00:05:02.430> does<00:05:03.430> he<00:05:03.520> survive<00:05:03.849> somehow<00:05:04.180> someway<00:05:04.750> and

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
but does he survive somehow someway and

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.279 
but does he survive somehow someway and
if<00:05:06.639> he<00:05:06.789> is<00:05:06.970> displayed<00:05:07.419> in<00:05:07.509> the<00:05:07.599> same<00:05:07.780> character

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
if he is displayed in the same character

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.320 
if he is displayed in the same character
then<00:05:08.620> that<00:05:08.830> means<00:05:09.099> Tom<00:05:09.430> Hardy<00:05:09.759> can't<00:05:10.030> be<00:05:10.180> the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
then that means Tom Hardy can't be the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.189 
then that means Tom Hardy can't be the
same<00:05:10.630> Mad<00:05:10.990> Max<00:05:11.259> as<00:05:11.440> Mel<00:05:12.130> Gibson's<00:05:12.669> is<00:05:13.660> it<00:05:13.840> son

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
same Mad Max as Mel Gibson's is it son

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.589 
same Mad Max as Mel Gibson's is it son
laughs<00:05:14.500> with<00:05:14.800> these<00:05:15.220> questions<00:05:15.599> but

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
laughs with these questions but

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:17.879 
laughs with these questions but
apparently<00:05:16.930> has<00:05:17.110> to<00:05:17.259> fit<00:05:17.409> together<00:05:17.500> somehow

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
apparently has to fit together somehow

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.029 
apparently has to fit together somehow
so<00:05:18.569> it's<00:05:19.569> the<00:05:19.659> same<00:05:19.840> director<00:05:20.349> as<00:05:20.620> the

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
so it's the same director as the

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.149 
so it's the same director as the
originals<00:05:21.460> again<00:05:21.970> George<00:05:22.599> Miller<00:05:22.919> which<00:05:23.919> at
