the first sunburn of my life and it's so
weird<00:00:52.199> because<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.770> always<00:00:53.190> sit<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
weird because I always sit out in the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.240 
weird because I always sit out in the
Sun<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.600> would<00:00:55.110> protect<00:00:55.410> myself<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.920> always<00:00:56.129> have

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
Sun I would protect myself I always have

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670 
Sun I would protect myself I always have
SPF<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.420> every<00:00:57.570> year<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.350> usually

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
SPF but I do it every year and I usually

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.349 
SPF but I do it every year and I usually
go<00:00:58.829> over<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> my<00:00:59.280> parents<00:00:59.460> house<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.030> sit<00:01:00.270> out

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
go over to my parents house I sit out

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.849 
go over to my parents house I sit out
because<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> really<00:01:01.320> nice<00:01:01.440> deck

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
because they have a really nice deck

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.520 
because they have a really nice deck
right<00:01:02.609> underneath<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.180> Sun<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.290> guess

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
right underneath the Sun and I guess

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
right underneath the Sun and I guess
they're<00:01:04.799> saying<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> Sun<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.460> getting<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
they're saying that the Sun is getting a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.640 
they're saying that the Sun is getting a
little<00:01:06.150> bit<00:01:06.360> stronger<00:01:06.630> every<00:01:07.080> single<00:01:07.409> year

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
little bit stronger every single year

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.710 
little bit stronger every single year
and<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.040> my<00:01:08.280> first<00:01:08.729> year<00:01:09.030> ever<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.689> I

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
and this is my first year ever that I

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.780 
and this is my first year ever that I
burned<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.950> actually<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.670> of

slowly eights the skin it treats pimples

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.150 
slowly eights the skin it treats pimples
