00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.600
 efficiency and performance management 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.350
 speed when you have an operation 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.110
 field 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.490
 these words define success can 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.590
 be an operation to provide 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.299
 services maintenance collection and delivery 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.430
 technical assistance 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.460
 no matter the goal is always the same 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.490
 do more in less time to minimize 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.779
 errors and control teams by eliminating 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.330
 rework 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.179
 was based on these four attributes that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.859
 we created the western mobile for you to get 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.860
 a much better management 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.960
 the the mobile is one of the most complete and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.260
 flexible power automation systems 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.450
 of the market with the mobile do 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 more means to balance the load of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.140
 team work 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.329
 taking into account not only the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.399
 number of orders but also the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.190
 position of the field professional on the map 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.020
 for the dispatch of services 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.180
 means to enable the monitoring of 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.340
 teams in real time and the comparison 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.070
 between the total number of orders 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.500
 day and the orders already made 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.990
 identifying teams in advance 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.479
 who failed to meet the goal 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.090
 the coordination of the operation may intervene 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.159
 and even relocate a team's work 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.350
 to ensure that in the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.409
 end of the day all work is 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.479
 performed to do in less time 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.229
 means to eliminate timeout 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.840
 taken 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.180
 the mobile allows the creation of fences 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.159
 electronic devices and limit the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.439
 teams and alerting the 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.780
 these limits are always 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.270
 outdated 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.590
 management reports 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.110
 identify deviations as peaks of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.360
 demands high waiting times and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.090
 recording of occurrences allowing the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.790
 continuous improvement of west operation 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.799
 mobile to minimize errors because it adapts 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.960
 to its mode of operation 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.850
 the flow editor you can 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.159
 set the west mobile to 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.960
 to reproduce the exact sequence in the system 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.659
 the work of their teams. 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.680
 field so you have the assurance that 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.020
 all stages of the process are 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.360
 are carried out in the sequence defined by 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.119
 ensuring greater efficiency in 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.640
 execution of each job also eliminates 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.440
 mistakes of understanding since all the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.150
 information is received very 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.460
 quickly through the mobile phone 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.540
 eliminating the exchange of information by 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.120
 voice 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.040
 plus text bar code images and 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.620
 to the location of the team can be 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.170
 recorded eliminating the need to 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.270
 manual reprocessing of information 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.570
 all to eliminate waste and 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.130
 increase mobile efficiency because 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.130
 one minute is worth a lot 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.050
