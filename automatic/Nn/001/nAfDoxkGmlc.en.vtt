 Well, that is, the introduction and the verse I did 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.440
 just beating the pick down you can 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.560
 as if in a different way somehow playing like 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.540

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.090
 play a little more complicated I'm here 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.800
 came up with a fight for this song 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.450
 like it or not but I 'll show you how 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.150
 he played himself wrote out and so set 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.200
 myocardium let the fase and start two 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.450
 times down then twice up but when 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.260
 you hit 2 size here need sharply 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.260
 make it orbiz 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.090
 that is, two times up two times down 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.640
 up and then beta 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.410
 where or up and down and then again strikes 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.390
 down and up 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.410
 and when did you move to the next chord 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.260
 on chord me 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.480
 you make a blow all repeated the same 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.080
 the most but on the chord 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:18.370
 m and chord ace 2 you do repeat 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:22.810
 this fight two times that is if on 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.360
 these chords nafa 7 and no me i'm simple 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.490
 rather you do it once this fight 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.980
 on the rest of the cards you do that one 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.420
 will be twice well be there 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.900
 navigate by song that is what 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:39.250
 it will be more convenient that there is such an easy song 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.160
 sola which is played in that song she 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.890
 also there started very easy on there i'm not 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.890
 I remember how it is exactly played 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.890
 like 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.300
 in short there is something like this that is you 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.020
 in the tenth year, lead the fourth side 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.500
 2 for 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.069
 then in the ninth year you beat the third 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.970
 the country is happy because it is the ninth year 4 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:14.759
 difficult too two times then 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:21.470
 start in the tenth year the fourth 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:21.470
 string beat 9 slide and 12 fret 4 string 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.150

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:36.830
 swapped to 9 9 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:38.330
