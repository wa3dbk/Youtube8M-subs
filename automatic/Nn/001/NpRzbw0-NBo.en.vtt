everybody's<00:03:41.010> body<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.430> little<00:03:41.640> bit

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
everybody's body is a little bit

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.900 
everybody's body is a little bit
different<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.630> you're<00:03:42.720> gonna<00:03:42.810> want<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.140> use<00:03:43.380> a

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
different so you're gonna want to use a

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.580 
different so you're gonna want to use a
nap<00:03:44.910> anatomical<00:03:45.660> picture<00:03:45.960> as<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> reference

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
nap anatomical picture as a reference

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.050 
nap anatomical picture as a reference
that's<00:03:46.800> sort<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.070> what<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.250> did<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.700> reference

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
that's sort of what I did is a reference

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.840 
that's sort of what I did is a reference
but<00:03:48.720> as<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.960> can<00:03:49.110> see<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.830> subjects<00:03:50.310> ABS<00:03:50.520> here

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
but as you can see the subjects ABS here

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.340 
but as you can see the subjects ABS here
are<00:03:50.970> fairly<00:03:51.300> defined<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.900> can<00:03:52.050> use<00:03:52.170> that

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
are fairly defined so you can use that

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.470 
are fairly defined so you can use that
as<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> basic<00:03:52.980> roadmap<00:03:53.400> but<00:03:54.030> if<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.240> want<00:03:54.390> to

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
as a basic roadmap but if you want to

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.090 
as a basic roadmap but if you want to
like<00:03:54.630> maybe<00:03:54.840> enhance<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.500> fullness<00:03:55.740> of<00:03:56.010> a

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
like maybe enhance the fullness of a

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.620 
like maybe enhance the fullness of a
specific<00:03:56.550> muscle<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:57.000> can<00:03:57.150> always<00:03:57.360> do<00:03:57.600> that

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
specific muscle you can always do that

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.930 
specific muscle you can always do that
with<00:03:57.900> lighting<00:03:58.290> remember<00:03:59.130> lighting<00:03:59.550> makes<00:03:59.760> it

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
with lighting remember lighting makes it

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.580 
with lighting remember lighting makes it
pop<00:04:00.150> out<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:00.630> then<00:04:00.750> darkness<00:04:01.200> of<00:04:01.380> course

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
pop out and then darkness of course

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.080 
pop out and then darkness of course
creates<00:04:01.980> your<00:04:02.100> terrain<00:04:02.460> it<00:04:02.640> creates<00:04:02.910> your

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
creates your terrain it creates your

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.240 
creates your terrain it creates your
your<00:04:03.720> third<00:04:03.990> dimension<00:04:04.500> your<00:04:04.740> dimension<00:04:05.160> of

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
your third dimension your dimension of

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.910 
your third dimension your dimension of
depth<00:04:05.490> so<00:04:06.300> I<00:04:06.600> have<00:04:07.230> already<00:04:07.350> done<00:04:07.530> this<00:04:07.590> side

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
depth so I have already done this side

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.230 
depth so I have already done this side
and<00:04:08.100> now<00:04:08.220> I'm<00:04:08.340> going<00:04:08.520> to<00:04:08.610> show<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:09.090> other

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
and now I'm going to show you the other

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.240 
and now I'm going to show you the other
side<00:04:09.300> as<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.900> do<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.200> I'm<00:04:10.320> probably<00:04:10.770> gonna<00:04:10.980> speed

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
side as I do it I'm probably gonna speed

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.470 
side as I do it I'm probably gonna speed
up<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.400> video<00:04:11.580> because<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.090> takes<00:04:12.270> a<00:04:12.360> little

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
up the video because it takes a little

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.090 
up the video because it takes a little
while<00:04:12.690> but<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.110> can<00:04:13.290> remember<00:04:13.500> during<00:04:13.770> during

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
while but you can remember during during

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.670 
while but you can remember during during
this<00:04:14.370> part<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:15.480> can<00:04:15.630> take<00:04:15.840> your<00:04:16.020> liberties<00:04:16.410> to

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
this part you can take your liberties to
