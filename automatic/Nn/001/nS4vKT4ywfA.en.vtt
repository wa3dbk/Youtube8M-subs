and I was like you know in those moments

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.590 
and I was like you know in those moments
where<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> realize<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.520> there's<00:00:39.420> some

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
where you realize that there's some

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.940 
where you realize that there's some
there's<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> bigger<00:00:40.050> picture<00:00:40.230> happening<00:00:40.800> here

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
there's a bigger picture happening here

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.319 
there's a bigger picture happening here
could<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.520> talk<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:42.030> bit<00:00:42.180> about

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
could you just talk a little bit about

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.389 
could you just talk a little bit about
that<00:00:42.510> yeah<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> mean<00:00:43.469> obviously<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.250> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
that yeah I mean obviously you know that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.920 
that yeah I mean obviously you know that
would<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:45.059> type<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.600> fear<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.899> I

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
would be one type of that fear and I

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.119 
would be one type of that fear and I
think<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> other<00:00:46.320> one<00:00:46.500> actually<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.010> we're

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
think the other one actually if we're

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.590 
think the other one actually if we're
honest<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.489> ourselves<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:48.180> kind<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
honest with ourselves is kind of the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.080 
honest with ourselves is kind of the
fear<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.110> we're<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.559> forgotten

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
fear that we're going to be forgotten

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.889 
fear that we're going to be forgotten
you<00:00:51.090> know<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.390> want<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> build<00:00:51.809> this

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you know when we want to build this

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.569 
you know when we want to build this
business<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.800> sell<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> perpetuates

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
business that we sell and it perpetuates

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
business that we sell and it perpetuates
itself<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.809> know<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.110> whatever<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.680> case

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
itself for you know or whatever the case

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.560 
itself for you know or whatever the case
is<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.250> when<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.789> get<00:00:56.910> down<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
is but when we really get down to it and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.939 
is but when we really get down to it and
we're<00:00:57.660> honest<00:00:57.960> with<00:00:58.020> ourselves<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.649> look<00:00:58.800> in

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
we're honest with ourselves and look in

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.200 
we're honest with ourselves and look in
the<00:00:58.980> mirror<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.370> basically<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.030> we're

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the mirror it's basically that we're

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.080 
the mirror it's basically that we're
scared<00:01:00.480> people<00:01:00.899> are<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.170> forget<00:01:01.379> us<00:01:02.090> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
scared people are going to forget us and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.719 
scared people are going to forget us and

imagine<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.310> you're<00:01:53.430> probably<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:54.119> going

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
imagine that you're probably not going

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.569 
imagine that you're probably not going
to<00:01:54.360> create<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.740> really<00:01:56.159> profitable

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
to create this like really profitable

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.789 
to create this like really profitable
just<00:01:57.270> machine<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.409> going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.680> be<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
just machine it's not going to be a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.039 
just machine it's not going to be a
smoothly<00:01:59.399> running<00:01:59.610> cash<00:02:00.210> machine<00:02:00.689> because

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
smoothly running cash machine because

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.219 
smoothly running cash machine because
that's<00:02:01.229> boring<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.899> built-in

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
that's boring so if I have a built-in

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.840 
that's boring so if I have a built-in
incentive<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.860> your<00:02:05.009> business<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.640> not

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
incentive and your business to not

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.520 
incentive and your business to not
create<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.509> precise<00:02:06.960> thing<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.409> you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
create the precise thing that you

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.990 
create the precise thing that you
probably<00:02:07.799> are<00:02:08.099> telling<00:02:08.399> yourself<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.789> you

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
probably are telling yourself that you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.369 
probably are telling yourself that you
want<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.270> create<00:02:09.420> or<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.989> you're<00:02:10.080> trying<00:02:10.259> to

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
want to create or that you're trying to

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.420 
want to create or that you're trying to
create

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
create

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.190 
create
and<00:02:11.519> so<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> odds<00:02:12.329> are<00:02:12.510> pretty<00:02:12.569> good<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:13.049> not

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and so the odds are pretty good it's not

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.830 
and so the odds are pretty good it's not
going<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.469> happen<00:02:14.209> there's<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.299> great<00:02:15.540> story

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
going to happen there's a great story

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.020 
going to happen there's a great story
and<00:02:16.049> Joe<00:02:16.469> is<00:02:16.650> actually<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.099> was<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.489> my<00:02:17.879> way

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
and Joe is actually I was on my way

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.330 
and Joe is actually I was on my way
years<00:02:18.329> ago<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.689> find<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> Phoenix<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.099> speak

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
years ago to find the Phoenix to speak

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.709 
years ago to find the Phoenix to speak
it<00:02:20.459> one<00:02:20.579> to<00:02:20.670> josé<00:02:20.849> seminars<00:02:21.329> I<00:02:21.450> heard<00:02:21.599> the

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
it one to josé seminars I heard the

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.089 
it one to josé seminars I heard the
story<00:02:22.019> on<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.260> radio<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.769> thought<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.010> was

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
story on the radio and I thought it was

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.280 
story on the radio and I thought it was
a<00:02:23.129> great<00:02:23.250> illustration<00:02:23.459> at<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.239> point<00:02:24.540> they

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
a great illustration at that point they

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.750 
a great illustration at that point they
were<00:02:25.349> talking<00:02:25.799> about<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.159> guy<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:26.549> think

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
were talking about this guy and I think

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.369 
were talking about this guy and I think
he<00:02:26.819> was<00:02:26.939> up<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.150> Minnesota<00:02:27.450> or<00:02:27.900> something<00:02:28.290> he

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
he was up in Minnesota or something he

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.119 
he was up in Minnesota or something he

another<00:03:12.689> we<00:03:12.989> turn<00:03:13.139> our<00:03:13.290> businesses<00:03:13.769> into<00:03:14.040> the

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
another we turn our businesses into the

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.530 
another we turn our businesses into the
roller<00:03:14.340> coaster<00:03:14.819> ride<00:03:14.849> because<00:03:15.239> we're<00:03:15.510> not

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
roller coaster ride because we're not

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.259 
roller coaster ride because we're not
getting<00:03:16.049> that<00:03:16.440> anywhere<00:03:16.949> else<00:03:17.159> so<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:18.030> think

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
getting that anywhere else so I think

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.860 
getting that anywhere else so I think
one<00:03:18.419> of<00:03:18.449> the<00:03:18.599> things<00:03:18.659> to<00:03:19.229> think<00:03:19.590> about<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:20.870> that

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
one of the things to think about is that

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.719 
one of the things to think about is that
personal<00:03:22.349> life<00:03:22.500> side<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:23.250> its<00:03:23.400> effect

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:23.729 
personal life side of it and its effect

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.000 
personal life side of it and its effect
on<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:24.000> business<00:03:24.419> and<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:25.019> think<00:03:25.319> oftentimes

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
on the business and I think oftentimes

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.770 
on the business and I think oftentimes
we<00:03:26.459> try<00:03:26.669> to<00:03:26.729> you<00:03:26.939> know<00:03:26.970> keep<00:03:27.209> those<00:03:27.389> in<00:03:27.629> two

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
we try to you know keep those in two

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.129 
we try to you know keep those in two
separate<00:03:28.169> boxes<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.010> separate<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:30.030> two<00:03:30.239> and

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
separate boxes and separate the two and

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.839 
separate boxes and separate the two and
not<00:03:31.290> acknowledge<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:32.010> everything<00:03:32.099> we<00:03:32.489> do<00:03:32.669> in

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
not acknowledge that everything we do in

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.309 
not acknowledge that everything we do in
one<00:03:33.030> affects<00:03:33.419> the<00:03:33.540> other<00:03:33.659> and<00:03:34.079> you<00:03:34.139> really

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
one affects the other and you really

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:44.990 
one affects the other and you really
can't<00:03:34.849> separate<00:03:35.849> the<00:03:36.000> two<00:03:36.150> from<00:03:36.419> each<00:03:36.449> other

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000
