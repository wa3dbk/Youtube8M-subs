00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
you know what that is yeah this is some

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.240 
you know what that is yeah this is some
sort<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.750> concept<00:00:07.200> right<00:00:07.290> yeah<00:00:07.740> if<00:00:07.799> it's<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.099> new

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
sort of concept right yeah if it's a new

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.330 
sort of concept right yeah if it's a new
g-wagen<00:00:09.030> concept<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.990> it's<00:00:10.500> built<00:00:10.769> for<00:00:11.040> time

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
g-wagen concept and it's built for time

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.770
