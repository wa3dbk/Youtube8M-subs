00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.110
 friends it's about world it's folded 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.730
 caudal and you and I I 'm fine we get 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.700
 found for a new tutorial 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.860
 so this is a bvp tutorial so a 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.750
 pretty easy tutorial I want to say 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.800
 to understand but that nobody thinks 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.080
 to do so frozen 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.699
 how I already knew this trap well I 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.420
 I'm just looking at them 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.739
 a video pvp the guy spent in his camp 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.879
 I saw that there was a plaque 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.970
 pressure so I asked myself a lot 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.409
 of questions and I'm I thought about that 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.040
 precisely I can estimate in time if 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:47.500
 it's a lot 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.120
 surely to protect so then I 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.949
 did the test was and it was exactly 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.940
 to protect since when I walked 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.010
 here hop 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.710
 there are those who opened so 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.239
 why I put a screen away 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.489
 because everything below there is the red 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.589
 stone and that's it and then the time that but 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.189
 that they do it happen paf it is good 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.640
 he is in the fire so this trap he 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.189
 market 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.590
 absolutely so it's because you 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.810
 have seen here there is here we are a little bit of 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.509
 light then you run away 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.009
 here again we advance like that we are 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.119
 forced to bump if so we have to 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.310
 go down 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.979
 so when we go down we have to 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.450
 move on and we are or actually says we do not 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.579
 can not do like this and move on 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.320
 directly end here has not obliged past 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.310
 by cons you will say yeah but the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.740
 pac of pressure can see it 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.109
 no since look totally into the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.530
 black is what you see a plate of 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.820
 pressure here I do not see it by 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.880
 against if we pass our cursor over 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.039
 where we see a little but there we do not see 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.710
 not finally we see but here is the guy 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.840
 I do not sing less but bg I'm going 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.490
 run finally I'm going to do that of course 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.540
 you to discover the culture gen Us 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.399
 Fishermen is absolutely 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.430
 to do four or five is sure that 5 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.290
 it's more trick it's my best psy by 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.790
 against the guy in your room he's 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.130
 immediately dashed if he does that hop 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.300
 AA so I'll explain the trick 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.739
 so already one to prevent them 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.980
 break below right down to 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.950
 left 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.930
 the lava jury too and I also 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.030
 obsidian mine like that he'll have to 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.380
 badly to the breakage and then on the other hand 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.780
 if he has an end on the 6th or a hip in 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.190
 can not do anything for 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.900
 so he put you in the queen stone 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.220
 underneath the plate of your pressure 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.750
 your loan on the spot 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.550
 So you put underneath you 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:39.630
 bypassed already by a 1 2 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.580
 at a repeater you put 2 you do 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.880
 a repeater in style like that you 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.590
 see 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.270
 then you do an inverter so 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.180
 that is to say that you put any 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.090
 what block behind the red stone that 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.760
 must be a right towards the block is 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.930
 behind redstone world so their being 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.250
 under enemy fire no matter how he 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.600
 can be right before finally that's it 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.450
 what 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.150
 the red stone that will be connected or precisely 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.980
 the son who pretends the red stone that will be 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.820
 connected by pistons the pistons that 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.720
 are exactly here 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.270
 this is really something con 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.150
 that the guy had not thought to say 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.070
 while it was supposed to be a pvp tutorial 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.830
 the guy in fact he stopped good today 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.690
 I showed you my ball and finally 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.490
 nor did they finally see 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.900
 he had gone through another place 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.280
 by the way if I go on his server I 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.350
 know exactly where was going especially that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.270
 these packs lane finally here it was so it was 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.860
 a little tutorial like that I hope that 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:37.260
 we liked it frankly I do 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.510
 not too much attention and s 43 ps that is 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.000
 okay besides I was at 108 troll 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.630
 finally here is when a page or roll to 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.550
 100 8 while usually 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.650
 usually I not help what so here goes 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.030
 I leave you friends and live the 1.3 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.250
 more than now that it was rolling 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.900
 not on the minecraft can roll 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.900
 easily in people
