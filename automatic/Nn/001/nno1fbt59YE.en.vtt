things really quick of course and I live
which<00:02:31.209> is<00:02:31.359> kind<00:02:31.600> of<00:02:31.690> nice<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.170> don't<00:02:32.350> live<00:02:32.470> with

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
which is kind of nice I don't live with

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.740 
which is kind of nice I don't live with
much<00:02:32.799> but<00:02:33.220> if<00:02:33.579> that<00:02:33.790> Willa<00:02:34.000> wisp<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.540> would

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
much but if that Willa wisp it I would

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.849 
much but if that Willa wisp it I would
have<00:02:34.840> lived<00:02:35.019> with<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.200> heck<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.650> lot<00:02:35.799> more

i'm<00:02:59.730> dead<00:02:59.879> so<00:03:00.599> i<00:03:00.870> go<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.230> shiva<00:03:01.500> because<00:03:02.370> i<00:03:02.700> need

i'm dead so i go to shiva because i need

i'm dead so i go to shiva because i need

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
to get that thing toxic even if I'm

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.360 
to get that thing toxic even if I'm
toxic<00:03:05.099> in<00:03:05.189> the<00:03:05.250> first<00:03:05.459> place<00:03:05.639> so<00:03:07.189> that's<00:03:08.189> why<00:03:08.310> I

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
toxic in the first place so that's why I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.910 
toxic in the first place so that's why I
selected<00:03:08.549> immediately<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.510> he<00:03:09.689> is<00:03:09.920> deciding

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
selected immediately and he is deciding

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.470 
selected immediately and he is deciding
between<00:03:11.010> what<00:03:11.459> he<00:03:11.700> wants<00:03:11.939> to<00:03:11.969> do<00:03:12.120> whether<00:03:12.299> he

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
between what he wants to do whether he

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.179 
between what he wants to do whether he

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
wants to switch does he predict ice does

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.849 
wants to switch does he predict ice does

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
he predict oxic does he predicts sub who

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.339 
he predict oxic does he predicts sub who
knows<00:03:17.040> what<00:03:17.189> he<00:03:17.280> predicts<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:18.139> he<00:03:19.139> ends<00:03:19.319> up

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
knows what he predicts and he ends up

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.490 
knows what he predicts and he ends up
going<00:03:19.500> with<00:03:19.739> surf<00:03:20.010> which<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:21.260> probably<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
going with surf which and probably the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.830 
going with surf which and probably the
least<00:03:23.159> most<00:03:23.489> effective<00:03:24.000> move<00:03:24.209> unless<00:03:24.540> he<00:03:24.720> was

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
least most effective move unless he was

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.809 
least most effective move unless he was
predicting<00:03:25.319> a<00:03:25.409> substitute<00:03:26.040> then<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.790> guess

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
predicting a substitute then I guess

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.849 
predicting a substitute then I guess
that<00:03:27.090> was<00:03:27.180> probably<00:03:27.389> his<00:03:27.569> only<00:03:27.780> option<00:03:27.930> I

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
that was probably his only option I

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.530 
that was probably his only option I
don't<00:03:29.280> know<00:03:29.400> what<00:03:29.519> item<00:03:29.790> he's<00:03:29.970> got<00:03:30.180> because<00:03:30.450> I

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
don't know what item he's got because I

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.709 
don't know what item he's got because I
see<00:03:30.750> no<00:03:30.900> leftovers<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:32.299> anyway<00:03:33.299> I'm<00:03:33.450> gonna<00:03:33.599> go

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:33.719 
see no leftovers so anyway I'm gonna go

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.110 
see no leftovers so anyway I'm gonna go
with<00:03:33.810> fly<00:03:34.139> because<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.340> will<00:03:35.519> get<00:03:35.700> me<00:03:35.909> more

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
with fly because it will get me more

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.059 
with fly because it will get me more
toxic<00:03:36.629> damage<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.500> will<00:03:37.590> get<00:03:37.709> me<00:03:37.859> fly

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
toxic damage and it will get me fly

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.099 
toxic damage and it will get me fly
damage<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.819> just<00:03:39.359> in<00:03:39.419> case<00:03:39.629> he<00:03:39.780> still<00:03:39.989> has

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
damage and just in case he still has

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.039 
damage and just in case he still has
toxic<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.650> will<00:03:40.829> dodge<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.250> which<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.609> did<00:03:42.049> hahaha

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
toxic I will dodge it which I did hahaha

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.869 
toxic I will dodge it which I did hahaha
that<00:03:43.439> is<00:03:43.560> amazing<00:03:43.889> I<00:03:44.189> can't<00:03:44.219> believe<00:03:44.639> it

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
that is amazing I can't believe it

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.440 
that is amazing I can't believe it
worked<00:03:44.969> that<00:03:45.269> way<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:46.500> that's<00:03:46.799> really<00:03:47.040> cool

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
worked that way so that's really cool

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.879 
worked that way so that's really cool
it's<00:03:48.450> an<00:03:48.569> extra<00:03:48.870> turn<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.139> toxic<00:03:49.500> damage<00:03:49.769> on

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
it's an extra turn of toxic damage on

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.740 
it's an extra turn of toxic damage on
him<00:03:50.099> especially<00:03:50.370> without<00:03:50.790> leftovers<00:03:51.510> and

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
him especially without leftovers and

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.539 
him especially without leftovers and
even<00:03:52.379> when<00:03:52.470> i<00:03:52.530> land<00:03:52.859> he<00:03:53.099> still<00:03:53.340> ends<00:03:53.459> up

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
even when i land he still ends up

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.839 
even when i land he still ends up
missing<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:53.879> toxic<00:03:54.389> which<00:03:54.569> is<00:03:54.720> cool<00:03:55.669> at<00:03:56.669> this

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
missing the toxic which is cool at this

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.460 
missing the toxic which is cool at this
point<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.269> doesn't<00:03:57.449> matter<00:03:57.720> too<00:03:57.959> much<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.319> don't

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
point it doesn't matter too much I don't

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.649 
point it doesn't matter too much I don't

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659

that<00:04:03.870> obviously<00:04:04.139> surf<00:04:04.409> will<00:04:04.590> hurt<00:04:04.709> him<00:04:04.859> a<00:04:04.889> lot

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
that obviously surf will hurt him a lot

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.339 
that obviously surf will hurt him a lot
but<00:04:05.340> he's<00:04:05.609> going<00:04:06.000> with<00:04:06.090> toxic<00:04:06.599> so<00:04:06.840> it'll<00:04:07.049> avoid

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
but he's going with toxic so it'll avoid

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.490 
but he's going with toxic so it'll avoid
that<00:04:08.030> fly<00:04:09.030> also<00:04:09.479> had<00:04:09.599> been<00:04:09.750> really<00:04:10.169> good<00:04:10.290> there

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
that fly also had been really good there

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.929 
that fly also had been really good there
too<00:04:10.530> i<00:04:10.680> would<00:04:10.919> have<00:04:11.010> evaded<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.430> toxic<00:04:11.819> would

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
too i would have evaded the toxic would

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.179 
too i would have evaded the toxic would
have<00:04:12.060> died<00:04:12.530> umbreon<00:04:13.530> would<00:04:13.680> have<00:04:13.769> had<00:04:13.889> to<00:04:13.979> turn

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
have died umbreon would have had to turn

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:15.770 
have died umbreon would have had to turn
to<00:04:14.340> pick<00:04:14.609> whatever<00:04:14.819> he<00:04:15.090> wanted<00:04:15.419> but<00:04:15.540> he<00:04:15.599> would

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
to pick whatever he wanted but he would

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.800 
to pick whatever he wanted but he would
have<00:04:15.870> taken<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.260> fly<00:04:16.500> so<00:04:17.120> instead<00:04:18.120> i<00:04:18.180> switched

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
have taken the fly so instead i switched

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.770 
have taken the fly so instead i switched
out<00:04:18.989> back<00:04:19.229> to<00:04:19.409> pincer<00:04:20.030> so<00:04:21.030> it's<00:04:21.269> got<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.539> sash

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
out back to pincer so it's got the sash

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.710 
out back to pincer so it's got the sash
it<00:04:22.229> can<00:04:22.409> deal<00:04:22.650> with<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:23.479> substitute<00:04:24.479> if<00:04:24.599> it

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
it can deal with a substitute if it

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.350 
it can deal with a substitute if it
needs<00:04:24.930> be<00:04:25.199> so<00:04:26.009> it's<00:04:26.400> got<00:04:26.580> two<00:04:26.759> moves<00:04:27.060> that<00:04:27.210> can

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
needs be so it's got two moves that can

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.330 
needs be so it's got two moves that can
kill<00:04:27.509> him<00:04:27.720> i'm<00:04:28.680> just<00:04:28.830> going<00:04:29.009> to<00:04:29.039> keep<00:04:29.190> going

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
kill him i'm just going to keep going

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.219 
kill him i'm just going to keep going
with<00:04:29.430> x-scissor<00:04:29.789> till<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.330> dies<00:04:30.479> it's<00:04:30.960> just

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
with x-scissor till it dies it's just

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.649 
with x-scissor till it dies it's just
that<00:04:31.380> simple<00:04:32.120> there's<00:04:33.120> not<00:04:33.300> really<00:04:33.449> any

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659

prediction<00:04:34.080> this<00:04:34.229> time<00:04:34.440> because<00:04:34.560> if<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:34.800> had

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
prediction this time because if you had

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.770 
prediction this time because if you had
a<00:04:34.949> better<00:04:35.190> poke<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.639> go<00:04:35.729> to<00:04:35.789> for<00:04:36.090> x-scissor<00:04:36.479> he

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
a better poke to go to for x-scissor he

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.689 
a better poke to go to for x-scissor he
would<00:04:36.900> have<00:04:36.990> done<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.199> in<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.320> first<00:04:37.380> place<00:04:37.699> so

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
would have done it in the first place so

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.700 
would have done it in the first place so
he's<00:04:39.330> only<00:04:39.449> got<00:04:39.690> two<00:04:39.870> guys<00:04:40.020> left<00:04:40.289> I<00:04:40.470> don't<00:04:40.530> know
