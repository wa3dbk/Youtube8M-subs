 17th episode of major Dutch 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.309
 as you can see we still have six 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.530
 point to graduate and even more 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.840
 nine points for the title and the version 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.730
 6 we still have 4 games for that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.619
 do this is the team that should go with 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.580
 happen in the very first match 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.189
 for example, we want to start, I want to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 say check in fifa coins Kopen.nl 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.310
 the link in the description and and other 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.650
 household view maschine studio 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.599
 I noticed no games would have it on 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.160
 this moment the is among the first 5 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.090
 competitions because this episode exists 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.099
 from 6 matches 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.680
 unfortunately I have the first five games 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.420
 no game so yes I didn't know I had 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.309
 a mistake in my elgato 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.890
 made so say so then I took that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.239
 my job but now only one 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.040
 new all these that they all disappeared 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.260
 for because that can function elia 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.789
 he does the nose and throat here 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.469
 then shoot it and heal becomes mystery 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.480
 yes, but almost always it is rebound 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.949
 and then suddenly I want to go 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.170
 exchange because croton with the young and 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.640
 love my opponent and not yes 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.140
 are my first three points of these 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.879
 delivery over within by one already 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.550
 quick this is the team what my to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.189
 promotion must lead and this is then 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.680
 then the opponents that have to 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.420
 trying to prevent his side but 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.280
 which of course I didn't put on but again 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.360
 a king here is critical and i on the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.710
 a new one inside 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.030
 and before i go any further i just want to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.460
 say forget was of course not 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.290
 all too like at the moment there are 450 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.060
 get likes for tonight I upload 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.189
 tomorrow the new episode 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.380
 episode 18 meanwhile a stupid one 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.270
 starting from his keeper I come to 2 0 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 with huntelaar and header then one 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.720
 good stitch pass on narsingh he could be happy 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.220
 I want to mark him with them 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.290
 but instead because narsingh a marker 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.509
 he gives me delicious full on klaas-jan 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.950
 huntelaar who then again score that man 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.380
 really has a sick substance that scores 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.119
 really fucking often but i don't know if 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.740
 the dispersion it is much machinery 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.170
 huntelaar still nice all version 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.210
 way here fall the 4 0 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.310
 vivian nothing and this man also decides 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.130
 the range white and so have two jets out 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.079
 the one behind the other and have the title in 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.790
 won a fall says that cornÃ© promotion 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.590
 have new all but deserve the title 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.360
 should we now win this is then 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.240
 the opponent again a fucking random 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.399
 team further away from the lawyer at 69 cam 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.530
 and then sneijder here with the beautiful 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.060
 free kick because yes it lives love 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.020
 honest with but sneijder 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.819
 of course also the man for that 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.260
 great god has that of course and 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.599
 then this man even though 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.849
 enough to quit already and so have the 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.739
 title and vision six times in my opinion 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.239
 only 6,000 points or you have to 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.819
 I always follow more would follow 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.810
 get and then you might think now you go 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.760
 yummy 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.470
 Rudy van Persie buy but that was still 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.209
 not because he was just like that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.280
 more expensive and I thought I'll wait 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.780
 because then language tbr during the pack 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.280
 opening of 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.450
 the team's precise mouth is now out 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.920
 comes of course then he will be again 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.780
 somewhat lower because that is a very many one 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.220
 pack when we just go if 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.900
 the first was in the vision weiss mail 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.579
 this is the opponent here finally 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.810
 a normal opponent that is 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.340
 something from fifa soon and then we look 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.849
 whether it can replace this match 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.650
 baking 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.870
 this match starts evil pretty cool 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.790
 because we have any unusual code but yes me 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.680
 don't know we won that goes so well 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.900
 lately but it is declining 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.909
 but then comes to craving at virgil 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.440
 van dijk that the one very true but look 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.150
 then I then have another column 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.129
 weather of days that appear under tab 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.639
 and then I speed up this piece of man and 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.530
 I often 123 Easter are suddenly eating 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.329
 we are on the other side of field 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.129
 only the goalkeeper will lower you 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.470
 possible to keep track of and so become 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.690
 a one and that I always find so fucking 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.549
 pussy because I can do so little about this 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.889
 you know me on that ball at the intersection 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.780
 fit three times and give you control 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.190
 but can keep up and then it is 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.449
 suddenly a one 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.489
 how do you see the first rescue 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.560
 lads wants to get Elijah's beans back 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.060
 and lack salvation from yogis and the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.680
 reason why I was sitting so much cone because 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.989
 I think this was already the sixth coming 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.269
 within half an hour within half an hour 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.980
 playing time then yes and then I buy this 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.389
 again and then you can say Moses is coming 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.829
 really want cone because you are going to this one 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.690
 episode even more and you have 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.129
 already seen so many but I get 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.919
 also so many corners of the fucking 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.970
 logically everything except this stopped 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.280
 bubbles big man who was me 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.720
 maintainable for the three one and then 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.489
 is it going well and then you know about the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.169
 vision 5 we are going to be the first thing that should be 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.549
 I actually hollow inside but then it is 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.169
 that the but the question or then nice but 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.090
 here is narsingh who lays the ball 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.109
 then he comes back to Elijah who made it 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.269
 four one 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.549
 and yes, this man is another one 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.450
 week Witte and our this episode 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:18.680
 packed with 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:20.989
 give glitch snap your tree full but for a moment 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.400
 without kidding this was already the fourth 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.500
 already quit on turning we go to three 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.850
 points in the vision 5 this is the competition 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.229
 where we next 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.880
 yes where we the or this are team about the 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.169
 volumes to play along and this is 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.030
 a team about how 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.169
 not a team what really just total 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.780
 is not a hybrid 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.280
 and this guy kicked the ball really hit on 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.110
 online with you keep track of why beerens the 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.699
 ball full can lay on none of us 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.610
 then klaas-jan huntelaar who's your own 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.050
 in may head in the 45th minute so 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.550
 that is nicely shown 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.530
 then here he will die for a moment 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.000
 content and yes everyone knows sneijder 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.560
 has a fantastic god 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.810
 cutting has five factory for me 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.400
 really like it because it makes here 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.870
 he again so good can do everything in the 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.940
 polygon then he still goes here 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.979
 scoring back with nobody 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.710
 other than ter and it actually does yes 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.530
 only in fifa 13 do I remember or fifa 14 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.139
 fifa 13 was that or are in 412 so then 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.610
 he was good but that is really in 2012 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.949
 2013 him 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.360
 yes in this viva really wouldn't be good anymore 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.039
 another fantastic can already 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.289
 unfortunately, the pole just hit the post 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.789
 there is by the pooping of roy 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.530
 every iban can make and 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.300
 then huntelaar here again 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.250
 a king in for the changes 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.180
 we make a four and that she was 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.910
 it easily won 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.530
 he goes into the vision after only six points 5 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.150
 an increased London to my best 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.030
 nice actually 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.010
 yes this division we start a new one 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.450
 already fucking nice and we have to see if 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.860
 be able to hold on to it finally and 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.510
 feel there was still able 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.160
 yes then make a completely good start then 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.320
 you really can't do anything else then 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.000
 you could almost say that you already have a PhD 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.630
 Of course you never know because of me 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.099
 your 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.479
 I can if I need another point and 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.950
 eight cancer matches before that 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.510
 nice everyone we look in the meantime 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.630
 but don't want that can't try me 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.729
 and again we actually come across one 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.690
 hydrate someone fox we also do not 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.160
 completely correct 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.410
 because not everyone in for chemistry but 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.660
 this team seemed like people own suds but yes 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.030
 I'm just dying for fucking stupid 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.220
 myself at a disadvantage via pedro 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.510
 by a stupid matter what with form and or 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.970
 that all was not enough yet 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.070
 form here he rolls the ball and pedro 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.469
 she performs and pedro slide that ball on one 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.000
 way in and next week won late 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:21.860
 the ball come that i'm a turkish van 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.240
 no I do n't mean that after 5 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.009
 competitions in this way 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.479
 my first defeat is coming but no me 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:29.210
 of course got the e-mail from the cone 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.310
 virgil van dijk in the 78th minute and then 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.259
 there is certainly hope if this goes 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.699
 happen in a five day now the good one 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.990
 steak shore only on a it 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.250
 try to lay a broad but the 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.720
 keeper is among them 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.400
 but then she runs into everyone's keeper 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.050
 then cash out and shoot 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.669
 but already beaten again was a keeper and 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.840
 this and that but in the end it is one 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.449
 new from narsingh that at the end 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.830
 and makes u22 from this scrimmage and 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.639
 because we are not enough in a food 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.800
 solut 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.660
 I know a lot about cutting back a facial 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.270
 what movement you should call it 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.389
 get full and Sneijder in the 96th minute 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.919
 cup penalty at 2 2 really i swear i had 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:02.419
 really stress i just had sick 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.860
 palpitations I know , but I expect 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.889
 but I ended up with a goal 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.750
 and the 96 now I make the three two 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.449
 and in this way we win this one 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.430
 So we go to 9 points in the competition 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:15.620
 the vision 5 so it's really delicious 9 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.240
 out of nine points three games 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.099
