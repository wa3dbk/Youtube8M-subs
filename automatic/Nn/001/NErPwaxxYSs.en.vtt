00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.709
 well nothing here we are again and today 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.269
 we want to answer a question that we 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.269
 they have done 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.820
 they are asking us when we should 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.520
 take a whey protein shake 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.650
 how should we take it or am I going to 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.940
 explain a little bit briefly and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.520
 simple way 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.370
 what is a whey protein a 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.140
 Whey protein is simply nothing 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.130
 more and nothing less than a protein of 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.130
 fast absorption 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.930
 it is obtained by isolating the soil from the milk 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:52.210
 and it gives us a product that is that protein 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:55.089
 of serum specifically this protein we 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.440
 can bring a lot of good things 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.449
 to our health 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.269
 can concretely increase the levels 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.159
 for example of glutathione which is a 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.560
 very important antioxidant that we 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.689
 can help so avoid 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.479
 those free radical terms that 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.759
 attack our cells can also 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.380
 help us protect ourselves from 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.640
 osteoporosis because it is very high in 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.979
 calcium also improves the healing of 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.950
 injuries after operations 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.409
 surgical interventions 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.789
 It will also help us improve 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.789
 our immune system 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.180
 and even to improve of course the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.799
 level of muscle mass but always 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.100
 we have to take into account that in 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:44.030
 no anything miraculous milkshake what 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.280
 important is the food and if it is clear 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.950
 that this these protein shakes 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.560
 They can help us even 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.180
 substitute some food when 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.510
 example our let's say 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.560
 and daily obligations do not 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.090
 they prevent therefore having the necessary time 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.530
 because we are away from home because 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.149
 We are working because we are 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.730
 moving from one place to another 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.010
 we can take that little bit of products that 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.709
 we can combine with well with milk 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.060
 skimmed or with water if not with milk 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.130
 skimmed if there were no problems of 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.470
 lactose intolerance and it's going to 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.110
 come very well for that to put 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.390
 that little food that gives us a 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.460
 nutrient series as we said 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.310
 specifically 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.650
 When you asked, you should 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.080
 take this protein as the protein of 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.940
 serum would be very good to take it for 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.490
 example in the first meal of the 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.140
 morning with breakfast because after 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.020
 that process that occurs from 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.360
 muscular catabolism throughout the 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.580
 night for those hours of fasting sleep 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.500
 what we have then is an optimal moment 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.420
 so that our body has the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.860
 ability to assimilate a lot of 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.440
 nutrients then it would be quite 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.140
 important at that time or also 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.000
 right after training right after 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.640
 to train that we need that contribution 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.040
 of nutrients because there has been a 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.230
 muscle hypertrophy have come a 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.770
 heap of blood to your muscles so that 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.290
 fill up 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.730
 with nutrients and that is manufactured that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.370
 muscle mass then there at the time 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.870
 also suitable to take that protein 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:28.580
 Well, nothing and I hope I solved it 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.860
 that doubt and subscribe give me I like and 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.530
 I wait for you here again but not what 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.650
 sells in that comment that question that 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.360
 surely it's going to be that we 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.310
 we can be following in contact with 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.310
 all of you until the next friends
