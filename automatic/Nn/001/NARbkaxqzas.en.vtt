you can't have him do anything else
other<00:02:51.290> than<00:02:51.500> spy<00:02:51.890> but<00:02:52.580> as<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:52.850> see<00:02:53.030> right<00:02:53.060> here

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
other than spy but as you see right here

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.780 
other than spy but as you see right here
when<00:02:53.750> he's<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.110> spy<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:55.130> pressure<00:02:55.430> still

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
when he's in a spy that pressure still

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.010 
when he's in a spy that pressure still
comes<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.210> and<00:02:56.420> then<00:02:56.510> if<00:02:56.630> they<00:02:56.750> try<00:02:56.960> to

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
comes in and then if they try to

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.960 
comes in and then if they try to
scramble<00:02:57.350> they're<00:02:57.710> screwed<00:02:58.340> because<00:02:58.640> that

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
scramble they're screwed because that

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.400 
scramble they're screwed because that
smile<00:02:59.240> just<00:02:59.540> be<00:02:59.660> sitting<00:02:59.960> there<00:02:59.990> waiting<00:03:00.260> for

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
smile just be sitting there waiting for

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.710 
smile just be sitting there waiting for
them<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.800> also<00:03:01.280> spies<00:03:01.820> are<00:03:02.030> super<00:03:02.360> good<00:03:02.510> for

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
them and also spies are super good for

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.690 
them and also spies are super good for
shutting<00:03:03.020> down<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.350> short<00:03:03.650> motion<00:03:04.490> hikes

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
shutting down the short motion hikes

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.070 
shutting down the short motion hikes
because<00:03:05.090> they<00:03:05.240> drop<00:03:05.480> right<00:03:05.720> back<00:03:05.900> into

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
because they drop right back into

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.960 
because they drop right back into
coverage<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:06.740> usually<00:03:07.430> have<00:03:07.580> pretty<00:03:07.850> good

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
coverage and usually have pretty good

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.310 
coverage and usually have pretty good
awareness<00:03:08.240> because<00:03:08.750> they're<00:03:08.900> just<00:03:09.080> spying

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
awareness because they're just spying

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.830 
awareness because they're just spying
the<00:03:09.500> quarterback<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.820> now<00:03:11.120> we<00:03:11.180> can<00:03:11.450> get<00:03:11.660> to

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
the quarterback so now we can get to

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.930 
the quarterback so now we can get to
some<00:03:12.080> in-game<00:03:12.290> footage<00:03:12.680> where<00:03:13.370> i<00:03:13.400> am<00:03:13.670> using
