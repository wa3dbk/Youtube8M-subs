00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
videos just even though it takes me like

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.200 
videos just even though it takes me like
five<00:01:04.530> minutes<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:05.189> edit<00:01:05.430> them<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.880> still

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
five minutes to edit them it's still

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.450 
five minutes to edit them it's still
just<00:01:06.450> draining<00:01:06.900> even<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> idea<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
just draining even the idea of it and

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
just draining even the idea of it and
all<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.540> little<00:01:09.720> things<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.470> along<00:01:10.590> with

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
all the little things that go along with

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.609 
all the little things that go along with
making<00:01:11.310> videos<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.299> lot<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> work<00:01:12.630> if

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
making videos it's it's a lot of work if

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.890 
making videos it's it's a lot of work if
you've<00:01:13.830> never<00:01:14.040> made<00:01:14.970> videos<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.540> YouTube

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
you've never made videos on YouTube

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.120 
you've never made videos on YouTube
before<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.320> think<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> lot<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> people<00:01:16.830> don't

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
before I think a lot of people don't

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
before I think a lot of people don't
realize<00:01:17.220> quite<00:01:17.880> how<00:01:17.939> much<00:01:18.299> work<00:01:18.540> goes<00:01:18.720> into

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
realize quite how much work goes into

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.410 
realize quite how much work goes into
even<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> simplest<00:01:19.830> things<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.640> I've<00:01:21.180> been

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
even the simplest things and I've been

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.940 
even the simplest things and I've been
doing<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.900> much<00:01:22.020> content<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.770> main

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
doing so much content for the main

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.480 
doing so much content for the main
channel<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.820> I'm<00:01:24.750> feeling<00:01:24.990> slightly<00:01:25.979> burnt

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
channel that I'm feeling slightly burnt

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.569

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.700 
out or try and borderline burnt out is
probably<00:01:29.880> more<00:01:30.000> accurate<00:01:30.079> just<00:01:31.079> trying<00:01:31.380> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
probably more accurate just trying to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.170 
probably more accurate just trying to
like<00:01:31.920> ah<00:01:34.250> now<00:01:35.250> get<00:01:35.430> fully<00:01:35.670> burnt<00:01:35.909> out
