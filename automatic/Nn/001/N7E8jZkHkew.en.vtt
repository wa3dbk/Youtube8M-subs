well I think when you start as a
beginner<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.940> gym<00:00:18.119> anyways<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.660> go<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:18.869> a

cutting<00:00:22.199> or<00:00:22.470> maintaining<00:00:22.890> because<00:00:23.220> there's

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
cutting or maintaining because there's

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.890 
cutting or maintaining because there's
nothing<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.670> cut<00:00:24.090> well<00:00:24.269> maintained<00:00:24.630> if<00:00:24.779> you're
