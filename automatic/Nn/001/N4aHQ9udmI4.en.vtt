00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
how to spray pain with your Kirby with

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.839 
how to spray pain with your Kirby with
the<00:00:07.830> portable<00:00:08.189> sprayer<00:00:09.650> so<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.800> get<00:00:11.040> results

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
the portable sprayer so you get results

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.520 
the portable sprayer so you get results
a<00:00:12.059> bit<00:00:12.599> like<00:00:12.960> that

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
a bit like that

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.950 
a bit like that
it's<00:00:14.219> not<00:00:14.400> perfect<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.480> was<00:00:15.719> just

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
it's not perfect that was just

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.200 
it's not perfect that was just
practicing<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:16.699> and<00:00:19.130> obviously<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.029> to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
practicing but and obviously you have to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.070 
practicing but and obviously you have to
have<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> Kirby<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> set<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.410> as<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> blower<00:00:23.060> it

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
have the Kirby it set up as a blower it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.500 
have the Kirby it set up as a blower it
excuse<00:00:25.080> me<00:00:25.820> so<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.150> need<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.480> have

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
excuse me so you know you need to have

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.630 
excuse me so you know you need to have
the<00:00:27.810> air<00:00:28.710> intake<00:00:29.189> guard<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.179> front<00:00:30.449> and

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
the air intake guard on the front and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
the air intake guard on the front and
the<00:00:32.899> attachment<00:00:33.899> hose<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> exhaust<00:00:34.829> port

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
the attachment hose on the exhaust port

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.729 
the attachment hose on the exhaust port
now<00:00:36.660> Kirby<00:00:37.050> recommend<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.710> use

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
now Kirby recommend that you use

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.790 
now Kirby recommend that you use
water-based<00:00:38.430> paint<00:00:39.350> because<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> motor<00:00:40.649> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
water-based paint because the motor is

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.290 
water-based paint because the motor is
open<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> spray<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.760> called<00:00:42.000> aconite

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
open to the spray in it called aconite

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.430 
open to the spray in it called aconite
and<00:00:45.200> what<00:00:46.200> did<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:46.379> call<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.559> now<00:00:48.440> with

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and what did they call it now with

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.930 
and what did they call it now with
volatile<00:00:49.829> solutions<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:50.579> something<00:00:50.820> like

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
volatile solutions or something like

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.760 
volatile solutions or something like
that<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:52.110> don't<00:00:52.140> recommend<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.680> you

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
that so they don't recommend that you

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.500 
that so they don't recommend that you
use<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:54.710> oil<00:00:55.710> based<00:00:55.949> paints<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.969> can't

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
use and oil based paints but I can't

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.979 
use and oil based paints but I can't
really<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> beater<00:00:58.199> problem<00:00:58.760> at<00:00:59.760> our<00:01:00.690> I

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
really see the beater problem at our I

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.529 
really see the beater problem at our I
doubt<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.530> ignite<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.030> honest<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
doubt it at ignite to be honest with you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.780 
doubt it at ignite to be honest with you
but<00:01:03.719> they<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.920> cover<00:01:05.100> themselves<00:01:05.369> I

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
but they have to cover themselves I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.429 
but they have to cover themselves I
suppose<00:01:06.229> so<00:01:07.229> anyway<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.659> you<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.960> spray

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
suppose so anyway and you can spray

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.090 
suppose so anyway and you can spray
paint<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.430> little<00:01:11.700> bit<00:01:11.850> em

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
paint with this but it's a little bit em

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.719 
paint with this but it's a little bit em
tricky<00:01:14.360> because<00:01:15.680> your<00:01:16.680> pain<00:01:17.040> has<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.430> be

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
tricky because your pain has to be

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.820 
tricky because your pain has to be
extremely<00:01:18.509> runny<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.710> if

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
extremely runny and so you know if

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.999 
extremely runny and so you know if
you've<00:01:22.950> got<00:01:22.979> water-based<00:01:23.610> paint<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.740> are<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
you've got water-based paint and are you

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.370 
you've got water-based paint and are you
willing<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.549> water<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.939> down<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
willing to do is water it down to get it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
willing to do is water it down to get it
to<00:01:28.560> add<00:01:28.710> almost<00:01:29.159> water<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.970> consistency<00:01:30.570> not

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
to add almost water like consistency not

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.399 
to add almost water like consistency not
really<00:01:32.400> watery<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.509> kind<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.530> that

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
really watery but kind of like that

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.480 
really watery but kind of like that
saying<00:01:37.409> let<00:01:37.530> me<00:01:37.560> try<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.890> pour<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> little<00:01:38.310> bit

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
saying let me try and pour a little bit

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.370 
saying let me try and pour a little bit
out<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.259> see<00:01:40.409> our<00:01:40.560> only<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> you

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
out you can see our only it is so you

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.840 
out you can see our only it is so you
know<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.759> it's<00:01:47.759> pretty<00:01:48.000> runny

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.600 

compared<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:53.020> what<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.140> pain<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.620> normally

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
compared to what the pain is normally

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.270 
compared to what the pain is normally
like<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:57.170> if<00:01:57.290> you've<00:01:57.410> got<00:01:57.530> water-based<00:01:58.040> paint

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
like so if you've got water-based paint

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.550 
like so if you've got water-based paint
you<00:01:58.400> can<00:01:58.580> water<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:59.030> down<00:01:59.270> but<00:01:59.570> obviously<00:01:59.930> that

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
you can water it down but obviously that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.560 
you can water it down but obviously that
just<00:02:00.860> means<00:02:01.070> that<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:01.370> need<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.700> apply<00:02:02.240> more

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
just means that you need to apply more

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.930 
just means that you need to apply more
coats<00:02:03.220> but<00:02:04.220> because<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.670> way<00:02:04.790> it<00:02:04.910> works

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
coats but because the way it works

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.170 
coats but because the way it works
because<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.870> forces<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.560> air<00:02:06.790> into<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.910> jar

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
because it forces the air into the jar

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
because it forces the air into the jar
which<00:02:09.170> creates<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:10.280> suck<00:02:11.200> whatever

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
which creates it to suck whatever

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.380 
which creates it to suck whatever
solutions<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.860> jar<00:02:13.100> back<00:02:13.310> up<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.850> spray

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
solutions in the jar back up and spray

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.880 
solutions in the jar back up and spray
out<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:17.480> liquid<00:02:18.350> has<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.530> be<00:02:18.680> pretty

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
out and the liquid has to be pretty

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.710 
out and the liquid has to be pretty
runny<00:02:19.220> because<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:20.000> mean<00:02:20.480> it's<00:02:20.600> not<00:02:20.780> pumped<00:02:21.320> so

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
runny because I mean it's not pumped so

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.480 
runny because I mean it's not pumped so
you<00:02:23.720> couldn't<00:02:24.020> use<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.260> thick<00:02:24.710> paint<00:02:25.190> you've

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
you couldn't use it thick paint you've

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.970 
you couldn't use it thick paint you've
got<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.730> make<00:02:25.850> sure<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.150> quite<00:02:26.330> watery<00:02:26.980> but

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
got to make sure it's quite watery but

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.770 
got to make sure it's quite watery but
not<00:02:28.160> too<00:02:28.340> well<00:02:28.580> should<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.850> all<00:02:29.090> run<00:02:29.360> but<00:02:29.660> you

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
not too well should it all run but you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.690 
not too well should it all run but you
know<00:02:29.930> you'll<00:02:30.710> just<00:02:30.890> have<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.130> experiment<00:02:31.400> a

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
know you'll just have to experiment a

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.880 
know you'll just have to experiment a
little<00:02:31.760> bit<00:02:31.910> with<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.270> but<00:02:33.260> it's<00:02:33.500> certainly

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
little bit with it but it's certainly

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.980 
little bit with it but it's certainly
doable<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.270> it's<00:02:35.450> quite<00:02:35.630> fun<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.080> suppose<00:02:37.990> so

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
doable and it's quite fun I suppose so

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.250 
doable and it's quite fun I suppose so
if<00:02:39.140> you've<00:02:39.290> got<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:41.510> once<00:02:41.750> you've<00:02:41.900> filled<00:02:42.110> the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
if you've got it once you've filled the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.950 
if you've got it once you've filled the
jar<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.790> need<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.030> screw<00:02:44.270> your<00:02:45.790> mmm<00:02:46.960> top

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
jar and you need to screw your mmm top

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.380 
jar and you need to screw your mmm top
good<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.620> pee<00:02:48.770> thumb<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.310> if<00:02:49.790> you've<00:02:49.910> got<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> G

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
good and pee thumb and if you've got a G

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.020 
good and pee thumb and if you've got a G
series<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.950> need<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.280> make<00:02:52.430> sure<00:02:52.460> that<00:02:52.910> you

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
series you need to make sure that you

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.990 
series you need to make sure that you
the<00:02:54.370> spray<00:02:55.370> nozzle<00:02:56.300> jet<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.989> in<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.350> end<00:02:58.000> and

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
the spray nozzle jet is in the end and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.390 
the spray nozzle jet is in the end and
of<00:02:59.810> course<00:03:00.230> we've<00:03:00.410> got<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.560> classic<00:03:00.770> series<00:03:01.250> it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
of course we've got a classic series it

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.010 
of course we've got a classic series it
doesn't<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:01.880> one<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.060> those<00:03:02.300> so<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.810> don't

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
doesn't have one of those so you don't

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.850 
doesn't have one of those so you don't
need<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.230> worry<00:03:03.350> about<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:05.410> sure<00:03:06.410> that's<00:03:06.680> on

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
need to worry about that sure that's on

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.050 
need to worry about that sure that's on
tight<00:03:07.570> there<00:03:08.570> we<00:03:08.660> go<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:10.340> again<00:03:10.370> make<00:03:10.910> sure

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
tight there we go so again make sure

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.410 
tight there we go so again make sure
it's<00:03:11.180> set<00:03:11.300> up<00:03:11.330> as<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.630> blower<00:03:13.209> put<00:03:14.209> your

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
it's set up as a blower put your

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.210 
it's set up as a blower put your
attachment<00:03:15.140> holes<00:03:15.350> into<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.890> end<00:03:18.190> make<00:03:19.190> sure

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
attachment holes into the end make sure

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.760 
attachment holes into the end make sure
that<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.760> trigger<00:03:20.120> is<00:03:20.390> opened<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.470> its

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
that the trigger is opened to its

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:30.190 
that the trigger is opened to its
fullest<00:03:22.840> amount<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:29.390> we're<00:03:29.570> ready<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.780> go

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
fullest amount and we're ready to go

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.300 
fullest amount and we're ready to go
so<00:03:30.380> of<00:03:31.160> course<00:03:32.020> keep<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:34.760> pressed<00:03:35.090> in

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
so of course keep it pressed in

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.470 
so of course keep it pressed in
constantly<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.910> maximise<00:03:38.810> flow<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:41.239> it

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
constantly to maximise flow and it

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.280 
constantly to maximise flow and it
should<00:03:42.310> spray<00:03:43.310> pretty<00:03:43.790> evenly<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:44.570> I'll<00:03:45.050> try

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
should spray pretty evenly so I'll try

00:03:45.290 --> 00:05:01.100 
should spray pretty evenly so I'll try
and<00:03:45.320> demonstrate

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:09.439 

so<00:05:02.110> it<00:05:02.289> does<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:02.470> pretty<00:05:02.710> good<00:05:02.770> job<00:05:03.099> really<00:05:03.370> I

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.480 

think<00:05:10.449> it<00:05:10.599> looks<00:05:10.750> quite<00:05:11.020> well<00:05:11.280> live<00:05:12.280> quite

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
think it looks quite well live quite

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.399 
think it looks quite well live quite
well<00:05:12.520> quite<00:05:13.270> good<00:05:14.190> and<00:05:15.190> I<00:05:16.199> suppose<00:05:17.199> it's<00:05:17.349> a<00:05:17.379> bit

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
well quite good and I suppose it's a bit

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.439 
well quite good and I suppose it's a bit
give<00:05:17.680> accusing<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.370> was<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.490> spray<00:05:18.789> painter<00:05:19.240> but

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
give accusing it was a spray painter but

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.230 
give accusing it was a spray painter but
you<00:05:19.599> know<00:05:19.770> if<00:05:20.770> you<00:05:20.889> haven't<00:05:21.069> got<00:05:21.280> a<00:05:21.310> specific

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
you know if you haven't got a specific

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.029 
you know if you haven't got a specific
spray<00:05:22.720> painting<00:05:23.379> gun<00:05:23.919> which<00:05:24.789> pumps<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:26.770> paint

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
spray painting gun which pumps the paint

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.719 
spray painting gun which pumps the paint
out<00:05:27.400> of<00:05:27.580> its<00:05:27.879> jar<00:05:28.500> then<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.830> possible<00:05:30.460> spray

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
out of its jar then the possible spray

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.600 
out of its jar then the possible spray
that<00:05:30.909> comes<00:05:31.120> with<00:05:31.270> your<00:05:31.449> Kirby<00:05:32.169> is<00:05:32.610> pretty

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
that comes with your Kirby is pretty

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.800 
that comes with your Kirby is pretty
adequate<00:05:33.960> it's<00:05:34.960> quite<00:05:35.139> fun<00:05:35.409> to<00:05:35.650> do<00:05:35.889> I<00:05:35.919> suppose

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
adequate it's quite fun to do I suppose

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.570 
adequate it's quite fun to do I suppose
but<00:05:37.810> it<00:05:38.229> does<00:05:38.409> work<00:05:38.620> and<00:05:38.860> as<00:05:38.979> I<00:05:39.009> say<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.520> only

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
but it does work and as I say the only

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.820 
but it does work and as I say the only
thing<00:05:39.990> that<00:05:40.990> you<00:05:41.080> need<00:05:41.199> to<00:05:42.389> really<00:05:43.800> make<00:05:44.800> sure

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
thing that you need to really make sure

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.100 
thing that you need to really make sure
of<00:05:45.280> to<00:05:46.180> be<00:05:46.300> sure<00:05:46.479> that<00:05:46.659> this<00:05:46.780> will<00:05:46.930> work

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
of to be sure that this will work

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.850 
of to be sure that this will work
properly

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
properly

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.600 
properly
is<00:05:48.300> that<00:05:49.300> your<00:05:49.590> paint<00:05:50.590> is<00:05:50.949> runny<00:05:51.250> enough

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
is that your paint is runny enough

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.490 
is that your paint is runny enough
because<00:05:52.240> if<00:05:52.330> it's<00:05:52.449> too<00:05:52.599> thick<00:05:52.900> it<00:05:53.169> just<00:05:53.379> will

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
because if it's too thick it just will

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.730 
because if it's too thick it just will
not<00:05:53.530> spray<00:05:54.039> but<00:05:54.940> you<00:05:55.840> can<00:05:55.990> press<00:05:56.229> the<00:05:56.379> trigger

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
not spray but you can press the trigger

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.680 
not spray but you can press the trigger
as<00:05:56.860> much<00:05:57.009> as<00:05:57.190> you<00:05:57.310> like<00:05:57.460> so<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.240> cows<00:05:58.449> come

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
as much as you like so the cows come

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.170 
as much as you like so the cows come
home<00:05:58.830> but<00:05:59.830> nothing<00:06:00.039> will<00:06:00.370> come<00:06:00.490> out<00:06:00.669> unless

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
home but nothing will come out unless

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.450 
home but nothing will come out unless
it's<00:06:01.690> runny<00:06:02.110> enough<00:06:02.380> to<00:06:02.710> feed<00:06:02.919> up<00:06:03.130> the<00:06:03.310> dip

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
it's runny enough to feed up the dip

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.980 
it's runny enough to feed up the dip
tube<00:06:05.130> so<00:06:06.130> hopefully<00:06:06.880> you<00:06:07.630> found<00:06:07.659> this

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
tube so hopefully you found this

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.620 
tube so hopefully you found this
interesting<00:06:08.349> and<00:06:08.969> of<00:06:09.969> course<00:06:10.210> you<00:06:10.360> need<00:06:10.509> to

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
interesting and of course you need to

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.809 
interesting and of course you need to
wash<00:06:10.840> it<00:06:11.110> immediately<00:06:11.469> after<00:06:12.400> you've

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:12.819 
wash it immediately after you've

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.769 
wash it immediately after you've
finished<00:06:13.440> painting<00:06:14.440> and<00:06:15.159> just<00:06:15.360> rinse<00:06:16.360> the<00:06:16.569> jar

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:16.779 
finished painting and just rinse the jar

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.080 
finished painting and just rinse the jar
rinse<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:17.529> nozzle<00:06:17.830> jet<00:06:18.099> and<00:06:18.490> just<00:06:18.699> rinse<00:06:18.880> the

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
rinse the nozzle jet and just rinse the

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.320 
rinse the nozzle jet and just rinse the
whole<00:06:19.560> gun<00:06:20.560> itself<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:21.729> then<00:06:21.849> fill<00:06:22.090> it<00:06:22.210> with

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
whole gun itself and then fill it with

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.309 
whole gun itself and then fill it with
warm<00:06:23.139> water<00:06:23.289> and<00:06:23.860> then<00:06:23.919> spray<00:06:24.310> it<00:06:25.199> into<00:06:26.199> the

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
warm water and then spray it into the
