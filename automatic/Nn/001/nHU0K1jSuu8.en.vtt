00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
attic this is the escape hatch that

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.280 
attic this is the escape hatch that
simulated<00:03:50.760> skate<00:03:51.150> Pat's<00:03:51.420> going<00:03:51.780> down<00:03:51.959> through

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
simulated skate Pat's going down through

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.890 
simulated skate Pat's going down through
the<00:03:52.440> attic<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:54.060> he's<00:03:54.239> going<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.480> bail<00:03:54.690> out

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
the attic and so he's going to bail out

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.570 
the attic and so he's going to bail out
his<00:03:55.200> first<00:03:55.470> down<00:03:55.739> underneath<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.370> he's

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
his first down underneath this he's

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.790 
his first down underneath this he's
going<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.850> come<00:03:57.000> around<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.630> what<00:03:58.230> happens<00:03:58.680> is

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
going to come around and what happens is

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.920 
going to come around and what happens is
once<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.040> get<00:03:59.220> inside<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.820> place<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.780> got

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
once you get inside of a place you got

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.780 
once you get inside of a place you got
stuff<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.230> fall<00:04:01.620> down<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.280> get<00:04:02.430> kind<00:04:02.730> of

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
stuff to fall down and you get kind of

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.090 
stuff to fall down and you get kind of
tight<00:04:03.030> areas<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.570> have<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.750> get<00:04:04.019> through<00:04:04.350> so

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
tight areas you have to get through so

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.410 
tight areas you have to get through so
the<00:04:06.530> barrel<00:04:07.530> over<00:04:07.769> here<00:04:08.010> simulates<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:09.060> tight

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
the barrel over here simulates a tight

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.080 
the barrel over here simulates a tight
area<00:04:09.630> brawls<00:04:10.440> bruise<00:04:10.769> he's<00:04:11.670> gonna<00:04:11.850> fit

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
area brawls bruise he's gonna fit

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.640 
area brawls bruise he's gonna fit
through<00:04:12.300> that<00:04:12.330> with<00:04:12.570> an<00:04:12.690> air<00:04:12.810> pack

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
go over here and this simulates a wall

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.159 
go over here and this simulates a wall
without<00:04:20.669> sheetrock<00:04:21.299> on<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.900> normal

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
without sheetrock on it just a normal

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.710

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
studying space he's gonna fit through

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.780
