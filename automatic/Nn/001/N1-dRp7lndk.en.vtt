00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.090
 a very common failure in mechanics is 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.700
 put the car in contact give starter 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.259
 and not getting the motor to pack 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.940
 The only thing we get is that it opens the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.220
 electric start but we do not get that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.140
 the engine enters combustion 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.140
 the situation would be more or less like this 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.140
 what we have just seen may be due to 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.760
 two things or carburation or ignition by 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.530
 the part of the carburetor what we have 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.110
 what to notice is that we have naphtha in the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.890
 vehicle if we have gasoline in the vehicle 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.239
 we must see if it reaches the carburetor 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.930
 if it arrives correctly without any 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.449
 difficulty 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.970
 so if we are going to move to the part of 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.940
 switched on 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.520
 Most manuals lines 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.930
 mechanics and forums tell us that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.700
 we have to have the help of a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.950
 second person to give us a start 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.720
 from the ignition key and we 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.090
 there we will be able to verify if 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.880
 we have and what kind of spark we have in 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.890
 the coil and in the distributor but what 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.810
 happens if we are alone the machine and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.370
 us if we have to effect this 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.170
 test 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.680
 let's do it in the following way 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.280
 a spark check only the car 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.049
 and we 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.640
 what we are going to do is verify the 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.400
 lit taking out the lid of 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 dealer to test if spark jumps 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.990
 between the raptor and massa 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.080
 once the rotors are separated with a 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.360
 little piece of cardboard what we're going to do 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.670
 is to put the car in contact 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.070
 Now with a handle screwdriver 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.840
 insulation we make a bridge between the shell 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.620
 of the distributor and the hammer of 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 raptor should appear sparks if not 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.640
 appear those sparks would be a 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.370
 indication that the abductor would be 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.900
 touching massa which is a defect 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.730
 what we are going to do now is the 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.650
 verification of the spark value of the 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.960
 dealer as we do from the 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.910
 Next we take out the piece of paper that 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.980
 separated the raptor's contacts and 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.370
 let's check the spark value of the 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.370
 distributor 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.650
 we move the crankshaft pulley so 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.540
 that the kidnappers touch well in this 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.360
 case are at a point in which 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.820
 they are playing well we disconnected the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.460
 high voltage cable that comes from the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.770
 coil we arrive at about 6 millimeters 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.510
 of a mass such as this one 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.300
 screw that is attached to the block of 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.790
 engine with the car always in contact what 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.860
 what we are going to do is repeatedly open 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.990
 and close the circuit by the raptor 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.780
 by the hammer of the rotor of this 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:47.140
 way what we have to achieve is that 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.140
 here sparks of those 6 millimeters 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.200
 no spark is present 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.550
 then the problem may be 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.590
 originating in the cable in this cable or in 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.410
 the coil what we're going to do first 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.050
 is to disconnect this cable and try 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.570
 an old cable that we know goes around 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.160
 it's old but we know what to do 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.010
 is the cable that we refer to is the 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.230
 cable that the car had first is a 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.760
 conventional copper cable 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.760
 we connect a coil 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.519
 and again we do not have sparks in the 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.519
 cable 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.450
 very well after the coil change 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.340
 let's try to complete the 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.530
 verification of the spark value of the 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.599
 dealer again the test the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.019
 we are going to carry out connecting the cable 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.299
 High voltage central coil a 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.939
 the coil and with the other end 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.430
 we will try to bring the mass together and with the 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.810
 another hand what we are going to do is 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.540
 Contact or open and close quickly 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.909
 dealer contacts now the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.730
 distributor for that way generate 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.989
 sparks in this extreme we come here with 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.989
 the finger and we do so 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.160
 there we are 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.710
 opening and closing the circuit 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.490
 perfect means that our value 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.500
 of spark is correct very well we achieve 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.800
 have good sparks about 6 millimeters 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.810
 of dough the color of the spark was white 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.930
 or bright with a tendency to blue 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.370
 but if you can not see that color and if 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.350
 not being able to distinguish the colors 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.060
 because for example they are anthony cost not 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.250
 have problems what must be important 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.770
 that you see the spark in broad daylight 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.050
 day and the same is accompanied by that 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.910
 characteristic sound is the click 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.250
 characteristic of electric current 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.480
 that you heard during the test if this is 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.980
 so your electrical system is 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.110
 working correctly 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.580
 this type of tests must be carried out 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.409
 always with the battery fully charged 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.819
 keep in mind that it is a test that 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.880
 let's do very possibly if 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.250
 we had problems in the start 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.100
 if we were insisting a lot with the 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.110
 electric starter of the car is very 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.210
 feasible that the battery does not have 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.730
 optimal consumption of charges but that is 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.890
 below those values and below 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.170
 of those values ​​it is very possible that the 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.730
 test goes out of hand and is not product 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.070
 of a fault in the cables in the 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.260
 Distributor in platinum capacitor 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.450
 not on the coil but the problem is 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.370
 low battery charge we have 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.110
 Beware of that, it turns out that for today 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.110
 thank you very much for watching the video
