coarsely<00:02:03.580> chopped<00:02:11.970> sometimes<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.440> dates

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
coarsely chopped sometimes the dates

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.500 
coarsely chopped sometimes the dates
will<00:02:14.680> stick<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.280> blade<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.300> might

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
will stick to the blade and you might

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.900 
will stick to the blade and you might
get<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> little<00:02:16.930> bit<00:02:17.080> large<00:02:18.010> chunk<00:02:18.460> left<00:02:18.730> so

totally just a few more places that's

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.190 
totally just a few more places that's
good<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:31.209> see<00:02:31.360> when<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.570> get<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.780> texture

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
wipe the bottom of the bowl because it'd

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.470 
wipe the bottom of the bowl because it'd
be<00:02:42.250> water<00:02:42.490> on<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:42.940> don't<00:02:43.090> want<00:02:43.209> that<00:02:43.300> in

be water on it you don't want that in
there<00:02:44.580> just<00:02:45.580> pour<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.209> think<00:02:46.840> try<00:02:47.050> to

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
there just pour it in I think try to

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.810 
there just pour it in I think try to
keep<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.410> off<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.560> center<00:02:48.100> if<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.310> can<00:02:48.550> and

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
keep it off the center if you can and

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.730 
keep it off the center if you can and
then<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:50.170> pulse<00:02:50.470> until<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:50.920> combined<00:02:52.740> if

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
then just pulse until it's combined if

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.530 
then just pulse until it's combined if
you<00:02:53.890> don't<00:02:54.070> have<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.280> food<00:02:54.490> processor<00:02:54.550> you<00:02:55.390> can

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
you don't have a food processor you can

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.180 
you don't have a food processor you can
just<00:02:55.660> chop<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.110> nuts<00:02:56.140> first<00:02:56.650> put<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.070> in<00:02:57.160> a

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
just chop the nuts first put it in a

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.920 
just chop the nuts first put it in a
bowl<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.610> then<00:02:57.760> add<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:58.090> chocolate<00:02:58.270> makes<00:02:58.810> it

bowl and then add the chocolate makes it

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.600 
bowl and then add the chocolate makes it
the<00:02:58.990> same<00:02:59.170> thing<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.709> process<00:03:00.250> makes<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.550> a

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
the same thing the process makes it a

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.880 
the same thing the process makes it a
lot<00:03:00.790> easier<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.260> next<00:03:02.410> thing<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.709> do<00:03:02.860> is

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890

just scoop out all the chocolate onto a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.600 
just scoop out all the chocolate onto a
cutting<00:03:05.320> board<00:03:05.620> like<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:08.550> chocolate<00:03:09.550> is

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
cutting board like this chocolate is

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.990 
cutting board like this chocolate is
already<00:03:10.000> beginning<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.390> harden<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:11.019> little<00:03:11.320> bit

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
already beginning to harden a little bit

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.580

square shape cut some equal sized pieces

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.520 
square shape cut some equal sized pieces
I<00:03:34.060> usually<00:03:34.480> cut<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.080> middle<00:03:35.110> first

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
I usually cut in the middle first

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.320 
I usually cut in the middle first
because<00:03:35.830> that's<00:03:35.980> easy<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.640> see<00:03:36.820> and<00:03:36.850> then<00:03:37.150> cut

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
because that's easy to see and then cut

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.180 
because that's easy to see and then cut
