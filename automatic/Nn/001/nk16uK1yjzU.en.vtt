00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.120
 what happened 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.950
 why do you turn before I draw 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.850
 transport I'm not me 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.740
 that you I do not break anything at all you 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.869
 interfere with rail 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.019
 transport minutes already standing because 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.220
 great i understand you stand on you 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.140

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.540
 stand stand i will stand on 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.700
 I understand that you came to me and you 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.430
 you know how to turn trams in general or 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.860
 Immediately the mouth is committed with passing not 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.290
 interfering with traffic 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.780
 following in the opposite direction and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.149
 it does not mean that you can you 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.989
 turn on the rails you met 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.829
 must stand on fair rails 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 hold two trams 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.500
 it is not i will delay it you delay it 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.879
 my car is not my car 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.070
 your that this is not my problem agree 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.380
 you before making a maneuver 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.939
 turning or turning should make sure 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.790
 in the absence of oncoming and passing 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.280
 directions or for transport on you not 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.049
 was the background and I appeared imagine 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.409
 just about that coincidence 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.970
 circumstances for appeared here stand 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.310
 further means that 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.439
 maybe I can still drive back or 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.990
 go round your but agree you want to go 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.060
 Yes, you take out and show me so that I can 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.110
 pull in case you think me more 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.600
 nothing to do 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.700
 I can not leave the tram cabin here in 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.020
 what's the matter of numbers look here believe it 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.689
 what do i need to do 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.579
 but let's do another way and give 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:59.219
 Cape bowl will send when the car will 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:02:00.780
 I don’t have a good time and it’s me now 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.460
 can't understand it because you 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.210
 interfere with rail 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.030
 of transport 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.719
 you make a maneuver reversal in not 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.729
 laid 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.340
 no provision in the manner prescribed 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.129
 rules of the road and coins 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.110
 I specifically provoke you 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.569
 provoke me thinking nothing to do 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.580
 that you drove so close 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.830
 Actually that I could not but how should I 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.690
 Was there a drive up, please tell me 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.269
 away so I could see yes let's 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.379
 his next sms came when 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.300
 I will drive up is not a number 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.310
 the phone when I'm suddenly here 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.540
 pass, I will definitely call or 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.099
 I will write so I will not break you broke 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.010
 rules of the road 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.940
 I can explain to you that you are breaking you 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.180
 violate i can't interfere 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:03:01.890
 no transport except the mouse tram 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:06.900
 this place I interfere with you show 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.860
 I wrote that I owed you something 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.349
 shows explain something tells 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:18.450
 should not should not in this case and in what 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:24.200
 the thing is but the fact is that when that is not 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.200
 it is understood that I can achieve 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.709
 I will specially go and sob Darwin and not 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.099
 to be great as well but what do 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.530
 Now talk about pedestrians that in general 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.450
 need to respect so here you are now not me 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.190
 respects because you don't follow the rules 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.069
 traffic maneuvers you 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.280
 must hear a turn from the passing 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.430
 directions the thing is now 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.689
 wait a moment and get distracted 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.170
 face you will fill him now he is 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.170
 left 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:08.430
 let's you now here you are at work 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:18.350
 at least not mardan I get for all this 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:18.350
 why money here 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.780
 the knife can not 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:53.750
 but because of the citizen does not want to leave 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:55.550
 I don't know from the rails 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.060
 counter flow he therefore cannot 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.060
 turn around 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:07.909
 he is not in front I will not show it somewhere 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:19.249
 don't know the balance oil is non-periodic 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.249
 sargon structure morons
