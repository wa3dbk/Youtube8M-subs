we<00:00:06.960> are<00:00:07.049> having<00:00:07.350> some<00:00:07.740> modern<00:00:08.370> warfare<00:00:08.610> 3<00:00:09.349> more

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
we are having some modern warfare 3 more

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.900 
we are having some modern warfare 3 more
gameplay<00:00:11.370> rights<00:00:11.730> here<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:13.250> thought<00:00:14.250> first<00:00:14.639> of

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
gameplay rights here I thought first of

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.460 
gameplay rights here I thought first of
not<00:00:15.179> uploading<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.139> gameplay<00:00:16.529> at<00:00:17.430> all<00:00:18.410> so<00:00:19.410> I

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
not uploading this gameplay at all so I

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.529 
not uploading this gameplay at all so I
really<00:00:19.920> think<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.340> wasn't<00:00:20.670> one<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.880> my<00:00:21.180> best

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
really think it wasn't one of my best

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.700 
really think it wasn't one of my best
ones<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:22.490> just<00:00:23.490> went<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.660> game<00:00:24.930> as<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.560> can

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
ones I just went on this game as you can

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.759 
ones I just went on this game as you can
see<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.550> termination<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:28.230> went<00:00:28.500> for

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
see it's termination and I just went for

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.810 
see it's termination and I just went for
the<00:00:28.920> model<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.640> game<00:00:30.500> actually<00:00:31.820> I'm

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the model on this game actually I'm

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.180 
the model on this game actually I'm
usually<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.450> kind<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.750> team<00:00:34.050> player<00:00:34.440> when<00:00:35.040> I'm

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
usually the kind of team player when I'm

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.670 
usually the kind of team player when I'm
playing<00:00:35.460> domination<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.719> time<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.020> was<00:00:37.380> just

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
playing domination this time I was just

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.760 
playing domination this time I was just
going<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.129> feels<00:00:38.460> like<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.770> like

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
going for the feels like that like

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.500 
going for the feels like that like
someone<00:00:41.250> who<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.489> trying<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.879> get<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> gameplay

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
someone who was trying to get a gameplay

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.650 
someone who was trying to get a gameplay
for<00:00:42.899> YouTube<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:45.920> anyways<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.940> game<00:00:48.180> went

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
for YouTube so anyways the game went

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.959 
for YouTube so anyways the game went
pretty<00:00:48.930> well<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:50.039> team<00:00:50.280> actually<00:00:50.460> managed

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
pretty well this team actually managed

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.029 
pretty well this team actually managed
to<00:00:51.120> win<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.539> all<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.079> games<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.620> row<00:00:52.649> like

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
to win like all the games in a row like

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.029 
to win like all the games in a row like
let's<00:00:53.399> say<00:00:53.550> five<00:00:53.789> games<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.530> opposite

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
let's say five games and the opposite

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.060 
let's say five games and the opposite
team<00:00:56.480> wasn't<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.960> doing<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.559> best<00:00:58.590> they

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
team wasn't really doing the best they

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.939 
team wasn't really doing the best they
could<00:00:59.399> do

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.710 

yeah<00:01:04.949> um<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.570> my<00:01:06.750> gun<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:08.720> m60

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
yeah um as you can see my gun it's m60

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.710 
yeah um as you can see my gun it's m60
maybe<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> most<00:01:11.100> used<00:01:11.700> gun<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> game

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
maybe not the most used gun in the game

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.810 
maybe not the most used gun in the game
but<00:01:12.990> definitely<00:01:13.560> I've<00:01:13.710> used<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.159> gun<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.640> lot

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
but definitely I've used this gun a lot

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.440 
but definitely I've used this gun a lot
on<00:01:15.180> survival<00:01:16.170> mode<00:01:16.400> it's<00:01:17.400> pretty<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:17.850> gun

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
on survival mode it's pretty good gun

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.560 
on survival mode it's pretty good gun
there<00:01:18.810> I'm<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:20.369> saying<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.850> very<00:01:20.909> bad<00:01:21.299> gun

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
there I'm not saying it's very bad gun

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.499 
there I'm not saying it's very bad gun
on<00:01:21.750> multiplayer<00:01:22.080> either<00:01:22.970> especially<00:01:23.970> once

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
on multiplayer either especially once

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.190 
on multiplayer either especially once
you<00:01:24.689> get<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> specialist<00:01:25.530> founders<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
you get the specialist founders and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.310 
you get the specialist founders and
here's<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.939> probably<00:01:29.939> my<00:01:30.210> favorite<00:01:30.600> setup<00:01:31.020> for

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
here's my probably my favorite setup for

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.840 
here's my probably my favorite setup for
this<00:01:31.500> gun<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.490> silencer<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.600> red<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.320> sight

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
this gun it's silencer and red of sight

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.140 
this gun it's silencer and red of sight
because<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.509> gun<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.500> slow<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.310> for

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
because this gun is really slow and for

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.800 
because this gun is really slow and for
me

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
me

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.639 
me
the<00:01:40.200> silencer<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.159> works<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.759> best<00:01:42.380> because<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the silencer it works the best because I

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.410 
the silencer it works the best because I
want<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.979> stay<00:01:44.220> out<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.700> radar<00:01:45.119> when<00:01:45.299> I'm

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
want to stay out of the radar when I'm

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.600 
want to stay out of the radar when I'm
going<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> mode<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.460> gun<00:01:49.399> since<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
going for a mode with this gun since the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.510 
going for a mode with this gun since the
gun<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.149> slow<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.570> use<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.799> probably<00:01:53.280> won't

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
gun is so slow to use you probably won't

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.910 
gun is so slow to use you probably won't
win<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.090> lot<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.590> 1v1<00:01:56.420> situations<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.079> best

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
win a lot of 1v1 situations so it's best

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.429 
win a lot of 1v1 situations so it's best
just<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.850> have<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.869> bit<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.140> background

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
just to have a little bit of background

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.550 
just to have a little bit of background
use<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.100> their<00:02:04.460> awareness<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:06.060> where<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.110> are

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
use of their awareness of where you are

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.620 
use of their awareness of where you are
if<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.890> makes<00:02:10.160> any<00:02:10.340> sense<00:02:10.520> probably<00:02:11.060> enough

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
if that makes any sense probably enough

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.350 
if that makes any sense probably enough
but<00:02:11.900> maybe<00:02:12.080> you'll<00:02:12.320> understand<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.760> wasn't<00:02:17.180> my

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
but maybe you'll understand it wasn't my

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.180 
but maybe you'll understand it wasn't my
first<00:02:17.630> getting<00:02:18.080> with<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.380> canvas<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.070> can

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
first getting with this canvas you can

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.820 
first getting with this canvas you can
see<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.430> already<00:02:19.730> got<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.180> golden<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.410> have<00:02:21.680> to

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
see I already got it golden so I have to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.270 
see I already got it golden so I have to
try<00:02:22.070> quite<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.030> lot<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.390> games<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:24.290> actually<00:02:24.710> get

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
try quite a lot of games to actually get

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.470 
try quite a lot of games to actually get
it<00:02:25.400> get<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.240> mold<00:02:27.670> but<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.700> have<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.090> say<00:02:29.270> that

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
it get the mold but I have to say that

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.230 
it get the mold but I have to say that
it<00:02:29.750> was<00:02:29.960> one<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.440> my<00:02:30.620> first<00:02:31.250> games<00:02:31.700> after

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
it was one of my first games after

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.140 
it was one of my first games after
either<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.410> gun<00:02:33.560> go<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.370> maybe<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.880> brought

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
either the gun go so maybe it brought

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.320 
either the gun go so maybe it brought

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
some you know good luck perhaps not

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.080 
some you know good luck perhaps not
necessarily<00:02:38.360> but<00:02:39.260> yeah<00:02:42.010> right<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.460> map<00:02:43.700> I

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
necessarily but yeah right on the map I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.080 
necessarily but yeah right on the map I
really<00:02:45.080> like<00:02:45.260> mission<00:02:45.740> I've<00:02:46.040> gotten<00:02:46.459> at<00:02:46.760> least

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
really like mission I've gotten at least

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.480 
really like mission I've gotten at least
five<00:02:47.360> mobs<00:02:47.690> on<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.110> map<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.740> think<00:02:49.190> I've<00:02:49.310> only

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
five mobs on this map I think I've only

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.100 
five mobs on this map I think I've only
uploaded<00:02:50.390> one<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.900> them<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:53.120> map<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:53.900> really

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
uploaded one of them this map is really

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.030 
uploaded one of them this map is really
good<00:02:54.380> for<00:02:54.560> mopes<00:02:55.780> definitely<00:02:56.780> my<00:02:56.990> best<00:02:57.650> map

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
good for mopes definitely my best map

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.060 
good for mopes definitely my best map
for<00:02:58.370> getting<00:02:58.760> mobs<00:02:59.390> with<00:02:59.810> just<00:03:00.440> about<00:03:00.620> any

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
for getting mobs with just about any

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.310 
for getting mobs with just about any
weapon<00:03:01.580> would<00:03:01.820> be<00:03:01.870> resistance<00:03:05.020> probably<00:03:06.020> some

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
weapon would be resistance probably some

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.880 
weapon would be resistance probably some
of<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.470> have<00:03:06.860> may<00:03:07.370> have<00:03:07.400> seen<00:03:07.970> once<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:09.200> got

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
of you have may have seen once I got

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.210 
of you have may have seen once I got
like<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.390> 49<00:03:11.390> gun<00:03:11.720> Street<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.290> while<00:03:12.560> ago<00:03:12.890> with

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
like a 49 gun Street a while ago with

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.440 
like a 49 gun Street a while ago with
the<00:03:13.400> ump45

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
the ump45

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.020 
the ump45
and<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:16.820> was<00:03:17.000> on<00:03:17.209> resistance<00:03:18.250> now<00:03:19.250> usually<00:03:19.580> I

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
and that was on resistance now usually I

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.840 
and that was on resistance now usually I
get<00:03:20.150> pretty<00:03:20.600> good<00:03:20.780> streaks<00:03:21.170> on<00:03:21.470> mission<00:03:22.070> but<00:03:22.820> I

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
get pretty good streaks on mission but I

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.160 
get pretty good streaks on mission but I
also<00:03:23.120> die<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.980> lot<00:03:25.580> more<00:03:25.850> often<00:03:26.239> on<00:03:26.390> mission<00:03:26.900> on

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
also die a lot more often on mission on

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.670 
also die a lot more often on mission on
a<00:03:27.230> good<00:03:27.560> streak<00:03:27.920> than<00:03:28.670> on<00:03:28.940> resistance<00:03:29.720> like

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
a good streak than on resistance like

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.600 
a good streak than on resistance like
there<00:03:30.950> I<00:03:30.980> rarely<00:03:31.780> die<00:03:32.810> during<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.890> streak<00:03:34.280> and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
there I rarely die during the streak and

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.509 
there I rarely die during the streak and
I<00:03:35.120> kind<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.570> get<00:03:35.810> get<00:03:36.650> what<00:03:36.860> I<00:03:36.890> want<00:03:37.250> on<00:03:37.489> that

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
I kind of get get what I want on that

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.820 
I kind of get get what I want on that
map<00:03:37.970> but<00:03:38.690> here<00:03:38.870> mission<00:03:39.320> is<00:03:39.500> more

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
map but here mission is more

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.160 
map but here mission is more
unpredictable<00:03:40.459> with<00:03:41.030> response<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.840> you

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
unpredictable with response and you

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.630 
unpredictable with response and you
might<00:03:42.350> get<00:03:42.590> screwed<00:03:43.510> just<00:03:44.510> instantly<00:03:45.640> though

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
might get screwed just instantly though

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.540 
might get screwed just instantly though
a<00:03:47.060> mission<00:03:47.540> is<00:03:47.720> kind<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:48.440> harder<00:03:48.769> map<00:03:49.010> for<00:03:49.400> me

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
a mission is kind of harder map for me

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.190 
a mission is kind of harder map for me
but<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.209> like<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.720> lot

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.370 
but I like it a lot
