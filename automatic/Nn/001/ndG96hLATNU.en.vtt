much how you fast you're going to start

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.170 
much how you fast you're going to start
with<00:02:28.020> an<00:02:28.170> eight-hour<00:02:28.560> window<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.160> then<00:02:29.940> I'd

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
with an eight-hour window and then I'd

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.600 
with an eight-hour window and then I'd
say<00:02:30.450> every<00:02:30.810> maybe<00:02:31.020> two<00:02:31.350> days<00:02:31.530> take<00:02:32.340> an<00:02:32.459> hour

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
say every maybe two days take an hour

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.730 
say every maybe two days take an hour
off<00:02:32.910> your<00:02:33.120> window<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.660> when<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.290> start<00:02:34.560> your

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
off your window so when you start your

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.140 
off your window so when you start your
first<00:02:34.950> two<00:02:35.130> days<00:02:35.310> do<00:02:35.490> an<00:02:35.610> eight-hour<00:02:35.940> window

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
first two days do an eight-hour window

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.040 
first two days do an eight-hour window
then<00:02:36.840> go<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.310> 706<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:39.000> then<00:02:39.150> go<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.450> 4<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
then go to a 706 and then go to a 4 and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.040 
then go to a 706 and then go to a 4 and
I<00:02:40.430> do<00:02:41.430> for<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.090> can<00:02:42.209> stay<00:02:42.390> up<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.720> four-hour
