in<00:03:52.870> this<00:03:52.989> formation<00:03:53.320> your<00:03:53.590> striker<00:03:53.920> should<00:03:54.220> be

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
in this formation your striker should be

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.160 
in this formation your striker should be
the<00:03:54.370> one<00:03:54.520> scoring<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.060> lot<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.660> goals<00:03:56.020> now

rebreathers taken our free kicks he's
taking<00:03:57.850> our<00:03:57.940> penalties<00:03:58.420> so<00:03:58.840> there's

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
taking our penalties so there's

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.449 
taking our penalties so there's
definitely<00:03:59.140> something<00:03:59.709> to<00:03:59.800> be<00:03:59.860> said<00:04:00.160> for<00:04:00.190> that

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
definitely something to be said for that

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.190 
definitely something to be said for that
or<00:04:01.890> so<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:03.280> finally<00:04:04.150> came<00:04:04.300> to<00:04:04.450> terms<00:04:04.480> with<00:04:04.930> why

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
or so I finally came to terms with why

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.680 
or so I finally came to terms with why
this<00:04:05.260> team<00:04:05.860> feels<00:04:06.130> good<00:04:06.459> but<00:04:06.970> doesn't<00:04:07.510> feel

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
this team feels good but doesn't feel

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.199 
this team feels good but doesn't feel
great<00:04:07.989> that's<00:04:08.230> because<00:04:08.530> Paul<00:04:08.830> Pogba<00:04:09.100> is<00:04:09.519> not

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
great that's because Paul Pogba is not

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.479 
great that's because Paul Pogba is not
the<00:04:10.420> attacking<00:04:10.750> mid<00:04:11.050> for<00:04:11.260> me<00:04:11.380> he's<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:11.980> little

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
the attacking mid for me he's a little

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.270 
the attacking mid for me he's a little
bit<00:04:12.730> too<00:04:13.030> clunky<00:04:13.390> on<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.810> ball<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.890> like

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
bit too clunky on the ball and I like

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.920

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.469 
because I feel like he provides really
good<00:04:57.900> goals<00:04:58.229> and<00:04:58.530> fun<00:04:59.520> goals<00:04:59.820> at<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:00.419> I

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
good goals and fun goals at that so I

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.920 
good goals and fun goals at that so I
have<00:05:00.630> an<00:05:00.750> idea<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:01.500> what<00:05:02.280> i'm<00:05:02.610> gonna<00:05:02.729> do<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.300> have

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
have an idea of what i'm gonna do I have

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.570 
have an idea of what i'm gonna do I have
well<00:05:04.349> have<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.530> few<00:05:04.830> ideas<00:05:04.949> there's<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.400> lot<00:05:05.550> of

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
well have a few ideas there's a lot of

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.710 
well have a few ideas there's a lot of
things<00:05:05.759> going<00:05:05.910> through<00:05:06.120> my<00:05:06.270> mind<00:05:06.360> right<00:05:06.599> now

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
things going through my mind right now

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.969 
things going through my mind right now
but<00:05:06.900> I<00:05:06.930> have<00:05:07.050> an<00:05:07.139> idea<00:05:07.229> how<00:05:07.530> we<00:05:07.590> can<00:05:07.740> switch<00:05:07.949> it

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
but I have an idea how we can switch it

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:08.960 
but I have an idea how we can switch it
up<00:05:08.099> because<00:05:08.280> as<00:05:08.430> long<00:05:08.520> as<00:05:08.699> there's<00:05:08.849> that

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
up because as long as there's that

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.580 
up because as long as there's that
little<00:05:09.090> Bayern<00:05:09.419> connection<00:05:09.990> over<00:05:10.320> there<00:05:10.470> on

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
little Bayern connection over there on

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.960 
little Bayern connection over there on
the<00:05:10.710> left<00:05:10.919> we<00:05:11.099> have<00:05:11.130> lots<00:05:11.520> of<00:05:11.699> different

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
the left we have lots of different

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.240 
the left we have lots of different
options<00:05:12.360> that<00:05:12.960> we<00:05:13.080> can<00:05:13.259> work<00:05:13.440> towards<00:05:13.680> this

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
options that we can work towards this

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.070 
options that we can work towards this
game<00:05:14.520> ends<00:05:14.789> at<00:05:15.030> one<00:05:15.240> nilda<00:05:15.630> that's<00:05:15.900> where

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
game ends at one nilda that's where

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.060 
game ends at one nilda that's where
we're<00:05:16.169> going<00:05:16.289> to<00:05:16.349> come<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.650> close<00:05:16.830> of<00:05:17.009> this

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
we're going to come to a close of this

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.560 
we're going to come to a close of this
episode<00:05:17.460> I'm<00:05:17.550> gonna<00:05:17.669> try<00:05:18.030> to<00:05:18.090> keep<00:05:18.240> path<00:05:18.419> to

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
episode I'm gonna try to keep path to

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.110 
episode I'm gonna try to keep path to
powers<00:05:18.810> may<00:05:19.050> be<00:05:19.110> a<00:05:19.199> little<00:05:19.530> bit<00:05:19.919> shorter<00:05:20.580> this

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
powers may be a little bit shorter this

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.430 
powers may be a little bit shorter this
is<00:05:21.300> when<00:05:21.509> I<00:05:21.539> first<00:05:21.810> started<00:05:22.080> doing<00:05:22.199> path

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
is when I first started doing path

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.559 
is when I first started doing path
powers<00:05:22.800> I've<00:05:22.979> never<00:05:23.400> would<00:05:23.699> go<00:05:23.849> over<00:05:24.150> six

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
powers I've never would go over six

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:25.610 
powers I've never would go over six
minutes<00:05:24.750> we're<00:05:25.020> gonna<00:05:25.080> keep<00:05:25.319> them<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.590> little

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
minutes we're gonna keep them a little

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.100 
minutes we're gonna keep them a little
bit<00:05:26.099> shorter<00:05:26.639> from<00:05:26.880> now<00:05:27.060> on<00:05:27.360> or<00:05:27.750> at<00:05:27.810> least<00:05:27.960> try

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
bit shorter from now on or at least try

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.390 
bit shorter from now on or at least try
