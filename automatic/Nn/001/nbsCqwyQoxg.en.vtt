00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.900
 friends and hello again to you 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.390
 Dmitriy ethical recipes and today have 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.550
 we will be cottage cheese cheesecake recipe like 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.420
 usually very simple let's see 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.420
 what will we do 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.640
 so if you have a curd such as 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.250
 I should definitely miss him 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.250
 through a sieve that he was so plump 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.900
 after 4 eggs, separate the white from the yolk 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.900
 immediately add the yolk to the curd 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.109
 add 3 tablespoons of cornstarch 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.789
 200 milliliters of nonfat kefir 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.670
 sweetener to taste can also 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.670
 add vanillin to check and all well 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.670
 mix 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.260
 we have such a mass 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:44.770
 after the whites we whip the squirrels into a cool foam 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.770
 gradually introduce into our cottage cheese 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.539
 mix well too 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.530
 after cooking for baking I do not advise you 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.630
 they use this form like mine 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.769
 because so tender curd 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.540
 cheesecake is then poorly taken out of it 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:18.000
 best to use just round 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.000
 form all fill neatly 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.130
 distribute 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:39.150
 and send bake at about 180 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:42.380
 200 degrees later in minutes 10 60 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.640
 check the rigidity of our cheesecake 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:50.220
 but it seems to be ready after the parish need 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.380
 will it cool i did it in 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.209
 a sink with cold water but also here 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.900
