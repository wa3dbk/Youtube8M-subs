00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:08.189
 talk about it by testing a sensor 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:11.179
 and the arduino are going to give a 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:16.580
 Look, he's in the front. 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:20.519
 position detector whistled her too 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.349
 put my brother here in front of him 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:28.560
 It's about 16 meters away. 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.990
 but it detects movement I programmed 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.080
 it to trigger a browser 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.850
 It's good to have a look around, I think. 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.650
 the fit will look good but let's try 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.350
 this is the sensor 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.980
 you usually see these sensors, you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.860
 a round lift in some places there 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.850
 that when there is someone it turns on the light 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.850
 just not right 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:08.310
 the two are connected at the hotel's door 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:16.890
 guadiana interlude score for there 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:18.270
 to stay painting the next look at the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:30.380
 program it to say that it does not have 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:35.520
 no one the following programming is simple 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.400
 it is connected to digital port three only 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.540
 I make the reading value on the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 metal 13 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.110
 if this value is true also in the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.979
 forward then he speaks a sentence until 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.610
 Someone there and I have the door in the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.160
 logic 9 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.930
 is the value 60 to ring the buzzer bell 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.400
 analogue 9 the conch on the new 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.320
 london 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.300
 well if you have anybody then he says that 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:13.180
 no one between deactivates or the sign of the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:16.240
 two is from the right bank, they know they want 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.180
 that I 've always been vod lupi is donated 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.430
 money and he compares this reading 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.850
 digital 3d is true because it has 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.250
 someone in front of the sensor can say 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.430
 a national phrase 12 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.550
 otherwise he says another sentence then saying 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.550
 nobody 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:48.640
 if you look here the high highlight 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:50.050
 how false am not going to put a training 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.040
 very simple 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.090
 just for you to have a sense of how the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.090
 presence sensor 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.769
 I enjoyed this way in four 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.739
 children 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:15.700
 actually the red at will 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:19.480
 the good is the gnv, my love is a sign that 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.690
 it verifies whether it is true or false and 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.500
 Send if you do not see 3d digital proposal 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:31.450
 right 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:38.709
 and here it is the black goes in a bathing suit 12 and 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:43.590
 yellow is what you see 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.590
 this project is running 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:55.490
 hdmi own gea day adapter 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.280
 so this was just a test 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.780
 the sensor of presence in the full carnival 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.590
 It's okay to show everyone a hug. 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.590
 there he spoke
