00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:10.469
 hello everyone and welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.940
 1 the good butter bulbs in tvz then 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.929
 what is the good butter bull in 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.670
 tele z bombers because it's him who 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.590
 did it anyway I think in the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.880
 first there are other people who 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.359
 have done since I saw them 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.359
 especially executed by breakage and others 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.369
 european players ico then has the idea 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.480
 it's back to something old enough 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.899
 school that is not to produce 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 lions open in tvz then you go 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.110
 on a classic an expanding racks you 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.370
 ask the bacon axa 12 know it's just 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.980
 behind as soon as you have 400 and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.289
 derrien instead of adding gas and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.579
 well you will add two racks and 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.000
 you will continuously produce 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.190
 marine 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.270
 good smell hunting lord this is 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.640
 optional but it's still the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.829
 welcome especially when you play with 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.109
 this type of air bubbles that has a lot of 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.550
 marine at the beginning of the game this build order 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.920
 is quite effective against bubbles 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.869
 of air that have no gas so there I 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.689
 not yet scouts and I'm going to listen to the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.210
 timing of b3 but in general is better 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.710
 listen to vcs earlier to have 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.340
 gas timing information from 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.630
 your opponent 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.140
 and so it's particularly 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.509
 interesting about the very gas takes 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.900
 late from your opponent that involves 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.770
 an absence of speed exergue behind 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.490
 you add your gas to 30 between 30 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.079
 and 35 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.390
 you continue to do well everything goes 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.000
 and you will be able to launch a take lab 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.720
 is a command center so you 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.479
 find with three cc3 racks and 1t 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.700
 clab a very important thing is this 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.880
 pressure at 6 minutes which in general 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.470
 involved in the fact that your 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.470
 opponent left on a build order 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.100
 without gas and that he will have a b3 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.259
 relatively fast so there I have a little 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.759
 it's not so good on this game because 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.049
 that good I got the info at the end of the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.520
 gas timing so I saw that there was 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.240
 no gas and that's why I 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.070
 lets go out 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.299
 if you have any doubt that your 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.229
 adversary is potentially in the process 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.200
 to go on an all in 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.239
 avoid going on this horror bull 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.650
 so that's the idea of ​​this pressure 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.190
 it's not at all about killing your 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.750
 opponent 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.640
 it's scouts and the taking of b3 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.340
 to try potentially killed and a 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.600
 queen slow down a little crip but that's it 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.790
 it's really not the goal it's 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.480
 really not kill you see I'm going 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.910
 go away 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.410
 peacefully behind once you 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.459
 started the ccdh we were talking about everything 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.269
 the time obviously you will have the 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.600
 timings in link on the tutorial you 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.690
 add one facto two ib and you 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.790
 take vorax your gas on the b2 because 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.040
 that of course zibe and a facto 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.069
 it starts to need gas so 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.200
 you take your gas on the b2 and you 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.420
 find with three racks of zibe and 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.810
 a facto so something rather 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.760
 classic finally in the game 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.410
 classic where you usually leave 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.310
 first on lots which 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.140
 obviously you're still 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.000
 attention or all in you crowd where are you going 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.530
 you make a security bunker in case 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.760
 where if you against because there well 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.290
 obviously you put the pressure but 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.850
 at any moment he can have the speed and 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.670
 many young people who go out and leave 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.040
 to lean so be very careful 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.810
 here is scouting the b3 there 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.269
 honestly I find that I am too 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.680
 aggressive about the situation 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.329
 really do not lose his marines at 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.400
 possible because that's really what 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.500
 will make your opponent doubt 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.019
 compared to the fact that you still have 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.450
 or not of the la of the population and 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.310
 he can from rooney or not is 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.510
 behind you will add your 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.670
 spatial you're going to put on a 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.650
 de facto reactor the facto you him 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.920
 put a reactor behind you 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.660
 the b3 in place and then you add 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.209
 the armory to do the 2-2 you add 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.060
 a second facto to make the speed 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.940
 mine office and you add 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.350
 racks and finally has it at 9 minutes 45 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.959
 we could very well in a situation 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.140
 you first came out reaper of 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.910
 hellions as soon as you just added 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.530
 your two racks finally it can be 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.729
 it's not if I tell you the bulldozer 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.769
 finally we can be in a 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:09.600
 situation you have produced hellions 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.040
 and his two racks you 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.840
 to build them and you're trying 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.550
 to put reactors on them like the 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.010
 classic bulbs that are on time 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.090
 current in the tvz standard so 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.070
 finally there from now 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.140
 you go on a classic game 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.180
 it's really the pressure timing 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.490
 with a small marine pack a plug 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.350
 of b3 pretty orly do not forget the 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.640
 high grades and behind to add some 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.520
 medivacs and you're right now 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.370
 to be able to consider a double medivacs and 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.310
 a fairly fast pressure with 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.690
 marines who will have shield esteem and already 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.790
 a small mass with a marine 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.910
 timing around 10 12 minutes 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.060
 just as one can see in tvz in pst 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.780
 forgiveness here on the two medivacs you 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.210
 will be able to consider the pressure without 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.250
 too much risk trying to slow down the 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.840
 crip try to see the choice 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.940
 your opponent's strategic 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.260
 I had added two bunkers until 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.120
 when I lost my navy I had 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.820
 afraid it's an all in one hit 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.540
 added two security bunkers 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.740
 do not hesitate to look at the commentary 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.410
 on the video 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.630
 after there are actually different 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.670
 different possibilities 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.620
 especially in the composition of the timing 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.570
 especially at the level of upgrades you 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.500
 can consider this addition to the 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.660
 shield before the steam 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.310
 after it's softer depending on 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.260
 your style of play you will be able to 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.240
 arrive earlier later play more or 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.190
 less defensive especially if your 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.840
 adversary took these gases made very 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.730
 attention because this pressure one 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.550
 plans to 6 7 minutes 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.020
 it is difficult to envisage if 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.360
 the guy is going on mass 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.950
 speedgling you are going to make his cage 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.990
 and your navy here I hope this tutorial 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.000
 you liked it if you're not watching 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.030
 timings in the comments of the 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.950
 video is also obviously the 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.870
 general comments on the buldozer 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.870
 that's good practice and see you next time
