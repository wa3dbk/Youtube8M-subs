00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 clark actions that have been known in 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.770
 the last hours who said them was 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.260
 jose luis chilavert and they have to do with 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.139
 a situation that has arisen in your 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.590
 neighborhood 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.590
 Hi how are you 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.980
 also want to see 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.450
 who want to build you near where 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.480
 you live 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.820
 in the neighborhood one just here I was 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.760
 with the meeting with the mayor 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.060
 alejandro granados which we left 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.580
 all the neighbors of neighborhood 1 and you 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.920
 we declare that we do not want 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.410
 that is built and the houses 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.480
 popular 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.730
 if they want to do it because they have already 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.860
 put the perimeter fence because no 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.140
 I think we have made an effort 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.390
 terrible each of the families we have 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.170
 invested a lot of money and we have 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.970
 a tranquility is also lived and 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.340
 I really do not repeat it to whom 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.220
 we manifested him and he said that good 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.460
 so far is an idea showed some 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.910
 photos of what the homes would be like 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.850
 like a monoblock but I think that about 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.979
 the way you have to handle 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.570
 I should also respect the thought 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.390
 in the tranquility of all the neighbors 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.250
 to see chile where the neighborhood one 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.390
 the neighborhood once in the neighborhood that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.010
 It is in front of the property of the afa 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.130
 Crossing the bridge 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.380
 that goes vienna crossing the bridge to the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.060
 right the center but to see but it's not going 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.979
 to be the first to see is not going to be the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.170
 first nor the last place where there is 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.200
 neighborhoods of high purchasing power and there 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.479
 neighborhoods of middle or lower middle class 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.729
 deposit for example the case of the area 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.280
 one thing yes we go one thing that you 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.930
 They called me to make a note if 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.060
 you yourselves are going to have your own 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.520
 argument why not a computer 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.740
 writing down again because each time 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.750
 one looks at the other's pocket does not look at the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.130
 William's achiever we made 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.140
 a lot of effort 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.149
 and I think there are a lot of places 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.860
 where they can put us also because they do not 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.960
 put it in front of the mangrullo or we 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.670
 puts in the celia where he lives or also 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.200
 there are many places calafate in all 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.570
 sides can put me run it 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.989
 just a place where we are 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.420
 supposedly a neighborhood that we paid about 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.370
 very high taxes and in which because 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.319
 they are not going to come and I do not have anything 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.819
 against the humble family 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.829
 and poor and I'm in a situation of 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.780
 privilege but football is why 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.400
 if you already have a thought 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.469
 they call and they will attack me not obviously 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.030
 cord or not and we know we do many 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.920
 social tasks in Paraguay apart 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.540
 We know that Paraguay is linked and it is also 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.629
 started the task of doing is and paraguay 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.510
 and in Argentina also the formosa 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.790
 jump jujuy tucumán what happened to me that I 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.950
 summoned the presses to be able to 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.950
 show what the aids are 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.819
 but I agree because that's what I 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.989
 I know the place is an exclusive neighborhood 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.290
 that is no longer exclusive to the word 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.919
 because there are also some houses 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.900
 middle class 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.400
 I do not know I know him that he is 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.329
 that now to chilavert jose hernan de mi 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.739
 name how are you going 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.349
 I think they modified the hospital not 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.610
 lately of course he is in charge of 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.770
 hospital they took them to the 205 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.230
 What bothers me the most, I turn to you 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.170
 repeat yesterday we talked all the neighbors 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.960
 when they take the floor I told the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.000
 legal governor quartermaster first the 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.740
 problem of insecurity he 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.360
 He stated that he is going to put perimeter 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.270
 esteem of security languages ​​I will 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.610
 I say but because if today you have you live 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.940
 usually because we do not either 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.010
 we can have that opportunity to buy 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.780
 the property if we also give the manager 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.060
 of the mortgage bank because he says of 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.730
 that the person has to earn 20 thousand 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.550
 pesos and pay a fee of 6 thousand pesos 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.070
 to be given housing and 100 wins 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.680
 20 thousand pesos today talking badly and soon to 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.320
 the humble people that we are 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.030
 realistic but apart from that sea that 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.610
 has a characteristic is different is 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.200
 a small neighborhood we can say is a 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.920
 very characteristic neighborhood of the place 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.480
 clear and really pulls out look at me 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.790
 would extend what is part of the neighborhood 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.300
 that here the beauty of what the 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.549
 back of that sea I think that 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.690
 is in the river fields out there 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.870
 near 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.300
 in beyond the river field the same 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.080
 in the same field the people and many 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.640
 families that have their horses for 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.770
 children to run 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.530
 I told him why he does not leave a space 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.690
 green for people and fundamentally 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.670
 search locate it somewhere else 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.380
 there are a lot of places opposite the 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.560
 mangrullo there are plenty meets tax 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.570
 as well 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.669
 in Calafate there are also points of 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.320
 earth because we do not always want 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.910
 harm the people we pay what 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.100
 that impose those fields that are Serbian 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:57.080
 in front of the desire is that they are fiscal 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:00.220
 also clear right to do it 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.690
 sometimes to the neighborhood it seems to me that 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.520
 as it is characteristic as it has a 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.350
 cute pretty structure that neighborhood me 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.870
 it seems that taking that visit can 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.610
 get to complicate that if you see it and this 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.280
 to you it is also beyond 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.139
 issue of insecurity would lower them 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.889
 the price or value of the property in 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.360
 that area totally totally or is there 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.639
 many neighbors that we made a 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.770
 investment is terrible and to maintain 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.410
 all that and see that it 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.930
 devalued the property of each one and 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.260
 also yesterday the mayor when I 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.720
 I spoke I told him without cuts and the bank 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.460
 mortgage for 3 we are saying 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.110
 we are going to all the neighbors and we 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.330
 we 're left with that prize and what 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.950
 we use as a park for children 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.680
 that can be used for any 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.870
 sports activity 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.030
 He said it's good to do many 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.850
 investments the cost is high and finished 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.070
 telling me not to say more bullshit 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.860
 when he told me do not say more volume if I 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.330
 I told him I do not say bullshit like that 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.009
 as I the recipe to you you have me 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.169
 that respect me because I am 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.910
 used to groping people I 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.280
 I think it's time that you have to 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.410
 respect us and fundamentally what I 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.169
 it hurts I do not know you have a country 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.509
 wonderful having all because 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.699
 has to do to confront people already 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:17.919
 that what I do not understand but when 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.949
 they change things because they do not call themselves 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.930
 consensus is discussed with the parties and 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.630
 go see the possibility to generate the 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.660
 lesser evil 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.330
 is a sexually of I believe that to me 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.670
 I would love that humble people 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.890
 because I so poor people 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.440
 humble usually serves at home and that 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.840
 Live with dignity, do not promise yourself in a 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.170
 thing and then they have no roof there 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.840
 they end they do not have light they do not have water 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:49.100
 he has gas and do not forget how he should live 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.100
 when a normal human being 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:57.389
 but who 1515 insults I understood that 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.389
 you insult Mayor said he told you 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:09.820
 I told him that and he has to respect me 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.710
 well we are live from the neighborhood 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.550
 are the neighbors while we are 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.070
 talking to you 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.919
 we all have a cell phone there that we 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:21.330
 It shows good to the people of your neighborhood 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:23.380
 that are there men young women 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.820
 of the third age we will be 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.930
 talking to them in a few minutes 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:30.190
 to also know what they think 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.430
 surely we are going in line with what 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:35.200
 from which to speak I thank you very much 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:37.270
 the coverage and good to repeat it I do not 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.729
 I have nothing against the humble people 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.030
 but that they put a place of 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:44.500
 privilege where they can live with dignity 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:48.550
 do not use it for the votes only 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.780
 he is afraid of Chinese insecurity and 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.370
 look at insecurity there are no 

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.000
 only in Argentina in all 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.610
 countries 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.150
 unfortunately in Latin America but 

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.150
 to do something 

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:01.239
 good the communication is cut
