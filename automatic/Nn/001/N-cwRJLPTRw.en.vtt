00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
when he came down and he gave me these I

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.340 
when he came down and he gave me these I
thought<00:02:23.120> about<00:02:23.330> testing<00:02:23.660> out<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:24.170> was<00:02:24.319> a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
thought about testing out it was a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.550 
thought about testing out it was a
little<00:02:24.530> light<00:02:24.799> at<00:02:24.980> first<00:02:25.660> tumbles<00:02:26.660> with<00:02:27.470> the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
little light at first tumbles with the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.880 
little light at first tumbles with the
wind<00:02:27.769> so<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:28.519> had<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.000> put<00:02:29.180> like<00:02:29.420> two<00:02:30.350> BB's<00:02:30.680> first
