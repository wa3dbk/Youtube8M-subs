00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello I'll show you today like you one 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.240
 weight watchers just light oneself 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.019
 I can make potatoes like this here 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.320
 cooked with vegetables in my case 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.120
 cauliflower 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.800
 but you can also do anything else 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.380
 Vegetable Nemes is a particularly good fit 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.090
 salted potatoes you just pay attention now 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.039
 the left our pot in the other 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.170
 I'll just stuff the potatoes and both 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.910
 the cauliflower in a small pot 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.580
 give her the butter and wine first 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.689
 let it melt slowly 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.899
 then I could have the milk 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.980
 I measure 250 milliliters 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.980
 taken milk 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.829
 and once the butter has melted 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.780
 Give her a tablespoon of flour to do it now 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.589
 Do not be surprised that fans super fast 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.059
 to pump 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:56.489
 but that would probably just continue 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.839
 then you go for a little sip of 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:05.610
 milk so now this year 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:07.049
 at first she wants to solve lumps 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.970
 You can not be frightened now 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.979
 you see, that really dissolves 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.330
 it has never happened on it 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.460
 afterwards lumped 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.990
 it should always happen 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.590
 again through a fine screen walls 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.330
 to brush 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.190
 you see that clarified chance for me 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.420
 quickly and that's the point on the 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.420
 we just finished last 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.250
 of course that again 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.310
 and then come the rest of the ingredients 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.190
 So I took a bit of vegetables 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.930
 man pure nature and magna is neither 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.600
 yeast extract still flavor enhancer 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.600
 then I cook two laurel leaves 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.360
 with each one taking out and have now 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.670
 another 100 milliliter milk something 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.610
 Water given because it is a 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.229
 previously there was little to tell your head 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:00.369
 pepper not even always fresh with 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.410
 colorful cologne and that are missing for the 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.600
 so exactly 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.399
 I took almost two teaspoons 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.170
 where i do a little bit more that 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.150
 I feel even younger then 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.000
 still done 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.450
 and another tablespoon sauces binder the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.040
 but not necessary 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.920
 makes it easy to feel comes 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.620
 rather implement first and at the end of that 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.080
 the consistency is important and that must be 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.290
 really just a good 20 minutes long 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.910
 simmer gently and reduce and then 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.520
 This can end with the potatoes 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.800
 Serve and so should the whole then 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.840
 really really tasty and points 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.610
 we have it almost tablespoon wise 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.550
 split my husband and me and we 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.260
 then have the points counted as 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.480
 Satisfied, it is also suitable then 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.130
 but you have the ingredients the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.230
 no fatigues are completely normal 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.890
 Calculate the exact information write 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.050
 I'll tell you the infobox someday 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.590
 as a little love as a cult we see each other 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.590
 in the next video
