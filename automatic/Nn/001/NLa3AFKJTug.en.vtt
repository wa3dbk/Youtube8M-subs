hand on his chest on the Japanese toy
it's<00:03:01.719> a<00:03:01.900> chromis<00:03:02.230> gold<00:03:02.469> color<00:03:02.739> but<00:03:03.099> on<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.849> it

it's a chromis gold color but on that it

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.689 
it's a chromis gold color but on that it
might<00:03:04.299> be<00:03:04.419> fingerprint<00:03:04.959> central<00:03:05.459> well<00:03:06.459> what

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:06.699 
might be fingerprint central well what

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.819 
might be fingerprint central well what
I'm<00:03:07.090> not<00:03:07.269> sure<00:03:07.569> or<00:03:07.719> not<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:07.900> don't<00:03:08.139> I've<00:03:08.560> never

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
I'm not sure or not I don't I've never

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.939 
I'm not sure or not I don't I've never
seen<00:03:09.159> a<00:03:09.189> soupçon<00:03:09.669> I'm<00:03:09.969> figuring<00:03:10.599> person<00:03:10.959> and

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:11.949 
seen a soupçon I'm figuring person and

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:13.649 
seen a soupçon I'm figuring person and
another<00:03:12.250> thing<00:03:12.579> is<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:12.879> that<00:03:13.030> on<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.299> zoo<00:03:13.449> bond

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
another thing is is that on the zoo bond

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.979 
another thing is is that on the zoo bond
toy<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.680> when<00:03:14.889> you<00:03:15.069> turn<00:03:15.730> this<00:03:15.879> dial<00:03:16.120> well<00:03:16.689> I

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
toy and when you turn this dial well I

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.780 
toy and when you turn this dial well I
guess<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.739> shouldn't<00:03:17.980> really<00:03:18.040> say<00:03:18.340> dial

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
guess it shouldn't really say dial

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.629 
guess it shouldn't really say dial
well<00:03:19.419> his<00:03:19.719> arms<00:03:20.049> would<00:03:20.169> pop<00:03:20.349> out<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.799> instead

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
well his arms would pop out and instead

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.030 
well his arms would pop out and instead
of<00:03:21.699> just<00:03:21.790> saying<00:03:22.000> well<00:03:22.329> just<00:03:23.139> using<00:03:23.409> the<00:03:23.500> same

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
of just saying well just using the same

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.289 
of just saying well just using the same
noise<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.579> does<00:03:24.730> over<00:03:24.969> and<00:03:25.000> over<00:03:25.209> again

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
noise that it does over and over again

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.610 
noise that it does over and over again
when<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:25.569> press<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.870> button<00:03:25.900> on<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.409> side

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
when you press the button on the side

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.640 
when you press the button on the side
and<00:03:26.889> he<00:03:27.459> would<00:03:27.549> say<00:03:28.180> his<00:03:28.299> name<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.530> know

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
and he would say his name and you know

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.099
