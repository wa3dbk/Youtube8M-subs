00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello everybody, my name is dindi gene and today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.470
 I'll talk to you about the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.240
 princesses 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.150
 was curious to know what I'm going 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.639
 Talk then bonamigo that I'm going to show 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.160
 I recently read the Folha de SÃ£o Paulo 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.300
 on the sheet illustrated with a student of the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.760
 U.S 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.289
 she is organizing on change.org 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.470
 an undersigned 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.470
 requiring disney plus size princesses 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.489
 the last princess of disney to elza them 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.610
 complain that her eye is bigger than 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.550
 the course she has is very thin that 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.680
 she has a course very soon anyway what? 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.430
 I thought I brought this subject to 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.520
 You, because I find this subject. 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.930
 extremely pertinent to disney. 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.240
 closed with our lives in several 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.180
 aspects not only on the issue of the prince 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.410
 enchanted but also in this ideal of 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.840
 perfect beauty of thinness that the 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.220
 disney princesses gets into the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.050
 people head 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.640
 I just do not agree with that 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.590
 I therefore like why 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.120
 You do not have to untangle suiting 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.360
 in spite of how well your hair should be 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.160
 you if what you get has to 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.270
 establish no beauty pattern 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.850
 folks 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.580
 we have to if what we are 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.440
 each with their differences and I also 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.190
 I find it wrong sometimes to put 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.280
 representatives was forced to 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.230
 It sure gets weird sometimes you see 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.990
 rabbit in a parallel with the 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:42.630
 95% of the journalists you journalists 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.940
 can realize that they are white but 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.370
 always end up putting some 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.070
 newspaper the black journalist to say that 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.100
 they are social to say that they 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.870
 embrace diversity stays is one thing 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.980
 forced because if you take all the 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.770
 newspapers 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.690
 Let us think that in the national 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.180
 However the papers so have the greatest 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.970
 Nationwide 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.560
 Do not you see a black man commanding sato? 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.520
 very few are the blacks the fat ones 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.120
 these minorities that are there in 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.680
 evidence then be yourself not 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.470
 wait for disney 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.480
 she set a standard for you 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.910
 does not have 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.310
 is more a joke to and plan 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.090
 no words, I do not see 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.150
 need to get on well with yourself 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.660
 embrace bigger causes there is hunger 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.310
 The world also has world wars and 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.890
 80 of the most interesting things to 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.870
 we bothered to stay if 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.320
 worrying about princess by oscips 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.790
 aicep at disney ok I think we 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.890
 You have to do what we have to do. 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.380
 make my opinion if the most in 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.910
 first and if you accept and do not want to 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.890
 that the other day 6 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.390
 you have to always be the first the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.760
 another accept you 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.670
 will be a consequence and sometimes the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.540
 another will accept you by putting it will not 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.790
 be even if you love yourself and 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.990
 sometimes the other had evil will not have 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.290
 relevant 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.180
 okay so that's what I think brought 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.550
 reflection that I find this subject very 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.550
 interesting subject that also 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.560
 I hope you have enjoyed it and 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.209
 liked to see who I liked for me here 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.270
 down do not forget that boy 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.150
 and just signing up is just 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.580
 pile and you know sad excellence 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.690

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.489
