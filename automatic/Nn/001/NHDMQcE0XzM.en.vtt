a very long time and it's finally ready
alright<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.160> before<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:20.640> get<00:00:20.760> into<00:00:21.000> that

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
alright but before we get into that

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.029 
alright but before we get into that

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
let's go ahead and talk about the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.450 
let's go ahead and talk about the
subject<00:00:23.340> at<00:00:23.820> hand

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
subject at hand

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.849 
subject at hand
torso<00:00:26.460> dominant<00:00:27.199> versus<00:00:28.199> limb<00:00:28.590> dominant<00:00:29.189> I

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
torso dominant versus limb dominant I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.340 
torso dominant versus limb dominant I
suffer<00:00:31.859> from<00:00:32.130> being<00:00:32.600> torso<00:00:33.600> dominant<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
suffer from being torso dominant and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.600 
suffer from being torso dominant and
I'll<00:00:35.340> explain<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> difference<00:00:36.180> between<00:00:36.600> each

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
I'll explain the difference between each

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.840 
I'll explain the difference between each
some<00:00:38.610> people<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> big<00:00:40.440> chest<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.730> they're

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
some people have a big chest and they're

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.060 
some people have a big chest and they're
able<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.239> really<00:00:42.570> contract<00:00:43.230> their<00:00:43.500> chest<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
able to really contract their chest and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.709 
able to really contract their chest and
their<00:00:44.280> back<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.789> their<00:00:45.360> torso<00:00:46.110> will<00:00:46.739> grow<00:00:47.129> um

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
their back and their torso will grow um

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.750 
their back and their torso will grow um
but<00:00:48.719> their<00:00:49.230> arms<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:50.039> kind<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.489> lagging

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
but their arms are kind of lagging

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.709 
but their arms are kind of lagging
behind

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
behind

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
behind
so<00:00:52.260> you'll<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.739> somebody<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.370> myself<00:00:53.579> for

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so you'll see somebody like myself for

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.959 
so you'll see somebody like myself for
example<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> bigger<00:00:55.379> chest<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.039> bigger<00:00:56.640> back

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
example was a bigger chest a bigger back

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.229 
example was a bigger chest a bigger back
but<00:00:57.600> smaller<00:00:58.050> arms<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.609> then<00:00:59.820> there's<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
but smaller arms and then there's the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.000 
but smaller arms and then there's the
people<00:01:00.390> who<00:01:00.539> are<00:01:00.750> limb<00:01:00.989> dominant<00:01:01.559> which<00:01:01.680> most

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
people who are limb dominant which most

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.690 
people who are limb dominant which most
people<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.989> pretty<00:01:03.989> much<00:01:04.199> envied<00:01:04.710> these<00:01:05.400> guys

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
people are pretty much envied these guys

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.550 
people are pretty much envied these guys
um<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:07.310> can't<00:01:08.310> say<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.689> well<00:01:10.200> but

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
um I can't say that I do as well but

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.609 
um I can't say that I do as well but
there<00:01:11.549> are<00:01:11.760> those<00:01:12.000> guys<00:01:12.270> who<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.290> can't

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
there are those guys who just can't

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.280 
there are those guys who just can't
build<00:01:13.920> their<00:01:14.130> chest<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.640> their<00:01:14.820> back<00:01:15.000> um<00:01:15.299> but

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
build their chest or their back um but

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.560 
build their chest or their back um but
for<00:01:16.470> some<00:01:16.710> reason<00:01:17.220> they've<00:01:17.430> got<00:01:17.640> massive<00:01:18.210> arms

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
for some reason they've got massive arms

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.350 
for some reason they've got massive arms
now<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.780> difference<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
now the difference is is that if you

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.390 
now the difference is is that if you
take<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> guy<00:01:21.869> whose<00:01:22.170> torso<00:01:22.710> dominant<00:01:23.220> he

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
take a guy whose torso dominant he

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.160 
take a guy whose torso dominant he
typically<00:01:23.880> looks<00:01:24.210> better<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:24.720> his<00:01:24.869> shirt

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
typically looks better with his shirt

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.310 
typically looks better with his shirt
off<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.490> take<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.790> guy<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.720> limb

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
off and if you take a guy that is limb

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
off and if you take a guy that is limb
dominant<00:01:28.890> he<00:01:29.100> typically<00:01:29.610> looks<00:01:29.939> better<00:01:30.150> in

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
dominant he typically looks better in

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240 
dominant he typically looks better in
clothes<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:31.140> he<00:01:31.259> looks<00:01:31.470> jacked<00:01:31.829> because

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
clothes because he looks jacked because

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.580 
clothes because he looks jacked because
his<00:01:32.400> arms<00:01:32.759> are<00:01:32.880> big<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.579> why<00:01:35.579> does<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.909> happen

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
his arms are big so why does this happen

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.140 
his arms are big so why does this happen
there's<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.770> number<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.280> reasons<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.880> this

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
there's a number of reasons that this

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.289 
there's a number of reasons that this
happens<00:01:39.630> number<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.290> genetics<00:01:41.220> some<00:01:41.909> people

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
happens number one genetics some people

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.780 
happens number one genetics some people
have<00:01:42.630> genetically<00:01:43.229> larger<00:01:43.860> arms<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.460> smaller

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
have genetically larger arms and smaller

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.230 
have genetically larger arms and smaller
chest<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.390> vice-versa

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
chest and vice-versa

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.469 
chest and vice-versa
now<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.960> thing<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.479> order

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
now one thing that you can do in order

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.609 
now one thing that you can do in order
to<00:01:51.689> correct<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.850> let's<00:01:53.850> say<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.329> example

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
to correct this let's say for example

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.469 
to correct this let's say for example
you<00:01:55.619> suffer<00:01:56.070> from<00:01:56.250> being<00:01:56.460> torso<00:01:57.030> dominant

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
you suffer from being torso dominant

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.920 
you suffer from being torso dominant
like<00:01:57.719> myself<00:01:58.070> what<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> want<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.719> want

like myself what I want to do is I want
to<00:02:00.990> start<00:02:01.140> training<00:02:01.619> my<00:02:01.770> arms<00:02:02.310> twice<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> week

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
to start training my arms twice a week

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.500

once<00:02:04.710> at<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.460> very<00:02:05.490> beginning

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
once at the very beginning

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.720 
once at the very beginning
and<00:02:06.600> once<00:02:07.020> at<00:02:07.230> the<00:02:07.320> very<00:02:07.560> end<00:02:07.800> so<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.310> example

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:08.730 
and once at the very end so for example
