fold with the white side up yeah fold it
in<00:00:41.430> half<00:00:41.489> doesn't<00:00:42.480> matter<00:00:42.570> which<00:00:42.750> way<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:44.340> it's

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
in half doesn't matter which way so it's

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.119 
in half doesn't matter which way so it's
like<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:45.829> then<00:00:46.829> open<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> fold<00:00:48.899> it

like this then open it up and fold it

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.500 
like this then open it up and fold it
this<00:00:50.129> way<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.149> with<00:00:54.420> the

this way so it's like this with the
crease<00:00:54.780> through<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> middle<00:00:55.379> then<00:00:56.370> you're

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
crease through the middle then you're

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.209 
crease through the middle then you're
going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> open<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.980> going<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
going to open it up it's going on the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.340 
going to open it up it's going on the
finest<00:00:59.489> got<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> tee<00:01:00.079> then<00:01:01.079> you're<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
finest got a tee then you're going to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.979 
finest got a tee then you're going to
fold<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:02.129> point<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> into<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> center

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
fold this point to the into the center

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
fold this point to the into the center
in<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.290> point<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
in this point to this and it's going to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.590 
in this point to this and it's going to
look<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:08.090> something<00:01:09.290> like<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:11.600> now

look a little something like this now

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.880 
look a little something like this now
here's<00:01:12.869> where<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> folding<00:01:13.409> part<00:01:13.439> gets<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
here's where the folding part gets a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.550 
here's where the folding part gets a
little<00:01:14.010> tricky<00:01:14.540> you're<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.869> want<00:01:16.020> this

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
little tricky you're going to want this

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.660 
little tricky you're going to want this
corner<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.640> corner<00:01:19.189> center<00:01:20.189> your<00:01:20.430> part

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
corner this corner center your part

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.010 
corner this corner center your part
thing<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.170> corner<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.790> now<00:01:24.659> let's<00:01:24.869> take

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
thing to this corner so now let's take

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.550 
thing to this corner so now let's take
it<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.610> bleep<00:01:27.090> across<00:01:27.840> its<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> fold

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it and bleep across its going to fold

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.770 
it and bleep across its going to fold
pretty<00:01:29.159> much<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> entire<00:01:29.490> piece<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.570> bring

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
pretty much the entire piece and bring

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.710 
pretty much the entire piece and bring
it<00:01:30.840> across<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:32.360> this<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.479> what's<00:01:33.630> going

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
it across like that this is what's going

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.999 
it across like that this is what's going
to<00:01:33.780> look<00:01:33.960> something<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.680> don't<00:01:34.829> want<00:01:34.950> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
to look something like you don't want to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.670 
to look something like you don't want to
fold<00:01:35.189> down<00:01:35.400> here<00:01:35.640> exactly<00:01:36.320> but<00:01:37.320> you're<00:01:37.560> going

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
fold down here exactly but you're going

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.170 
fold down here exactly but you're going
to<00:01:37.740> fold<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> look

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
to fold like that it's going to look

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
to fold like that it's going to look
like<00:01:39.210> something<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.170> you're<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.189> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
like something like that you're going to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.760 
like something like that you're going to
fold<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> middle<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.140> want<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
fold do the middle there then I want to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.580 
fold do the middle there then I want to
unfold<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.930> same<00:01:46.140> thing<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
unfold that do the same thing to the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.929 
unfold that do the same thing to the
other<00:01:46.619> side<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.380> it'll<00:01:49.590> look<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:50.220> little

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
other side so it'll look a little

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.510 
other side so it'll look a little
something<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:52.189> it's<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.460> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
something like that it's going to have a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.510 
something like that it's going to have a
place<00:01:53.909> there<00:01:53.939> then<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.920> open<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.399> up<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
place there then you can open it up and

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.670 
place there then you can open it up and
got<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> line<00:01:57.000> here<00:01:57.270> line<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.439> line

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
got a line here line here and a line

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.750 
got a line here line here and a line
there<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.420> you're<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> do

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.620 

then<00:02:04.760> fold<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:05.720> one<00:02:05.930> back<00:02:06.050> again<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:08.000> there's

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
then fold this one back again so there's

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.050 
then fold this one back again so there's
a<00:02:08.660> little<00:02:08.720> opening<00:02:09.050> there<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.619> can<00:02:10.060> hold

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
a little opening there you can hold

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.570 
a little opening there you can hold
backwards<00:02:11.750> on<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.500> center<00:02:12.740> line<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.310> center

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
backwards on the center line the center

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.350 
backwards on the center line the center
line<00:02:13.700> even<00:02:13.820> fold<00:02:14.120> backwards<00:02:14.540> on<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:17.240> it's

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
line even fold backwards on so it's

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.570 
line even fold backwards on so it's
going<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.540> look<00:02:17.600> something<00:02:17.690> like<00:02:17.930> that
