00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
this is a classic game that I think

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.890 
this is a classic game that I think
first<00:00:36.410> came<00:00:36.680> out<00:00:36.830> for<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.190> Atari<00:00:37.610> 2600<00:00:38.210> it<00:00:38.750> was

first came out for the Atari 2600 it was

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:56.340 
first came out for the Atari 2600 it was
an<00:00:39.680> extremely<00:00:40.100> popular<00:00:40.250> game<00:00:41.650> by<00:00:42.650> Activision

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.590 

in<00:00:57.350> this<00:00:57.589> game<00:00:57.860> you<00:00:58.040> have<00:00:58.250> 20<00:00:58.909> minutes<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.360> find

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
in this game you have 20 minutes to find

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.890 
in this game you have 20 minutes to find
a<00:01:00.070> certain<00:01:01.070> amount<00:01:01.640> of<00:01:01.930> treasures<00:01:02.930> I<00:01:04.900> don't

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
a certain amount of treasures I don't

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.090 
a certain amount of treasures I don't
remember<00:01:06.140> how<00:01:06.440> many<00:01:06.470> there<00:01:06.799> are

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.000 

and<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.340> can<00:01:10.810> go<00:01:11.810> above<00:01:12.080> ground<00:01:12.140> or<00:01:12.710> below

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
and you can go above ground or below

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.219 
and you can go above ground or below
ground<00:01:13.460> but<00:01:13.729> blow<00:01:13.939> ground<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.450> sometimes<00:01:15.080> hit

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
ground but blow ground you sometimes hit

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.080 
ground but blow ground you sometimes hit
these<00:01:15.380> walls<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.010> you<00:01:16.040> eventually<00:01:16.880> have<00:01:17.060> to

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
these walls so you eventually have to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.649 
these walls so you eventually have to
come<00:01:17.210> above<00:01:17.689> ground<00:01:17.750> sometimes<00:01:19.510> when<00:01:20.510> you've

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
come above ground sometimes when you've

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.020 
come above ground sometimes when you've
got<00:01:20.920> various<00:01:21.920> obstacles<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.580> have<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.850> avoid

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
got various obstacles you have to avoid

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.200 
got various obstacles you have to avoid
you<00:01:23.299> have<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:24.039> jump<00:01:25.039> over<00:01:25.159> alligators<00:01:25.909> and

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
you have to jump over alligators and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.080 
you have to jump over alligators and
snakes<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:26.990> I<00:01:27.320> guess<00:01:28.009> they're<00:01:28.219> tar<00:01:28.460> pits<00:01:28.820> and

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
snakes and I guess they're tar pits and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:53.800 
snakes and I guess they're tar pits and
scorpions<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:31.539> various<00:01:32.539> objects

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.970 

I've<00:01:54.810> never<00:01:55.050> really<00:01:55.260> been<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.620> that<00:01:55.770> good<00:01:55.950> at

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
I've never really been all that good at

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.420 
I've never really been all that good at
this<00:01:56.220> game<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:57.560> never<00:01:58.560> seem<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.510> be<00:02:00.510> able<00:02:00.630> to

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
this game I never seem to be able to

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.950 
this game I never seem to be able to
actually<00:02:02.430> climb<00:02:02.910> down<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.330> hole<00:02:03.480> I<00:02:03.540> would

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
actually climb down in a hole I would

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.850 
actually climb down in a hole I would
just<00:02:04.140> fall<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
just fall with it

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:45.610 
just fall with it
and<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.130> can't<00:02:05.370> stop<00:02:05.670> once<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.120> start<00:02:06.360> following

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.089 

now<00:02:46.620> if<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:47.360> run<00:02:48.360> into<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.780> logs<00:02:48.989> or<00:02:49.410> some<00:02:50.010> of

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
now if you run into the logs or some of

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.320 
now if you run into the logs or some of
the<00:02:50.160> other<00:02:50.280> obstacles<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.090> won't

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
the other obstacles that won't

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.350 
the other obstacles that won't
necessarily<00:02:51.510> kill<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:53.730> they'll<00:02:53.940> take

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
necessarily kill you but they'll take

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.330 
necessarily kill you but they'll take
some<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.690> your<00:02:54.780> time<00:02:55.050> away<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:55.980> think<00:02:56.220> they

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
some of your time away and I think they

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:41.089 
some of your time away and I think they
take<00:02:56.520> some<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.760> your<00:02:56.790> points<00:02:57.150> away<00:02:57.360> too<00:03:40.099> now

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
take some of your points away too now

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.910 
take some of your points away too now

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.430 
graphically
this<00:03:43.550> game<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.940> me<00:03:44.090> looks<00:03:44.360> about<00:03:45.050> like<00:03:45.290> the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
this game to me looks about like the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.370 
this game to me looks about like the
2600<00:03:46.160> version<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:47.209> may<00:03:47.810> be<00:03:47.870> it's<00:03:48.110> slightly

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
2600 version this may be it's slightly

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.830 
2600 version this may be it's slightly
better<00:03:48.819> but<00:03:49.819> it<00:03:49.880> seems<00:03:50.060> like<00:03:50.209> Activision

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
better but it seems like Activision

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.830 
better but it seems like Activision
games<00:03:51.080> all<00:03:51.380> look<00:03:51.760> almost<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.060> same<00:03:53.300> on<00:03:53.599> no

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
games all look almost the same on no

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:50.090 
games all look almost the same on no
matter<00:03:53.989> what<00:03:54.110> platform<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:54.739> play<00:03:54.890> hard

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.969 

this<00:04:51.100> is<00:04:51.280> probably<00:04:51.729> get<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.210> game<00:04:52.419> that<00:04:52.720> made

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
this is probably get the game that made

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.520 
this is probably get the game that made
Activision<00:04:53.979> things<00:04:54.840> they<00:04:55.840> don't<00:04:55.990> know<00:04:56.199> if<00:04:56.380> I

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
Activision things they don't know if I

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.770 
Activision things they don't know if I
had<00:04:56.680> heard<00:04:56.860> of<00:04:56.919> Activision<00:04:57.370> before<00:04:57.790> pitfall

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.000 

but<00:05:01.780> I<00:05:01.810> know<00:05:01.930> some<00:05:02.229> of<00:05:02.260> my<00:05:02.350> friends<00:05:02.770> had<00:05:02.860> had

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.170 
but I know some of my friends had had
2600<00:05:03.850> this<00:05:04.000> was<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:05.139> game<00:05:05.350> that<00:05:05.590> they<00:05:05.710> all

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
2600 this was the game that they all

00:05:06.180 --> 00:06:15.130 
2600 this was the game that they all
were<00:05:07.180> excited<00:05:07.660> about<00:05:07.870> and<00:05:08.080> God
