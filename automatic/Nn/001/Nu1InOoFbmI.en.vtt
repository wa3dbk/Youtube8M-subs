to run out of my control during a game
and<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:20.260> what<00:03:20.440> separates<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.280> top<00:03:21.610> elite

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
and this is what separates the top elite

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.900 
and this is what separates the top elite
athletes<00:03:22.840> from<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.350> amateurs<00:03:24.069> you<00:03:24.610> see<00:03:24.760> the

athletes from the amateurs you see the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.240 
athletes from the amateurs you see the
elite<00:03:25.180> athletes<00:03:25.600> they<00:03:25.900> mentally<00:03:26.470> train<00:03:26.980> in

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
elite athletes they mentally train in

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.280 
elite athletes they mentally train in
advance<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:27.910> conditioned<00:03:28.630> their<00:03:28.780> minds<00:03:28.959> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
advance and conditioned their minds to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.470 
advance and conditioned their minds to
stay<00:03:29.590> focus<00:03:30.100> in<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.340> present<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:31.299> then

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
stay focus in the present so then

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.920 
stay focus in the present so then
nothing<00:03:32.140> rattles<00:03:32.380> them<00:03:32.739> come<00:03:33.010> game<00:03:33.280> time

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
nothing rattles them come game time

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.539 
nothing rattles them come game time
just<00:03:34.930> like<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.380> practice<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.160> drill<00:03:36.400> the
