00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.890
 Welcome to the Sony Playstation 4 in the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hands-on this time also what the menu 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.529
 We've already got it from the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.790
 Names shown and we can see 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.200
 are currently in play paint in there but 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.309
 you can always get out of any game 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.110
 just by putting it on the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.759
 dualshock controller playstation head 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.770
 just as much as the case does 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.420
 already is with the xbox of for example 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.830
 at the last playstation we will then 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.539
 this beautiful menu comes where you 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.800
 Of course pre-installed games here in 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.170
 We can have a list with you 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.680
 debug console there is of course some 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.599
 games 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.970
 so to speak as demo we pre-installed 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.830
 on the far left, for example, that too 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.719
 wars only means you can also facebook 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.370
 and more stuff sign up and 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.210
 then check where your friends 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.290
 so we do not have any 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.940
 Internet connection that is it will 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.079
 not work when we came to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.969
 go right through the whole 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.340
 play through see you at home in the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.250
 library there you can play the games again 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.239
 you also look at the playstation 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.129
 store in there and of course 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.629
 Internet browser is also available with 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.850
 We then talk about the smartphone too 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.739
 Example keyboard or tablet 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.260
 Keyboard can also enter things 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.480
 if we go up then we have one 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.800
 more menu so if not more 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.290
 this menu was what we had before 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.610
 but a two-step just into the gate 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.070
 but can go as can be said 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.659
 internet justifications to 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.220
 For example, here we see what we are for 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.970
 have installed with such beautiful game 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.500
 name then once again a French 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.020
 possibility online also in the playstation 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.130
 network friends cordially invite 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.509
 find and serve to play 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.070
 I can do it then 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.790
 according to the exchange about party 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.200
 also with sound or video per case can 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.939
 you of course create a profile 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.500
 trophies 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.909
 you already know that from other older ones 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.450
 you can sometimes use generation settings 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.680
 go in 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.729
 there is a lot, however, how to 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 For example, the user guide can be used 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.990
 Of course , look here 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.070
 safety and health not really right now 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.509
 playstation next watch 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.979
 Of course, log in and fish logins 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.360
 but not so exciting 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.180
 the mens teams may take care of everything 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.350
 just go in and see what parents 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.409
 we can hire for your children 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.820
 it works exactly for example 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.560
 We can only offer certain programs 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.409
 to allow load inter browser 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.569
 to exhibit completely 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.569
 you can of course adjust and adjust 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.189
 You can stop certain users certain 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.170
 things so to speak allow as you do 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.090
 can create several users and they can 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.260
 just different things on the console 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.940
 but you always have to 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.150
 unsubscribe from it then of course 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.860
 also works when we go back 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.239
 then you see everything else is not 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.160
 too exciting at the network wlan 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.440
 adjust sound screen and so on 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.150
 the interesting way still the ps vita 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.830
 maybe or the playstation app 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.840
 exactly where we are right now where you are 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.069
 Simply by smartphone or tablet 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.079
 can connect here and then as I said 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.610
 for example, the browser then easier 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.849
 can use the keyboard or too 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.590
 to play a touchscreen on the 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.329
 sometimes I also have the buttons 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.370
 can use exactly the same ps vita over 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.870
 wlan you can play remotely very much 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.940
 nice so you can bid on everything 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.290
 Play what is playable on the ps4 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.480
 because the control design is yes 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.220
 exactly the same and yes next 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.510
 see set we can actually 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.040
 not too exciting the bank is there 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.090
 of course in the retail so official 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.380
 version elements no longer so and yes 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.849
 turn off the camera on the far right and it 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.160
 was not here even with the short one 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.720
 Presentation of the new playstation minis 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.040
 now just a game like 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.180
 shadowrun then you will see here and 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.739
 if we asked of course if the last one 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.630
 want to turn game and then loads as well 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.690
 already the game and then we are too 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.069
 right back in the game was here 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.780
 Of course it looks very nice 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.130
 detailed and you see 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.079
 You really do not really have to wait long 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.280
 waiting to immediately start to play 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.440
 until next time opinion maker 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.200
 steel and that was the idea of ​​the 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.790
 ps4 console in a short overview one 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.049
 Of course we will both be together for a long time 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.319
 with the finished but also quite 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.319
 finished
