00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.389 

some<00:00:32.520> ways<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.270> insects<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.680> survive

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
some ways that insects can survive

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.220 
some ways that insects can survive
winter<00:00:35.969> they<00:00:36.960> could<00:00:37.410> migrate<00:00:38.300> which<00:00:39.300> mostly

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
winter they could migrate which mostly

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.940 
winter they could migrate which mostly
flying<00:00:40.590> insects<00:00:40.980> including<00:00:41.460> butterflies<00:00:42.950> go

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
flying insects including butterflies go

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.510 
flying insects including butterflies go
to<00:00:44.010> warmer<00:00:44.370> climates<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.320> know

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
to warmer climates like you know

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:59.240 
to warmer climates like you know
Southern<00:00:48.469> places<00:00:49.469> where<00:00:57.890> they'll<00:00:58.890> stick<00:00:59.219> with

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
Southern places where they'll stick with

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:35.210 
Southern places where they'll stick with
their<00:00:59.609> colonies<00:01:33.530> basically<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.860> freeze

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
their colonies basically not freeze

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.830 
their colonies basically not freeze
tolerate<00:01:35.909> much<00:01:36.090> colder<00:01:36.509> temperatures<00:01:38.840> what

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
tolerate much colder temperatures what

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.130 
tolerate much colder temperatures what
away<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.939> hibernation<00:01:41.939> which<00:01:42.659> could<00:01:43.020> be

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
away this is hibernation which could be

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.889 
away this is hibernation which could be
short<00:01:43.439> term<00:01:43.649> which<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.399> turn<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.299> into

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
short term which is not turn and into

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.170 
short term which is not turn and into
our<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.920> basically<00:01:47.130> stay<00:01:47.700> frozen

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
our for you basically stay frozen

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.060 
our for you basically stay frozen
overnight<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.229> become<00:01:49.500> active<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
overnight and become active in the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.359 
overnight and become active in the
daytime<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:52.020> long<00:01:52.229> term<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.710> die<00:01:53.040> pods

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
daytime and the long term is die pods

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.840 
daytime and the long term is die pods
and<00:01:54.049> if<00:01:55.049> diapause<00:01:55.560> basically<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.520> find<00:01:56.759> a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and if diapause basically you find a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.389 
and if diapause basically you find a
cavity<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.360> something<00:01:57.810> some<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.100> tree<00:01:59.280> or

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
cavity or something some in the tree or

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.749 
cavity or something some in the tree or
something

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
something

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.569 
something
and<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.600> lay<00:02:00.899> its<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.979> know<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.430> hibernate

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
and just lay its you know just hibernate

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.170 
and just lay its you know just hibernate
the<00:02:02.939> entire<00:02:03.299> winter<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.909> those<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:06.060> all

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the entire winter and those are all

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.479 
the entire winter and those are all
really<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.750> most<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.229> way<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.979> intact

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
really it most of the way is that intact

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.960 
really it most of the way is that intact
