00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.910
 will hello to all we meet to 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.680
 a special video to celebrate 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.450
 fittingly the birthday of king louis 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.590
 so we end up on a map that 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.960
 I did a while ago when 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.670
 I started minecraft on stonehenge 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.950
 that's why it amused me a lot 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.500
 to see the first episode of king louis 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.170
 on the architectured in minecraft this is 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.070
 it's a construction so put 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.340
 allow the block almost sure about the state of the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.520
 the structure today 1 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.100
 we see everything around small brands 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.820
 which indicates the location of the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.809
 old stones that have 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.420
 gone today 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.550
 and then all around there we can see the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.780
 famous hedge so-called edge 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:14.930
 it's the slope with the small moat 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.130
 around there the sun soon soon will be 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.200
 sunset west an art one is at 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.009
 north there are two accesses in the hedge 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.520
 an honor one south down there and then 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.100
 the famous north-north-east road to the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.119
 the structures that are still here 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.800
 so that was it stonehenge and I 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.690
 you find on another map that 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.000
 I wanted to show you 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.190
 for the birthday of king louis a 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.120
 card that me personally holds me 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.350
 a lot to heart 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.650
 we'll be careful we're gone and we're 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.040
 so found at the level of egypt on 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.500
 the plateau of guizeh it is this one of 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.110
 most beautiful constructions that we can 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.660
 find in the world I find with both 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.000
 great pyramids that of here the one of 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.690
 kheops here that of khephren is a little 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.340
 further over here if it goes well 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.540
 load that of miki rhinos so there we 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.310
 is on a map 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.920
 exceptionally a stonehenge effect 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.970
 everything to the scale to the nearest meter 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.810
 exceptionally the view the size of 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.830
 building one is safe to thirds one 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.690
 is one third of the size 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.570
 because here we have a big pyramid 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.450
 who is at the base had to do 146 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.280
 meters high keops so here I am them 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.770
 do three doors of the little everything is 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.320
 three times smaller and if I land 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.400
 you'll see we're already it's already 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.870
 pretty impressive who opt kephren 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.180
 really I visited it myself what 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.980
 ready I do not live in countries because 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.920
 that there were a lot of people and 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.570
 kephren I was alone 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.150
 I was all alone in the carmi it's 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.620
 really a 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.650
 a really extraordinary feeling 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.450
 so here we have the sphinx that 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.510
 was carved into a small cliff 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.060
 which is a little bit behind 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.459
 see and of course the sphinx we see well 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.769
 the difference in texture between the head 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.680
 because certainly been carved a little more 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.410
 late at the time of the parents and then the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.260
 lion in himself who is in you that the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.720
 borer a lot more of the road is 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.700
 much older and so if we get 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.620
 find here pretty cool there we see 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.180
 the three the own terms hits that 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.180
 have been loaded 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.609
 yet I am extreme in view of 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.469
 chunk normally happily the 1.8 goes 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:42.719
 settle all that is what I like 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.969
 in this construction really it's 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:47.579
 the little story behind it 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:51.019
 the pyramids of khephren khephren actually 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.519
 kephren was the son of kheops 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.730
 today it's his pyramid that has the 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.299
 bigger it must exceed at least 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.769
 of five meters I believe and opts 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.780
 today is 138 meters high 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.840
 because so many stones have been 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.879
 withdrawn actually it's not at all 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.799
 time that damaged the pyramids 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.389
 before she was really all smooth 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.720
 but we have in minecraft is complicated 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:19.130
 to do that especially with the Anglo truck 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.260
 after 52 want so it's not the 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.010
 This is not the time that has 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.560
 deteriorated the pyramids it's simply 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.660
 down the men who for power 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.020
 build other buildings lÃ©zan 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.660
 cabinet there is only kephren and whose 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.310
 High whose taste is still intact 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.980
 that's why today she 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.120
 exceeds that of kheops so puts the 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.890
 little story that is really 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.780
 friendly who touched me a little 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.850
 that I wanted to share with you it's 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:53.490
 that who are braking being the son of p offs 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:56.130
 he has he wanted his pyramid for a 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.570
 once raffarin who had less ego he 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.240
 wanted his pyramid to be smaller 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.160
 than that of his father out of respect and 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.560
 so basically at the building she 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.530
 was 143 meters high that take 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.020
 while that of kheops was 146 m 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.120
 what is the time of the blow with time 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.340
 and then the fact that it has one of khufu 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.890
 completely lost its coating to 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.090
 cause of men 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.770
 so now it's kephren who is 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.080
 the biggest but it was not planned 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.270
 like that and I found this story 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.840
 really really very touching 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.630
 very pretty of a son by respect for 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.460
 his father who has decided to do that 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.810
 his pyramid a people who found that 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.160
 cute 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.350
 so that's all that was for 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.370
 wish a happy birthday to roy 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:44.780
 louis so we do not want you ashamed 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:48.380
 wish him a happy birthday 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.380
 go hi to all
