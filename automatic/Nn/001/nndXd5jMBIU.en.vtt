00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.890
 in life and this video I'm going to do it 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.480
 on my new channel because he wants 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.370
 inaugurate does it in a gameplay not 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.870
 but a new but of this 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.309
 game to do something other than what 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.140
 soil usually doing in the channel 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.150
 principal and the truth that took months 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.130
 without playing and for me this is on the top 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.650
 5 on the top 10 of the best 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.840
 compound played in my life was going to do 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.980
 like the cousin in the count title 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.870
 versus 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.060
 com 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.230
 of all life because not you with advance 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.490
 advance of what it does is that I 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.170
 unlock all the skills without 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.820
 need for nothing and good for now no 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.130
 I know what not to fall into this channel exactly 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.080
 about dragon ball or whatever but it's 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.440
 mainly but now it's going to be a 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.830
 first character you have to see something 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.250
 different I think I come is as I have 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.989
 said I could flip good and good 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.430
 guys for now what I 'm going to do in 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.680
 this channel as I said I will dedicate 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.800
 the most to the anime and this music finished 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.380
 and we are going to fight in archipelago already in 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.509
 a plain as a little thing surely 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.820
 during this weekend a video goes up 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.290
 concerning the film Naruto the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.520
 new one that came out so he 's attentive to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.759
 the little ones that are subscribed to 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.759
 channel 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.729
 and surely this video will not 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.410
 many people since in the channel 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.300
 I do not know about many people and I have not 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.710
 explained on my main channel with a 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.330
 video surely when you watch this video 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.760
 the next day involve the principal to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.380
 a reference video on youtube to the boy 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.690
 my mother or call the cultural mix 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.070
 that takes months without stopping by the way 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.360
 if I 'm asking that I'm more 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.710
 creating whatever 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.980
 and I think it's not at a level of 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.280
 easy difficulty so there are two super 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.280
 saiyan 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.110
 commanding the team did not control it very 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.110
 well at the time of playing this game 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.450
 epic battle 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.110
 that is taking this is the technique 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.090
 from the burka and 3 I remember 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.820
 right at the beginning you do not the Swiss law 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.520
 ostias thing more beautiful no but the new 7 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.560
 it is very heavy at least and it was 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.600
 very heavy indeed I have thrown all the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.330
 health in our brand today improved 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.890
 attacking very nice and simple and was at 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.510
 final it was very heavy for me to state 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.420
 heavy and in the end what I was doing was 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.550
 get away from the enemy to wait for it 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.690
 determine that power or his person his 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.020
 person does not have cold peak 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.020
 for example 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.760
 is carrying 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.200
 all the skills 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.930
 transforming with the blocking power of 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.269
 one much more chungo wing this area 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.129
 although for me the video with mode ends 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.129
 super normal saiyan that I like a lot 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.620
 bringas tries to kill him when he has left 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.140
 little life with the definitive so that 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.150
 we see great a lot and the video 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.349
 there is a little thing that puts a problem with 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.349
 because I liked it much more 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.460
 we use the technique 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.520
 boorstin and not for example that is one of 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.890
 local team like this one but a lot more 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.410
 simple is much better the point of 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.630
 view that in the theme of gameplay is worth 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.220
 move this fight and that is because I 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.860
 I explain why the combos you have 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.480
 they are much more faithful to the series than the 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.480
 pure pp for example 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.470
 the world for example like this this fucking 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.120
 Piper gathers them will be all very very 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.120
 very much like hundreds of games 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.830
 strong 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.630
 so I think that looks good 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.340
 implies you'll see that I've been five minutes 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.050
 like to take battles like that the truth with 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.180
 all life lasts a little longer for 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.720
 part of not playing in plan to do 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.720
 combos 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.460
 as well as with a gates funnel gameplay 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.480
 and good with this video we are going to inaugurate 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.220
 the section 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:57.860
 thin video with ball in the new channel 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.990
 that you are watching this video a few days 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.820
 then it's because I made a video in 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.530
 my main channel on this channel and 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.970
 this and this video because it is here that no 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.830
 look at us the main channel but of 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.810
 this will be in the secondary channel well 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.190
 explained everything for now is still without 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.320
 solve the youtube themes but 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.700
 well what are I going to do the other guys already 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.170
 I do not know anything to see if along this 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.180
 week that looks like I doubt it I think that 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.070
 until January they will not say anything to me 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.320
 solves the little things and nothing the more 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.120
 man but he had liked this video the 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.600
 truth is pretty good very good to 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.600
 my point of view
