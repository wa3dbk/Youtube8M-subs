using a Z a Shimano z m6 40 rear Mac
that<00:01:22.180> was<00:01:22.210> that's<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.900> course<00:01:23.140> 10<00:01:23.799> speed<00:01:24.100> now

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
that was that's of course 10 speed now

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.999 
that was that's of course 10 speed now
the<00:01:25.119> reason<00:01:25.390> why<00:01:25.479> it's<00:01:25.630> fairly<00:01:25.810> easy<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.229> do<00:01:26.560> 1

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
the reason why it's fairly easy to do 1

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.890 
the reason why it's fairly easy to do 1
by<00:01:27.159> 10<00:01:27.340> transformation<00:01:27.970> from<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.210> 3<00:01:28.390> by<00:01:28.540> 10<00:01:28.600> is

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
by 10 transformation from a 3 by 10 is

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.840 
by 10 transformation from a 3 by 10 is
because<00:01:29.619> if<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:29.830> think<00:01:30.040> about<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.369> spacing

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
because if you think about the spacing

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.170 
because if you think about the spacing
of<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.060> chain<00:01:31.720> rings<00:01:31.930> here<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.130> 1st<00:01:33.430> 2nd

newly bought Alaska 152 millimeter crank
set<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:51.240> 1<00:04:51.450> by<00:04:51.630> 10<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:52.190> I<00:04:53.190> guess<00:04:53.460> that<00:04:53.490> would

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
set to a 1 by 10 and I guess that would

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.880 
set to a 1 by 10 and I guess that would
be<00:04:53.880> part<00:04:54.240> two<00:04:54.450> of<00:04:54.480> my<00:04:54.720> video<00:04:54.990> hope<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.800> found
