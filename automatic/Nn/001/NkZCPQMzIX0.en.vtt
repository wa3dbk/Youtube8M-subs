banners<00:01:35.330> take<00:01:36.290> into<00:01:36.590> consideration<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.610> web

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
banners take into consideration that web

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.970 
banners take into consideration that web
traffic<00:01:38.180> is<00:01:38.510> very<00:01:38.570> difficult<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.350> predict<00:01:39.740> and

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
traffic is very difficult to predict and

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.430 
traffic is very difficult to predict and
it<00:01:40.340> fluctuates<00:01:41.000> tremendously<00:01:41.690> so<00:01:42.290> your

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
it fluctuates tremendously so your

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.150 
it fluctuates tremendously so your
inventory<00:01:43.040> size<00:01:43.370> could<00:01:43.790> vary<00:01:44.060> each<00:01:44.390> month

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
inventory size could vary each month

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.980 
inventory size could vary each month
what<00:01:46.160> is<00:01:46.310> clear<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.330> more<00:01:47.510> content

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
what is clear is that the more content

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.020 
what is clear is that the more content
that<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.230> have<00:01:48.440> on<00:01:48.620> your<00:01:48.770> website<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.820> better
