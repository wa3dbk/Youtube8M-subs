it<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> hardware<00:01:15.270> section<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.100> bent<00:01:17.369> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
it in the hardware section and I bent it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.929 
it in the hardware section and I bent it
into<00:01:17.729> curvilinear<00:01:18.630> shape<00:01:19.430> go<00:01:20.430> Torn's<00:01:20.820> are

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
into curvilinear shape go Torn's are

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.940 
into curvilinear shape go Torn's are
actually<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.570> ovoid<00:01:22.020> or<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
actually really ovoid or like this and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.429 
actually really ovoid or like this and
then<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.220> rotate<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:24.000> go<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.200> I'm

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
then they rotate as they go and so I'm

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.929 
then they rotate as they go and so I'm
just<00:01:25.590> using<00:01:25.710> these<00:01:25.890> two<00:01:26.100> base<00:01:26.310> pieces<00:01:26.580> not

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
just using these two base pieces not

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.800 
just using these two base pieces not
triangular<00:01:27.540> one<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> Rams<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.810> then

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
triangular one like a Rams one and then

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.890 
triangular one like a Rams one and then
I<00:01:30.840> wrapped<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> put<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> twist<00:01:33.720> tie

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
I wrapped it in when I put a twist tie

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.530 
I wrapped it in when I put a twist tie
on<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> end<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:35.340> bring<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.610> together<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:38.540> then

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
on the end to bring it together and then

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.639 
on the end to bring it together and then
I<00:01:40.049> wrapped<00:01:41.450> all<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> two<00:01:42.750> pieces<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.439> very

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
I wrapped all the two pieces in very

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.580 
I wrapped all the two pieces in very
thin<00:01:43.950> red<00:01:44.189> wire<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:45.600> course<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.020> collapsed

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
thin red wire and of course it collapsed

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.630 
thin red wire and of course it collapsed
so<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> then<00:01:47.850> put<00:01:48.450> wooden<00:01:49.229> braces<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so I then put wooden braces in it and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.270 
so I then put wooden braces in it and
hot<00:01:51.299> glue<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> wooden<00:01:51.689> braces<00:01:51.960> into<00:01:52.259> place<00:01:52.470> so

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
hot glue the wooden braces into place so

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.889 
hot glue the wooden braces into place so
we<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.759> strong<00:01:55.219> holding<00:01:56.219> shape

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
we now have a strong holding shape

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.800 
we now have a strong holding shape
that's<00:01:57.899> exactly<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> shape<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.100> want

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
that's exactly the shape that I want

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.270 
that's exactly the shape that I want
I've<00:02:00.810> cut<00:02:01.200> strips<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:02.450> foam<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.869> used<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.740> hot

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
I've cut strips of foam and used a hot

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.650 
I've cut strips of foam and used a hot
glue<00:02:05.610> gun<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.090> adhere<00:02:07.020> them<00:02:07.429> and<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:09.090> use<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
glue gun to adhere them and I use the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.839 
glue gun to adhere them and I use the
industrial<00:02:10.229> hot<00:02:10.379> glue<00:02:10.619> gun<00:02:10.860> which<00:02:11.129> melted<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
industrial hot glue gun which melted the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.300 
industrial hot glue gun which melted the
foam

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
foam

during the actual creation process so I

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.430 
during the actual creation process so I
just<00:03:20.829> pulled<00:03:21.070> this<00:03:21.220> out<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:22.420> put<00:03:23.049> it<00:03:23.140> over<00:03:23.260> the

it<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.810> just<00:03:25.959> do<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.230> entire<00:03:26.470> thing<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:27.040> way

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
it you just do the entire thing this way

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.160

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
I've left just the tip unwrapped so I

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.750 
I've left just the tip unwrapped so I
can<00:03:40.740> pull<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.100> out<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.250> then<00:03:41.460> I'm<00:03:41.550> going<00:03:41.730> to

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
can pull it out and then I'm going to

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.460 
can pull it out and then I'm going to
kind<00:03:42.330> of<00:03:42.480> carve<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.930> foam<00:03:43.110> into<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.350> right

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
kind of carve the foam into the right

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.390 
kind of carve the foam into the right
shape<00:03:43.500> glue<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.070> down<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.400> cut<00:03:44.520> it<00:03:44.610> into<00:03:44.760> place

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
shape glue it down and cut it into place

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.370 
shape glue it down and cut it into place
you<00:03:47.400> can<00:03:47.430> see<00:03:47.580> here<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.030> I've<00:03:48.360> also<00:03:48.690> filled

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
you can see here that I've also filled

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.190 
you can see here that I've also filled
in<00:03:49.650> all<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.250> gaps<00:03:50.400> glue<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.780> I'm<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.990> tight

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
in all of the gaps glue so I'm the tight

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.260 
in all of the gaps glue so I'm the tight
side<00:03:52.440> it's<00:03:52.890> contiguous<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.000> on<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.150> other

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
side it's contiguous and on the other

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.120 
side it's contiguous and on the other
side<00:03:54.480> there's<00:03:54.690> open<00:03:55.020> spaces<00:03:55.260> that's<00:03:55.650> fine<00:03:55.920> it

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
side there's open spaces that's fine it

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.620 
side there's open spaces that's fine it
looks<00:03:56.310> good<00:03:56.490> and<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.880> finish<00:03:57.210> process<00:03:59.630> okay

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
looks good and the finish process okay

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.680 
looks good and the finish process okay
so<00:04:01.020> I<00:04:01.530> wrapped<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.610> green<00:04:02.790> wire<00:04:02.970> completely

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
so I wrapped the green wire completely

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.930 
so I wrapped the green wire completely
around<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.050> sculptural<00:04:04.530> form<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.160> filled<00:04:05.790> in

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
around the sculptural form and filled in

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.970 
around the sculptural form and filled in
all<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.090> gaps<00:04:06.210> with<00:04:06.630> glue<00:04:06.900> as<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.590> can<00:04:07.740> see

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
all the gaps with glue as you can see

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.660 
all the gaps with glue as you can see
here<00:04:10.640> and<00:04:11.640> then<00:04:12.480> i<00:04:12.990> shimmied<00:04:13.920> it<00:04:14.160> off<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.520> base

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670

form mine ripped in a few places

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.880 
form mine ripped in a few places
I<00:04:17.940> might<00:04:18.600> actually<00:04:18.810> suggest<00:04:19.290> even<00:04:19.500> leaving<00:04:19.860> a

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
I might actually suggest even leaving a

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.920 
I might actually suggest even leaving a
couple<00:04:20.040> places<00:04:20.220> open<00:04:20.700> unglued<00:04:21.270> for<00:04:21.660> my<00:04:21.750> next

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
couple places open unglued for my next

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.830 
couple places open unglued for my next
set<00:04:22.520> still<00:04:23.520> use<00:04:23.670> one<00:04:23.880> continuous<00:04:24.390> wire<00:04:24.570> cut

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
set still use one continuous wire cut

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.450 
set still use one continuous wire cut
this<00:04:24.900> with<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.080> strength<00:04:25.290> is<00:04:25.590> leave<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.220> couple

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
this with the strength is leave a couple

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.920 
this with the strength is leave a couple
areas<00:04:26.850> on<00:04:26.970> glued<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.510> you<00:04:27.600> can<00:04:27.750> easily

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
areas on glued so that you can easily

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.980 
areas on glued so that you can easily
slide<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.410> off<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.970> form<00:04:29.970> came<00:04:30.330> out<00:04:30.540> more<00:04:30.810> or

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
slide it off the form came out more or

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.650 
slide it off the form came out more or
less<00:04:31.020> unharmed<00:04:31.410> from<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.130> inside<00:04:32.550> as<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.510> can

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
less unharmed from the inside as you can

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.110 
less unharmed from the inside as you can
see<00:04:33.870> here<00:04:34.170> this<00:04:34.320> is<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.710> cash<00:04:35.160> form<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:36.030> it

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
see here this is the cash form so it

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.310 
see here this is the cash form so it
looks<00:04:36.300> like<00:04:36.390> I<00:04:36.570> should<00:04:36.750> be<00:04:36.810> able<00:04:36.900> just<00:04:36.990> plug

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
looks like I should be able just plug

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.950 
looks like I should be able just plug
that<00:04:37.350> right<00:04:37.650> back<00:04:37.830> into<00:04:38.010> its<00:04:38.220> base<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.960> make

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
that right back into its base and make

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.270 
that right back into its base and make
another<00:04:40.200> one<00:04:40.470> or<00:04:40.590> two<00:04:40.740> out<00:04:40.860> of<00:04:40.890> it<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:41.160> that's

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
another one or two out of it so that's

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.950 
another one or two out of it so that's
very<00:04:41.460> exciting<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:42.150> might<00:04:42.300> be<00:04:42.390> able<00:04:42.480> to<00:04:42.600> make<00:04:42.720> a

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
very exciting I might be able to make a

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.730 
very exciting I might be able to make a
whole<00:04:43.500> series<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.950> these<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:45.740> relatively

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
whole series of these a relatively

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.650 
whole series of these a relatively
little<00:04:46.980> work<00:04:47.130> great<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:50.130> next<00:04:50.430> step<00:04:50.670> is<00:04:50.910> to

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
little work great the next step is to

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.370 
little work great the next step is to
apply<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:53.220> crepe<00:04:54.180> paper<00:04:54.510> layer<00:04:54.840> which<00:04:55.050> is<00:04:55.200> going

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
apply a crepe paper layer which is going

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.820 
apply a crepe paper layer which is going
to<00:04:55.530> give<00:04:55.680> structure<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:57.350> finished<00:04:58.350> horn

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
to give structure to the finished horn

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.580 
to give structure to the finished horn

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
minutes it'll dry the crepe paper

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:07.869 
minutes it'll dry the crepe paper
completely<00:06:06.560> allow<00:06:06.919> me<00:06:07.069> to<00:06:07.190> the<00:06:07.310> next<00:06:07.460> section

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:07.879 
completely allow me to the next section

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.390 
completely allow me to the next section
and<00:06:08.620> it's<00:06:09.620> very<00:06:09.770> important<00:06:10.159> you<00:06:10.219> can<00:06:10.250> actually

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
and it's very important you can actually

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.149 
and it's very important you can actually
read<00:06:10.669> mole<00:06:11.000> reshape<00:06:11.659> at<00:06:12.319> this<00:06:12.680> point<00:06:12.949> so<00:06:13.129> you

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159 
read mole reshape at this point so you

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:15.490 
read mole reshape at this point so you
can<00:06:13.340> do<00:06:13.490> troubleshooting<00:06:14.180> get<00:06:14.719> it<00:06:14.810> exactly

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
can do troubleshooting get it exactly

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.830 
can do troubleshooting get it exactly
the<00:06:15.889> curve<00:06:16.159> that<00:06:16.460> you're<00:06:16.610> looking<00:06:16.969> for<00:06:17.240> but<00:06:17.750> it

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
the curve that you're looking for but it

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.089 
the curve that you're looking for but it
has<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.080> be<00:06:18.169> held<00:06:18.379> in<00:06:18.530> that<00:06:18.560> curve<00:06:18.860> achill

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
has to be held in that curve achill

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.300 
has to be held in that curve achill
shape<00:06:19.280> I<00:06:19.430> have<00:06:19.669> this<00:06:19.819> on<00:06:19.940> a<00:06:19.969> support<00:06:20.300> stand

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
shape I have this on a support stand

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.290 
shape I have this on a support stand
during<00:06:22.310> the<00:06:22.460> drawing<00:06:22.669> process<00:06:22.849> because

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
during the drawing process because

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.879 
during the drawing process because
that's<00:06:23.389> what's<00:06:23.629> going<00:06:23.810> to<00:06:23.840> bend<00:06:24.080> it<00:06:24.199> if<00:06:24.590> you<00:06:24.710> do

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
that's what's going to bend it if you do

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.589 
that's what's going to bend it if you do
mess<00:06:25.069> it<00:06:25.219> up<00:06:25.310> you<00:06:25.370> can<00:06:25.639> always<00:06:25.759> read<00:06:26.060> it

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
mess it up you can always read it

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.459 
mess it up you can always read it
put<00:06:27.020> a<00:06:27.050> form<00:06:27.620> inside<00:06:27.860> of<00:06:28.009> it<00:06:28.099> let<00:06:28.219> it<00:06:28.310> read<00:06:28.400> RIE

that<00:06:39.500> was<00:06:39.620> holding<00:06:39.949> its<00:06:40.099> shape<00:06:40.159> and<00:06:40.520> now<00:06:41.029> I'll

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
that was holding its shape and now I'll

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.120 
that was holding its shape and now I'll
hold<00:06:41.240> the<00:06:41.389> shape<00:06:41.539> all<00:06:41.750> on<00:06:41.810> its<00:06:41.930> own<00:06:42.050> I've<00:06:42.919> done

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
hold the shape all on its own I've done

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.189 
hold the shape all on its own I've done
a<00:06:43.159> couple<00:06:43.490> of<00:06:43.580> different<00:06:43.969> layers<00:06:44.630> and<00:06:44.810> places

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 
a couple of different layers and places

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.050 
a couple of different layers and places
where<00:06:45.289> it<00:06:45.409> seemed<00:06:45.620> weak<00:06:46.009> and<00:06:46.340> I've<00:06:46.789> done<00:06:46.940> my

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
where it seemed weak and I've done my

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.279 
where it seemed weak and I've done my
best<00:06:47.090> make<00:06:47.419> it<00:06:47.509> nice<00:06:47.599> and<00:06:47.779> strong<00:06:47.930> still

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289 
best make it nice and strong still

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:50.320 
best make it nice and strong still
hollow<00:06:48.560> inside<00:06:48.800> still<00:06:49.370> very<00:06:49.610> very<00:06:49.849> very<00:06:50.000> light

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
hollow inside still very very very light

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.459 
hollow inside still very very very light
and<00:06:52.360> so<00:06:53.360> that's<00:06:53.750> about<00:06:53.870> the<00:06:54.080> finished<00:06:54.319> piece

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:54.469 
and so that's about the finished piece

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.249 
and so that's about the finished piece
look<00:06:54.680> like<00:06:54.860> all<00:06:55.069> that's<00:06:55.279> left<00:06:55.520> is<00:06:55.759> to<00:06:56.110> coat<00:06:57.110> it

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259 
look like all that's left is to coat it

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.790 
look like all that's left is to coat it
in<00:06:57.380> plastic<00:06:57.979> and<00:06:58.099> paint<00:06:58.279> it<00:06:58.490> I<00:06:59.620> hope<00:07:00.620> you've

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
in plastic and paint it I hope you've

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.279 
in plastic and paint it I hope you've
enjoyed<00:07:00.919> my<00:07:01.190> video<00:07:01.580> on<00:07:01.849> how<00:07:02.150> to<00:07:02.210> make<00:07:02.569> your<00:07:02.840> own

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:03.289 
enjoyed my video on how to make your own

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:06.909 
enjoyed my video on how to make your own
formed<00:07:04.279> horn<00:07:04.699> structures<00:07:05.740> then<00:07:06.740> you

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
formed horn structures then you

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.140 
formed horn structures then you
obviously<00:07:07.099> could<00:07:07.460> use<00:07:07.580> this<00:07:07.669> make<00:07:07.849> lots<00:07:08.029> of

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.150 
obviously could use this make lots of

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.180 
obviously could use this make lots of
different<00:07:08.270> items<00:07:09.050> but<00:07:09.409> that's<00:07:09.889> the<00:07:09.979> one<00:07:10.099> that

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
different items but that's the one that

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.159 
different items but that's the one that
I<00:07:10.279> used<00:07:10.550> a<00:07:10.849> couple<00:07:11.240> of<00:07:11.330> changes<00:07:11.750> I<00:07:11.840> left<00:07:12.020> it

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:12.169 
I used a couple of changes I left it

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:14.350 
I used a couple of changes I left it
open<00:07:12.680> on<00:07:12.770> the<00:07:12.919> inside<00:07:13.279> because<00:07:13.520> as<00:07:14.029> of<00:07:14.210> the

I<00:07:16.039> got<00:07:16.219> it<00:07:16.340> from<00:07:16.550> it<00:07:16.729> you<00:07:16.819> can<00:07:16.849> add<00:07:17.210> light

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
I got it from it you can add light

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.709 
I got it from it you can add light
strings<00:07:18.199> make<00:07:18.440> it<00:07:18.560> glow<00:07:18.770> from<00:07:18.949> the<00:07:19.039> inside

00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:19.719 
strings make it glow from the inside
