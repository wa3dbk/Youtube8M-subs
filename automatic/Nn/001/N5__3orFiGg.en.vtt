00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:16.510
 I have the fire ready today I 'm going sir 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:18.189
 to make grilled chicken curry I'm 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.030
 I'm going to leave your skin because 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:24.030
 I want that well crunchy and golden 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.030
 cortecito 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.230
 and cortecito then so that it is more 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.230
 supported still 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.720
 so that all this in order to get the 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.739
 breast with ease that does not move 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.579
 on all sides 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.450
 I go to the center 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.190
 and frame 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.020
 you run your finger and always rubbing the bone 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.670
 is taking out so that you do not lose anything 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.620
 of meat 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.090
 there 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.090
 and there 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.900
 a breast I leave the skin and I go to 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.250
 cut to the middle frame the sternum I'll 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.250
 make a mark on this side is 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.140
 always flush with the bone 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.630
 here 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.630
 we take out the wings that I retire 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.800
 joint 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.800
 sometimes the bustle there 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.920
 and it comes out we just tell what the knife what 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.920
 you get here 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:49.600
 and a couple of tablespoons of curry powder 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.150
 four or five tablespoons of oil 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.500
 olive 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.500
 a good stream of white wine 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.080
 some fresh herbs a touch of 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.080
 rosemary 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.810
 three or four cloves of garlic 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.810
 and a little lemon juice 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.480
 so that it takes more flavor I'm still going 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.370
 do as a few cuts milestones 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.150
 superficial 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.150
 the pieces of chicken 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.230
 all this well with all the mix 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.630
 you are that it takes an incredible flavor 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.580
 all night inside the top of this 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.140
 so that you do not invade flavors and if not 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.920
 at least one hour 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.920
 good 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.180
 we are going to get here because good 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.819
 I'm going to cook directly on the grill 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.569
 the idea that generates a kind of dismissal 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.569
 put it in some way 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.430
 because I put the breasts forward for 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.190
 to be able to take them out first as they are going to 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.709
 pass cooking point that if you take from 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.450
 oil so that it helps to pray well now 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.850
 we have to cook I prefer to do it 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.630
 directly with the heat of the embers 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.030
 I can support just is roughly 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.590
 about 15 centimeters of the same grill 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.020
 I'm going to do with this 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.180
 you just have to go around and what 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.709
 what I'm going to do is go putting him a little 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.540
 of the marinade that remained during the 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.959
 cooking at least 34 times of each 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.959
 side 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.440
 we are ready fifty fifty and 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.440
 five minutes of cooking 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.130
 grill 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.130
 here
