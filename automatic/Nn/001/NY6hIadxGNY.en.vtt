there's something like that can rely on
and<00:00:40.890> won't<00:00:41.070> die<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.340> them<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:43.190> most<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and won't die on them and most of the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.160 
and won't die on them and most of the
plants<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.030> stunt<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.570> actually<00:00:45.899> begin

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
plants in the stunt are actually begin

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.350 
plants in the stunt are actually begin
our<00:00:46.320> plants<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:48.050> my<00:00:49.050> tongue<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.530> relatively

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
our plants so my tongue is relatively

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.290 
our plants so my tongue is relatively
good<00:00:51.360> looking<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.989> suppose<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.680> fish<00:00:52.860> tank

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300

a<00:01:44.549> great<00:01:44.850> plant<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.229> more<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.530> cook<00:01:46.740> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
a great plant and the more you cook it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.700 
a great plant and the more you cook it
the<00:01:47.189> more<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.579> grows<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.470> actually

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the more it grows and you can actually

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.340 
the more it grows and you can actually
develop<00:01:50.430> your<00:01:50.790> own<00:01:50.820> varieties<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
develop your own varieties of it as you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.770 
develop your own varieties of it as you
can<00:01:52.470> see<00:01:52.649> there<00:01:52.920> there's<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.909> leaf<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.509> free

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
can see there there's a leaf with free

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.050 
can see there there's a leaf with free

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
small plants like that they often

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.610 
small plants like that they often
require<00:03:26.739> very<00:03:27.280> high<00:03:27.370> light<00:03:27.819> levels<00:03:27.849> and<00:03:28.620> what

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
require very high light levels and what

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.219 
require very high light levels and what
size<00:03:29.859> really<00:03:30.250> isn't<00:03:30.370> fussy<00:03:30.879> and<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.959> wouldn't

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:32.229 
size really isn't fussy and I wouldn't

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:34.979 
size really isn't fussy and I wouldn't
keep<00:03:32.319> it<00:03:32.439> in<00:03:32.560> very<00:03:32.739> low<00:03:33.069> lights<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:33.989> haven't

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
keep it in very low lights I haven't

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.800 
keep it in very low lights I haven't
said<00:03:35.229> that<00:03:35.260> I've<00:03:35.799> kept<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.250> with<00:03:36.370> LEDs<00:03:37.000> for<00:03:37.510> a

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
said that I've kept it with LEDs for a

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.129 
said that I've kept it with LEDs for a
few<00:03:38.319> months<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:38.859> it<00:03:39.579> can<00:03:39.909> tolerate<00:03:40.299> quite<00:03:40.870> low

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
few months so it can tolerate quite low

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.280 
few months so it can tolerate quite low
light<00:03:41.409> levels<00:03:41.769> but<00:03:42.069> I<00:03:42.340> keep<00:03:42.909> it<00:03:43.030> in<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.359> moderate

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
light levels but I keep it in a moderate

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.159 
light levels but I keep it in a moderate
lathe<00:03:44.530> level<00:03:45.040> but<00:03:45.849> yeah<00:03:46.329> just<00:03:46.569> great<00:03:46.840> plan

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
lathe level but yeah just great plan

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.610 
lathe level but yeah just great plan
sends<00:03:47.829> I've<00:03:47.979> run<00:03:48.189> us<00:03:48.310> everywhere<00:03:49.199> stay<00:03:50.199> short

you<00:03:50.829> can<00:03:50.979> trim<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.370> although<00:03:51.790> I've<00:03:52.000> never

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
you can trim it although I've never

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.319 
you can trim it although I've never
actually<00:03:52.509> trimmed<00:03:52.959> mine<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:55.000> there's

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
actually trimmed mine and there's

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.849 
actually trimmed mine and there's
actually<00:03:55.479> a<00:03:55.659> lot<00:03:55.930> of<00:03:55.989> different<00:03:56.319> varieties<00:03:56.680> as

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
actually a lot of different varieties as

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.270 
actually a lot of different varieties as
such<00:03:58.169> but<00:03:59.169> one<00:03:59.439> of<00:03:59.470> my<00:03:59.620> favourites<00:04:00.099> is

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
such but one of my favourites is

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.780 
such but one of my favourites is
definitely<00:04:00.669> draw<00:04:00.849> search<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:02.129> it<00:04:03.129> just<00:04:03.430> looks

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
definitely draw search and it just looks

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.969 
definitely draw search and it just looks
so<00:04:03.970> much<00:04:04.180> like<00:04:04.419> actual<00:04:05.319> grass<00:04:05.590> that<00:04:05.829> you'd

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:05.979 
so much like actual grass that you'd

just trim off trim off the top another
promoter<00:04:40.680> figure<00:04:41.070> growth<00:04:41.310> so<00:04:42.150> she<00:04:42.240> if<00:04:42.600> I<00:04:42.810> was<00:04:42.930> a

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
promoter figure growth so she if I was a

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.680

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.450 
you can tie it a rocks and bits of wood
and<00:05:56.700> it<00:05:57.510> looks<00:05:57.720> great<00:05:57.930> alongside<00:05:58.500> java<00:05:59.190> fern

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460
