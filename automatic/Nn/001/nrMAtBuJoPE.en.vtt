00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.129
 and Liniger 2 not always via usb cable 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.999
 No 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:11.820
 the castle on the Kindle amounts to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.449
 First of all binding by cable 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.179
 the children become computers and then appear here 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.179
 the Kindle as a USB hard disk 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.970
 I do not even know 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.429
 second window on 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:26.539
 then we see here 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:27.890
 the contents go out 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.769
 know about it 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.180
 What I've got here is Nokia's head shape art 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.180
 and the same book again pdf format 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.780
 which I can not do unfortunately I can not easily the the blunder 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.190
 Transfer market on the Kindel because he can not show that 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.850
 You have to convert it first 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 there you can do that with the GEK in Berlin 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.220
 with the children's circus is 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.300
 if you use the free e-mail address of his children this file 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.320
 sends there 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.530
 It is formatted into a format that children can read 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.380
 if, however, then as that looks the same as here is the question sometimes 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.930
 the state road at Thun is very good sometimes it is need to wish 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.650
 that's what makes it much more mature than PDF for now 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.730
 shares 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.110
 because this is not a 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.770
 but as well as one recognizes it from the computer 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.770
 most important partner documents demand that Bartz 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.280
 now it is CERN 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.100
 Bucher Hoffmann 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.610
 salty problem however if it is not an active e-book format therefore 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.920
 you can not act anymore 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.200
 the font sizes prevent for example 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.680
 Book is also a man no zoom so you can be big and small at 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.120
 zoom but it is not free float text 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.650
 not with the children themselves 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.140
 so that unfortunately 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.900
 a compromise
