across my basement and obviously having

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.440 
across my basement and obviously having
the<00:00:13.990> bridge<00:00:14.290> creates<00:00:15.130> a<00:00:15.219> problem<00:00:15.460> because<00:00:15.790> if

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
the bridge creates a problem because if

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
goes out whatever I've got to do when I

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.510 
goes out whatever I've got to do when I
come<00:00:43.210> back<00:00:43.420> I<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:46.239> pull<00:00:46.510> it<00:00:46.600> down<00:00:47.430> put<00:00:48.430> it

come back I just pull it down put it
right<00:00:48.670> back<00:00:48.879> where<00:00:48.940> it<00:00:49.239> came<00:00:49.270> from

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
right back where it came from

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.500 
right back where it came from
this<00:00:50.860> is<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.190> business<00:00:51.579> end<00:00:51.789> of<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.120> hinged

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
this is the business end of the hinged

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.660 
this is the business end of the hinged
bridge<00:00:52.809> and<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:53.890> can<00:00:54.039> see<00:00:54.219> what<00:00:54.340> I've<00:00:54.430> done<00:00:54.550> is

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
bridge and you can see what I've done is

bridge and you can see what I've done is
I've<00:00:54.820> modified<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.809> Atlas<00:00:56.289> bridge<00:00:56.789> by<00:00:57.789> adding

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
I've modified the Atlas bridge by adding

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.680 
I've modified the Atlas bridge by adding
on<00:00:58.780> these<00:00:59.110> hinges<00:01:00.000> right<00:01:01.000> here<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:01.539> was<00:01:01.629> a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
on these hinges right here it was a

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.410 
on these hinges right here it was a
little<00:01:01.750> tricky<00:01:02.260> with<00:01:02.410> the<00:01:02.649> way<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.980> Atlas

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
little tricky with the way the Atlas

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.300 
little tricky with the way the Atlas
does<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.600> end<00:01:04.720> of<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:04.930> bridge<00:01:05.170> but<00:01:06.039> I<00:01:06.100> got

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
does the end of the bridge but I got

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.600 
does the end of the bridge but I got
them<00:01:06.490> on<00:01:06.580> there<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:08.250> after<00:01:09.250> putting<00:01:09.490> the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
them on there and after putting the

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.940 
them on there and after putting the
hinges<00:01:10.000> on<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.420> next<00:01:10.720> part<00:01:10.930> was<00:01:11.799> to

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
hinges on the next part was to

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.210 
hinges on the next part was to
counterweight<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.760> and<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.799> something<00:01:15.130> I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
counterweight it and this is something I

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.450 
counterweight it and this is something I
learned<00:01:15.400> from<00:01:15.700> our<00:01:15.880> GRS<00:01:16.390> back<00:01:16.659> shop<00:01:16.960> DVDs<00:01:17.470> this

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
learned from our GRS back shop DVDs this

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.510 
learned from our GRS back shop DVDs this
is<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:19.090> monofilament<00:01:19.840> line<00:01:20.229> for<00:01:20.710> fly-fishing

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
is a monofilament line for fly-fishing

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.359 
is a monofilament line for fly-fishing
and<00:01:21.820> this<00:01:22.630> goes<00:01:22.810> down<00:01:23.110> into<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.220> table

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
and this goes down into the table

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.219 
and this goes down into the table
through<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.030> table<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.540> then<00:01:25.720> down<00:01:25.960> under

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
through the table and then down under

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.340 
through the table and then down under
the<00:01:26.350> table<00:01:26.500> there's<00:01:27.369> a<00:01:27.600> weight<00:01:28.600> on<00:01:28.630> each<00:01:28.990> line

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
the table there's a weight on each line

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.310 
the table there's a weight on each line
that<00:01:30.000> acts<00:01:31.000> as<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.270> counterweight<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.170> that

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
that acts as a counterweight so that

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.210 
that acts as a counterweight so that
when<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.530> bridge<00:01:32.770> lifts<00:01:33.759> up<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.860> counter

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
when the bridge lifts up the counter

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.149 
when the bridge lifts up the counter
weights<00:01:36.400> keep<00:01:36.670> it<00:01:36.820> nicely<00:01:37.030> in<00:01:37.299> place<00:01:37.329> and<00:01:38.159> then

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
weights keep it nicely in place and then

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.700 
weights keep it nicely in place and then
it<00:01:39.189> comes<00:01:39.490> back<00:01:39.579> down<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:41.229> is<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.530> other

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
it comes back down this is the other

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.219 
it comes back down this is the other
side<00:01:42.009> of<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.220> bridge<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:43.450> problem<00:01:43.810> on<00:01:44.049> this

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
side of the bridge the problem on this

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.300 
side of the bridge the problem on this
side<00:01:44.439> of<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.590> bridge<00:01:44.799> is<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.159> always

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
side of the bridge is that you always

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.810 
side of the bridge is that you always
want<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.670> make<00:01:45.759> sure<00:01:45.880> that<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.570> track<00:01:47.820> stays

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
want to make sure that the track stays

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.480 
want to make sure that the track stays
perfectly<00:01:49.780> aligned<00:01:50.229> when<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.829> bridge<00:01:51.100> comes

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
perfectly aligned when the bridge comes

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.219 
perfectly aligned when the bridge comes
back<00:01:51.939> down<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.509> want<00:01:52.659> to<00:01:52.720> make<00:01:52.869> sure<00:01:52.899> the

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
back down you want to make sure the

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.710 
back down you want to make sure the
bridge<00:01:53.470> comes<00:01:54.220> back<00:01:54.490> down<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.149> same<00:01:55.390> place

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
bridge comes back down to the same place

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.889 
bridge comes back down to the same place
it<00:01:55.960> was<00:01:56.140> before<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.740> lifted<00:01:57.040> it<00:01:57.100> up<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:58.509> assist

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
it was before you lifted it up to assist

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.389 
it was before you lifted it up to assist
on<00:01:59.079> that<00:01:59.110> what<00:01:59.530> I've<00:01:59.680> done<00:01:59.710> is<00:01:59.979> cut<00:02:00.219> little

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
on that what I've done is cut little

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.969 
on that what I've done is cut little
pieces<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.909> wood<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.390> put<00:02:02.110> them<00:02:02.229> on<00:02:02.320> each<00:02:02.560> side

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
pieces of wood and put them on each side

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.940 
pieces of wood and put them on each side
of<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.850> bridge<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.899> that<00:02:05.140> kind<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.439> locks<00:02:05.770> it

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950
