the<00:01:20.430> move<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:21.090> more<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.409> people<00:01:23.100> who<00:01:23.280> are

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the move is more for people who are

the move is more for people who are
looking<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> more<00:01:24.180> accurate<00:01:24.479> motion

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
looking for a more accurate motion

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
with Kinect it is tracking your whole

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.620 
with Kinect it is tracking your whole
body<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:35.909> you're<00:01:36.000> playing<00:01:36.180> something

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
body but if you're playing something

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.719 
body but if you're playing something
like<00:01:36.780> ping<00:01:37.079> pong<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:38.009> entirely

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
like ping pong it's not entirely

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.330 
like ping pong it's not entirely
accurate<00:01:39.210> however<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.560> you're<00:01:40.829> playing<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
accurate however if you're playing the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.370 
accurate however if you're playing the
same<00:01:41.820> thing<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.540> move<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:43.049> you're<00:01:43.229> playing

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
same thing on the move if you're playing

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.190 
same thing on the move if you're playing
ping<00:01:43.710> pong<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.640> incredibly<00:01:45.390> accurate<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
ping pong it's incredibly accurate and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.020 
ping pong it's incredibly accurate and
precise<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.490> feel<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.729> you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
precise and you really feel like you

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.440 
precise and you really feel like you
have<00:01:48.240> complete<00:01:48.689> control<00:01:48.899> over<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.619> racket

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
have complete control over that racket

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.020 
have complete control over that racket
so<00:01:51.450> um<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.350> think<00:01:52.680> they<00:01:53.009> both<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.549> incredible

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
so um I think they both have incredible

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.899 
so um I think they both have incredible
potential<00:01:54.829> however<00:01:55.829> I'd<00:01:56.009> said<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.310> connect<00:01:56.670> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
potential however I'd said to connect is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.300 
potential however I'd said to connect is
more<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.420> casual<00:01:57.899> gamers<00:01:58.350> based<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.219> what

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
more for casual gamers based on what

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.340 
more for casual gamers based on what
I've<00:01:59.430> seen<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.700> far<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.659> move<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.079> more

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
I've seen so far and the move is more

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.929 
I've seen so far and the move is more
for<00:02:02.210> horrorcore<00:02:03.210> gamers<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:04.369> possibly<00:02:05.369> casual

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
for horrorcore gamers or possibly casual

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.270 
for horrorcore gamers or possibly casual

are excellent you know and they're both
really<00:02:17.040> fun<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.549> use<00:02:18.079> in<00:02:19.079> my<00:02:19.920> opinion<00:02:20.629> after

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
really fun to use in my opinion after

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.649 
really fun to use in my opinion after
using<00:02:21.840> both<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.499> far<00:02:22.879> I'd<00:02:23.879> say<00:02:23.909> that<00:02:24.480> with<00:02:24.629> the

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
using both so far I'd say that with the

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.470 
using both so far I'd say that with the
games<00:02:25.079> that<00:02:25.379> are<00:02:25.620> out<00:02:25.769> for<00:02:26.040> each<00:02:26.340> arm<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.239> I'm

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
games that are out for each arm and I'm

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.740 
games that are out for each arm and I'm
going<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.810> use<00:02:27.959> these<00:02:28.469> sports<00:02:28.950> games<00:02:29.400> by<00:02:30.299> Sony

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
going to use these sports games by Sony

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.379 
going to use these sports games by Sony
and<00:02:31.139> Microsoft<00:02:31.170> for<00:02:31.889> this<00:02:32.040> comparison<00:02:32.549> I've

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
and Microsoft for this comparison I've

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.869 
and Microsoft for this comparison I've
actually<00:02:33.719> had<00:02:34.049> more<00:02:34.379> fun<00:02:34.769> with<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.489> connect

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
actually had more fun with the connect

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.569 
actually had more fun with the connect
them<00:02:36.239> with<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.540> move<00:02:36.769> however<00:02:37.769> in<00:02:38.159> a<00:02:38.250> lot<00:02:38.430> of

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
them with the move however in a lot of

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.789 
them with the move however in a lot of
ways<00:02:38.730> I've<00:02:39.060> been<00:02:39.299> more<00:02:39.569> impressed<00:02:40.200> with<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
ways I've been more impressed with the

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.250 
ways I've been more impressed with the
move<00:02:41.090> because<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.389> because<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:43.019> how

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
move because just because of how

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.610 
move because just because of how
accurate<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.040> precise<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:45.620> however

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
accurate and precise it is however

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.770 
accurate and precise it is however
that's<00:02:46.829> just<00:02:47.159> my<00:02:47.340> opinion<00:02:47.569> they're<00:02:48.569> both

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
that's just my opinion they're both

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.189 
that's just my opinion they're both
great<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:49.439> I<00:02:50.430> know<00:02:51.060> I'm<00:02:51.299> being<00:02:51.449> kind<00:02:51.719> of<00:02:51.870> soft

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:52.199 
great and I know I'm being kind of soft

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.750 
great and I know I'm being kind of soft
here<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.650> my<00:02:52.769> comparisons<00:02:53.459> they're<00:02:53.639> not

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
here in my comparisons they're not

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.849 
here in my comparisons they're not
giving<00:02:53.969> you<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> straight<00:02:54.540> answer<00:02:54.680> but<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.829> I

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
giving you a straight answer but like I

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.589 
giving you a straight answer but like I
said<00:02:55.980> before<00:02:56.250> it's<00:02:56.790> really<00:02:57.090> based<00:02:57.269> on<00:02:57.449> what

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
said before it's really based on what

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.530 
said before it's really based on what
you<00:02:57.719> want<00:02:58.019> an<00:02:58.260> emotion<00:02:58.739> control<00:02:59.239> you<00:03:00.239> know<00:03:00.329> if

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
you want an emotion control you know if

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.379 
you want an emotion control you know if

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
maybe as a kid or that you've always

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.360 
maybe as a kid or that you've always
wanted<00:03:08.000> go<00:03:09.000> with<00:03:09.180> Kinect<00:03:10.099> because<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.189> won't

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
wanted go with Kinect because you won't

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
level something that's a little bit more

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.189 
level something that's a little bit more

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
opinion they're both very impressive in

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.740 
opinion they're both very impressive in
terms<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.479> their<00:03:24.659> technological<00:03:25.590> feats<00:03:26.189> but

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
terms of their technological feats but

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.129 
terms of their technological feats but
in<00:03:27.750> terms<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:28.109> real-world<00:03:28.349> use<00:03:29.159> I<00:03:30.019> was<00:03:31.019> just

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
in terms of real-world use I was just

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.499 
in terms of real-world use I was just
amazed<00:03:31.590> at<00:03:31.979> how<00:03:32.459> much<00:03:32.639> control<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.299> get

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:33.509 
amazed at how much control and you get

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.649 
amazed at how much control and you get
with<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.810> move<00:03:34.159> so<00:03:35.159> anyway<00:03:35.489> that's<00:03:36.269> my

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
with the move so anyway that's my

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.689 
with the move so anyway that's my
comparison<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.769> that's<00:03:37.889> my<00:03:38.069> take<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.639> it

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
comparison and that's my take on it

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.539 
comparison and that's my take on it
there<00:03:39.659> they<00:03:40.109> both<00:03:40.319> have<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.859> lot<00:03:41.099> of<00:03:41.129> potential

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
there they both have a lot of potential

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.969 
there they both have a lot of potential
but<00:03:41.759> I<00:03:41.879> feel<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> can't<00:03:42.540> give<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.930> too<00:03:43.169> much<00:03:43.799> of

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:43.979 
but I feel I can't give you too much of

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.960 
but I feel I can't give you too much of
an<00:03:44.099> answer<00:03:44.250> yet<00:03:45.090> because<00:03:45.629> they<00:03:46.079> both<00:03:46.609> are<00:03:47.609> very

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
an answer yet because they both are very

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.179 
an answer yet because they both are very
new<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.629> they<00:03:48.750> need<00:03:48.930> time<00:03:49.139> to<00:03:49.349> develop<00:03:49.470> before

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189
