00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
this little turntable and you got to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.119 
this little turntable and you got to
keep<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.399> mind<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.680> this<00:00:37.680> connects<00:00:38.010> your

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
keep in mind that this connects your

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.500 
keep in mind that this connects your
bluetooth<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.910> through<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.149> killer

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
bluetooth but not through the killer

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.420 
bluetooth but not through the killer
bluetooth<00:00:39.930> that's<00:00:40.469> advertised<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.250> has<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
bluetooth that's advertised it has a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.000 
bluetooth that's advertised it has a
secondary<00:00:42.000> Bluetooth<00:00:42.510> chip<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.559> board<00:00:43.800> in

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
secondary Bluetooth chip in the board in

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.190 
secondary Bluetooth chip in the board in
a<00:00:44.100> specialized<00:00:44.579> em<00:00:44.760> pcie<00:00:45.180> slot<00:00:45.510> only<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.110> that

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
a specialized em pcie slot only for that

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.110 
a specialized em pcie slot only for that
and<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.890> was<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.280> surprised<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.730> find<00:00:47.940> that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and I was really surprised to find that

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.380 
and I was really surprised to find that
because<00:00:49.610> it's<00:00:50.610> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.940> covered<00:00:51.180> by<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
because it's kind of covered by the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.790 
because it's kind of covered by the
shield<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.020> can't<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.710> but

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
shield and you can't really see it but

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.250 
shield and you can't really see it but
that's<00:00:53.190> specific<00:00:53.760> dedicated<00:00:54.239> circuitry<00:00:54.719> just

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that's specific dedicated circuitry just

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.900 
that's specific dedicated circuitry just
for<00:00:55.410> changing<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.800> colors<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.550> that's<00:00:56.730> not

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
for changing the colors now that's not

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.130 
for changing the colors now that's not
the<00:00:57.000> cool<00:00:57.180> part<00:00:57.420> what<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:57.899> made<00:00:58.050> this

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the cool part what I really made this

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.500 
the cool part what I really made this
video<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> show<00:00:58.680> these<00:00:58.980> modes<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.390> these

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
video is to show these modes so these

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.260 
video is to show these modes so these
are<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> modes<00:01:00.960> right<00:01:01.489> we<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.640> flashing

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
are the modes right we have flashing

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.210 
are the modes right we have flashing
pulsing<00:01:03.750> wave<00:01:03.989> random<00:01:04.680> all<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:04.979> goodies

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
pulsing wave random all these goodies

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.219 
pulsing wave random all these goodies
but<00:01:06.030> let's<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> look<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.880> flashing<00:01:09.229> pretty

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
but let's take a look at flashing pretty

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.710 
but let's take a look at flashing pretty
cool<00:01:10.470> huh<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:11.250> electrons<00:01:11.729> pulsating<00:01:12.570> in

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
cool huh like electrons pulsating in

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.230 
cool huh like electrons pulsating in
different<00:01:13.290> regions<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.830> board<00:01:14.150> then<00:01:15.150> we

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
different regions of the board then we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.670 
different regions of the board then we
have<00:01:15.390> stack<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.140> another<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> my

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
have stack this is another one of my

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.469 
have stack this is another one of my
favorites<00:01:17.159> kind<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.580> stacks<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.060> Tetris

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
favorites kind of stacks it like Tetris

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.260 
favorites kind of stacks it like Tetris
from<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> bottom<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.970> thought<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.150> was

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
from the bottom up I thought this was

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.929 
from the bottom up I thought this was
pretty<00:01:21.390> cool<00:01:21.659> mode<00:01:22.220> that's<00:01:23.220> random<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.850> then

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
pretty cool mode that's random and then

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.640 
pretty cool mode that's random and then
this<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.180> random

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.410 

it's<00:01:30.310> just<00:01:30.460> as<00:01:30.610> random<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:31.180> there's<00:01:31.360> a

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
it's just as random and there's a

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.010 
it's just as random and there's a
rainbow<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:31.810> course<00:01:33.510> you<00:01:34.510> got<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.930> have

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
rainbow of course you got to have

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.870 
rainbow of course you got to have
rainbow<00:01:35.350> in<00:01:35.470> there<00:01:35.620> and<00:01:35.800> then<00:01:35.950> shining<00:01:36.490> which

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
rainbow in there and then shining which

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.000 
rainbow in there and then shining which
is<00:01:37.000> just<00:01:37.090> buddy<00:01:37.360> basically<00:01:38.050> a<00:01:38.080> steady<00:01:38.440> maximum

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
is just buddy basically a steady maximum

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.770 
is just buddy basically a steady maximum
output<00:01:39.160> red<00:01:39.610> Gaming<00:01:40.600> is<00:01:40.750> red<00:01:41.290> pulsating<00:01:41.830> in

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
output red Gaming is red pulsating in

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.930 
output red Gaming is red pulsating in
and<00:01:43.780> out<00:01:43.930> in<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.680> out<00:01:44.770> really<00:01:45.400> slowly<00:01:45.670> and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
and out in and out really slowly and

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.050 
and out in and out really slowly and
then<00:01:46.170> breathing<00:01:47.170> is<00:01:47.350> basically<00:01:47.860> gaming<00:01:48.340> but

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
then breathing is basically gaming but

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.000 
then breathing is basically gaming but
it<00:01:49.360> changes<00:01:49.630> colors<00:01:49.990> after<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.440> pulsates<00:01:50.830> in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
it changes colors after it pulsates in

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.050 
it changes colors after it pulsates in
and<00:01:51.160> out<00:01:52.950> yep<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.130> then<00:01:54.400> I'll<00:01:54.520> go<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.700> yellow

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
and out yep and then I'll go to yellow

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.250 
and out yep and then I'll go to yellow
and<00:01:55.330> then<00:01:55.480> on<00:01:56.200> its<00:01:56.410> way<00:01:56.560> wave<00:01:57.900> so<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.050> color

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
and then on its way wave so the color

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.990

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
people might also not like off I

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.330 
people might also not like off I
actually<00:02:10.899> am<00:02:11.200> going<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.410> keep<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.740> going<00:02:12.100> maybe

flashing I thought I was pretty cool all
right<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.070> oh<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.640> can<00:02:15.910> put<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.180> music<00:02:17.070> you

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
right and oh you can put it to music you

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.320 
right and oh you can put it to music you

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
go in the music finder and it's all

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.690

their<00:02:19.540> works<00:02:19.810> pretty<00:02:19.959> well<00:02:20.080> actually<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:21.670> I

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
their works pretty well actually but I

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.740 
their works pretty well actually but I
don't<00:02:21.850> really<00:02:22.030> know<00:02:22.240> if<00:02:22.300> it's<00:02:22.360> going<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.630> the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
don't really know if it's going to the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.060 
don't really know if it's going to the
beat<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:22.900> music<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.410> haven't<00:02:23.740> spent<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:23.980> much

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
beat of music I haven't spent that much

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.740 
beat of music I haven't spent that much
time<00:02:24.160> observing<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.209> but<00:02:25.330> it's<00:02:25.420> pretty<00:02:25.600> cool

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
time observing it but it's pretty cool

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.720 
time observing it but it's pretty cool
and<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.440> app<00:02:26.560> works<00:02:26.740> really<00:02:27.010> well<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.550> I

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
and the app works really well and I

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.150 
and the app works really well and I
haven't<00:02:27.970> any<00:02:28.150> problems<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.690> used<00:02:28.840> bluetooth

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
haven't any problems in a used bluetooth

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.290 
haven't any problems in a used bluetooth
but<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.310> also<00:02:30.430> doesn't<00:02:30.820> really<00:02:30.940> have<00:02:31.120> any

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
but it also doesn't really have any

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.360 
but it also doesn't really have any
authentication<00:02:31.630> there's<00:02:32.500> no<00:02:32.620> software<00:02:32.890> to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
authentication there's no software to

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.009 
authentication there's no software to
control<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.330> which<00:02:34.450> might<00:02:34.660> be<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> good<00:02:34.959> thing

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
control it which might be a good thing

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.840 
control it which might be a good thing
since<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.680> would<00:02:35.739> take<00:02:35.920> less<00:02:36.100> resources<00:02:36.610> to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
since it would take less resources to

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.890 
since it would take less resources to
run<00:02:38.400> anyways<00:02:39.400> yeah<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:39.820> read<00:02:40.209> my<00:02:40.360> review<00:02:40.390> and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
run anyways yeah so read my review and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.060 
run anyways yeah so read my review and
hear<00:02:41.080> what<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.230> think<00:02:41.470> about<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.800> rest<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.760 
hear what I think about the rest of the
board<00:02:42.220> thanks
