expansion<00:02:18.910> pack<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.270> there<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.570> one<00:02:19.780> two<00:02:20.020> but

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
expansion pack in there is one two but

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.060 
expansion pack in there is one two but
it<00:02:21.940> doesn't<00:02:22.420> make<00:02:22.570> up<00:02:22.810> for<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.200> lost<00:02:23.440> points<00:02:23.740> I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
it doesn't make up for the lost points I

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.160 
it doesn't make up for the lost points I
mean<00:02:24.310> there's<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.209> much<00:02:25.390> missing<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.050> they

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
mean there's so much missing that they

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.530 
mean there's so much missing that they
didn't<00:02:26.440> give<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.790> fact<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.240> we're

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
didn't give you and the fact that we're

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.980 
didn't give you and the fact that we're
refined<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:30.220> same<00:02:30.520> cards<00:02:31.150> over<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.660> over

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
refined the same cards over and over

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.630 
refined the same cards over and over
again<00:02:32.110> like<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.680> don't<00:02:32.739> understand<00:02:33.400> their

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
logic in that I mean if anyone wants to

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.500 
logic in that I mean if anyone wants to
throw<00:02:37.660> down<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.230> what<00:02:38.560> they<00:02:38.709> think<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:40.000> their

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
throw down of what they think on their

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.300 
throw down of what they think on their
actual<00:02:40.989> opinion<00:02:41.410> on<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.709> by<00:02:41.920> all<00:02:42.100> means
