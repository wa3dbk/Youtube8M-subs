at the top of the screen
you'll<00:01:56.540> kind<00:01:56.690> of<00:01:56.720> get<00:01:56.870> a<00:01:56.900> prompt<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.260> sort<00:01:57.440> of

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
obviously the PS Vita has only got

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.190 
obviously the PS Vita has only got
ellen:oh<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.710> doesn't<00:02:00.950> have<00:02:01.070> l1<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.450> r1<00:02:02.510> l2

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
ellen:oh it doesn't have l1 and r1 l2

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.170 
ellen:oh it doesn't have l1 and r1 l2
and<00:02:03.350> r2<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.370> back<00:02:04.520> is<00:02:04.700> kind<00:02:04.850> of<00:02:04.880> what<00:02:05.030> used

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
and r2 so the back is kind of what used

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.550 
and r2 so the back is kind of what used
for<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.420> but<00:02:05.900> then<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.050> know<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.229> can<00:02:06.410> back

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.469 
for that but then you know I can back
out<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:06.920> then<00:02:07.010> I<00:02:07.040> can<00:02:07.250> access<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.729> XMB

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
out and then I can access the XMB

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.600 
out and then I can access the XMB
accordingly<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:10.160> for<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.310> sake<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.429> it

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610
