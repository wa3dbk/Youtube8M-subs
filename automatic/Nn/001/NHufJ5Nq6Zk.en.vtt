00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
their website and I ended up ordering

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.849 
their website and I ended up ordering
like<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> bunch<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.750> other<00:00:30.900> things<00:00:31.019> since<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.710> was

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
like a bunch of other things since I was

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.040 
like a bunch of other things since I was
gonna<00:00:32.040> place<00:00:32.250> an<00:00:32.399> order<00:00:32.640> anyway<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> picked

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
gonna place an order anyway so I picked

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.470 
gonna place an order anyway so I picked
up<00:00:34.140> some<00:00:34.440> things<00:00:34.770> probably<00:00:35.399> didn't<00:00:35.969> mean<00:00:36.180> any

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
up some things probably didn't mean any

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.450 
up some things probably didn't mean any
of<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.200> thought<00:00:37.440> why<00:00:37.860> not<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.160> lot

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
of it but I just thought why not a lot

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.100 
of it but I just thought why not a lot
of<00:00:38.489> their<00:00:38.730> things<00:00:38.969> are<00:00:39.120> very<00:00:39.420> affordable

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
of their things are very affordable

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.990 
of their things are very affordable
anyway<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.800> after<00:00:41.070> trying<00:00:41.309> out<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.610> revealed

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
anyway and after trying out the revealed

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790 
anyway and after trying out the revealed
2<00:00:42.270> palette<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.750> was<00:00:42.899> really<00:00:43.230> impressed<00:00:43.559> by<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
2 palette I was really impressed by the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.549 
2 palette I was really impressed by the
quality<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.180> am<00:00:45.629> excited<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.260> try<00:00:46.350> out

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.680 
quality of it so I am excited to try out
these<00:00:46.920> things<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.670> picked<00:00:47.940> out<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.629> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
these things that I picked out and I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.080 
these things that I picked out and I
also<00:00:48.809> recently<00:00:49.110> sent<00:00:49.559> me<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.920> new<00:00:50.280> clear<00:00:50.820> lid

also recently sent me this new clear lid
interchangeable<00:00:52.020> palette<00:00:52.500> which<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.129> thought

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
interchangeable palette which I thought

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.410 
interchangeable palette which I thought
was<00:00:53.399> kind<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.670> cool<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.300> just

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
was kind of cool because you can just

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.689 
was kind of cool because you can just
pick<00:00:54.780> your<00:00:55.260> favorite<00:00:55.320> shadows<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
pick your favorite shadows and then you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.729 
pick your favorite shadows and then you
can<00:00:56.879> put<00:00:57.090> them<00:00:57.210> into<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.170> magnetic

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
can put them into this it is magnetic

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.069 
can put them into this it is magnetic
and<00:00:59.129> they<00:00:59.850> sent<00:01:00.090> me<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.210> couple<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.750> random

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and they sent me a couple of random

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.689 
and they sent me a couple of random
colors<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.559> didn't<00:01:01.739> put<00:01:01.890> them<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.340> because

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
colors I didn't put them all in because

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.420 
colors I didn't put them all in because
I<00:01:02.910> actually<00:01:03.390> decided<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.290> pick<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:05.040> few<00:01:05.220> on

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.060 
can just see what colors you have I
don't<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.570> any<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.140> these<00:01:34.229> interchangeable

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
don't have any of these interchangeable

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.539 
don't have any of these interchangeable
palettes<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.030> think<00:01:36.420> they<00:01:36.810> only<00:01:37.049> fit<00:01:37.740> their

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
palettes and I think they only fit their

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.640 
palettes and I think they only fit their
hot<00:01:38.909> pot<00:01:39.270> single<00:01:39.720> shadows<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
hot pot single shadows and they have a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.249 
hot pot single shadows and they have a
ton<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.950> them<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.400> think<00:01:41.939> they're<00:01:42.060> under<00:01:42.270> $2<00:01:42.990> for

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
ton of them I think they're under $2 for

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.590 
ton of them I think they're under $2 for
each<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.799> they're<00:01:44.009> very<00:01:44.310> very<00:01:44.610> affordable<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
each so they're very very affordable the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.170 
each so they're very very affordable the
ones<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.930> played<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.770> far<00:01:47.130> which<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.000> think

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
ones I played with so far which I think

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.090 
ones I played with so far which I think
I<00:01:48.240> used<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.689> recent<00:01:49.079> video<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.439> well<00:01:49.649> they

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.580 
I used in a recent video as well they
are<00:01:50.130> pretty<00:01:50.729> nice<00:01:51.149> quality<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.560> price

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
are pretty nice quality for the price

be a good transition shade and then next

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.620 
be a good transition shade and then next

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.520 
really that orange but it's slightly
metallic<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:28.269> thought<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:28.900> would<00:02:29.049> be<00:02:29.110> pretty

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530

and<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:30.640> next<00:02:30.940> one<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.180> very<00:02:31.540> similar<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.049> it

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
and the next one is very similar to it

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.080 
and the next one is very similar to it
it's<00:02:32.500> actually<00:02:32.650> like<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:32.980> matte<00:02:33.370> version<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.940> it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
it's actually like a matte version of it

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.410 
it's actually like a matte version of it
it's<00:02:34.690> called<00:02:34.959> bronze<00:02:35.290> peach<00:02:36.090> again<00:02:37.090> these<00:02:37.269> are

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
it's called bronze peach again these are

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.150 
it's called bronze peach again these are
all<00:02:37.600> really<00:02:37.900> nice<00:02:38.170> kind<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.560> warmer

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.699 
all really nice kind of warmer
transition<00:02:39.819> shades<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.599> then<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.319> next<00:02:41.560> one

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
transition shades and then the next one

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.220 
transition shades and then the next one
I<00:02:41.739> picked<00:02:42.040> out<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.580> called<00:02:43.030> copper<00:02:43.540> pot<00:02:43.870> which

coppery<00:02:47.590> color<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.370> thought<00:02:48.549> that<00:02:48.790> would

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
coppery color and I thought that would

that I picked out but all of these will

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.030 
that I picked out but all of these will
go<00:02:52.269> really<00:02:52.420> nicely<00:02:52.720> into<00:02:53.049> this<00:02:53.470> palette<00:02:53.920> I'm

I use a fan brush and I think is massive
and<00:05:17.900> it's<00:05:18.140> just<00:05:18.380> a<00:05:18.530> little<00:05:18.710> bit<00:05:18.890> too<00:05:19.010> big<00:05:19.160> so

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
and it's just a little bit too big so

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.460 
and it's just a little bit too big so
this<00:05:20.030> will<00:05:20.480> be<00:05:20.810> perfect

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
this will be perfect

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.820 
this will be perfect
I<00:05:21.620> think<00:05:22.070> these<00:05:22.340> are<00:05:22.400> all<00:05:22.760> synthetic<00:05:23.620> if<00:05:24.620> I'm

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
I think these are all synthetic if I'm

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.500 
I think these are all synthetic if I'm
wrong<00:05:25.070> I<00:05:25.400> will<00:05:25.460> let<00:05:25.790> you<00:05:25.910> know<00:05:25.940> but<00:05:26.360> I<00:05:26.390> think

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
wrong I will let you know but I think

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.990 
wrong I will let you know but I think
they're<00:05:26.840> all<00:05:26.960> synthetic<00:05:27.500> but<00:05:28.190> it<00:05:28.550> does<00:05:28.730> feel

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
they're all synthetic but it does feel

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000 
they're all synthetic but it does feel
really<00:05:29.240> nice<00:05:29.570> and<00:05:29.870> soft<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.470> doesn't<00:05:30.860> seem

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
really nice and soft and doesn't seem

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.770 
really nice and soft and doesn't seem
like<00:05:31.130> it's<00:05:31.280> shedding<00:05:31.550> or<00:05:31.760> anything<00:05:31.970> yet<00:05:32.540> I

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
like it's shedding or anything yet I

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.140 
like it's shedding or anything yet I
will<00:05:33.080> give<00:05:33.320> these<00:05:33.500> a<00:05:33.650> wash<00:05:34.010> before<00:05:34.310> I<00:05:34.520> use<00:05:34.910> them

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
will give these a wash before I use them

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.090 
will give these a wash before I use them
I<00:05:35.419> was<00:05:35.780> kind<00:05:35.990> of<00:05:36.020> reading<00:05:36.470> like<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.800> different

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
I was kind of reading like the different

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.920 
I was kind of reading like the different
reviews<00:05:37.460> and<00:05:37.640> whatnot<00:05:37.940> online<00:05:38.360> and<00:05:38.630> a<00:05:38.780> lot<00:05:38.900> of

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
reviews and whatnot online and a lot of

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.210 
reviews and whatnot online and a lot of
people<00:05:39.260> really<00:05:39.530> like<00:05:39.680> this<00:05:39.830> brush

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
people really like this brush

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.980 
people really like this brush
that<00:05:40.400> so<00:05:40.640> hopefully<00:05:40.970> it<00:05:41.060> works<00:05:41.270> out<00:05:41.540> so

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
that so hopefully it works out so

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.500 
that so hopefully it works out so
there's<00:05:42.170> a<00:05:42.260> ton<00:05:42.680> of<00:05:42.710> these<00:05:43.130> really<00:05:43.850> teeny-tiny

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
there's a ton of these really teeny-tiny

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.950 
there's a ton of these really teeny-tiny
eye<00:05:45.260> brushes<00:05:46.040> that<00:05:46.220> I<00:05:46.280> really<00:05:46.730> wanted<00:05:47.270> this

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
eye brushes that I really wanted this

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.680 
eye brushes that I really wanted this
one<00:05:48.320> is<00:05:48.530> specific<00:05:49.250> I<00:05:49.460> thought<00:05:49.850> they<00:05:50.660> just

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
one is specific I thought they just

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.870 
one is specific I thought they just
dropped<00:05:51.110> one<00:05:51.290> this<00:05:51.860> one<00:05:52.070> in<00:05:52.190> specific<00:05:52.730> I

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
dropped one this one in specific I

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.490 
dropped one this one in specific I
thought<00:05:53.060> would<00:05:53.210> be<00:05:53.330> really<00:05:53.360> nice<00:05:53.780> for<00:05:54.050> like

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
thought would be really nice for like

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.860 
thought would be really nice for like
blending<00:05:55.400> out<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:55.730> shadow<00:05:56.030> on<00:05:56.360> your<00:05:56.570> bottom

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
blending out the shadow on your bottom

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.950 
blending out the shadow on your bottom
lashline<00:05:57.380> or<00:05:57.830> maybe<00:05:58.130> even<00:05:58.520> for<00:05:58.790> eyeliner<00:05:59.150> but

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
lashline or maybe even for eyeliner but

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.250 
lashline or maybe even for eyeliner but
this<00:06:00.290> is<00:06:00.440> really<00:06:00.890> soft<00:06:01.840> the<00:06:02.840> police<00:06:03.110> are

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
this is really soft the police are

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.350 
this is really soft the police are
coming<00:06:03.590> at<00:06:03.860> me<00:06:03.980> and<00:06:04.160> then<00:06:04.880> this<00:06:05.060> one<00:06:05.240> I<00:06:05.270> really

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
coming at me and then this one I really

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.900 
coming at me and then this one I really
wanted<00:06:06.050> for<00:06:06.500> my<00:06:06.650> brows<00:06:06.950> but<00:06:07.460> I<00:06:07.490> don't<00:06:07.730> know<00:06:07.820> if

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
wanted for my brows but I don't know if

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.030 
wanted for my brows but I don't know if
it's<00:06:08.030> going<00:06:08.210> to<00:06:08.330> be<00:06:08.540> a<00:06:08.570> little<00:06:08.780> bit<00:06:08.960> too<00:06:09.260> small

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
it's going to be a little bit too small

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.120 
it's going to be a little bit too small
not<00:06:10.940> as<00:06:11.180> dense<00:06:11.540> as<00:06:11.750> I<00:06:11.900> would<00:06:12.080> like<00:06:12.320> but<00:06:12.680> we'll

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
not as dense as I would like but we'll

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.710 
not as dense as I would like but we'll
see<00:06:13.370> if<00:06:13.550> that<00:06:13.580> works<00:06:13.760> out

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
see if that works out

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.430 
see if that works out
and<00:06:15.500> then<00:06:16.160> I<00:06:16.850> wanted<00:06:17.510> to<00:06:17.600> check<00:06:17.780> out<00:06:17.960> these<00:06:18.140> two

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
and then I wanted to check out these two

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.230 
and then I wanted to check out these two
brushes<00:06:18.800> which<00:06:19.010> they<00:06:19.580> look<00:06:19.760> very<00:06:19.790> similar

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
brushes which they look very similar

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.830 
brushes which they look very similar
except<00:06:21.140> one<00:06:21.500> is<00:06:21.860> not<00:06:22.760> as<00:06:22.970> dense<00:06:23.300> as<00:06:23.510> the<00:06:23.690> other

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
except one is not as dense as the other

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.200 
except one is not as dense as the other
I<00:06:23.930> think<00:06:24.080> but<00:06:24.860> these<00:06:25.040> are<00:06:25.250> great<00:06:25.430> for<00:06:25.550> like

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
I think but these are great for like

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.330 
I think but these are great for like
blending<00:06:26.720> out<00:06:26.900> colors<00:06:27.320> in<00:06:27.530> the<00:06:27.620> crease<00:06:27.800> and

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
blending out colors in the crease and

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.700 
blending out colors in the crease and
they're<00:06:28.970> super<00:06:29.300> soft<00:06:29.750> and<00:06:30.290> then<00:06:30.470> the<00:06:30.590> other

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
they're super soft and then the other

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.280 
they're super soft and then the other
one<00:06:30.950> like<00:06:31.100> I<00:06:31.220> said<00:06:31.400> it's<00:06:31.580> not<00:06:31.790> as<00:06:32.060> dense<00:06:32.390> and

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
one like I said it's not as dense and

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.500 
one like I said it's not as dense and
also<00:06:33.590> the<00:06:33.710> ferrule<00:06:34.190> is<00:06:34.340> a<00:06:34.400> little<00:06:34.760> bit<00:06:34.940> thicker

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
also the ferrule is a little bit thicker

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.180 
also the ferrule is a little bit thicker
I<00:06:35.870> don't<00:06:36.169> know<00:06:36.230> that<00:06:36.860> might<00:06:37.040> make<00:06:37.160> a

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
I don't know that might make a

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.430 
I don't know that might make a
difference<00:06:37.390> but<00:06:38.390> this<00:06:38.660> one<00:06:38.870> is<00:06:38.990> a<00:06:39.020> little<00:06:39.230> bit

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
difference but this one is a little bit

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.720 
difference but this one is a little bit
more<00:06:39.560> dense<00:06:39.800> than<00:06:40.010> this<00:06:40.160> one<00:06:40.370> I<00:06:40.400> think<00:06:40.640> the

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
more dense than this one I think the

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.090 
more dense than this one I think the
hair<00:06:40.970> on<00:06:41.210> this<00:06:41.450> one<00:06:41.660> is<00:06:41.960> a<00:06:42.020> little<00:06:42.650> bit<00:06:42.770> longer

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
hair on this one is a little bit longer

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.860 
hair on this one is a little bit longer
so<00:06:43.460> I'm<00:06:43.580> going<00:06:43.820> to<00:06:43.910> play<00:06:44.240> around<00:06:44.360> with<00:06:44.720> these

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
so I'm going to play around with these

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.810 
so I'm going to play around with these
brushes<00:06:45.290> and<00:06:45.740> probably<00:06:46.190> use<00:06:46.340> them<00:06:46.550> in<00:06:46.700> my

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
brushes and probably use them in my

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.330 
brushes and probably use them in my
upcoming<00:06:47.300> tutorials<00:06:47.840> and<00:06:48.080> whatnot<00:06:48.470> they'll

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
upcoming tutorials and whatnot they'll

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.310 
upcoming tutorials and whatnot they'll
have<00:06:49.669> really<00:06:49.850> nice<00:06:50.150> and<00:06:50.419> soft<00:06:50.690> oh<00:06:50.990> and<00:06:51.169> this

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
have really nice and soft oh and this

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.830 
have really nice and soft oh and this
one<00:06:51.530> I<00:06:51.560> really<00:06:51.830> wanted<00:06:52.340> for<00:06:52.550> like<00:06:53.180> blending

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
one I really wanted for like blending

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.170 
one I really wanted for like blending
out<00:06:54.080> shadows<00:06:54.740> oh<00:06:54.770> my<00:06:55.070> god<00:06:55.220> it<00:06:55.460> does<00:06:55.760> feel<00:06:56.150> a

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
out shadows oh my god it does feel a

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.810 
out shadows oh my god it does feel a
little<00:06:56.300> bit<00:06:56.570> stiff<00:06:56.930> though<00:06:57.260> this<00:06:58.250> this

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
little bit stiff though this this

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.850 
little bit stiff though this this
actually<00:06:58.970> seems<00:06:59.450> like<00:06:59.570> a<00:06:59.840> big<00:07:00.290> version<00:07:00.560> of

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
actually seems like a big version of

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.430 
actually seems like a big version of
this<00:07:01.190> guy<00:07:01.490> I<00:07:01.820> don't<00:07:02.090> know<00:07:02.300> we'll<00:07:03.020> play<00:07:03.290> around

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
this guy I don't know we'll play around

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.080 
this guy I don't know we'll play around
with<00:07:03.710> these<00:07:03.830> and<00:07:04.100> see<00:07:04.220> how<00:07:04.370> it<00:07:04.520> works<00:07:04.700> out<00:07:04.880> this

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.090 
with these and see how it works out this

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.990 
with these and see how it works out this
one<00:07:05.270> is<00:07:05.390> just<00:07:05.540> a<00:07:05.720> flat<00:07:06.380> and<00:07:06.740> angled<00:07:07.340> kind<00:07:07.820> of

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
one is just a flat and angled kind of

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.930 
one is just a flat and angled kind of
fluffy<00:07:08.600> shadow<00:07:09.140> brush<00:07:09.530> I<00:07:09.860> like<00:07:10.100> this<00:07:10.250> wait<00:07:10.910> is

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
fluffy shadow brush I like this wait is

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.320 
fluffy shadow brush I like this wait is
this<00:07:11.390> not<00:07:11.660> metal<00:07:12.520> I'm<00:07:13.520> confused

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
this not metal I'm confused

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.350 
this not metal I'm confused
this<00:07:14.450> doesn't<00:07:14.870> look<00:07:14.960> like<00:07:15.169> metal<00:07:15.440> I<00:07:17.140> think

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.390 

is<00:07:20.810> the<00:07:21.050> fair<00:07:21.349> amount<00:07:21.650> made<00:07:21.830> of<00:07:21.949> metal

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 
is the fair amount made of metal

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.809 
is the fair amount made of metal
somebody<00:07:22.759> tell<00:07:23.030> me<00:07:23.259> or<00:07:24.259> maybe<00:07:24.560> this<00:07:25.129> part<00:07:25.550> is

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:25.819 
somebody tell me or maybe this part is

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:30.369 
somebody tell me or maybe this part is
metal<00:07:26.599> and<00:07:27.370> then<00:07:28.370> this<00:07:28.610> part<00:07:29.030> is<00:07:29.379> rubberized

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:30.379 
metal and then this part is rubberized

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:34.119 
metal and then this part is rubberized
to<00:07:31.069> protect<00:07:31.430> it<00:07:31.639> if<00:07:32.389> it<00:07:32.599> is<00:07:32.770> that<00:07:33.770> might<00:07:33.949> be<00:07:34.099> a

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:34.129 
to protect it if it is that might be a

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:37.450 
to protect it if it is that might be a
very<00:07:34.189> smart<00:07:34.639> thing<00:07:34.729> but<00:07:35.270> if<00:07:35.360> it's<00:07:35.539> not<00:07:35.780> I<00:07:36.460> don't

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.460 
very smart thing but if it's not I don't

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.550
