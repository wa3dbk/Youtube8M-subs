okay<00:00:03.689> in<00:00:03.840> this<00:00:03.899> video<00:00:04.230> we're<00:00:04.380> going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.530> look

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
okay in this video we're going to look

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.730 
okay in this video we're going to look
at<00:00:04.770> how<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:04.950> simplify<00:00:05.280> a<00:00:05.460> nested<00:00:06.030> fraction

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
at how to simplify a nested fraction

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.329 
at how to simplify a nested fraction
here<00:00:07.740> we<00:00:07.950> have<00:00:08.099> y<00:00:08.370> minus<00:00:08.969> 2i<00:00:09.870> minus<00:00:10.139> 2y<00:00:10.740> minus<00:00:11.070> 7

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:11.339 
here we have y minus 2i minus 2y minus 7

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:18.490 
here we have y minus 2i minus 2y minus 7
over<00:00:11.459> 7<00:00:12.230> over<00:00:14.240> 35<00:00:15.240> over<00:00:15.660> 21<00:00:16.020> plus<00:00:16.440> 7<00:00:17.400> over<00:00:17.460> 3<00:00:17.610> y

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
over 7 over 35 over 21 plus 7 over 3 y

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.100 
over 7 over 35 over 21 plus 7 over 3 y
so<00:00:19.700> let's<00:00:20.700> drink<00:00:20.910> with<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.360> a<00:00:21.450> complicated

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
so let's drink with it's a complicated

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.660 
so let's drink with it's a complicated
thing<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.500> yes<00:00:22.740> let's<00:00:22.950> do<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.250> little<00:00:23.430> bit

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
thing like yes let's do it a little bit

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.270 
thing like yes let's do it a little bit
at<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> time<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.510> little<00:00:24.600> bits<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.530> time<00:00:25.590> so

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.280 
at a time a little bits at a time so

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.820 
at a time a little bits at a time so
first<00:00:26.520> of<00:00:26.640> all<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.880> 7<00:00:27.320> this<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.380> kind<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.710> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
first of all this 7 this is kind of a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.960 
first of all this 7 this is kind of a
block<00:00:29.040> should<00:00:29.190> have<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.400> fraction<00:00:29.790> in<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
block should have a fraction in a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.930 
block should have a fraction in a
fraction<00:00:30.420> multiply<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.320> top<00:00:31.710> fraction<00:00:32.369> here

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
fraction multiply the top fraction here

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.340 
fraction multiply the top fraction here
all<00:00:33.929> this<00:00:34.350> by<00:00:35.010> 7<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.109> all<00:00:37.109> this<00:00:37.499> by<00:00:38.309> 7<00:00:39.350> now

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
all this by 7 and all this by 7 now

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.700 
all this by 7 and all this by 7 now
that'll<00:00:40.890> simplify<00:00:41.039> things<00:00:41.339> out<00:00:41.899> will<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.379> 7

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
that'll simplify things out will the 7

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.520 
that'll simplify things out will the 7
over<00:00:43.859> 7<00:00:43.980> will<00:00:44.190> cancel<00:00:44.550> out<00:00:44.989> we'll<00:00:45.989> get<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> 7

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
over 7 will cancel out we'll get a 7

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.380 
over 7 will cancel out we'll get a 7
times<00:00:46.769> y<00:00:47.069> which<00:00:47.399> gives<00:00:47.699> us<00:00:48.319> 7<00:00:49.370> y<00:00:51.140> minus<00:00:52.140> 2y

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
times y which gives us 7 y minus 2y

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.569 
times y which gives us 7 y minus 2y
minus<00:00:54.390> 7<00:00:54.899> over<00:00:58.069> I'm<00:00:59.069> sure<00:00:59.249> we<00:00:59.339> can<00:00:59.429> see

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
minus 7 over I'm sure we can see

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.819 
minus 7 over I'm sure we can see
ourselves<00:01:00.050> ok<00:01:01.050> 7<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.499> here<00:01:02.300> 21<00:01:03.300> that's<00:01:03.899> 3

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
ourselves ok 7 down here 21 that's 3

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:10.209 
ourselves ok 7 down here 21 that's 3
times<00:01:05.129> 7<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.409> 7<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.340> top<00:01:08.369> 7<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.060> bottom

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
times 7 so we can 7 on top 7 on bottom

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.990 
times 7 so we can 7 on top 7 on bottom
set<00:01:11.219> which<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.700> no<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.570> cancels<00:01:12.930> out<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.259> we<00:01:13.380> got

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
set which is no it cancels out so we got

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.950 
set which is no it cancels out so we got
35<00:01:15.229> over<00:01:16.229> 3<00:01:16.829> but<00:01:17.399> we<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.579> the<00:01:17.670> 7<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.299> 7<00:01:18.930> here

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
35 over 3 but we have the 7 here 7 here

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.789 
35 over 3 but we have the 7 here 7 here
owes<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> cancelled<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:20.030> plus<00:01:21.030> 7<00:01:21.990> times<00:01:22.200> 7<00:01:22.560> set

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
owes it cancelled out plus 7 times 7 set

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.760 
owes it cancelled out plus 7 times 7 set
them<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:22.950> top<00:01:23.130> 7<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.549> top<00:01:23.789> we<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.659> 7<00:01:25.259> squared

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
them on top 7 on top we have 7 squared

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.069 
them on top 7 on top we have 7 squared
that's<00:01:26.250> 49<00:01:26.610> over<00:01:27.409> 3y<00:01:29.090> okay<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.420> more<00:01:30.810> simple

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that's 49 over 3y okay it's more simple

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.300 
that's 49 over 3y okay it's more simple
than<00:01:31.289> it<00:01:31.409> was<00:01:32.990> let's<00:01:33.990> take<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.859> step<00:01:35.039> further

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
than it was let's take it a step further

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.819 
than it was let's take it a step further
7<00:01:36.299> y<00:01:36.590> 2y<00:01:37.880> okay<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.210> now<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.600> let's<00:01:40.530> rewrite

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
7 y 2y okay we now have let's rewrite

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.240 
7 y 2y okay we now have let's rewrite
that<00:01:41.039> as<00:01:43.100> 5y<00:01:45.530> try<00:01:46.530> career<00:01:46.799> where<00:01:47.039> you<00:01:47.070> guys

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
that as 5y try career where you guys

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.660 
that as 5y try career where you guys
were<00:01:47.429> need<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.000> see<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.329> 5y<00:01:49.320> minus<00:01:49.399> 7<00:01:50.399> over<00:01:52.070> 3<00:01:54.530> 35

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
were need to see it 5y minus 7 over 3 35

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.590 
were need to see it 5y minus 7 over 3 35
3<00:01:57.020> ok<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.140> need<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.350> simplify<00:01:58.590> further<00:01:59.100> though

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
3 ok we need to simplify further though

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.910 
3 ok we need to simplify further though
we<00:02:00.600> sell<00:02:00.749> these<00:02:00.899> fractions<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.499> the<00:02:01.590> bottom

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
we sell these fractions in the bottom

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.830 
we sell these fractions in the bottom
and<00:02:02.070> that's<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.579> obnoxious<00:02:02.840> who

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and that's just kind of obnoxious who

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.750 
and that's just kind of obnoxious who
wants<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> deal<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.380> that

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.080 

so<00:02:07.420> fresh<00:02:08.380> sheet<00:02:08.560> of<00:02:08.650> paper<00:02:08.800> do<00:02:09.520> not<00:02:09.700> be<00:02:09.910> afraid

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
so fresh sheet of paper do not be afraid

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.180 
so fresh sheet of paper do not be afraid
to<00:02:10.210> use<00:02:10.360> fresh<00:02:10.570> sheets<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.870> paper<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:12.010> keep

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
to use fresh sheets of paper you keep

will pay dividends and make your work
much<00:02:16.960> easier<00:02:17.790> okay<00:02:18.820> so<00:02:19.120> we<00:02:19.270> have<00:02:20.670> right<00:02:21.670> here

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
much easier okay so we have right here

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.700 
much easier okay so we have right here
on<00:02:24.160> top<00:02:24.580> we<00:02:24.820> have<00:02:25.000> 5y<00:02:25.930> minus<00:02:26.460> seven<00:02:28.590> what<00:02:29.590> do<00:02:29.650> we

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
on top we have 5y minus seven what do we

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.200 
on top we have 5y minus seven what do we
do<00:02:29.830> -<00:02:29.920> here<00:02:30.070> is<00:02:30.160> simplifying<00:02:30.640> let<00:02:30.910> me<00:02:30.970> back<00:02:31.180> up

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
do - here is simplifying let me back up

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
do - here is simplifying let me back up
just<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.630> second<00:02:33.390> we<00:02:34.390> need<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.630> simplify<00:02:34.900> so

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
just a second we need to simplify so

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.130 
just a second we need to simplify so
let's<00:02:35.380> multiply<00:02:35.910> 3y<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.270> top<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.050> on<00:02:38.080> bottom

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
let's multiply 3y on top and on bottom

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.420 
let's multiply 3y on top and on bottom
that'll<00:02:39.010> simplify<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.460> bottom<00:02:39.850> down<00:02:39.970> here<00:02:41.430> so

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
that'll simplify the bottom down here so

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.200 
that'll simplify the bottom down here so
on<00:02:42.640> top<00:02:42.940> we'll<00:02:43.300> have<00:02:44.700> 3y<00:02:46.020> times<00:02:48.180> 5y<00:02:49.180> minus

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
on top we'll have 3y times 5y minus

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:57.510 
on top we'll have 3y times 5y minus
seven<00:02:50.170> oh<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.930> gets<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:53.770> okay<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:57.250> on<00:02:57.460> the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
times 35 over three 3s will cancel out

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:13.080 
times 35 over three 3s will cancel out
we're<00:03:05.620> left<00:03:05.740> with<00:03:06.390> 35<00:03:07.390> y<00:03:10.530> 3y<00:03:11.530> times<00:03:12.100> three<00:03:12.400> 49

will cancel out were left with 49 okay
nice<00:03:20.950> this<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.459> much<00:03:21.760> simpler<00:03:22.090> fraction

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
nice this is a much simpler fraction

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.979 
nice this is a much simpler fraction
question<00:03:25.120> let's<00:03:25.330> see<00:03:25.450> can<00:03:25.660> we<00:03:25.690> factor

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
question let's see can we factor

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.110 
question let's see can we factor
anything<00:03:26.410> down<00:03:26.560> here<00:03:27.130> because<00:03:27.820> in<00:03:28.000> general

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
anything down here because in general

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.220 
anything down here because in general
you<00:03:28.360> want<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.540> make<00:03:28.660> sure<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:28.870> factor

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
you want to make sure you factor

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.740 
you want to make sure you factor
everything<00:03:29.470> you're<00:03:29.800> gonna<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:31.360> might<00:03:31.540> miss

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
everything you're gonna you might miss

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.870 
everything you're gonna you might miss
something<00:03:32.160> okay<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:33.220> let's<00:03:33.489> see<00:03:33.610> we<00:03:33.730> can

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
something okay so let's see we can

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.550 
something okay so let's see we can
factor<00:03:34.270> out<00:03:34.420> of<00:03:34.450> seven<00:03:34.989> out<00:03:35.080> of<00:03:35.200> both<00:03:35.350> of<00:03:35.500> these

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
factor out of seven out of both of these

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.320 
factor out of seven out of both of these
terms<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.400> would<00:03:37.300> give<00:03:37.600> us

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
terms that would give us

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:47.520 
terms that would give us
I'll<00:03:40.330> see<00:03:40.570> 3y<00:03:41.230> over<00:03:41.880> seven<00:03:45.510> 5y<00:03:46.510> minus<00:03:46.540> seven

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
I'll see 3y over seven 5y minus seven

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.310 
I'll see 3y over seven 5y minus seven
over<00:03:47.709> oh<00:03:48.430> look<00:03:49.420> at<00:03:49.570> that<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:52.120> have<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.270> 5y<00:03:52.810> over<00:03:52.959> 7

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
over oh look at that we have a 5y over 7

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.900 
over oh look at that we have a 5y over 7
over<00:03:53.530> 5<00:03:53.739> y<00:03:53.890> over<00:03:54.070> seven<00:03:56.250> those<00:03:57.250> two<00:03:57.670> will

over 5 y over seven those two will

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:06.270 
over 5 y over seven those two will
