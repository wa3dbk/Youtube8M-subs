hi<00:00:05.790> there<00:00:06.290> I<00:00:07.290> wanted<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.920> do<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> test<00:00:08.340> because<00:00:09.210> I

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:09.299 
hi there I wanted to do a test because I

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.289 
hi there I wanted to do a test because I
noticed<00:00:09.629> that<00:00:09.690> my<00:00:10.340> sparge<00:00:11.340> water<00:00:11.459> when<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> am

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:12.299 
noticed that my sparge water when I am

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.250 
noticed that my sparge water when I am
doing<00:00:12.869> all<00:00:12.990> grain<00:00:13.910> tends<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.000> come<00:00:15.180> out

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
doing all grain tends to come out

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.070 
doing all grain tends to come out
considerably<00:00:16.260> cooler<00:00:16.619> than<00:00:17.400> what<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:18.080> recipe

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
considerably cooler than what the recipe

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.609 
considerably cooler than what the recipe
calls<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.440> the<00:00:19.650> actual<00:00:20.190> sparge<00:00:20.520> water<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:21.060> be

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
calls for the actual sparge water to be

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.079 
calls for the actual sparge water to be
I'm<00:00:22.619> usually<00:00:22.769> around<00:00:23.039> 168<00:00:25.249> when<00:00:26.249> I<00:00:26.339> did<00:00:26.999> the

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.089 
I'm usually around 168 when I did the

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.429 
I'm usually around 168 when I did the
last<00:00:27.269> couple<00:00:27.509> batches<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.839> noticed<00:00:28.169> that<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
last couple batches I noticed that it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.790 
last couple batches I noticed that it
was<00:00:28.560> coming<00:00:29.369> out<00:00:29.839> anywhere<00:00:30.839> depending<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.679> how

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
was coming out anywhere depending on how

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.520 
was coming out anywhere depending on how
slow<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> would<00:00:32.910> drain<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.390> Oh<00:00:33.710> between<00:00:34.910> 148<00:00:36.530> 155

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
slow I would drain it Oh between 148 155

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.910 
slow I would drain it Oh between 148 155
which<00:00:38.040> means<00:00:38.310> it's<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:39.300> cooling<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.920> some

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
which means it's it's cooling out some

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.400 
which means it's it's cooling out some
as<00:00:41.130> it<00:00:41.280> comes<00:00:41.490> out<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.790> ball<00:00:41.970> valve<00:00:42.410> down

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
as it comes out of this ball valve down

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.750 
as it comes out of this ball valve down
the<00:00:43.590> tube<00:00:43.830> into<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.990> fly<00:00:45.990> sparge<00:00:46.760> dispenser

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the tube into this fly sparge dispenser

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.960 
the tube into this fly sparge dispenser
so<00:00:47.970> I<00:00:48.180> set<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.630> a<00:00:48.750> little<00:00:48.870> test<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.970> how

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
so I set up a little test to see how

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.820 
so I set up a little test to see how
this<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.120> gonna<00:00:51.270> work<00:00:51.470> because<00:00:52.470> I<00:00:52.530> wanted<00:00:52.770> to

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
this is gonna work because I wanted to

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.920 
this is gonna work because I wanted to
make<00:00:53.250> some<00:00:53.430> calculations<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> what<00:00:54.810> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
make some calculations as to what the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.270 
make some calculations as to what the
actual<00:00:55.050> temperature<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.680> water<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.040> I<00:00:56.160> need

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
actual temperature the water is I need

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.710 
actual temperature the water is I need
to<00:00:56.370> put<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:58.700> and<00:00:59.700> what<00:01:00.180> actually<00:01:00.360> comes

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
to put in here and what actually comes

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.530 
to put in here and what actually comes
out<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.740> the<00:01:01.950> dispenser<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:02.970> I've<00:01:03.090> got<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
out at the dispenser and so I've got a

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.170 
out at the dispenser and so I've got a
cup<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.259> pots<00:01:04.470> boiling<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.519> usually<00:01:05.939> do

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
cup of pots boiling here I usually do

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.880 
cup of pots boiling here I usually do
this<00:01:06.299> out<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> garage<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.590> didn't<00:01:07.740> want

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
this out the garage I just didn't want

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.730 
this out the garage I just didn't want
to<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> full<00:01:08.430> set<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:09.350> I'm<00:01:10.350> gonna<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:10.590> some

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
to do the full set up I'm gonna get some

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.410 
to do the full set up I'm gonna get some
water<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.009> there<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.609> it<00:01:11.700> boiling<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.210> about

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
water in there get it boiling it's about

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.190 
water in there get it boiling it's about
1

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
1

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200 
1
I'll<00:01:13.619> give<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.829> a<00:01:13.950> temperature<00:01:14.429> about<00:01:14.609> 190

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
I'll give it a temperature about 190

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.039 
I'll give it a temperature about 190
another<00:01:16.079> 200<00:01:16.679> and<00:01:16.859> then<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.310> I'll<00:01:17.399> do<00:01:17.579> is

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
another 200 and then what I'll do is

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.249 
another 200 and then what I'll do is
take<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.109> temperature<00:01:19.469> reading<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:21.109> cool<00:01:22.109> it

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
take a temperature reading and cool it

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.880 
take a temperature reading and cool it
off<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.619> needed<00:01:23.039> and<00:01:24.259> until<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.350> reach<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
off as needed and until I reach the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.370 
off as needed and until I reach the
target<00:01:26.249> temperature<00:01:26.399> of<00:01:26.969> 168<00:01:27.719> coming<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.289> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
target temperature of 168 coming out of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.840 
target temperature of 168 coming out of
the<00:01:28.439> dispenser<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.670> would<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:30.560> sparge

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
the dispenser which would then sparge

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.809 
the dispenser which would then sparge
the<00:01:33.619> actual<00:01:35.450> mash<00:01:36.450> at<00:01:36.749> about<00:01:37.460> 168<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
the actual mash at about 168 and

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:45.169 
the actual mash at about 168 and
hopefully<00:01:39.179> be<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:40.020> goal<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:43.729> okay<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.759> what<00:01:45.149> I

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
hopefully be the goal so okay so what I

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.929 
hopefully be the goal so okay so what I
got<00:01:45.389> going<00:01:45.719> here<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.280> calculated<00:01:47.819> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
got going here now is I calculated the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.679 
got going here now is I calculated the
flow<00:01:48.179> rate<00:01:48.709> about<00:01:49.709> two<00:01:49.979> cups<00:01:50.280> per<00:01:51.149> minute<00:01:51.539> I

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
flow rate about two cups per minute I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.679 
flow rate about two cups per minute I
want<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> average<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.009> out<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.759> you

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
want to average this out so that you

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.300 
want to average this out so that you
know<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:55.079> get<00:01:55.350> about<00:01:55.530> four<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.100> five

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
know I can get about four to five

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.889 
know I can get about four to five
gallons<00:01:56.999> out<00:01:57.179> over<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> 45<00:01:58.319> minute<00:01:58.649> period<00:01:59.899> and

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
gallons out over a 45 minute period and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.539 
gallons out over a 45 minute period and
as<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.289> see<00:02:01.439> I'm<00:02:01.560> sparging<00:02:02.130> here<00:02:02.399> I'm

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
as you can see I'm sparging here I'm

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.359 
as you can see I'm sparging here I'm
about<00:02:05.240> almost<00:02:06.240> 30<00:02:06.569> seconds<00:02:07.049> into<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.799> at

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
about almost 30 seconds into it and at

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.550 
about almost 30 seconds into it and at
about<00:02:08.490> 1<00:02:08.880> cup<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.330> that's<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.539> decent<00:02:09.780> flow<00:02:10.319> rate

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
about 1 cup so that's a decent flow rate

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.100 
about 1 cup so that's a decent flow rate
for<00:02:11.160> sparging<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.540> gonna<00:02:12.659> rinse<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
for sparging this is gonna rinse the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.229 
for sparging this is gonna rinse the
grains<00:02:13.349> real<00:02:13.560> well<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.489> temperature-wise

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
grains real well and temperature-wise

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.309 
grains real well and temperature-wise
I'm<00:02:15.810> looking

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
I'm looking

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:24.440 
I'm looking
about<00:02:17.180> 175<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.980> that's<00:02:23.249> gonna<00:02:23.489> count<00:02:24.060> for<00:02:24.329> all

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
about 175 and that's gonna count for all

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.300 
about 175 and that's gonna count for all
the<00:02:24.659> cooling<00:02:25.139> down<00:02:25.290> as<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.739> goes<00:02:25.769> down<00:02:25.920> his

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
the cooling down as it goes down his

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.250 
the cooling down as it goes down his
tube<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.540> see<00:02:27.659> my<00:02:27.870> initial

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
tube and you can see my initial

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.849 
tube and you can see my initial
temperature<00:02:28.709> here<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.249> that<00:02:29.659> one<00:02:33.109> 192<00:02:34.109> to

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
temperature here is that one 192 to

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:40.699 
temperature here is that one 192 to
start<00:02:35.159> with<00:02:38.269> that's<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.389> decent<00:02:39.540> rate<00:02:39.959> but<00:02:40.349> a

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
start with that's a decent rate but a

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.309 
start with that's a decent rate but a
little<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.099> warm<00:02:41.310> side<00:02:41.930> still<00:02:42.930> I'm

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
little on the warm side still I'm

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.709 
little on the warm side still I'm
looking<00:02:43.650> at<00:02:45.290> 176<00:02:46.290> kind<00:02:47.159> of<00:02:47.310> now<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:48.540> there's

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
looking at 176 kind of now and there's

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:49.699 
looking at 176 kind of now and there's
about<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.930> minute<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.439> could<00:02:49.560> probably

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
about a minute so I could probably

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.490 
about a minute so I could probably
increase<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.189> flow<00:02:50.400> rate<00:02:50.609> just<00:02:50.909> a<00:02:51.000> little<00:02:51.209> bit

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
increase the flow rate just a little bit

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.330 
increase the flow rate just a little bit
so<00:02:52.500> I'm<00:02:52.590> gonna<00:02:52.680> keep<00:02:52.859> a<00:02:52.980> track<00:02:53.280> here<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.799> see

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
so I'm gonna keep a track here and see

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.879 
so I'm gonna keep a track here and see
the<00:02:57.299> temperature<00:02:57.689> variances<00:02:58.169> as<00:02:58.349> it<00:02:58.500> changes

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
the temperature variances as it changes

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.429 
the temperature variances as it changes
as<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> temperature<00:02:59.489> cools<00:02:59.699> off<00:03:00.000> as<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.959> cooler

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
as a temperature cools off as a cooler

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.390 
as a temperature cools off as a cooler
water<00:03:01.769> now<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.639> liquor<00:03:03.540> tank<00:03:04.129> okay<00:03:05.129> we're

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
water now to the liquor tank okay we're

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.020 
water now to the liquor tank okay we're
back<00:03:05.549> again<00:03:05.939> now<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:07.310> my<00:03:08.310> target<00:03:08.549> temperature

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
back again now and my target temperature

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.589 
back again now and my target temperature
looks<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.449> be<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> right<00:03:10.620> around<00:03:11.359> 180<00:03:12.359> now

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
looks to be a right around 180 now

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.599 
looks to be a right around 180 now
inside<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.319> just<00:03:13.530> keep<00:03:13.709> recirculating<00:03:14.489> this

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
inside I just keep recirculating this

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.539 
inside I just keep recirculating this
water<00:03:15.359> as<00:03:15.569> I'm<00:03:15.689> using<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.139> it<00:03:16.199> seems<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:16.889> drop

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
water as I'm using and it seems to drop

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.170 
water as I'm using and it seems to drop
every<00:03:17.909> time<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.449> couple<00:03:18.870> degrees<00:03:19.230> so

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
every time I do this a couple degrees so

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.559 
every time I do this a couple degrees so
good<00:03:21.180> flow<00:03:21.389> rate<00:03:21.629> and<00:03:23.239> it's<00:03:24.239> looking<00:03:24.509> like

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
good flow rate and it's looking like

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.129 
good flow rate and it's looking like
about<00:03:24.870> 12<00:03:25.319> degrees<00:03:26.299> in<00:03:27.299> addition<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.989> this

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
about 12 degrees in addition to this

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.830 
about 12 degrees in addition to this
large<00:03:28.470> temperature<00:03:29.069> is<00:03:29.220> what<00:03:29.400> I'm<00:03:29.720> coming<00:03:30.720> out

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
large temperature is what I'm coming out

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.439 
large temperature is what I'm coming out
to<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:32.459> just<00:03:33.060> gonna<00:03:33.209> give<00:03:33.359> you<00:03:33.389> an<00:03:33.509> idea<00:03:35.449> my

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
to and just gonna give you an idea my

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.679 
to and just gonna give you an idea my
results<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.290> did<00:03:37.769> find<00:03:38.099> that<00:03:38.509> when<00:03:39.509> the

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
results I did find that when the

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.659 
results I did find that when the
disperser<00:03:40.560> tip<00:03:40.829> is<00:03:41.419> flush<00:03:42.419> as<00:03:43.290> I'm<00:03:43.470> filling<00:03:43.829> it

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
disperser tip is flush as I'm filling it

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.699 
disperser tip is flush as I'm filling it
I'll<00:03:45.090> keep<00:03:45.629> it<00:03:45.810> flush<00:03:46.049> with<00:03:46.259> the<00:03:46.349> top<00:03:46.409> of<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
I'll keep it flush with the top of the

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.599 
I'll keep it flush with the top of the
water<00:03:46.949> in<00:03:47.129> that<00:03:47.159> cup<00:03:48.829> it<00:03:49.829> tends<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.459> be<00:03:50.549> a

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
water in that cup it tends to be a

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.309 
water in that cup it tends to be a
couple<00:03:50.879> degrees<00:03:50.970> warmer<00:03:51.780> than<00:03:51.930> when<00:03:52.199> it's

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
couple degrees warmer than when it's

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.339 
couple degrees warmer than when it's
allowed<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.560> drip<00:03:52.979> from<00:03:53.970> dispenser<00:03:54.540> down<00:03:54.780> into

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
allowed to drip from dispenser down into

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.569 
allowed to drip from dispenser down into
the<00:03:55.500> cup<00:03:55.889> it<00:03:56.009> actually<00:03:56.280> will<00:03:56.370> cool<00:03:56.549> off

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
the cup it actually will cool off

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.020 
the cup it actually will cool off
another<00:03:56.970> couple<00:03:57.269> degrees<00:03:57.659> okay<00:03:58.169> guys<00:03:58.669> now<00:03:59.669> I

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
another couple degrees okay guys now I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.849 
another couple degrees okay guys now I
finished<00:04:00.509> his<00:04:00.780> test<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.349> actually<00:04:01.530> went<00:04:01.799> and

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
finished his test I actually went and

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.490 
finished his test I actually went and
saw<00:04:02.370> moved<00:04:02.729> the<00:04:02.849> family<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.449> came<00:04:04.139> back<00:04:04.169> and

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
saw moved the family and came back and

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.280 
saw moved the family and came back and
just<00:04:04.590> ran<00:04:04.799> all<00:04:04.979> these<00:04:05.129> numbers<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.930> what<00:04:07.049> I<00:04:07.079> did

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
just ran all these numbers so what I did

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.619 
just ran all these numbers so what I did
is<00:04:07.409> I<00:04:07.530> decided<00:04:08.519> to<00:04:08.879> have<00:04:09.030> two<00:04:09.299> different

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
is I decided to have two different

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.449 
is I decided to have two different
columns<00:04:10.169> and<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.650> did<00:04:10.889> this<00:04:10.949> in<00:04:11.129> Excel<00:04:13.310> one<00:04:14.310> with

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
columns and I did this in Excel one with

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.240 
columns and I did this in Excel one with
the<00:04:14.519> numbers<00:04:15.169> dealing<00:04:16.169> with<00:04:16.289> the<00:04:16.469> 2<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:17.039> 3-inch

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
the numbers dealing with the 2 to 3-inch

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.909 
the numbers dealing with the 2 to 3-inch
sparge<00:04:17.669> trickle<00:04:18.509> kind<00:04:18.780> of<00:04:18.930> in<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.829> other

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
sparge trickle kind of in the other

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.399 
sparge trickle kind of in the other
numbers<00:04:20.849> with<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.359> actual<00:04:21.840> readings<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:22.229> got

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
numbers with the actual readings I got

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.550 
numbers with the actual readings I got
from<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.680> level<00:04:23.750> barge<00:04:24.750> right<00:04:24.990> on<00:04:25.139> top<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.500> the

man

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.230 
man
and<00:04:27.070> looks<00:04:28.070> like<00:04:28.130> after<00:04:28.760> it's<00:04:28.880> all<00:04:28.970> said<00:04:29.000> done

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
and looks like after it's all said done

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.330 
and looks like after it's all said done
there's<00:04:29.990> on<00:04:30.260> average<00:04:30.680> maybe<00:04:30.890> about<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.130> two

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
there's on average maybe about a two

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.580 
there's on average maybe about a two
degree<00:04:31.490> difference<00:04:32.000> between<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.690> two<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:35.590> on

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
degree difference between the two and on

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.770 
degree difference between the two and on
an<00:04:36.710> average<00:04:36.830> room<00:04:37.100> temperature<00:04:37.610> about<00:04:38.120> 78

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
an average room temperature about 78

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.640 
an average room temperature about 78
degrees<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:40.370> looks<00:04:40.550> like<00:04:40.670> I'd<00:04:40.820> want<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.650> do

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
degrees it looks like I'd want to do

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.640 
degrees it looks like I'd want to do
about<00:04:42.830> an<00:04:42.920> 11<00:04:43.250> degree<00:04:43.490> increase<00:04:43.910> on<00:04:44.210> the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
about an 11 degree increase on the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.940 
about an 11 degree increase on the
liquor<00:04:45.650> tank<00:04:45.920> water<00:04:46.220> so<00:04:46.460> my<00:04:46.700> goals<00:04:46.940> around<00:04:47.150> 68

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
this kind of looks populate it's really

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.960 
this kind of looks populate it's really
not<00:05:06.770> that<00:05:06.830> complicated<00:05:07.280> it's<00:05:07.520> kind<00:05:07.730> of<00:05:07.760> fun

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
not that complicated it's kind of fun

future when you want to do some sparging
and<00:05:22.490> you<00:05:23.090> want<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.270> get<00:05:23.360> those<00:05:23.480> numbers<00:05:23.810> exact

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
and you want to get those numbers exact

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.180 
and you want to get those numbers exact
as<00:05:24.650> possible<00:05:25.000> but<00:05:26.000> I<00:05:26.300> know<00:05:26.450> as<00:05:26.690> I'll<00:05:27.230> look

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
as possible but I know as I'll look

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.500 
as possible but I know as I'll look
scientific<00:05:28.820> it<00:05:28.910> really<00:05:29.180> isn't<00:05:29.330> that

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
scientific it really isn't that

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.480 
scientific it really isn't that
complicated<00:05:29.960> when<00:05:30.740> it's<00:05:30.980> all<00:05:31.100> said<00:05:31.310> and<00:05:31.370> done

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
complicated when it's all said and done

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.770 
complicated when it's all said and done
and<00:05:31.760> you<00:05:31.820> can<00:05:31.970> get<00:05:32.090> a<00:05:32.120> lot<00:05:32.270> of<00:05:32.360> these<00:05:32.450> numbers<00:05:32.750> I

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
and you can get a lot of these numbers I

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.500 
and you can get a lot of these numbers I
averaged<00:05:33.170> out<00:05:34.060> and<00:05:35.060> you<00:05:35.180> don't<00:05:35.330> even

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
averaged out and you don't even

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.150 
averaged out and you don't even
necessarily<00:05:35.720> need<00:05:36.080> to<00:05:36.110> be<00:05:36.170> his<00:05:36.410> exact<00:05:36.800> as<00:05:36.980> I've

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
necessarily need to be his exact as I've

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.880 
necessarily need to be his exact as I've
got<00:05:37.970> it<00:05:38.090> here<00:05:38.300> it<00:05:38.420> just<00:05:38.650> sometimes<00:05:39.650> it<00:05:39.740> makes

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
got it here it just sometimes it makes

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.440 
got it here it just sometimes it makes
it<00:05:40.010> interesting<00:05:40.340> to<00:05:40.640> see<00:05:40.820> how<00:05:40.940> exact<00:05:41.300> you<00:05:41.419> can

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
it interesting to see how exact you can

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.070 
it interesting to see how exact you can
get<00:05:41.690> it<00:05:41.860> thanks<00:05:42.860> guys<00:05:43.040> this<00:05:43.700> is<00:05:43.850> Matt<00:05:44.060> by<00:05:45.020> the
