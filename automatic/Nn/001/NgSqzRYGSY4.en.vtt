00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.100
 good afternoon dear channel viewers 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.170
 newspaper grower video 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.170
 to get a good crop of cucumbers 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.689
 need a little time to water 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.300
 feed create favorable 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.950
 conditions and correct including 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.129
 form a cucumber bush 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.390
 exactly about the formation of the cucumber plant in 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.219
 greenhouse we today and we will talk 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.950
 cucumbers have a great escape 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.590
 educational ability if 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.129
 do not pinch the leaves in time 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.270
 quickly capture all the greenhouse space 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.460
 so there will be a big expense 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.969
 nutrient growth on lashes 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.190
 of course to the detriment of the ripening of the crop except 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.830
 addition leaves will shade each other 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.420
 what can provoke a number of diseases 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.869
 since in greenhouses now 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.500
 most gardeners grow 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.780
 parthenocarpic hybrid and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.689
 that is, cucumbers that do not require for 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.630
 dusting presence of insects and wind then we 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.330
 and let's talk about shaping 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.070
 parthenocarpic hybrid of greenhouses 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.040
 let's set the vectors first 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.820
 plant growth directions in greenhouses 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.070
 Cucumber grows vertical and to 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.189
 shrub rose cucumber upright us 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.130
 you need to tie it up first and then 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.110
 vertically up 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.780
 tie up the plants when it reaches 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.960
 about 30 centimeters high 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.970
 if you're late with suspension and plants 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.280
 already lay on the ground nothing terrible 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.520
 only in this case will have to be 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.729
 be careful not to break the stem 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.000
 cucumber for tying cucumber plants 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.960
 any strong ropes and twine are suitable and 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.429
 that withstand wet environments 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.700
 Stalks plant in any case not 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.520
 pull over the gap as 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.870
 trunk diameter will increase with 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.209
 Growing plants do a loop under 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.150
 second or third real leaf 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.340
 tie the other end of the rope to 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.090
 top bar or wire 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.000
 the greenhouses strung up above the twine itself is not 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.330
 should be stringed he should 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.510
 be slightly relaxed then the plants 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.670
 gently direct up 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.360
 we twist it around the twine 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.280
 making a turn under each leaf if 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.440
 do it carelessly then plants can 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.829
 just slide the rope under the weight 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.829
 fruits 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.970
 at the very beginning of the development of the plant on 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.420
 the main stem dazzle all nodes 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:08.500
 up to 3 4 of this sheet that is 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.890
 pinch all shoots from the ovary to 3 4 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.890
 sheet 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.290
 this area is conventionally called a zone 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.900
 glare above it to a height of 1 meter 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:31.750
 pinch lateral shoots 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:34.510
 sheet while leaving one entry on 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.330
 height from meter to one and a half nip 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.380
 do over the second sheet leaving 2 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.870
 ovary above this zone 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.060
 nip over the third or 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.980
 the fourth leaf leaving 34 ovary but 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.470
 what to do when the main stem 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.330
 will reach the trellis wire or 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.180
 crossbar on which tied 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.380
 plants 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.790
 there are different ways of forming 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.530
 Cucumber bush above this level can 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.770
 just two times to throw a bush around 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.590
 crossbar and lower it down into 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.670
 pinching shoots spend over third 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.700
 or fourth leaf leaving 34 ovary 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.000
 shoot growth is suspended by 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.930
 Sewing when they reach 1 meter from 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.930
 soil surface 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.580
 the second way is the main stem 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.240
 pinch when it outgrows the level 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.440
 trellis 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.440
 20-30 centimeters from the top nodes 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.620
 main stem down 1 2 side 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.010
 shoots that pinch every 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.470
 50 centimeters from the sinus 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.250
 last leaf leave escape 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.800
 continued shoot growth 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.100
 suspend in the same way 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:02.350
 I pinch them when they reach 80 100 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:05.440
 centimeters from ground level in the process 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.250
 growing cucumber regardless of type 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.979
 hybrid and 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.130
 or the method of its formation is removed 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.800
 from the side shoots that bear fruit and 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.260
 also sick and yellow 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.400
 lower leaves first those which 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.430
 touch the ground 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.580
 then gradually all the lower leaves to 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.919
 50 centimeters high by this 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.370
 better ventilation is provided 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.280
 plants I do it with scissors neatly 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.470
 not to damage the plants 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.830
 if suddenly from careless trimming 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:43.030
 there will be big wounds to fill them 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.729
 crushed coal and conclusion want to say 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.580
 what to form cucumber plant 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.919
 must be approached creatively maybe somewhere 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.150
 put a longer whip can 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.880
 make it shorter 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.850
 it depends on many factors before 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.970
 only varieties from the height of our greenhouse 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.760
 on seeding density and of course 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.669
 from your imagination and I wish you good 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.500
 harvest and all the best and not
