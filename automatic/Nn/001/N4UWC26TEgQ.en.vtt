00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.650
 Hello my dear friends are sadists with 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.410
 you are a tiberian sufferer and this is the 56th edition 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.240
 heading master on all tanks heading in 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.460
 which I get a mark of class master 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.430
 on a technique whose name you are 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.529
 specify in the comments on the sponsors 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.900
 today's sufferings are those of you 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.600
 who in the past gave his vote 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.010
 T28 American Pt-Sau 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.780
 eighth level 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.170
 it was on her that she had to receive 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.389
 wizard what I want to tell you of course 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.050
 thank you very much 

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:43.300
 suffered 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 I missed these vantage shots from 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.120
 artillery mad speed and just 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.309
 impenetrable armor thank you very much 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.309
 guys i don't even know what i would without you 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.049
 did in general spend me in the next 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.749
 times and choose so for the next release 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.459
 You can follow the link in the description well 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:04.180
 and I begin my story about 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:06.100
 wonderful ptt 28 and so for a start 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.670
 let's talk about dynamics 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.700
 this american possum is about 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.620
 great word to remember this dynamics not 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.560
 very not at all in comparison 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.480
 with the same t95 which literally vomits with 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.560
 places and in a couple of seconds gaining its 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.650
 maximum speed 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.930
 t28 is not like that i still need time to 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.850
 accelerate to its maximum speed at 18 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.950
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.200
 back course is even better as much as 7 kilometers 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.270
 an hour turns out so far ahead . 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.580
 especially not going and back somehow not very 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.360
 in a hurry but turning speed on the spot 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.430
 generally excellent 20 play a second 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.060
 there is in any more or less fast tank i 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.550
 not talking 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.460
 light average you can easily 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.860
 twist in general think you understand here 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.110
 two options or go to one for some 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.680
 direction to press the right to die 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.740
 emphasize 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.900
 either stand and defit base well since 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.630
 dynamics in this p all say so not 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.790
 very good then surely she has 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.800
 armor let's them just now and 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.570
 let's talk 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.220
 Before that, I want to do a little 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.440
 ad specifically for those guys 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.820
 who will surely write in the comments 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.760
 what d 28 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.470
 this is a great armored pt friends 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.660
 especially for you i will now call 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.240
 booking in millimeters and say that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.820
 this is very good armor for tanks 8 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.280
 level and then i will talk about how on 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.460
 in fact, this armor behaves in combat and 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.890
 so tsiferok lovers dedicated to his forehead 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.950
 T28, that is, the upper armor sheet 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.840
 and felling 203 millimeters vld under a small 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.750
 slope beveling under good 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.340
 tilt and this is very good armor for 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.370
 tanks of level 8 and now reality 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.230
 t28 perfectly tanks no seriously t28 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.480
 excellent tank guns with a break to 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.700
 200 millimeters true with a small 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.610
 reservation if the enemy does not heal 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.890
 you handles and deckhouse roof so clean for 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.590
 Help in the pens 100 millimeters of the roof 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.450
 25 I think no need to explain that any 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.270
 tank that you meet you 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.880
 easily breaks in there except this any 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.890
 met tank easily pierce t28 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.280
 the side of the upper well, a measure of its 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.650
 part where only 51 millimeter if u 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.900
 enemy breakthrough from 230 millimeters 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.989
 he doesn't need to aim anything at all 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.620
 hatches roof board why just shoot 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.970
 lr and punches in passing carrying out the engine 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.700
 perhaps about the nine and tens of 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.770
 breaking the mod 250 millimeters i talk 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.200
 nothing will you guess what 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.470
 they do 128 and I'll let you down 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.680
 a small top on the armor of this birdie 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.109
 frontal armor is for level eight 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.120
 she is very good but in practice you 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.790
 either punch in the forehead with gold or 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.519
 fire out roof hatches and also great 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.920
 punch nines and tens are tank 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.900
 mask but also not always on this with 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.680
 booking everything and let's talk about 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.680
 in the gun tool t28 normal could 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.879
 worse could be better 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.519
 armor-piercing shells can be pierced 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.689
 armored tanks of level 9 and 10 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.329
 vulnerabilities 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.459
 with a gold, respectively, easier one-time 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.680
 damage 400 units time down 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.620
 comfortable accuracy will come down spread on 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.090
 100 meters 038 in this gun me 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.919
 pleased rate of fire with 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.840
 dispenser gun recharges slightly 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.669
 in more than 8 seconds that is 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.280
 it turns out quite good dp 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.349
 but it seemed to me that the gun 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.270
 very bad aiming angles and how 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:31.039
 horizontal and vertical 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.800
 as for the horizontal angles 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.870
 For some reason, I donâ€™t see them all the time 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.900
 enough though on the passport, they seem to be 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.789
 normally 10 degrees left and 11 right 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.360
 I guess I just did not skate for a long time 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.970
 on pt 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.889
 but the declination is only 5 degrees 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.440
 I had constant discomfort 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.430
 because any bump under the tracks and 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.659
 guns look at the sky they are at the enemy 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.880
 speedy gun and excellent 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:58.240
 masking our leisurely possum 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.979
 great for annoying tactics 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.680
 review by the way is also not bad for support 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.930
 Eighth level he is 370 meters 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.940
 if you use the stereo then in 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.449
 combined with a very good disguise you 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.310
 most likely the first to notice the enemy 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.320
 well now let's tell you how much 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.280
 I got pleasure while trying 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.979
 take the master on the t-28 a lot very much 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.039
 pleasures I would get if I were 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.530
 masochist mark class master give 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:30.259
 if you earn about 1300 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.479
 pure experience and given the features 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.050
 gameplay of this wonderful pattern 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.639
 do it somehow a little bit complicated 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.250
 You can earn money by being in the top 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.039
 if you managed to crawl to opponents 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.529
 well or they came to you nobody 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.709
 punches and 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:50.559
 if you shot well the second way 

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:52.269
 ambush you complement the house of the best 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:54.759
 smartly nagiborskie positions 

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:57.189
 necessary to emphasize and being there for 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.779
 planted shoot a lot of a lot of damage 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:01.029
 on opponents who periodically 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.939
 find yourself in the shot and get 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.859
 the wizard seems to be nothing complicated but 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:08.319
 believe me guys before wbi 

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:11.429
 will allow you to take the master you will receive 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:14.919
 so much pleasure and mobility 

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:16.779
 t28 and from the brown squares not from 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.939
 opponents who shoot premium 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:20.739
 us shells and even from those opponents 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:23.199
 who don't shoot blue but 

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:25.779
 vyselivayut hatches the roof you will feel 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.509
 the full power of this bird's armor when you get 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:31.329
 to nines and tens but most importantly 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:33.999
 the most pleasure you will get from 

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:37.059
 allies who provide you more than once 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:39.159
 opportunity to drag the fight alone in 

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:39.699
