00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.490 
now for example you can actually see how
it<00:04:47.960> closes<00:04:49.659> right<00:04:50.659> here<00:04:51.110> there's<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:51.409> little

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
it closes right here there's a little

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.189 
it closes right here there's a little
nut<00:04:52.250> for<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.729> to<00:04:52.880> open<00:04:53.120> it<00:04:53.270> yeah<00:04:53.659> this<00:04:54.050> thing

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
nut for you to open it yeah this thing

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.879 
nut for you to open it yeah this thing
locks<00:04:54.560> it<00:04:54.740> so<00:04:54.889> they'll<00:04:55.039> go<00:04:55.220> all<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.430> way<00:04:55.490> down

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
locks it so they'll go all the way down

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.529 
locks it so they'll go all the way down
but<00:04:57.889> the<00:04:58.220> one<00:04:58.340> problem<00:04:58.550> i<00:04:58.760> did<00:04:58.970> hear<00:04:59.210> about

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
but the one problem i did hear about

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.270 
but the one problem i did hear about
this<00:04:59.690> box<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:00.440> we<00:05:00.620> can<00:05:00.740> go<00:05:00.830> ahead<00:05:00.889> and<00:05:00.979> test<00:05:01.159> it

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
this box and we can go ahead and test it

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.010 
this box and we can go ahead and test it
right<00:05:01.310> now<00:05:01.550> is<00:05:01.789> if<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.060> put<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.270> card<00:05:02.630> divider

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
right now is if you put a card divider

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.460 
right now is if you put a card divider
in<00:05:03.260> it<00:05:04.070> actually<00:05:04.400> doesn't<00:05:04.610> close<00:05:04.880> snuggly<00:05:05.510> so

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
in it actually doesn't close snuggly so

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.050 
in it actually doesn't close snuggly so
let's<00:05:06.650> go<00:05:06.740> ahead<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:06.979> put<00:05:07.220> on<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.430> dividers

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
let's go ahead and put on the dividers

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.990 
let's go ahead and put on the dividers
in<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.510> front<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:08.810> back<00:05:08.870> here<00:05:09.789> just<00:05:10.789> what<00:05:10.909> I'm

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
in the front and back here just what I'm

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.370 
in the front and back here just what I'm
doing

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.040 

and<00:05:17.240> yeah<00:05:18.240> I<00:05:18.270> mean<00:05:18.509> there's<00:05:18.569> actually<00:05:19.020> a

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
and yeah I mean there's actually a

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.460 
and yeah I mean there's actually a
slight<00:05:19.910> you<00:05:20.910> know<00:05:21.180> you<00:05:21.750> can't<00:05:21.930> really<00:05:22.259> see<00:05:22.380> it

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
slight you know you can't really see it

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.070 
slight you know you can't really see it
really<00:05:22.710> well<00:05:22.800> but<00:05:23.190> there's<00:05:23.430> a<00:05:23.520> slight<00:05:24.080> spacing

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
really well but there's a slight spacing

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.150 
really well but there's a slight spacing
here<00:05:26.539> kind<00:05:27.539> of<00:05:27.599> weird<00:05:27.840> yeah<00:05:28.139> it<00:05:28.590> shouldn't

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
here kind of weird yeah it shouldn't

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.830 
here kind of weird yeah it shouldn't
bother<00:05:29.310> most<00:05:29.580> people<00:05:29.910> I<00:05:30.030> mean<00:05:30.240> it's<00:05:30.389> not<00:05:30.449> as<00:05:30.780> a

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
bother most people I mean it's not as a

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.409 
bother most people I mean it's not as a
big<00:05:31.440> as<00:05:31.590> most<00:05:31.620> people<00:05:31.979> reporting<00:05:32.430> but<00:05:33.150> this<00:05:33.270> is

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
big as most people reporting but this is

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.089 
big as most people reporting but this is
a<00:05:33.449> nice<00:05:33.690> box<00:05:33.990> and<00:05:34.319> I<00:05:34.380> think<00:05:34.590> it<00:05:34.680> makes<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:34.949> nice

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
a nice box and I think it makes a nice

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.200 
a nice box and I think it makes a nice
gift<00:05:35.400> if<00:05:35.819> you<00:05:36.389> want<00:05:36.569> to<00:05:36.660> buy<00:05:36.750> it<00:05:36.810> for<00:05:37.050> value

gift if you want to buy it for value

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.189 
gift if you want to buy it for value
it's<00:05:39.210> not<00:05:39.300> really<00:05:39.419> good<00:05:39.630> value<00:05:39.960> because<00:05:40.110> you

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
it's not really good value because you

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.689 
it's not really good value because you
know<00:05:40.289> you're<00:05:40.680> buying<00:05:40.860> boosters<00:05:41.190> are<00:05:41.340> retail
