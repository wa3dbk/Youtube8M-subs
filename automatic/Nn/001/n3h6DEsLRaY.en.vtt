fifty bases we've got some kale got some

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.499 
fifty bases we've got some kale got some
lettuce<00:01:34.600> we've<00:01:35.170> got<00:01:35.320> some<00:01:35.500> broccoli<00:01:36.509> tomatoes

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
lettuce we've got some broccoli tomatoes

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.169 
lettuce we've got some broccoli tomatoes
they're<00:01:37.810> being<00:01:38.020> germinated<00:01:38.649> I<00:01:38.920> was<00:01:39.820> on<00:01:39.939> some

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
they're being germinated I was on some

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:47.940 
they're being germinated I was on some
melon<00:01:40.509> plants<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.830> some<00:01:45.670> corn<00:01:46.709> some<00:01:47.709> bell

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
melon plants and some corn some bell

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.350 
melon plants and some corn some bell
peppers<00:01:49.470> we've<00:01:50.470> also<00:01:50.740> got<00:01:51.159> on<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:52.000> ring<00:01:52.179> down

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
peppers we've also got on the ring down

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.830 
peppers we've also got on the ring down
here<00:01:53.640> which<00:01:54.640> is<00:01:54.670> growing<00:01:55.060> in<00:01:55.240> part<00:01:55.509> of<00:01:55.569> the<00:01:55.630> fed

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
here which is growing in part of the fed

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.870 
here which is growing in part of the fed
that<00:01:56.049> gets<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.619> most<00:01:56.799> sunlight<00:01:57.130> at<00:01:57.549> this<00:01:57.670> time

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
that gets the most sunlight at this time

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.179 
that gets the most sunlight at this time
of<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.030> year<00:01:58.259> we've<00:01:59.259> already<00:01:59.349> discovered

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
of the year we've already discovered

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.870 
of the year we've already discovered
that<00:02:00.520> you<00:02:01.149> know<00:02:01.950> late<00:02:02.950> February<00:02:03.490> is<00:02:03.610> probably

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
that you know late February is probably

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.370 
that you know late February is probably
a<00:02:03.939> little<00:02:04.030> bit<00:02:04.209> earlier<00:02:04.539> to<00:02:04.720> grow<00:02:04.929> more<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.170> go

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
a little bit earlier to grow more and go

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.759 
a little bit earlier to grow more and go
okay<00:02:06.310> obviously<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.349> where<00:02:08.530> we're<00:02:08.649> doing

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
okay obviously this is where we're doing

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.350 
okay obviously this is where we're doing
it<00:02:08.950> for<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:09.160> pilot<00:02:09.549> arm<00:02:09.849> obviously<00:02:09.970> when

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
it for the pilot arm obviously when

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.180 
it for the pilot arm obviously when
we're<00:02:10.479> doing<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:11.290> actual<00:02:11.530> root<00:02:11.769> Moringa

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
we're doing the actual root Moringa

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.640 
we're doing the actual root Moringa
trials<00:02:12.549> it<00:02:12.700> would<00:02:12.820> be<00:02:12.970> on<00:02:13.510> location<00:02:13.989> and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
trials it would be on location and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.479 
trials it would be on location and
either<00:02:14.829> in<00:02:15.040> Malawi<00:02:15.549> or<00:02:17.070> Dominica

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
either in Malawi or Dominica

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.210 
either in Malawi or Dominica
so<00:02:18.850> obviously<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:20.290> kind<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.739> indoor

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
so obviously this kind of indoor

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.080 
so obviously this kind of indoor
microclimate<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.410> probably<00:02:23.410> best<00:02:23.680> suited<00:02:23.739> to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
microclimate is probably best suited to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.920 
microclimate is probably best suited to
situations<00:02:25.090> where<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.420> don't<00:02:25.600> have<00:02:25.720> much

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
situations where you don't have much

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.440 
situations where you don't have much
rainfall<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:27.069> much<00:02:27.250> water<00:02:27.549> so<00:02:27.730> we're<00:02:28.420> just

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
rainfall and much water so we're just

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.420 
rainfall and much water so we're just
looking<00:02:28.630> at<00:02:28.870> how<00:02:29.049> we<00:02:29.109> can<00:02:29.380> grow<00:02:29.500> Moringa<00:02:29.980> so

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
looking at how we can grow Moringa so

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.789 
looking at how we can grow Moringa so
where<00:02:30.670> there<00:02:30.760> isn't<00:02:31.000> enough<00:02:31.359> rainfall

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
where there isn't enough rainfall

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.250 
where there isn't enough rainfall
somewhere<00:02:32.799> there's<00:02:33.010> not<00:02:33.640> much<00:02:33.880> water<00:02:34.109> when<00:02:35.109> we

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
somewhere there's not much water when we

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.449 
somewhere there's not much water when we
have<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.560> kind<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:35.739> have<00:02:35.829> a<00:02:35.950> closed-loop

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
have to kind of have a closed-loop

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.660 
have to kind of have a closed-loop
system<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:38.380> yeah<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:38.859> obviously<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.340> can<00:02:39.489> see

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
system so yeah so obviously you can see

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.949 
system so yeah so obviously you can see
here<00:02:39.940> we've<00:02:40.239> got<00:02:40.269> some<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.680> our<00:02:41.859> initial

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
here we've got some this is our initial

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.449 
here we've got some this is our initial
aquaponic<00:02:43.959> system<00:02:44.380> which<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> very<00:02:45.220> very

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
aquaponic system which is a very very

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.069 
aquaponic system which is a very very
small<00:02:45.700> one<00:02:45.850> just<00:02:46.120> used<00:02:46.359> as<00:02:46.569> initially<00:02:46.959> as<00:02:47.049> a

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
small one just used as initially as a

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.559 
small one just used as initially as a
pilot<00:02:47.760> as<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.910> can<00:02:49.060> see<00:02:49.180> here<00:02:49.329> we've<00:02:49.420> got<00:02:49.540> a

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
pilot as you can see here we've got a

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.009 
pilot as you can see here we've got a
pump<00:02:49.950> pumping<00:02:50.950> water<00:02:51.100> out<00:02:51.220> by<00:02:51.459> some<00:02:51.700> tank<00:02:52.030> into

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
pump pumping water out by some tank into

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:00.830 
pump pumping water out by some tank into
the<00:02:53.260> beds<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:55.170> then<00:02:56.609> drains<00:02:57.609> down<00:02:58.030> into

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.130 

fishtank<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:01.859> as<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.129> can<00:03:02.249> see<00:03:02.989> number<00:03:03.989> of

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
fishtank so as you can see number of

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:14.430 
fishtank so as you can see number of
fish<00:03:06.650> happily<00:03:07.650> swimming<00:03:07.769> around<00:03:08.249> in<00:03:08.519> there

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.700 

they're<00:03:15.250> pretty<00:03:15.400> happy<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:16.630> nitrate<00:03:17.080> nitrite

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
they're pretty happy the nitrate nitrite

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.730 
they're pretty happy the nitrate nitrite
levels<00:03:17.770> are<00:03:18.340> about<00:03:18.580> right<00:03:19.800> lower<00:03:20.800> ammonia<00:03:21.640> and

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
levels are about right lower ammonia and

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.400 
levels are about right lower ammonia and
plants<00:03:23.740> are<00:03:23.830> doing<00:03:23.920> pretty<00:03:24.130> well<00:03:24.300> obviously

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
plants are doing pretty well obviously

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.200 
plants are doing pretty well obviously
yeah<00:03:26.410> this<00:03:26.680> is<00:03:26.830> all<00:03:26.950> going<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.250> be<00:03:27.400> at<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:27.820> moment

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
yeah this is all going to be at a moment

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.590 
yeah this is all going to be at a moment
this<00:03:28.560> really<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.740> being<00:03:29.920> regulated<00:03:30.480> by<00:03:31.480> them

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
this really is being regulated by them

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.870 
this really is being regulated by them
by<00:03:32.140> hand<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.730> plan<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.830> our<00:03:35.880> Arduino

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
by hand the plan is that our Arduino

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.540 
by hand the plan is that our Arduino
Arduino<00:03:38.010> powered<00:03:39.960> system<00:03:40.960> which<00:03:41.200> we<00:03:41.590> look<00:03:42.370> up

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
Arduino powered system which we look up

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.220 
Arduino powered system which we look up
to<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.880> Padrino<00:03:44.280> Internet<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.640> Things

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
to the a Padrino Internet of Things

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.730 
to the a Padrino Internet of Things
service<00:03:47.610> essentially<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:50.290> can<00:03:50.350> see<00:03:50.500> from<00:03:50.680> the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
service essentially you can see from the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.460 
service essentially you can see from the
LCD<00:03:51.430> is<00:03:51.880> taking<00:03:52.750> some<00:03:52.930> readings<00:03:53.110> at<00:03:53.410> the

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
LCD is taking some readings at the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.270 
LCD is taking some readings at the
moment<00:03:54.120> aq<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.240> aquarium<00:03:56.640> 1/8<00:03:57.660> a<00:03:58.660> Q<00:03:59.590> 2<00:03:59.950> is

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
moment aq is aquarium 1/8 a Q 2 is

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.380 
moment aq is aquarium 1/8 a Q 2 is
aquarium<00:04:00.940> two<00:04:01.180> antenna<00:04:02.110> 1<00:04:02.260> degree<00:04:02.530> C<00:04:03.390> inside

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
aquarium two antenna 1 degree C inside

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.200 
aquarium two antenna 1 degree C inside

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
humidity there outside community inside

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.300 
humidity there outside community inside
temperature<00:04:07.450> has<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.780> temperature<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:09.220> then

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
temperature has a temperature and then

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.880 
temperature has a temperature and then
obviously<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.730> inside<00:04:10.210> is<00:04:10.990> dim<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.440> outside

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
obviously the inside is dim and outside

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.150 
obviously the inside is dim and outside
is<00:04:12.040> dim<00:04:12.250> that's<00:04:12.460> for<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.700> light<00:04:12.880> levels

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
is dim that's for the light levels

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.440 
is dim that's for the light levels
bottom<00:04:15.160> right<00:04:15.370> hand<00:04:15.580> corner<00:04:15.700> there<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.269> can

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
bottom right hand corner there you can

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.759 
bottom right hand corner there you can
see<00:04:16.600> at<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.750> time

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.189 

Greenwich<00:04:20.459> Mean<00:04:20.639> Time<00:04:21.169> 1650<00:04:22.169> inches<00:04:22.530> 10<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.490> 5

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
Greenwich Mean Time 1650 inches 10 to 5

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.510 
Greenwich Mean Time 1650 inches 10 to 5
so<00:04:25.199> obviously<00:04:25.620> none<00:04:25.919> of<00:04:25.979> this<00:04:26.100> stuff<00:04:26.340> does

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
so obviously none of this stuff does

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.779 
so obviously none of this stuff does
these<00:04:26.819> readings<00:04:27.150> are<00:04:27.240> actually<00:04:27.569> hooked<00:04:27.720> up<00:04:27.900> to

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.300 
board and getting the safely do you know
this<00:06:21.159> Arduino<00:06:21.780> system<00:06:22.780> online<00:06:23.500> on<00:06:23.770> the<00:06:24.009> AP<00:06:24.190> do

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
this Arduino system online on the AP do

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.249 
this Arduino system online on the AP do
you<00:06:24.370> know<00:06:24.490> system<00:06:24.960> so<00:06:25.960> that<00:06:26.050> we<00:06:26.169> can<00:06:26.349> start

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
you know system so that we can start

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.570 
you know system so that we can start
monitoring<00:06:29.259> online<00:06:29.800> and<00:06:30.009> controlling<00:06:30.460> it

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
monitoring online and controlling it

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.149 
monitoring online and controlling it
from<00:06:30.610> online<00:06:31.090> and<00:06:31.919> then<00:06:32.919> getting<00:06:33.069> some

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:33.159 
from online and then getting some

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:36.719 
from online and then getting some
readings<00:06:33.490> and<00:06:33.909> actually<00:06:35.490> contributing<00:06:36.490> some

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
readings and actually contributing some

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.800 
readings and actually contributing some
some<00:06:37.060> figures<00:06:37.389> as<00:06:37.509> well<00:06:37.539> and<00:06:38.259> our<00:06:38.889> experience

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
some figures as well and our experience

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.119 
some figures as well and our experience
so<00:06:40.810> this<00:06:41.229> is<00:06:41.319> where<00:06:41.469> we<00:06:41.560> are<00:06:41.590> at<00:06:41.770> the<00:06:41.830> moment

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:42.129 
so this is where we are at the moment

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:44.519 
so this is where we are at the moment
and<00:06:42.250> we'll<00:06:43.150> get<00:06:43.270> back<00:06:43.419> to<00:06:43.659> future

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:44.529 
and we'll get back to future

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.649 
and we'll get back to future
developments<00:06:45.130> thanks<00:06:45.729> for<00:06:45.819> watching<00:06:46.120> but

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:46.659 
developments thanks for watching but

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:54.629 
developments thanks for watching but
Mike
