00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
lately and I thought I wonder if I have

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.959 
lately and I thought I wonder if I have
enough<00:00:12.480> junk<00:00:12.870> laying<00:00:13.200> around<00:00:13.639> that<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.759> could

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
enough junk laying around that I could

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.420 
enough junk laying around that I could
actually<00:00:15.240> put<00:00:15.809> together<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.590> bit<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.340> a

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
actually put together a bit of a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.340 
actually put together a bit of a
slingshot<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:20.420> walking<00:00:21.420> along<00:00:21.660> through<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
slingshot so walking along through the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.370 
slingshot so walking along through the
garage<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:23.100> noticed<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.699> had<00:00:23.910> some

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
garage and I noticed that I had some

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.630 
garage and I noticed that I had some
thera-band<00:00:25.380> black<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:27.830> laying<00:00:28.830> around<00:00:29.039> from

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
thera-band black to laying around from

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.420 
thera-band black to laying around from
some<00:00:29.910> other<00:00:30.060> project<00:00:31.160> stretchy<00:00:32.160> stretchy<00:00:32.640> -

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
some other project stretchy stretchy -

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.660 
some other project stretchy stretchy -
and<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.610> actually<00:00:36.469> have<00:00:37.469> some<00:00:37.829> some<00:00:38.430> leather

and I actually have some some leather
scraps<00:00:40.670> still<00:00:41.670> haven't<00:00:42.000> used<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.360> project<00:00:42.899> he

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
scraps still haven't used the project he

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.840 
scraps still haven't used the project he
was<00:00:43.500> those<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> project<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.430> bought<00:00:44.610> with

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
was those for the project I bought with

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.069 
was those for the project I bought with
all<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.120> course<00:00:45.739> ain't<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.950> way<00:00:47.989> so<00:00:48.989> we

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
all of course ain't that the way so we

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.270 
all of course ain't that the way so we
had<00:00:49.170> some<00:00:49.350> thera-band

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
had some thera-band

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.580 
had some thera-band
so<00:00:51.059> there's<00:00:51.210> your<00:00:51.420> spring<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:52.170> some<00:00:52.379> leather

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
so there's your spring get some leather

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
so there's your spring get some leather
as<00:00:52.980> your<00:00:53.190> poach<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:55.050> good<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:57.390> then<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
as your poach it's good and then I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.060 
as your poach it's good and then I
needed<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.170> fork<00:00:58.890> Oh<00:00:59.629> a<00:01:00.629> slingshot<00:01:01.199> shaped<00:01:01.800> like

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
needed a fork Oh a slingshot shaped like

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.240 
needed a fork Oh a slingshot shaped like
this<00:01:02.840> these<00:01:03.840> are<00:01:04.110> not<00:01:05.070> gonna<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> slingshot

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
this these are not gonna be a slingshot

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.800 
this these are not gonna be a slingshot
but<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.939> need<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.180> kind<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.510> fork

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
but you know you need a kind of fork

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
but you know you need a kind of fork
shape<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.680> probably<00:01:11.460> could<00:01:11.670> make

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
shape like that probably could make

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.080 
shape like that probably could make
those<00:01:12.060> into<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.420> slingshot

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
those into a slingshot

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.730 
those into a slingshot
however<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.509> walked<00:01:15.780> past<00:01:15.900> one<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.470> these

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
however then I walked past one of these

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
some utility wire there just rip these

some utility wire there just rip these
ends<00:02:48.290> together<00:02:49.510> probably<00:02:50.510> should<00:02:50.900> be<00:02:51.080> using

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
ends together probably should be using

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.920

this<00:03:57.680> in<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:58.330> really<00:03:59.530> inefficient<00:04:00.530> way<00:04:01.040> somehow

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
this in a really inefficient way somehow

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.130 
this in a really inefficient way somehow

that<00:04:14.000> one<00:04:14.180> one<00:04:14.330> hidden<00:04:17.079> weight<00:04:18.079> I<00:04:19.060> feel<00:04:20.060> like

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
that one one hidden weight I feel like

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:29.950 
that one one hidden weight I feel like
it<00:04:20.359> was<00:04:20.480> a<00:04:20.510> total<00:04:20.870> waste<00:04:21.019> of<00:04:21.200> time<00:04:21.410> now<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:28.960> would

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
it was a total waste of time now I would

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.170 
it was a total waste of time now I would
imagine<00:04:30.200> this<00:04:30.560> would<00:04:30.740> be<00:04:30.889> a<00:04:30.919> little<00:04:31.190> bit<00:04:31.340> a

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
imagine this would be a little bit a

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.500 
imagine this would be a little bit a

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
go it is an effective slingshot and you

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.250 
go it is an effective slingshot and you

sling<00:05:09.680> has<00:05:10.070> it<00:05:10.250> work<00:05:10.370> so<00:05:10.669> there<00:05:10.820> you<00:05:10.940> go

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
sling has it work so there you go
