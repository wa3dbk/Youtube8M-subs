00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 The FC Schalke 04 has it last 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.500
 once again an important weekend 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.960
 lost game and still allowed 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.880
 thanks to the assets of the persecutors 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.799
 still fourth place on his own 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.230
 to keep up to seasonal 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.359
 but one thing is certain in the last four 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.529
 you can not and can not play any 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.449
 slips do more 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.880
 because three of the coming opponents are playing 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.949
 even at fourth and thus the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.180
 possibility for the champions 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.580
 league to qualify 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.489
 on sunday comes the table eighth 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.980
 Hamburger SV in the arena with two 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.410
 score arrears alert readiness for 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.700
 all players one of the most important 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.770
 Achievement will continue to be lacking 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.989
 Jefferson's procedure is still laboring 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.180
 on a muscle strain in the thigh 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.730
 that's what the chances are for klaas jan 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.149
 huntelaar back up very well 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.860
 can 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.660
 the attacker since derby with 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.149
 An internal torn ligament in the left knee 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.420
 had to stay injured is back in 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.420
 team workout 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.270
 the suffering should be so for the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.189
 hunter over 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.810
 according to own statement a damn 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.340
 hard time that happened from the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.799
 stand out 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.100
 after all, it's about the champions league 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.100
 qualification 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.460
 that of course if we lose or 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.460
 or not win 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.520
 in the match, the FC Schalke 04 conceded 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.740
 a 1 2 broke 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.780
 after all, klaas jan huntelaar was the one 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.060
 Protect the only hit on pages 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.270
 He can do it against Hamburg 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.270
 so
