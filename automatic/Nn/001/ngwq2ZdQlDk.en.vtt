so<00:00:01.380> you<00:00:01.439> may<00:00:01.709> wonder<00:00:02.010> sometimes<00:00:02.669> which<00:00:03.300> part

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
so you may wonder sometimes which part

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.289 
so you may wonder sometimes which part
of<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.290> whole<00:00:04.560> apparatus<00:00:05.190> over<00:00:05.609> here<00:00:05.970> on<00:00:06.150> the

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
of this whole apparatus over here on the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.709 
of this whole apparatus over here on the
right<00:00:06.480> side<00:00:06.750> mix<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.040> bow<00:00:08.189> move<00:00:08.610> okay<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.570> I

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
right side mix the bow move okay and I

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.540 
right side mix the bow move okay and I
would<00:00:09.929> say<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.500> really<00:00:10.710> depends<00:00:11.160> on<00:00:11.340> what

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
would say that it really depends on what

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.330 
would say that it really depends on what
bolster<00:00:12.059> you're<00:00:12.330> doing<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:13.380> faster<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.219> bow

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
bolster you're doing the faster the bow

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.820 
bolster you're doing the faster the bow
stroke<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.360> smaller<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.230> muscles<00:00:16.650> you're

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
stroke the smaller the muscles you're

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.410 
stroke the smaller the muscles you're
going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.039> use<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:18.000> if<00:00:18.090> you're<00:00:18.240> doing

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
going to use so if you're doing

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.510 
going to use so if you're doing
something<00:00:18.990> along<00:00:19.199> lines<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:19.980> ta<00:00:20.160> or

something along lines of a so ta or
staccato<00:00:22.310> you're<00:00:23.310> probably<00:00:23.609> going<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> be

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
staccato you're probably going to be

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.300 
staccato you're probably going to be
using<00:00:24.330> pretty<00:00:25.050> small<00:00:25.470> little<00:00:25.800> muscles<00:00:26.130> in

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
using pretty small little muscles in

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.019 
using pretty small little muscles in
your<00:00:26.490> finger<00:00:26.970> your<00:00:27.240> hand<00:00:28.429> maybe<00:00:29.429> your<00:00:29.580> wrist<00:00:29.849> a

your finger your hand maybe your wrist a
little<00:00:30.240> bit<00:00:30.390> down<00:00:30.599> there<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.529> doesn't

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
little bit down there and that doesn't

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.380 
little bit down there and that doesn't
mean<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> rest<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.279> your<00:00:32.430> arm<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.790> frozen<00:00:33.239> in

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
mean the rest of your arm is frozen in

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.049 
mean the rest of your arm is frozen in
face<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.440> does<00:00:34.620> mean<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
face but it does mean that this is a

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.049 
face but it does mean that this is a
little<00:00:36.390> more<00:00:36.690> what's<00:00:36.989> doing<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> work

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
little more what's doing the work

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.590 
little more what's doing the work
whereas<00:00:39.059> if<00:00:39.420> you're<00:00:39.780> doing<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:44.420> it's<00:00:45.420> gonna

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
whereas if you're doing a it's gonna

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.630 
whereas if you're doing a it's gonna
mean<00:00:45.809> these<00:00:46.050> big<00:00:46.379> muscles<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.489> your

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
mean these big muscles here in your

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.180 
mean these big muscles here in your
upper<00:00:48.000> arm<00:00:48.270> or<00:00:48.570> your<00:00:48.719> back<00:00:49.020> that's<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
upper arm or your back that's going to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.029 
upper arm or your back that's going to
be<00:00:50.399> what's<00:00:50.840> initiating<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.320> movement<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
be what's initiating the movement of the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.110 
be what's initiating the movement of the
bow<00:00:53.190> okay<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> find<00:00:54.870> happens<00:00:55.379> is

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
bow okay and what I find happens is

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.810 
bow okay and what I find happens is
especially<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.329> these<00:00:57.800> long<00:00:58.800> bow<00:00:59.340> strokes

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
especially on these long bow strokes

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.420 
especially on these long bow strokes
with<00:01:00.149> beginning<00:01:00.840> cellists<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.649> they<00:01:02.100> tend<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
with beginning cellists if they tend to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.520 
with beginning cellists if they tend to
forget<00:01:02.670> about<00:01:03.120> all<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
forget about all of this up here and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.030 
forget about all of this up here and
they<00:01:04.920> try<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.220> leave<00:01:05.610> from<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> hand<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:07.040> my

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
they try to leave from the hand and my

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.719 
they try to leave from the hand and my
teacher

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
teacher

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.820 
teacher
Richard<00:01:09.060> Aaron<00:01:09.299> explained<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> me<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.710> way

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
Richard Aaron explained to me in a way

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.969 
Richard Aaron explained to me in a way
that<00:01:10.860> made<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> lot<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.729> sense<00:01:12.290> why<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:13.710> not

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
that made a lot of sense why that's not

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.859 
that made a lot of sense why that's not
a<00:01:14.040> good<00:01:14.310> idea<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:15.240> he<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.420> saying<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.840> that

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
a good idea what he was saying is that

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.170 
a good idea what he was saying is that
if<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> think<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> bar<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> pendulum

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
if you think of the bar like a pendulum

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.230 
if you think of the bar like a pendulum
right<00:01:18.720> where<00:01:19.130> you've<00:01:20.130> got<00:01:20.340> let's<00:01:20.580> say<00:01:20.729> point<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
right where you've got let's say point a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.609 
right where you've got let's say point a
up<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.750> point<00:01:22.619> B<00:01:23.420> point<00:01:24.420> B<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.930> moving<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
up here point B point B is moving a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.999 
up here point B point B is moving a
whole<00:01:26.009> lot<00:01:26.670> more<00:01:27.290> for<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> same<00:01:28.619> amount<00:01:28.890> of

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
whole lot more for the same amount of

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.039 
whole lot more for the same amount of
work<00:01:29.220> right<00:01:29.579> all<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.880> had<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.689> could<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
work right all I had to do is I could I

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.230 
work right all I had to do is I could I
could<00:01:31.350> power<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.280> there's<00:01:32.850> tiny

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
could power it from here there's tiny

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.960 
could power it from here there's tiny
little<00:01:33.479> motion<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.860> huge<00:01:35.280> result

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
little motion and I get this huge result

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.960 
little motion and I get this huge result
down<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.680> think<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:38.009> bow<00:01:38.430> arm<00:01:38.670> as

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
down here so if I think of my bow arm as

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.889 
down here so if I think of my bow arm as
being<00:01:39.600> similar<00:01:40.759> I've<00:01:41.759> got<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> point<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.540> and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
being similar I've got a point a and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.789 
being similar I've got a point a and
point<00:01:43.259> B<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.640> move<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.329> tiny<00:01:45.960> little<00:01:46.439> bit

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
point B I can move this tiny little bit

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.880 
point B I can move this tiny little bit
up<00:01:47.040> here<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.479> huge<00:01:48.930> result<00:01:49.560> down

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
up here and get this huge result down

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.359 
up here and get this huge result down
here<00:01:50.310> okay<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.479> that's<00:01:51.689> why<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:51.990> these<00:01:52.530> long

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
here okay so that's why for these long

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.190 
here okay so that's why for these long
bow<00:01:53.700> strokes<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.630> actually<00:01:54.960> much<00:01:55.170> more

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
bow strokes it's actually much more

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.100 
bow strokes it's actually much more
efficient<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.159> initiate<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> movement<00:01:57.540> from

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
efficient to initiate the movement from

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.859 
efficient to initiate the movement from
up<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:58.680> alright<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.340> don't<00:01:59.579> kind<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.299> ignore

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
up here alright so don't kind of ignore

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.560 
up here alright so don't kind of ignore
your<00:02:01.110> hand<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.469> little<00:02:01.500> bit<00:02:02.000> make<00:02:03.000> sure<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
your hand a little bit make sure the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.350 
your hand a little bit make sure the
muscles<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.229> your<00:02:04.259> back<00:02:04.829> are<00:02:05.189> engaged

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
muscles in your back are engaged

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.910 
muscles in your back are engaged
and<00:02:06.450> some<00:02:06.780> different<00:02:07.050> ways<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.350> can<00:02:07.500> work<00:02:07.770> on

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and some different ways you can work on

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.859 
and some different ways you can work on
that<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.880> very<00:02:09.149> simple<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:09.690> take

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
that one very simple one if you take

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.200 
that one very simple one if you take
your<00:02:10.080> other<00:02:10.470> hand<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.340> lay<00:02:11.820> it<00:02:11.850> flat

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
your other hand and you lay it flat

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.840 
your other hand and you lay it flat
against<00:02:12.840> your<00:02:12.900> lower<00:02:13.200> back<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.860> then<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.640> do

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
against your lower back and then just do

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.090 
against your lower back and then just do
this<00:02:15.030> movement<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.840> air<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.380> think<00:02:16.830> you'll

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
this movement in the air I think you'll

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.920 
this movement in the air I think you'll
be<00:02:17.220> able<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.520> feel<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.730> there's<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.240> whole<00:02:18.540> lot

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
be able to feel that there's a whole lot

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.100 
be able to feel that there's a whole lot
going<00:02:18.960> on<00:02:19.550> in<00:02:20.550> your<00:02:20.850> back<00:02:21.090> muscles<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.900> if<00:02:22.020> you

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
going on in your back muscles and if you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.310 
going on in your back muscles and if you
try<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.410> do<00:02:23.070> it<00:02:23.220> from<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.850> your<00:02:24.120> lower<00:02:24.540> arm<00:02:24.690> or

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
try to do it from just your lower arm or

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.280 
try to do it from just your lower arm or
your<00:02:25.470> hand<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.610> amount<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.180> movement<00:02:27.990> in<00:02:28.140> your

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
your hand the amount of movement in your

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.310 
your hand the amount of movement in your
back<00:02:28.880> decreases<00:02:29.880> significantly<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.200> can

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
back decreases significantly so you can

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.410 
back decreases significantly so you can
kind<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.560> see<00:02:31.710> if<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.830> can<00:02:31.980> maximize<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.820> and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
kind of see if you can maximize that and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.690 
kind of see if you can maximize that and
that<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.380> start<00:02:34.680> getting<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.400> feeling

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
that can start getting you this feeling

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.530 
that can start getting you this feeling
of<00:02:35.970> how<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.900> can<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.220> bow<00:02:38.400> arm<00:02:38.700> from<00:02:39.330> your

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
of how you can do the bow arm from your

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.630 
of how you can do the bow arm from your
bigger<00:02:39.720> muscles<00:02:40.170> another<00:02:40.980> way<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.250> work<00:02:41.459> on

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
bigger muscles another way to work on

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.229 
bigger muscles another way to work on
this<00:02:41.820> stand<00:02:42.720> up<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.489> just<00:02:44.489> let<00:02:44.700> your<00:02:44.910> arms

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
this stand up and just let your arms

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.449 
this stand up and just let your arms
swing<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.590> let<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.800> swing<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.160> different

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
swing you can let it swing in different

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.760 
swing you can let it swing in different
directions<00:02:47.930> maybe<00:02:48.930> actually<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.470> easiest

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
directions maybe actually the easiest

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.850 
directions maybe actually the easiest
way<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.950> start<00:02:50.340> would<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.610> like<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:51.650> back<00:02:52.650> and

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
way to start would be like this back and

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.430 
way to start would be like this back and
forth<00:02:53.100> all<00:02:53.700> right<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.840> I'm<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:54.989> trying

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
forth all right and so I'm just trying

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.820 
forth all right and so I'm just trying
to<00:02:55.560> sort<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.160> use<00:02:56.430> my<00:02:57.300> natural<00:02:57.630> momentum<00:02:58.530> and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
to sort of use my natural momentum and

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.090 
to sort of use my natural momentum and
inertia<00:02:58.950> and<00:03:00.140> then<00:03:01.140> when<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.530> put<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:01.890> on<00:03:01.950> the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
inertia and then when I put it on the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.640 
inertia and then when I put it on the
cello<00:03:02.400> if<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.300> keep<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:03.840> feeling<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
cello if I can keep that feeling of it

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.310 
cello if I can keep that feeling of it
swinging<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.520> relaxed<00:03:06.060> then<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.840> part<00:03:07.200> of

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
swinging and relaxed then this part of

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.520 
swinging and relaxed then this part of
my<00:03:07.440> arm<00:03:07.470> remains<00:03:08.220> pretty<00:03:08.670> neutral<00:03:09.200> well<00:03:10.200> this

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
my arm remains pretty neutral well this

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.740 
my arm remains pretty neutral well this
just<00:03:10.890> does<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> little<00:03:11.459> bit<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.760> work<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.180> gets

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
just does a little bit of work and gets

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.900 
just does a little bit of work and gets
this<00:03:12.930> huge<00:03:13.170> result<00:03:14.000> okay<00:03:15.000> um<00:03:16.010> so<00:03:17.010> yeah<00:03:17.549> this

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
this huge result okay um so yeah this

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.440 
this huge result okay um so yeah this
does<00:03:18.150> not<00:03:18.360> mean<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:19.110> my<00:03:19.709> fingers<00:03:20.459> are<00:03:20.850> frozen

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
does not mean that my fingers are frozen

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.600 
does not mean that my fingers are frozen
stiff<00:03:21.900> while<00:03:22.380> I'm<00:03:22.530> doing<00:03:22.830> this<00:03:23.010> long<00:03:23.310> bow

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
stiff while I'm doing this long bow

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.940 
stiff while I'm doing this long bow
stroke<00:03:23.910> okay<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:25.110> next<00:03:25.470> video<00:03:25.739> I'm<00:03:25.860> gonna

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
stroke okay and the next video I'm gonna

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.370 
stroke okay and the next video I'm gonna
make<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.370> gonna<00:03:26.459> be<00:03:26.700> about<00:03:26.970> flexible<00:03:27.959> fingers

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
make is gonna be about flexible fingers

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.800 
make is gonna be about flexible fingers
because<00:03:28.739> although<00:03:29.040> I'm<00:03:29.400> not<00:03:29.810> purposefully

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
because although I'm not purposefully

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.060 
because although I'm not purposefully
moving<00:03:31.140> my<00:03:31.290> fingers<00:03:33.320> match<00:03:34.320> my<00:03:34.590> arm<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.890> so

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
moving my fingers match my arm is so

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.420 
moving my fingers match my arm is so
free<00:03:35.340> now<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.580> went<00:03:36.090> right<00:03:36.269> off<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.420> cello<00:03:36.720> um

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
free now I went right off the cello um

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.280 
free now I went right off the cello um
although<00:03:38.430> I'm<00:03:39.269> not<00:03:39.480> personally<00:03:39.720> moving<00:03:40.170> my

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
although I'm not personally moving my

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.440 
although I'm not personally moving my
fingers<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.709> they<00:03:41.070> are<00:03:41.130> not<00:03:41.370> frozen<00:03:42.000> stiff

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
fingers that they are not frozen stiff

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.690 
fingers that they are not frozen stiff
they<00:03:42.720> are<00:03:43.110> flexible<00:03:43.380> they<00:03:43.860> are<00:03:43.890> soft<00:03:44.310> they<00:03:44.580> are

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
they are flexible they are soft they are

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.449 
they are flexible they are soft they are
my<00:03:45.000> my<00:03:45.630> shock<00:03:45.989> absorbers

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
my my shock absorbers

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.640 
my my shock absorbers
but<00:03:47.910> I'm<00:03:48.180> not<00:03:48.480> really<00:03:48.660> thinking<00:03:48.959> about<00:03:49.230> them

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
but I'm not really thinking about them

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.250 
but I'm not really thinking about them
I'm<00:03:49.860> just<00:03:50.340> keeping<00:03:50.760> them<00:03:50.880> relaxed<00:03:51.480> okay<00:03:51.870> so

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
I'm just keeping them relaxed okay so

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.350 
I'm just keeping them relaxed okay so
check<00:03:52.440> out<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.709> flexible<00:03:53.160> fingers<00:03:53.519> exercises

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
check out the flexible fingers exercises

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.390 
check out the flexible fingers exercises
because<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.200> can<00:03:55.410> help<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.830> start<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.280> get

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
because that can help you start to get

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.860 
because that can help you start to get
to<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.610> point<00:03:56.880> where<00:03:57.269> your<00:03:57.480> fingers<00:03:57.840> are

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
to the point where your fingers are

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.240 
to the point where your fingers are
supple<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:58.890> movable<00:03:59.430> but<00:03:59.910> remember<00:04:01.250> mm

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
supple and movable but remember mm

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.900 
supple and movable but remember mm
slower<00:04:02.700> bow<00:04:02.940> strokes<00:04:03.269> bigger<00:04:04.079> muscles<00:04:04.910> faster
