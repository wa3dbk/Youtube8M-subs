00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
position and there's a reason for that

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.520 
position and there's a reason for that
for<00:00:55.860> those<00:00:55.980> guys<00:00:56.010> who<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.850> l1<00:00:57.300> tens<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:58.320> know

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and when you do that what happens is you

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.539 
and when you do that what happens is you
always<00:01:03.629> tend<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> grind<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.680> paint<00:01:04.920> down<00:01:05.189> here

the paint has been removed from year
from<00:01:09.540> years<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.020> years<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.610> lifting<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> hood

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
from years and years of lifting the hood

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.890 
from years and years of lifting the hood
up<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.770> siding<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> other<00:01:14.700> side<00:01:15.030> so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
up the siding up on the other side so

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.440 
up the siding up on the other side so
what<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> did<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.560> created<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:17.939> scissors

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
what I did was I created some scissors

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.969 
what I did was I created some scissors
hinges<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.930> built<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> myself<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.799> made<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
hinges I built it myself I made a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.940 
hinges I built it myself I made a
template<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:21.689> scale<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.350> make<00:01:22.590> sure<00:01:22.799> they

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
template to scale and make sure they

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.230 
template to scale and make sure they
would<00:01:23.070> work<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.490> what<00:01:23.640> happens<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.060> when

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
would work so what happens is that when

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.330 
would work so what happens is that when
you<00:01:24.330> lift<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> hood<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.470> actually<00:01:25.830> lifts<00:01:26.159> up

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
you lift the hood it actually lifts up

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.120 
you lift the hood it actually lifts up
before<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.000> moves<00:01:27.299> forwards<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.080> then<00:01:28.860> of

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
before it moves forwards and then of

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.260 
before it moves forwards and then of
course<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:30.600> will<00:01:30.840> go<00:01:31.020> back<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.680> down<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
course it will go back just go down and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.140 
course it will go back just go down and
you<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.390> close<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.840> way<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.880> lot<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.939> this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
you can close it that way a lot of this

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.359 
you can close it that way a lot of this
some<00:01:36.479> obviously<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.619> can't<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.189> anymore

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
some obviously you can't see anymore

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.310 
some obviously you can't see anymore
because<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.880> under<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> skin<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:40.140> when<00:01:40.290> I

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
because it's under the skin but when I

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
subframe I built for a frame that I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.280 
subframe I built for a frame that I
built<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.380> holds<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.979> rad<00:01:56.189> support<00:01:57.200> let<00:01:58.200> me

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
built that holds the rad support let me

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.460 
built that holds the rad support let me
close<00:01:58.590> this
