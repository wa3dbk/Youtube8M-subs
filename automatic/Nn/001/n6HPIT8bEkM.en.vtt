00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hi to all it's fred I'm going 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.400
 now introduce yourself to 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.620
 different moving rules for 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.389
 the pawns for that I realized a 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.580
 file in which I put different 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 screenshots so that's this file 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.430
 so here you see a chessboard on 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.590
 which one has the eight white pawns that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.880
 here are online 2 and 8 black pawns that 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.619
 are here online 7 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.529
 so that's the initial position of 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.410
 chords okay so we removed the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.980
 white pieces and black pieces this 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.960
 be very clear 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.700
 so that's the position of the pawns at 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.710
 beginning of the game I remember that this is 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.500
 always whites that starts on the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.180
 second screenshot appear here 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 the possible displacements of the pieces 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.309
 so I represented here three pawns 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.289
 whites that are mine between 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.450
 quotation marks is a pure black which is the one 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.399
 of the opponent 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.660
 the white pawns the possible move 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.949
 white pawns are represented by 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.090
 crosses for the pure black the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.129
 possible moves are displaced 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.309
 by Hungarian people so you have to know 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.220
 a pawn can qu'avancer reads it 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.520
 can advance and he can advance a 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.860
 box or 2.6 on its position 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.960
 initial then look a little bit at the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.610
 pawn who is here the pawn who is here the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.229
 on its initial position 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.119
 first he's on line 2 he can 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.040
 so move either 2015 be 2.2 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.140
 agree the same way the black pawn 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.310
 here he is on his initial position 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.070
 so he can move a box or 2 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.950
 2 the two white pawns 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.420
 are here they have already been moved so 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.369
 his white checkers can not move forward 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.180
 finally now only one 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.860
 chord box while a pawn can not 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.220
 not back Sicily can not 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.720
 back down he can only advance then he 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 there is one thing to know about China 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.869
 parentheses if you manage to bring 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.020
 one of your white checkers on line 8 or 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.810
 that the opponent manage to bring a 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.340
 of his black pawns on the line he goes there 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.210
 have what is called promotion 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.890
 a pawn 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.590
 does that mean what does it mean if I 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.390
 successful so brought this white pawn on the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.190
 line 8 here in box h 8 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.810
 well i will be able to promove 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.320
 my pawns ie I will be able 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.000
 replace my piece with another piece 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.040
 so that will be for example I would choose 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 for example a crazy tower or a 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.190
 rider a queen 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.900
 it's up to you to agree and so you can 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.450
 have for example several queens on 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.770
 a chessboard the whites may have to 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.050
 reindeer and blacks can have to 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.300
 reindeer 3 reindeers agree depending on the 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.540
 number of pieces that the player will have year 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.320
 on line 8 for white pawns 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.830
 okay latest screenshots the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.990
 here's the hour again I represented 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.270
 by black circles the displacements 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.680
 possible for black pawns agree 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.200
 so these black pawns can only advance 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.280
 of a box or two because it is 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.280
 on its initial position 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.240
 that one he can advance a class 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.430
 because he is no longer on his position 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.990
 initial and that one 2015 because he 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.210
 is no longer its original position 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.760
 on the other hand you see here two stars 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.700
 black these two black star laws 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.120
 pardon correspond to displacements 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.890
 possible of a pawn for taking a 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.020
 piece or an opponent's piece 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.870
 does that mean what does it mean that 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.010
 made a pawn can only take in 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.780
 diagonally and thus advancing the pawn 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.380
 black who is here in d4 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.940
 he can take an opponent's piece but 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.709
 only if this piece is green 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.380
 finding his three here or to them three there 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.320
 agree a pawn so always advance 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.209
 it can never rule it back there 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.860
 second rule a pawn he takes in 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.709
 diagonally and obviously advancing 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.940
 okay last rules but that one 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.670
 will see a little bit later in a 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.590
 other video is the passing prison 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.989
 okay this rule is not 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.130
 essential to know to start 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.100
 in chess we'll see it's a bit more 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.489
 late so the best is that now 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.260
 we were going on titan and we 6 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.470
 million a part so I'm going to open 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.350
 chisty time it's gone 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.570
 so I'm going to have the whites and I 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.910
 will only move the pawns and I 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.079
 would let the opponent move but 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.270
 what is it that wants it 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.470
 okay so here I'm going to hold back 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.630
 move this pawn at random if I click 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.940
 game I activate here the cell ie 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.740
 the lake on which is the case okay 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.660
 the orgy of possible displacements like 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.810
 my pawns and on his initial box 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.250
 so I can move forward a square or two 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.380
 okay so there is an option that is 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.820
 very interesting time gisti it's the 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.550
 next you go in party option and 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.570
 you click on show movements 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.330
 valid hockey is so blue you 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.370
 have different different ones 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.740
 possible displacements for this pure 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.060
 okay so actually my client 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.560
 I can advance a class or 2 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.030
 contains for example I launches it and 2 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.130
 so I let my opponent play 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.050
 here he moved the yaws here but 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.310
 of a single box I want moved by 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.440
 example this pawn so now I the 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:21.940
 does not exceed 2.2 15 I move one on 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:23.290
 15 so my opponent is playing ok so here 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.530
 look a little bit maybe you 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.330
 have already seen the pawn that is there I 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.460
 can the advanced one box then 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.140
 obviously I can not move from 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.950
 2.15 because I'm not on my 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.410
 initial position 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.600
 and then anyway I already have this pawn 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.000
 who is there so I can not but in 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.890
 revenge I can take the most opponent 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.110
 here diagonally actually if I 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.970
 click on it a little bit I have the 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.500
 class 2 kg and activate here so that 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.910
 means I can move forward and the box 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.750
 red here that is enabled 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.130
 that means I can take this 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.020
 that they reverse you're gone I click 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.350
 on it then obviously I'm going to take 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.000
 this pawn but I will be at the mercy of 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.550
 those who have the who could 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.470
 possibly take diagonally 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.880
 also this kernel we will see a small 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.880
 little what the opposing player will do 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.380
 ok he took you saw a little bit 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.630
 my white pawns 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.630
 I will advance for example this pawn 1015 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.240
 opposing players at sight moved by 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.470
 in a little bit his rider we'll see 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.420
 in future videos what are 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.090
 the rules for moving riders 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.890
 but also the crazy la turns 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.410
 queen and king okay so I 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.700
 am always interested in what this piece 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.530
 are the possible displacements but in 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.180
 done I do not agree I can not 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.850
 not move forward because I already have a pawn 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.010
 so maybe you say I have that at 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.840
 take his place yes but I can not 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.150
 take his place because there I can not 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.650
 not eat the worst black enemy why 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.020
 because we can only take 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.340
 diagonal okay so if i click here 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.940
 a shelter move no displacement 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.410
 possible 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.540
 okay so I'm going for example 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:57.030
 move this piece then be a breakage 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.440
 be 2.2 to the gold who played choose two 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.280
 boxes then obviously strategically 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.960
 it may not be the best choice 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.450
 why because I can do 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:08.190
 eat by this pawn is not serious 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:09.720
 try you saw the opponent did not 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.410
 not eat so maybe it's 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.840
 strategic 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:19.530
 it was strategic good ben me I do not 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:19.890
 eat and tea party and that's it and so 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.990
 after 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.250
 so I hope you understood a 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.440
 little bit how can we move the 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.380
 pawns to sum up a pawn can only 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:33.840
 to go forward first thing second thing 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:35.640
 a pawn may be moved forward one space and 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.730
 possibly 2.6 of them on his 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.290
 initial position 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:43.200
 third thing to know a pawn of 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:46.230
 take that diagonally and moving forward 

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.020
 obviously fourth thing to know if 

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:51.510
 you manage to lead in white pawns 

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.830
 on line 8 here the opponent you 

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.110
 may have a promotion of your 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.420
 pawn and you can choose to have a 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.920
 other is white for example and 

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.120
 last rules to know who is a little 

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.980
 more complicated this one which is the 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.360
 taken from and I will come back on 

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.440
 this rule in a next video
