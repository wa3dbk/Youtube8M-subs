00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hello, we are preparing Karabakh today 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.360
 year for this in dishes pour 80 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.170
 milliliters of water and which you need 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.049
 add 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.410
 one and a half teaspoons without top dry 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.410
 yeast 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:31.349
 now add 100 milliliters here 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:35.070
 milk 2 tablespoons of sugar and so much 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.260
 flour to make a batter like 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:44.030
 I spent about one on pancakes 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.030
 a quarter of the flour on it 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.200
 all the ingredients are mixed and left 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.020
 so that the opara rose so we prepared 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.750
 bark when on the surface 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.450
 many bubbles of cracks appear 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.410
 it's ready now come up 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.910
 add vanilla sugar and a half eggs 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:13.790
 here 1 egg and 1 protein add 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.840
 we need the remaining sugar 100 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.310
 gram of sugar 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.140
 butter or margarine 80 grams 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:28.700
 the butter should be soft now 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:34.580
 mix all the ingredients add 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:38.479
 the remaining flour will need 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.780
 about 550 grams of dough we shift 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.280
 on the table and homemade 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.500
 the resulting dough send warm 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.310
 place a towel over it 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.130
 lifted and doing 2 fixings i.e. two 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.500
 times the dough should rise every time 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.120
 knead the dough after the second punch 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.460
 you can already work with the test 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.040
 while the dough is resting prepare the filling 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.620
 for this you need can fry on dry 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.770
 add pan to the cooled flour 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.030
 butter and chop the butter along with 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.030
 flour with a knife 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.270
 the resulting crumb is shifted to 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.270
 table add sugar and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.430
 we grind a stuffing between both palms 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.750
 until you get fine crumbs for the filling 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.400
 we will need 155 grams of butter 135 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.400
 grams of sugar 400 grams of flour 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.980
 divide the dough into 4 pieces covered 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.760
 towel and leave on the table to 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.710
 they came up 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.780
 now take one piece of dough 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.270
 roll it with a rolling pin 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.670
 no thinner than half a centimeter thick 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.490
 put the stuffing in the middle 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.980
 fillings need to take so much that she 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.980
 weighed about half the test 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.220
 for example if we took a piece of dough weighing 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.940
 200 grams and we will make of him gita then 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.860
 the filling needs to be taken weighing 100 grams 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.000
 the middle of the rolled dough cup 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.000
 grease 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.050
 the edges of the test are going to do exactly 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.050
 also as if we make belyashi 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:35.009
 at the end we connect the edges of the dough with our hands 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.009
 slightly smooth 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.130
 turn the whale on the front side 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.490
 now using the rolling pin smooth you 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:51.680
 on the dough but you can't just 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.680
 smooth rolling pin from the middle to the edges 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.190
 we shift the cat on a baking sheet 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:07.590
 laid baking paper 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.949
 cover with a towel and leave to 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.710
 it went up we got 4 5 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:17.660
 when they rise the surface 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.660
 grease egg yolk 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.950
 we prick with a fork and put a pattern and with 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.260
 using a fork when we form a cat 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.150
 its thickness should be no thinner than 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.810
 one and a half centimeters if we are 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.940
 roll out 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.340
 I'm less than one and a half thick 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.340
 centimeter then the filling will not be visible 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:31.520
 liver this at 180 degrees 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:34.150
 to a ruddy color like this 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.150
 on the cut 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.250
 I'm ready to have a nice tea party
