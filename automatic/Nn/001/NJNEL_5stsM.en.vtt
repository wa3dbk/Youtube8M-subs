00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.450 

now<00:00:07.310> I'm<00:00:07.459> going<00:00:07.729> to<00:00:07.850> tell<00:00:08.059> you<00:00:08.240> how<00:00:08.780> to<00:00:08.840> do

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
now I'm going to tell you how to do

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.940 
now I'm going to tell you how to do
shading<00:00:10.660> this<00:00:11.660> is<00:00:11.900> the<00:00:12.170> first<00:00:12.410> technique<00:00:12.619> will

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
shading this is the first technique will

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.299 
shading this is the first technique will
be<00:00:13.129> to<00:00:13.789> give<00:00:14.000> you<00:00:14.090> wash<00:00:14.330> wash<00:00:15.139> as<00:00:15.830> it<00:00:16.070> means

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
be to give you wash wash as it means

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.990 
be to give you wash wash as it means
literally<00:00:16.849> is<00:00:17.029> to<00:00:17.349> remove<00:00:18.349> something<00:00:19.220> so

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
literally is to remove something so

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.710 
literally is to remove something so
first<00:00:20.330> you<00:00:20.570> apply<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.020> color<00:00:22.720> directly

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
first you apply the color directly

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.830 
first you apply the color directly
thickly<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:25.189> then<00:00:26.119> as<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:28.789> area<00:00:29.090> progresses

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
thickly and then as the area progresses

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.740 
thickly and then as the area progresses
you<00:00:30.080> keep<00:00:30.349> diluting<00:00:32.230> your<00:00:33.230> brush<00:00:33.559> with<00:00:33.830> water

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
you keep diluting your brush with water

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.430 
you keep diluting your brush with water
and<00:00:35.750> just<00:00:36.589> start<00:00:36.890> filling<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:37.339> area<00:00:37.519> so<00:00:38.440> first

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
and just start filling the area so first

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.289 
and just start filling the area so first
one<00:00:39.799> or<00:00:39.949> two<00:00:40.129> times<00:00:40.370> will<00:00:40.670> be<00:00:40.820> loading<00:00:41.150> the

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:41.299 
one or two times will be loading the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.840 
one or two times will be loading the
brush<00:00:41.510> with<00:00:41.720> paint<00:00:41.860> after<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.460> you'll<00:00:43.699> only

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
brush with paint after that you'll only

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.979 
brush with paint after that you'll only
be<00:00:44.210> filling<00:00:44.570> it<00:00:44.750> with<00:00:44.780> water

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.590 

you'll<00:00:48.260> be<00:00:48.440> diluting<00:00:48.949> it<00:00:49.010> with<00:00:49.159> water<00:00:49.600> so

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
you'll be diluting it with water so

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.390 
you'll be diluting it with water so
you'll<00:00:50.750> be<00:00:50.900> washing<00:00:51.409> the<00:00:51.440> existing<00:00:52.129> thick

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
you'll be washing the existing thick

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.280 
you'll be washing the existing thick
color<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:55.010> that<00:00:55.040> you<00:00:55.250> will<00:00:55.489> get<00:00:55.670> different

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
color so that you will get different

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.240 
color so that you will get different
shades<00:00:57.290> and<00:00:57.650> tones<00:00:57.739> of<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.460> same<00:00:59.449> color<00:01:00.250> so

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
shades and tones of the same color so

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.899 
shades and tones of the same color so
this<00:01:01.549> technique<00:01:02.239> is<00:01:02.420> used<00:01:02.659> to<00:01:02.869> produce

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
this technique is used to produce

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.670 
this technique is used to produce
three-dimensional<00:01:04.909> effect<00:01:05.290> say<00:01:06.290> for<00:01:06.590> the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
three-dimensional effect say for the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.969 
three-dimensional effect say for the
skin<00:01:07.150> or<00:01:08.150> any<00:01:08.540> fruits<00:01:08.990> or<00:01:11.020> any<00:01:13.179> live<00:01:14.179> object

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
skin or any fruits or any live object

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.880 
skin or any fruits or any live object
see<00:01:15.979> now<00:01:16.159> I<00:01:16.460> am<00:01:16.820> gonna<00:01:17.060> have<00:01:17.119> stopped<00:01:17.890> taking

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
see now I am gonna have stopped taking

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.560 
see now I am gonna have stopped taking
paint<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:20.450> just<00:01:21.140> loading<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:23.090> brush<00:01:23.329> with

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
paint and just loading the brush with

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.279 
paint and just loading the brush with
more<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:23.990> more<00:01:24.049> water<00:01:24.409> I<00:01:25.659> am<00:01:26.659> trying<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.109> use

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
more and more water I am trying to use

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.219 
more and more water I am trying to use
up<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.770> leftover<00:01:28.280> paint<00:01:28.549> in<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:28.999> brush<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.570> am

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
up the leftover paint in the brush I am

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:41.789 
up the leftover paint in the brush I am
NOT<00:01:30.469> taking<00:01:30.679> any<00:01:31.009> more<00:01:31.310> fresh<00:01:32.060> paint

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.679 

so<00:01:42.799> this<00:01:42.979> way<00:01:43.249> the<00:01:43.609> paint<00:01:43.880> will<00:01:44.149> disappear

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
so this way the paint will disappear

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.030 
so this way the paint will disappear
into<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.990> white<00:01:45.259> space<00:01:45.619> on<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:45.950> paper

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:02:03.359 

you

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.800 

if<00:02:03.729> you<00:02:03.880> fill<00:02:04.270> in<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.600> painters<00:02:06.420> thick<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.630> one

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
if you fill in the painters thick in one

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.570 
if you fill in the painters thick in one
area<00:02:08.050> until<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.679> area<00:02:09.039> just<00:02:09.420> slightly<00:02:11.580> wash

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
area until of area just slightly wash

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.430 
area until of area just slightly wash
the<00:02:12.850> paint<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.480> blend<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.080> with<00:02:14.230> them

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
the paint and blend it with them

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:23.860 
the paint and blend it with them
adjacent<00:02:15.040> area

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.140 

to<00:02:24.870> give<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.410> much<00:02:25.740> better<00:02:25.980> 3d<00:02:26.400> effect<00:02:26.820> what<00:02:27.000> you

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
to give a much better 3d effect what you

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.660 
to give a much better 3d effect what you
can<00:02:27.330> do<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:28.470> give<00:02:28.650> around<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:29.070> level<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.400> can

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
can do is to give around a level you can

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.420 
can do is to give around a level you can
take<00:02:29.940> some<00:02:30.210> more<00:02:30.420> thick<00:02:30.690> paint<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:32.010> fill<00:02:32.280> it

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
take some more thick paint and fill it

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.730 
take some more thick paint and fill it
on<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:33.260> other<00:02:34.260> edge<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.130> Apple<00:02:35.460> as<00:02:35.610> well

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
on the other edge of the Apple as well

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.000 
on the other edge of the Apple as well
so<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:37.980> way<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.250> will<00:02:38.460> get<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.640> feeling<00:02:38.970> of

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
so that way you will get a feeling of

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:50.490 
so that way you will get a feeling of
round<00:02:41.010> object<00:02:42.260> something<00:02:43.260> solid

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.970 

the<00:02:51.130> main<00:02:51.340> idea<00:02:51.820> here<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:53.350> pain<00:02:53.620> should

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
the main idea here is the pain should

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.370 
the main idea here is the pain should
not<00:02:55.410> stick<00:02:56.410> out<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:57.370> any<00:02:57.700> place<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.360> just<00:02:58.990> blend

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
not stick out in any place it just blend

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.920 
not stick out in any place it just blend
with<00:02:59.650> the<00:03:00.150> area<00:03:01.150> adjacent<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.720> that's

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
with the area adjacent to it so that's

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.640 
with the area adjacent to it so that's
the<00:03:05.170> main<00:03:05.410> skill<00:03:06.340> about<00:03:06.720> these<00:03:07.720> shading

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
the main skill about these shading

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.250 
the main skill about these shading
techniques<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:10.180> for<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.900> have<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.080> be

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
techniques so for this you have to be

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.130 
techniques so for this you have to be
very<00:03:11.830> quick<00:03:12.310> otherwise<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.570> paint<00:03:13.810> will<00:03:14.110> dry

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
very quick otherwise the paint will dry

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.000 
very quick otherwise the paint will dry
and<00:03:14.700> blending<00:03:15.700> might<00:03:15.880> become<00:03:16.150> difficult

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
and blending might become difficult

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.340 
and blending might become difficult
though<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.160> may<00:03:18.340> not<00:03:18.370> be<00:03:18.630> also<00:03:19.630> difficult<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:20.290> a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
though it may not be also difficult in a

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.810 
though it may not be also difficult in a
Tanjore<00:03:20.740> work<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.130> if<00:03:21.250> you're<00:03:21.400> doing<00:03:21.640> on<00:03:21.790> a

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
Tanjore work that if you're doing on a

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.080 
Tanjore work that if you're doing on a
paper<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:23.320> to<00:03:23.590> be<00:03:23.740> very<00:03:23.980> quick<00:03:24.310> because<00:03:24.460> the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
paper it to be very quick because the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.090 
paper it to be very quick because the
tendency<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.780> paper<00:03:26.050> to<00:03:26.290> absorb<00:03:26.380> water<00:03:26.800> is

tendency of the paper to absorb water is
more<00:03:27.370> than<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:28.360> bone<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:29.290> paint<00:03:29.560> will

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
more than the bone the paint will

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:52.449 
more than the bone the paint will
quickly<00:03:30.250> dry

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:05.080 

the<00:03:53.459> area

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.560 

this<00:04:06.090> talk<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.840> just<00:04:07.110> filling<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.650> color

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
this talk and just filling the color

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:15.680 
this talk and just filling the color
that<00:04:09.570> what<00:04:10.110> just<00:04:10.470> as<00:04:10.710> it<00:04:10.920> comes<00:04:14.210> maybe<00:04:15.210> you<00:04:15.450> can

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
that what just as it comes maybe you can

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.510 
that what just as it comes maybe you can
just<00:04:16.100> make<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.310> darker<00:04:17.820> at<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.000> top<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:23.490> that

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
just make it darker at the top so that

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:33.980 
just make it darker at the top so that
means<00:04:23.910> this<00:04:24.030> will<00:04:24.210> also<00:04:24.570> get<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.080> do<00:04:32.990> to

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
means this will also get it to do to

00:04:33.990 --> 00:05:01.749 
means this will also get it to do to
color<00:04:34.490> color

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
like this and just fill it so that there

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.290 
like this and just fill it so that there
is<00:05:45.509> very<00:05:45.749> less<00:05:46.019> paint<00:05:46.409> in<00:05:46.649> that<00:05:46.679> area<00:05:47.149> so<00:05:48.149> it

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
is very less paint in that area so it

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.600 
is very less paint in that area so it
