00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
some of them are so dead that i don't

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.080

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
use the covers on them anymore and that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.149 
use the covers on them anymore and that
was<00:01:03.239> what<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> cut<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.290> out<00:01:04.470> so

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
was what that was so I cut that out so

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.710 
was what that was so I cut that out so
they<00:01:05.280> could<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.060> both<00:01:06.180> sides<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.570> it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
they could have it on both sides and it

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840 
they could have it on both sides and it
ends<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:07.350> along<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.430> pumpkin

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
ends right along here so the pumpkin

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.850 
ends right along here so the pumpkin
just<00:01:09.119> kind<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.330> comes<00:01:09.540> around<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> corner<00:01:10.080> so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
just kind of comes around the corner so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.390 
just kind of comes around the corner so
we<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> haunted<00:01:11.820> house<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:13.010> then<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.220> go

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
accordion style and made it look like a

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.400 
accordion style and made it look like a
table<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.329> then<00:04:09.450> we<00:04:09.510> have<00:04:09.600> a<00:04:09.660> creepy<00:04:10.079> hand
