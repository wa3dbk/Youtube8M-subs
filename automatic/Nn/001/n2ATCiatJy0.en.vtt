00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.280
 six hours depends on your internet it 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.539
 it may take much longer or much less 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.969
 that has been downloaded them down a 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.280
 RAR file gives you right click and they give you 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.660
 extract data will ask for a password 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.579
 and I 'm going to describe them in the description 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.230
 leave and also here well if they are 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.390
 watching the video they copy and paste it 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.220
 far ok I did not succeed because I already 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.560
 I have and since it has finished 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.840
 extract that they are about 10 more minutes or 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.729
 unless you leave this folder 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.039
 now you are going to approach double 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.869
 click and they appreciate all your files 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.729
 not to do that installs the game is very 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.229
 easy here will come other 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.649
 instructions in case you want 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.909
 but this I did not understand them much if 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.649
 you come to have an error that 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.020
 does not open the game or something like that 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.579
 download if these programs here are 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.619
 many programs now what are they going to 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.679
 have to do is double click the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.570
 crack copy these three files and it 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.090
 go says wine 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.990
 read and paste replace the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.330
 files and now they will have the game and 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.540
 remember that here they will also have 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.560
 other instructions now to open the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.780
 I play what you are going to have to 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.300
 do is give a bill and give it where it says 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.280
 watch docs give double click and 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.840
 disappear something from a play that is being 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.700
 updating as it is finished 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.259
 update you will appear this from 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.660
 login you are not going to have 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.000
 to do nothing if they leave it and now where 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.789
 says game launcher right click 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.130
 and they make a shortcut in the 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.959
 desktop as you want , open it 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.090
 This is going to be how they are going to open the game 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.830
 frequent they always have to open from 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.110
 white sox so you can open this 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.380
 if it does not have it open, it is not going to 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.690
 to be able to open this follows 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.240
 there will always be now is going to appear 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.190
 this gives you more information to run from 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.500
 all ways remember that this type of 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.120
 files do not have any viruses and if you 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.050
 comes to detect viruses is the crack 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.050
 because he does not have 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.379
 the 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.870
 it has no author and that's why it detects 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.650
 virus so I'm going to press the video 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.599
 tower we think 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.560
 the game has already been opened and now what 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.019
 you are going to have to do is 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.930
 press any key and it will send them 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.819
 to the menu as you see it is opening and 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.260
 will put several options and now for 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.720
 put it in Spanish you what 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.440
 will have to do is give you options 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.560
 language and audium and they go here where it says 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.540
 language and text will be in English 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.880
 you are the net that bow the little arrow 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.080
 for the right until they find 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.820
 where to go to Spanish they give you to apply and already 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.140
 like it will reopen the game well 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.880
 very fast and they will have it in 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.010
 Spanish here if you want to change 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.040
 the volume that is very loud he 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.410
 they lower it now here will be the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.440
 controls in case they want to change the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.760
 keyboard and mouse and all that quality of 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.070
 the graphics if you do not have a 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.680
 good video card as the intel 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.170
 graphics 4000 something like this 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.080
 Put everything under now as I finish it 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.120
 to put everything together this embargo but what 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.910
 Major put it in between now 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.459
 screen this the resolution of the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.350
 screen is if you have a laptop 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.520
 I recommend and if you have a computer and 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.610
 already cpu the one that I have from your computer is 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.290
 what they put window mode that you 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.830
 put on false is right now because no 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.670
 record the field if I put it in the moment 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.580
 Alan go back and they put the new 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.260
 initial new match here that initial 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.230
 now to leave you will go out to 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.180
 desk and they give doing 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.010
 this would be all little friends I hope that you 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.989
