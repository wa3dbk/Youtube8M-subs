00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
squat machine that you guys that wall

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.320 
squat machine that you guys that wall
that<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.530> purchased<00:00:10.980> from<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:12.030> can<00:00:12.059> see

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
that I purchased from you you can see

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.690 
that I purchased from you you can see
here<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.769> it's<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.950> machine<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.519> guys

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
here is it's the machine that you guys

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.480 
here is it's the machine that you guys
have<00:00:15.920> but<00:00:16.920> I've<00:00:17.039> made<00:00:17.160> some<00:00:17.220> minor

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
have but I've made some minor

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.700 
have but I've made some minor
adjustments<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.449> I'll<00:00:19.199> let<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.350> see<00:00:19.529> right

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
adjustments to it I'll let you see right

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:29.150 
adjustments to it I'll let you see right
now<00:00:27.140> cut<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> little<00:00:28.289> slit<00:00:28.590> there<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.099> could

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
now cut a little slit there so it could

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.450 
now cut a little slit there so it could
fit<00:00:29.449> but<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.539> still<00:00:30.689> very<00:00:30.750> supported<00:00:31.439> but<00:00:32.309> I

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
fit but it's still very supported but I

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.860 
fit but it's still very supported but I
think<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> two-inch<00:00:33.149> steel<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.690> have

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
think the two-inch steel that you have

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.040 
think the two-inch steel that you have
and<00:00:34.829> they<00:00:35.010> struck<00:00:35.370> hitch<00:00:35.579> pins<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> have

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and they struck hitch pins that I have

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.810 
and they struck hitch pins that I have
instead<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> bolt<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.399> easy<00:00:38.550> access

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
instead of the bolt so it's easy access

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:50.049 
instead of the bolt so it's easy access
to<00:00:39.120> take<00:00:39.300> off<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:40.079> replacement<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.950> made

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.450 

same<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.239> done<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:53.219> put<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
same is done to this one and I put a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.529 
same is done to this one and I put a
little<00:00:54.770> screw<00:00:55.770> there<00:00:55.980> taps<00:00:56.280> crew<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.510> they

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
little screw there taps crew so they

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.200 
little screw there taps crew so they
would<00:00:58.289> stop<00:00:58.530> vibrating<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.160> stop<00:00:59.399> all<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
would stop vibrating or stop all the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.760 
would stop vibrating or stop all the
shaky<00:01:00.449> movements<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.140> movement<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.680> would

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
shaky movements the movement so it would

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.170 
shaky movements the movement so it would
be<00:01:01.829> nice<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.250> steady<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.730> you're<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:02.969> there

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
be nice and steady when you're on there

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.600 
be nice and steady when you're on there
still<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.180> had<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.510> made<00:01:10.400> which<00:01:11.400> is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
still and I had this made which is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.460 
still and I had this made which is
constructed<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.390> steel<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.110> well<00:01:13.140> from

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
constructed of steel as well from

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.929 
constructed of steel as well from
another<00:01:13.680> machine<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.189> wasn't<00:01:14.400> using<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.880> I

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
another machine that I wasn't using so I

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.080 
another machine that I wasn't using so I
cut<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:15.810> I'm<00:01:16.290> sure<00:01:16.350> your<00:01:17.189> factory<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.820> if

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
cut it but I'm sure your factory can if

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.810 
cut it but I'm sure your factory can if
you<00:01:18.210> decide<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.750> make<00:01:18.869> something<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.380> this

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
you decide to make something like this

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.100 
you decide to make something like this
could<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> much<00:01:21.119> better<00:01:21.180> job<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.930> is

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
could do a much better job but this is

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.660 
could do a much better job but this is
the<00:01:22.200> way<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.350> did<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:23.280> put<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> pad

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the way I did it just put a pad

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.760 
the way I did it just put a pad
underneath<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.320> some<00:01:25.320> 2-inch<00:01:25.650> square<00:01:25.979> tubing

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
underneath it some 2-inch square tubing

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.140 
underneath it some 2-inch square tubing
holds<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.009> cotter<00:01:29.220> pin<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.700> holes<00:01:29.939> for

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
holds for the cotter pin or holes for

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.149 
holds for the cotter pin or holes for
the<00:01:30.210> truck<00:01:30.420> hitch<00:01:30.600> pins<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.710> that's<00:01:31.890> how<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the truck hitch pins and that's how it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:55.779 
the truck hitch pins and that's how it
goes<00:01:32.340> on

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.719 

well<00:01:56.789> what<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.270> Oh<00:02:01.069> probably<00:02:02.069> think<00:02:02.520> I

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
well what is this Oh probably think I

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.520 
well what is this Oh probably think I
made<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.329> other<00:02:03.509> adjustment<00:02:04.049> well<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.319> haven't

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
made one other adjustment well I haven't

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.990 
made one other adjustment well I haven't
made<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.770> yet<00:02:05.810> but<00:02:06.810> here's<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.110> standard

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
made it yet but here's a standard

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.740 
made it yet but here's a standard
footplate<00:02:09.000> before<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.360> calf<00:02:09.569> raise<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:11.750> need

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
footplate before the calf raise I need

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.080 
footplate before the calf raise I need
to<00:02:12.840> make<00:02:12.959> another<00:02:13.170> hole<00:02:13.440> here<00:02:13.830> slightly<00:02:14.790> move

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
to make another hole here slightly move

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.520 
to make another hole here slightly move
this<00:02:15.299> I<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.930> right<00:02:19.110> there<00:02:21.230> but<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
this I have that right there but for the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.650 
this I have that right there but for the
time<00:02:22.799> being<00:02:25.549> I'm<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.610> whole<00:02:26.880> big<00:02:27.060> block<00:02:27.299> just

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
time being I'm a whole big block just

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:43.759 
time being I'm a whole big block just
for<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.840> time<00:02:28.049> bein<00:02:30.920> I'm<00:02:31.920> gonna<00:02:32.069> try<00:02:32.250> use<00:02:42.769> and

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
for the time bein I'm gonna try use and

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.370 
for the time bein I'm gonna try use and
there<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.340> go<00:02:44.549> what<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.360> we'll<00:02:46.200> take<00:02:46.319> a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
there you go what is it we'll take a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:03:04.770 
there you go what is it we'll take a
look

so<00:03:05.780> that's<00:03:06.140> what<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.349> did

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
so that's what I did

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.830 
so that's what I did
I've<00:03:07.430> seen<00:03:07.730> pretty<00:03:08.030> good<00:03:08.150> results<00:03:08.510> by<00:03:08.630> that

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
I've seen pretty good results by that

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.800 
I've seen pretty good results by that
and<00:03:09.050> I<00:03:09.620> know<00:03:09.680> similar<00:03:10.160> machines<00:03:10.520> even<00:03:11.239> basic

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
and I know similar machines even basic

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.280 
and I know similar machines even basic
like<00:03:11.989> this<00:03:12.260> are<00:03:13.160> very<00:03:13.220> expensive<00:03:14.170> over<00:03:15.170> the
