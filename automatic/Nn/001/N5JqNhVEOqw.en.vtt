00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
this one actually pretty good but then

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:26.369 
this one actually pretty good but then
this<00:03:21.729> one<00:03:22.949> we<00:03:23.949> don't<00:03:24.479> people<00:03:25.479> who<00:03:25.780> know<00:03:26.139> this

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
this one we don't people who know this

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.520
