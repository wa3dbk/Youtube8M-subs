00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
we kind of all get together and kind of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.650 
we kind of all get together and kind of
bounce<00:01:23.310> ideas<00:01:23.520> off<00:01:23.820> each<00:01:23.880> other<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.300> little<00:01:24.480> bit

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
bounce ideas off each other a little bit

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.200 
bounce ideas off each other a little bit
and<00:01:24.900> kind<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.980> formulate<00:01:26.370> one<00:01:26.640> really<00:01:26.940> great

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
and kind of formulate one really great

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.830 
and kind of formulate one really great
idea<00:01:27.690> out<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.230> all<00:01:28.440> of<00:01:28.470> us<00:01:28.710> from<00:01:29.040> there<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:30.300> do<00:01:30.480> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
idea out of all of us from there we do a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.780 
idea out of all of us from there we do a
couple<00:01:31.170> practices<00:01:31.740> try<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> figure<00:01:32.310> out<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
couple practices try to figure out the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.370 
couple practices try to figure out the
timing<00:01:33.030> things<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:34.050> go<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
timing things like that we go in the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.980 
timing things like that we go in the
studio<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:35.190> shoot<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.940> actual<00:01:36.270> motion<00:01:36.660> from

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
studio we shoot the actual motion from

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.980 
studio we shoot the actual motion from
there<00:01:37.260> we<00:01:37.710> take<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:38.280> data<00:01:38.460> process<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.600> get

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
there we take the data process it get

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.870 
there we take the data process it get
into<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.260> computer<00:01:40.650> exaggerate<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.760> well

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
into the computer exaggerate it well

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.370 
into the computer exaggerate it well
beyond<00:01:42.150> whatever<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.600> shot<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.050> that<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.290> get

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
beyond whatever we shot so that we get

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.810 
beyond whatever we shot so that we get
like<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.680> really<00:01:44.070> great<00:01:44.190> performance

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
like this really great performance

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.150 
like this really great performance
without<00:01:45.030> all<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.270> gruesome<00:01:45.800> brutal<00:01:46.800> things

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160

without all the gruesome brutal things
that<00:01:47.310> people<00:01:47.580> come<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.850> expect<00:01:48.120> from<00:01:48.240> more

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that people come to expect from more

the missiles fly out and we've been

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.820 
the missiles fly out and we've been
telling<00:04:34.389> our<00:04:34.630> artists<00:04:35.110> let's<00:04:35.440> leave<00:04:35.620> it<00:04:35.680> at

telling our artists let's leave it at
about<00:04:35.980> six<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.790> then<00:04:37.150> all<00:04:37.300> these<00:04:37.480> missiles

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
about six and then all these missiles

about six and then all these missiles
flying<00:04:38.230> around<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:38.830> all<00:04:38.980> these<00:04:39.100> particle

effects<00:04:39.970> going<00:04:40.180> off<00:04:40.419> we<00:04:40.660> were<00:04:40.750> wondering<00:04:40.990> how

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
effects going off we were wondering how

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.720 
effects going off we were wondering how
we<00:04:41.350> were<00:04:41.470> going<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:41.740> call<00:04:41.889> that<00:04:41.950> by<00:04:42.280> then<00:04:42.430> but

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
we were going to call that by then but

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.580 
we were going to call that by then but
as<00:04:42.940> it<00:04:43.270> turned<00:04:43.480> out<00:04:43.630> we<00:04:43.810> managed<00:04:44.139> to<00:04:44.169> make<00:04:44.440> it

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
as it turned out we managed to make it

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.170 
as it turned out we managed to make it
work<00:04:44.740> every<00:04:45.220> fatality<00:04:45.730> had<00:04:45.880> its<00:04:46.030> own

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
work every fatality had its own

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.690 
work every fatality had its own
challenges<00:04:46.419> ranging<00:04:47.139> from<00:04:47.620> just<00:04:48.220> making<00:04:48.580> the

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
challenges ranging from just making the

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.790 
challenges ranging from just making the
blood<00:04:48.940> look<00:04:49.210> good<00:04:49.480> and<00:04:49.780> blood<00:04:50.530> from<00:04:50.710> the

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
blood look good and blood from the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.710 
blood look good and blood from the
outset<00:04:51.220> there's<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.970> tricky<00:04:52.300> thing<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.480> get

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
outset there's a tricky thing to get

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.810 
outset there's a tricky thing to get
right<00:04:52.750> when<00:04:53.260> we<00:04:53.590> have<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.889> do<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:54.220> graphic<00:04:54.700> that

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
right when we have to do a graphic that

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.790 
right when we have to do a graphic that
will<00:04:54.970> update<00:04:55.120> 60<00:04:55.600> times<00:04:55.810> a<00:04:55.900> second<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.560> best

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
will update 60 times a second the best

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.730 
will update 60 times a second the best
fatalities<00:04:57.400> are<00:04:57.669> the<00:04:57.970> ones<00:04:58.180> that<00:04:58.570> are<00:04:59.080> nasty

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
fatalities are the ones that are nasty

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.980 
fatalities are the ones that are nasty
they're<00:05:00.400> like<00:05:00.669> really<00:05:00.850> violent<00:05:01.360> but<00:05:01.810> at<00:05:01.900> the

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
they're like really violent but at the

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.860 
they're like really violent but at the
same<00:05:02.200> time<00:05:02.410> have<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:03.070> comedic<00:05:03.700> tone<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.840> it

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
same time have a comedic tone to it

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.020 
same time have a comedic tone to it
those<00:05:05.290> are<00:05:05.440> always<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.740> best<00:05:05.860> one<00:05:06.340> most<00:05:06.880> of

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
those are always the best one most of

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.090 
those are always the best one most of
them<00:05:07.150> actually<00:05:07.330> have<00:05:07.720> a<00:05:07.750> comedic<00:05:08.169> tone<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:09.070> it

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
them actually have a comedic tone to it

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.070 
them actually have a comedic tone to it
and<00:05:09.460> I<00:05:09.669> think<00:05:09.729> that's<00:05:10.060> what<00:05:10.300> makes<00:05:10.510> fatalities

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
and I think that's what makes fatalities

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.839 
and I think that's what makes fatalities
popular
