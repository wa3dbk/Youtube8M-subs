up some red paint put in the top circle

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.850 
up some red paint put in the top circle
just<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.700> little<00:00:33.059> staying<00:00:33.809> inside<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.290> circle

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
just a little staying inside the circle

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.010 
just a little staying inside the circle
with<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.579> red<00:00:35.880> which<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> primary

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
with the red which is one of the primary

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.160 
with the red which is one of the primary
colors<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.030> then<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.360> will<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.840> pick<00:00:40.020> up

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
colors and then I will go on and pick up

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.310 
colors and then I will go on and pick up
a<00:00:40.350> fresh<00:00:40.980> brush<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.910> new<00:00:42.120> one<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.870> only<00:00:43.020> has

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
a fresh brush a new one that only has

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.639 
a fresh brush a new one that only has
yellow<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> won't<00:00:45.690> put<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.440> in

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
yellow on it and then I won't put it in

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.190 
yellow on it and then I won't put it in
the<00:00:46.829> second<00:00:47.370> circle<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:48.450> seeing<00:00:48.840> here

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the second circle we are seeing here

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.350

that<00:00:49.469> red<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.129> yellow<00:00:50.610> will<00:00:51.000> mix<00:00:51.180> together

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
that red and yellow will mix together

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.670 
that red and yellow will mix together
we'll<00:00:51.719> make<00:00:51.750> orange<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:53.070> we'll<00:00:53.460> try<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.789> I

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
we'll make orange now we'll try that I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.220 
we'll make orange now we'll try that I
will<00:00:55.680> go<00:00:55.860> under<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.610> equation<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.449> circle

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
will go under the equation and circle

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.260 
will go under the equation and circle
and<00:00:58.410> some<00:00:58.620> red<00:00:59.629> pick<00:01:00.629> my<00:01:00.899> brush<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.530> again<00:01:02.270> put

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
and some red pick my brush up again put

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.000 
and some red pick my brush up again put
the<00:01:03.420> yellow<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:05.869> go<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.080> top<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.770> mix

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the yellow and go on top of that and mix

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.960 
the yellow and go on top of that and mix
it<00:01:08.189> together

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.230 

from<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:17.810> mixing<00:01:18.410> we<00:01:18.590> can<00:01:18.770> indeed<00:01:19.190> see<00:01:19.240> that

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
from this mixing we can indeed see that

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.170 
from this mixing we can indeed see that
red<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.020> yellow<00:01:21.350> make<00:01:21.770> this<00:01:22.280> secondary<00:01:22.820> color

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
red and yellow make this secondary color

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.200 
red and yellow make this secondary color
orange<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:24.770> next<00:01:25.100> color<00:01:25.340> we<00:01:25.580> are<00:01:25.610> asked<00:01:26.180> to

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
orange the next color we are asked to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.160 
orange the next color we are asked to
make<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.170> secondary<00:01:27.650> color<00:01:28.010> green<00:01:29.170> since

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
make is the secondary color green since

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.170 
make is the secondary color green since
yellow<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.860> lightest<00:01:31.370> we'll<00:01:31.790> start<00:01:32.060> with

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
yellow is the lightest we'll start with

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.090 
yellow is the lightest we'll start with
the<00:01:32.300> yellow<00:01:32.450> first<00:01:32.840> we're<00:01:33.530> going<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:33.800> try

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
the yellow first we're going to try

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.990 
the yellow first we're going to try
yellow<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:34.820> blue<00:01:35.770> yellow<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.130> top<00:01:37.370> circle

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.070 

blue<00:01:41.000> in<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.450> bottom<00:01:41.810> circle<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:44.810> we<00:01:44.990> are

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
blue in the bottom circle so we are

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.530 
blue in the bottom circle so we are
saying<00:01:45.410> yellow<00:01:45.740> +<00:01:46.280> blue<00:01:46.310> will<00:01:47.000> make<00:01:47.180> green

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
saying yellow + blue will make green

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.100 
saying yellow + blue will make green
let's<00:01:48.500> try<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:49.000> yellow<00:01:50.000> first<00:01:50.450> because<00:01:50.900> it's

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
let's try it yellow first because it's

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.300 
let's try it yellow first because it's
the<00:01:51.260> lightest<00:01:53.500> mixing<00:01:54.500> in<00:01:54.650> with<00:01:54.680> some<00:01:55.040> of<00:01:55.190> our

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
the lightest mixing in with some of our

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:04.420 
the lightest mixing in with some of our
blue<00:01:59.440> should<00:02:00.440> give<00:02:00.740> us<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.100> nice<00:02:01.400> green<00:02:02.360> if<00:02:03.430> we

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
blue should give us a nice green if we

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.150 
blue should give us a nice green if we
want<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.729> darker<00:02:05.060> green<00:02:05.270> then<00:02:06.170> we<00:02:06.320> can<00:02:06.500> add<00:02:06.530> blue

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
want a darker green then we can add blue

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.210 
want a darker green then we can add blue
if<00:02:07.520> we<00:02:08.119> want<00:02:08.330> our<00:02:08.479> lighter<00:02:08.780> green<00:02:09.259> then<00:02:09.770> we<00:02:10.070> can

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
if we want our lighter green then we can

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.880 
if we want our lighter green then we can
add<00:02:10.250> yellow<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:11.810> see<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.050> yellow<00:02:12.560> and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
add yellow so we see that yellow and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.940 
add yellow so we see that yellow and
blue<00:02:13.130> do<00:02:13.520> make<00:02:13.730> green<00:02:14.090> our<00:02:15.020> last<00:02:15.350> color<00:02:15.740> is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
blue do make green our last color is

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.360 
blue do make green our last color is
purple<00:02:16.660> for<00:02:17.660> purple<00:02:18.260> we're<00:02:18.650> going<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.130> mix

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
purple for purple we're going to mix

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.680 
purple for purple we're going to mix
blue<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.410> red<00:02:21.670> put<00:02:22.670> some<00:02:22.880> blue<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.450> top

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
blue and red put some blue in the top

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.900 
blue and red put some blue in the top
circle<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.989> we<00:02:27.080> put<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.500> read<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.519> bottom

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
circle and we put so read in the bottom

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.560 
circle and we put so read in the bottom
circle<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.590> we're<00:02:30.769> saying<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.430> red<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.060> blue

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
circle so we're saying that red and blue

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.270 
circle so we're saying that red and blue
will<00:02:33.350> make<00:02:33.590> purple<00:02:34.480> we<00:02:35.480> have<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:36.709> put<00:02:36.950> some

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
will make purple we have to put some

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:46.090 
will make purple we have to put some
blue<00:02:40.360> then<00:02:41.360> we'll<00:02:41.570> put<00:02:41.840> some<00:02:42.110> red<00:02:44.739> mix<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.950> all

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
blue then we'll put some red mix it all

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.470 
blue then we'll put some red mix it all
together<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:47.560> we<00:02:48.560> will<00:02:48.680> have<00:02:48.860> purple<00:02:49.400> we<00:02:50.330> all

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
together and we will have purple we all

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.840 
together and we will have purple we all
know<00:02:50.780> there<00:02:50.989> are<00:02:51.080> many<00:02:51.470> different<00:02:52.430> kinds<00:02:52.459> of

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
know there are many different kinds of

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.630 
know there are many different kinds of
purple<00:02:53.299> so<00:02:54.019> we<00:02:54.290> wanted<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:54.980> be<00:02:55.010> more<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.519> a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
purple so we wanted this to be more of a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.780 
purple so we wanted this to be more of a
red<00:02:55.940> then<00:02:56.510> we<00:02:56.720> would<00:02:56.870> add<00:02:56.900> more<00:02:57.290> rent<00:02:57.590> if<00:02:57.920> you

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
red then we would add more rent if you

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.789 
red then we would add more rent if you
wanted<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.390> be<00:02:59.450> more<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.230> darker

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
wanted this to be more of a darker

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.720 
wanted this to be more of a darker
purple<00:03:01.280> then<00:03:01.760> we'll<00:03:02.030> add<00:03:02.299> more<00:03:02.330> blue<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.730> mix

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
purple then we'll add more blue and mix

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.840 
purple then we'll add more blue and mix
it<00:03:04.940> all<00:03:05.090> up<00:03:05.120> together<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.260> then<00:03:07.190> we<00:03:07.310> have<00:03:07.459> us<00:03:07.670> a

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
it all up together and then we have us a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.310 
it all up together and then we have us a
nice<00:03:08.180> shade<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.110> purple<00:03:10.239> so<00:03:11.239> we<00:03:11.780> have<00:03:11.930> learned

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
nice shade of purple so we have learned

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.830 
nice shade of purple so we have learned
that<00:03:13.040> when<00:03:13.310> we<00:03:13.489> mix<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.910> primary<00:03:14.330> colors<00:03:14.690> red

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
that when we mix the primary colors red

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.140 
that when we mix the primary colors red
yellow<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.440> blue<00:03:15.560> together<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.459> certain

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
yellow and blue together and certain

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.750 
yellow and blue together and certain
combination<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:18.440> showing<00:03:18.920> here<00:03:19.070> in<00:03:19.190> our<00:03:19.340> chart

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
combination is showing here in our chart

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.360 
combination is showing here in our chart
that<00:03:20.510> we<00:03:20.690> can<00:03:20.900> make<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.290> secondary<00:03:21.860> colors

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
that we can make the secondary colors

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.120 
that we can make the secondary colors
orange<00:03:22.700> green<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.360> perfect<00:03:24.080> try<00:03:25.069> this

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
orange green and perfect try this

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.580 
orange green and perfect try this
experiment
