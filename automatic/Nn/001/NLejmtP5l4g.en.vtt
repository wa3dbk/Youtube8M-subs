00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.070
 Failed failed 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.040
 the result at the second child seat 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.109
 test of the adac in 2013 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.400
 sobering 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:20.130
 To be honest, I am something this time 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.439
 disappointed we tested 15 models 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.539
 four of them have received a poor 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.410
 such a high rate we already had 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.060
 not for a long time 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.130
 I hope that in the next test 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.810
 looks better again but until then 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
 Let's take a look at the current one 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.640
 test from all weight classes 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.800
 was tested on the seats tested 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.280
 criteria safety so protection in 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.010
 accident handling and ergonomics and on 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.530
 Pollutants in this seat tear the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.350
 Isofix arms out of the bracket of the seat 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 is thrown by the vehicle 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.070
 at the next meeting will be from the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.739
 leadership and cuts the child in the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.809
 neck at the third seat of the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.250
 test fallen are the cheeks 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.410
 the seat shell too small 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.290
 in a side impact beats the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.330
 head of the child against the vehicle 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.310
 fourth loser had too high 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.850
 pollutant values â€‹â€‹the pollutant test 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.150
 is since 2011 an important component of the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.170
 Child seat to normally has the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.780
 pollutant note does not affect the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.360
 overall note it is assumed that 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.750
 Child seats are pollutant-free 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.009
 pollutants are found the seat 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.229
 that means devalued if there are any traces 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.540
 of pollutants are present such as 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.860
 can be an example of cancer 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.310
 is moderately devalued and if the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.649
 seats are heavily loaded is devalued 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.280
 up to deficient no pollutants 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.720
 higher speeds during the tests 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.659
 side impact protection the requirements of the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.970
 adac have for years, the same one 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.500
 new approval standard for child seats is 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.570
 in force for a few months 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.969
 There are, after all, there too 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.860
 the side impact test after the new one 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.659
 Norm, a child no longer needs to be in 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.399
 a larger seat if it is heavier 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.829
 but if it is one 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.080
 certain size has so it will be new 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.400
 seat models give and also the cars 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.110
 will adjust to it 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.420
 not a reason for starting 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.570
 Cynic currently does not mind 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.210
 a child's seat for the currently always 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.600
 still valid ece r44 to buy the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.440
 is called after the older rule 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.150
 especially when he is with us in the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.080
 test has done well because also at 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.450
 us in the test is one 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.100
 Side impact protection required and one 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.490
 seat of no side impact protection 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.890
 also no good will be received 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.690
 these ece r44 approved child seats 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.160
 can also be used for a very long time 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.290
 so that means the parents are the 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.670
 now need to buy a child seat 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.220
 Do not be afraid that someday 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.300
 is forbidden and she is another 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.910
 need to buy new ones 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.980
 who still buys a seat for the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.350
 applies with your own car and the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.050
 own child in the shop and on site 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.850
 even try if the child to the seat 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.850
 and the seat fits the car
