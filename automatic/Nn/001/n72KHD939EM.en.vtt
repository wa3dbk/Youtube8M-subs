turkeys<00:01:37.650> feet<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.070> bound<00:01:38.250> together<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.729> lot<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
turkeys feet are bound together a lot of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.429 
turkeys feet are bound together a lot of
the<00:01:39.210> times<00:01:39.390> would<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> buy<00:01:39.720> turkey<00:01:40.049> now<00:01:40.200> their

the times would you buy turkey now their
feet<00:01:40.619> are<00:01:40.740> gonna<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.920> bound<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.840> if

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
feet are gonna be bound like that so if

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.050 
feet are gonna be bound like that so if
that's<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.439> case<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.250> eliminates

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that's the case then that eliminates

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880 
that's the case then that eliminates
some<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.210> our<00:01:45.360> trust<00:01:45.659> work<00:01:45.840> else<00:01:46.619> want<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> get

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
some of our trust work else want to get
