00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.040
 is over 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.610
 so in front 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:54.230
 in the region there is a counterweight that is removable 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:55.640
 I put the wings luggage made 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:04.559
 small 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:08.420
 then they grip and then find the track with 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.420

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.149

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:57.860
 she starts up here and drive here's the law 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:02.209
 rises so understand turning 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:14.840
 fixed or also lowered turnover 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:21.049
 This is fixed in my transmission brake 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.989
 hydraulic brake cylinder with 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:29.799
 bus probably 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:34.660
 side lie down front liquid sake touching 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.660
 the wings put the back forward 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.310
 redid a diminutive wheel 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.959
 wheel lock 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:54.069
 semi differential made by hub 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.069
 from the eight rear wheel 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:15.989
 Well, what else is a big camping gas to 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:15.989
 prove it is very easy to spin 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.780
 you are afraid 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.780
 overall plan 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.110
 trying to 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.600
 chair is true
