00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.089
 as this golf premiere is celebrated 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.069
 at the same time the commodore c64 presented 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.500
 Helmut Kohl will become chancellor and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.099
 Hamburger SV German football champion 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.440
 we are writing the year 1982 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.880
 lie between these two vehicles 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.250
 31 years 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.020
 this is the first gti and this one 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.550
 this is the newest and how to do that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.500
 certainly also knows about himself 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.080
 Over the years we win, we say 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.869
 a bit of substance so old and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.050
 So here is the new here 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.930
 weighs 1.4 tons and about 14 tons 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.640
 old weighs just 8 145 kilos moreover 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.860
 he is about half a meter shorter 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.420
 and a good 20 centimeters narrower 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.520
 what connects these two cars 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.320
 actually still except the vw logo here 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.539
 in front and the three letters we want 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.750
 know how much clock gtd is in 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.550
 latest these wolfsburger both originate 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.710
 from another millennium and so on 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.960
 Spartan is also the first one 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.730
 gtd with the most necessary for the driver 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.379
 that through the side cockpit of the new 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.539
 on the other hand acts like the bridge of 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.909
 enterprise especially with the multimedia 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.320
 system that leaves nothing to be desired 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.049
 small look under the hood 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.810
 so be engine room times from the left 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.420
 small 1 6-liter fenced of all sorts 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.619
 cabling right under 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.619
 Plastic cover hidden 2 liters 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.310
 the first of its kind still rich 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.689
 You get 70 ps and 133 newton meters 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.549
 but no more behind today 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.810
 and that's why this has the current gtd 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.530
 also a little bit more 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.009
 performance of the four-cylinder diesel makes 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.899
 184 hp and 380 newton meters 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.850
 he marks the top speed 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.490
 at 230 km h 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.729
 the sprint from 0 to 100 is in 75 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.289
 seconds completed less than eight 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.799
 seconds around the hundred mark too 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.950
 crack 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.649
 the first gtd of 82 needed it 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.420
 even almost twice as long 14 seconds 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.080
 and he also consumed almost twice 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.899
 so much 75 liters per 100 kilometers of 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.930
 current gtd consumes loud volkswagen 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.549
 only 4.2 liters diesel 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.350
 but I think we are all that if 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.500
 to get someone really pure time essential 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.030
 will be more on the clock, though 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.250
 the weather conditions are mostly not 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.980
 would allow a two times one could then 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.290
 there the gtd marched from 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.120
 start vigorously going on the mighty and early 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.790
 snug torque pushes the golf 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.370
 already in the speed cellar of 1,750 tours 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.310
 powerful to turn it goes up 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.049
 about 5000 rpm with the these snarls 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.120
 while quite audible the 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:50.320
 nice sound of a gti who lacks it 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.120
 but you compare the two directly 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.690
 In fact, they do not have that much anymore 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.760
 common 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.010
 but that is probably similar as one would 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.329
 next to his great-grandfather who is also 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.100
 not so fast and strong anymore 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.180
 Above all, he no longer sees anything at all 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.700
 like yourself 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.260
 the genes are still the same of 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.120
 supposedly most powerful difference 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.980
 between old and new that 's the price 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.829
 29 1350 euro costs the current gtd the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.600
 first of the then only 17,000 850 mark 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.880
 Also cost that but you have to 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.890
 relation because 982 has a bullet 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.510
 ice also cost around and both big ones 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.720
 today you have to partially already 1 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.720
 euro 50 pay unbelievable 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.550
 So everything about the iron exactly 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.100
 The gtd is today as it was then 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.530
 driving pleasure with the approach of economical 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.840
 Consuming only that today for a lot 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.260
 has to reach deeper into the bag than 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.260
 once
