00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.610
 hello to all and cyborg and welcome 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.780
 in this introduction to the languages ​​of 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.210
 web development with html5 and css3 to 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.189
 information title html5 is used to dock the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 content of your web page 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.510
 unfortunately this one does not allow us 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.199
 not to create the design that's why 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.029
 that they exist the css so the css is 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.550
 a formatting language is that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.219
 which will allow us to create the design of 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.050
 our website 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.270
 as an example on a web page 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.360
 any text there are images 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.980
 videos for example 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.379
 so these elements are introduced via the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.590
 html so it's really this language that 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.440
 will allow us to create the content 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.629
 is the opposite of html there is also 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.620
 formatting and that's where the css 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.620
 come into play 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.829
 so being also going through the phase 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.340
 learning different languages 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.049
 web 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.090
 I will do my best to 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.460
 to be the most educator possible in order to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.900
 allow you to be able to do 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.680
 your own websites 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.670
 at the end of these tutorials so the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.979
 first thing to do is to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.229
 download a software that will us 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.990
 to create our first page 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.720
 web so there are plenty of them each 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.130
 developer at his small preference 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.700
 nevertheless, I will present two 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.210
 or three that I like so you have 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.579
 basic on pc notepad plus more that is 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.030
 a basic editor is relatively 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.030
 simple 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.590
 you also have sublime text that 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.979
 is a very good scorer he is 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.270
 ergonomic and totally free and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.130
 so to finish you also have 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.689
 brackets who is also a publisher 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.060
 which I particularly like 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.430
 because it is simple effective well 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.579
 obviously free is also 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.700
 ergonomic 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.100
 so of course this is not a list 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.560
 comprehensive of these software a exists 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.759
 many others for the most 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.229
 neophytes know that we can do 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.009
 exactly the same things about each 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.599
 of its software 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.590
 the code will remain anyway the same 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.880
 to allow you to start this 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.350
