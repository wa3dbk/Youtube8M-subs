incorrectly just correct me in the
comments<00:01:37.490> but<00:01:38.240> I'm<00:01:38.450> essentially<00:01:38.810> what<00:01:39.080> it

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
comments but I'm essentially what it

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.170 
comments but I'm essentially what it
does<00:01:39.289> i<00:01:39.319> pretty<00:01:39.709> much<00:01:39.740> explained<00:01:40.399> it<00:01:40.579> but<00:01:41.030> it

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
does i pretty much explained it but it

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.310 
does i pretty much explained it but it
follows<00:01:41.329> you<00:01:41.570> guys<00:01:41.719> around<00:01:41.930> it's<00:01:42.109> kind<00:01:42.289> of

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
follows you guys around it's kind of

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.599 
follows you guys around it's kind of
like<00:01:42.439> a<00:01:42.500> little<00:01:42.649> pet<00:01:43.009> if<00:01:43.189> you<00:01:43.310> want<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.520> think

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
like a little pet if you want to think

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.310 
like a little pet if you want to think
of<00:01:43.729> it<00:01:43.820> like<00:01:43.880> that<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.359> it<00:01:44.840> essentially<00:01:45.109> just

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
of it like that and it essentially just

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.109 
of it like that and it essentially just
goes<00:01:45.469> around<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.829> it<00:01:45.979> sucks<00:01:46.310> in<00:01:46.520> any<00:01:46.759> little

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
goes around and it sucks in any little

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.090 
goes around and it sucks in any little
entities<00:01:47.539> that<00:01:47.719> are<00:01:47.780> on<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.109> ground<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:48.950> what

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100

ground now you guys can see when I put

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.669 
ground now you guys can see when I put
my<00:01:53.270> little<00:01:53.539> cursor<00:01:53.869> over<00:01:54.079> it<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.409> says

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
created you can just place it down and

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.039 
created you can just place it down and
it<00:02:10.640> should<00:02:10.820> just<00:02:10.940> follow<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.329> around<00:02:11.540> like<00:02:11.690> so
