 The clothes around the neck are boring 

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:29.134
 The spider web displays the polyline as it is 

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:34.167

 White is crushed because it is summer 

00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:20.067
 Disregarding music that neglected the picture 

00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:30.034
 But privately I think it fits strangely 

00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:37.701

 There is no sound but it is not a malfunction 

00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:34.901

00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:52.967
 What a landing 

00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:57.601
