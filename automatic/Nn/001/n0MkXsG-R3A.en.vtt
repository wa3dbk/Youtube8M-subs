00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.300
 from enemies 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.510
 today let's see how to make babies 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.840
 films using only paper 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.840
 from oven 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.450
 our hot glue that I have 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:34.560
 found in a colored version of the 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:40.380
 scissors and some glitter of those 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:42.739
 they are cutting a piece of it 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.739
 greaseproof paper 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.360
 nor is it really enough that very few depend 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.670
 also from what you want to achieve in 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.350
 this case they show you how to make a 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.250
 pendant but could also be 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.880
 some earrings 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.600
 if you are good you could work by hand 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.020
 free 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.420
 otherwise you can help yourself with the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.270
 silhouettes just to make yours 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.180
 silhouette in this case I act by hand 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.480
 free also because I do n't like the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.480
 exact precision so I make a heart 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:43.579
 slightly slightly uneven wound 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:47.469
 therefore not perfectly balanced e 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.469
 I'm going to cut it with the scissors 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.689
 we got our template for 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.060
 let you see better now I'll put it down 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.239
 of the colored paper just to give you 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.129
 the idea of ​​the path we are on 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.110
 doing 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.890
 otherwise white on white you could not 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.190
 leicester now we must competence 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.220
 fill our heart with glue a 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.220
 hot 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.290
 after completing this step 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.190
 we can think of embellishing with 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.350
 some points of the exino before the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.980
 hot glue dry we do not give to 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.980
 to insert 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.670
 now we will only have to wait for the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:59.000
 dry glue and we will give our money 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.000
 the 3d made all of hot glue 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.020
 so how we made the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.700
 pendant we can also make 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.280
 earrings always with the same method 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.030
 with the heat pre filling a shape e 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.350
 adding some details when 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:22.710
 the hot glue will have dried 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:29.959
 we can go and remove the paper 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.959
 oven thus obtaining our little heart 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.500
 as you can see, it is also very shiny 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.230
 easily even with a needle to be able to 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.400
 put the thread and this is ours 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.400
 idea for today 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.230
