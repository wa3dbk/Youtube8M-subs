00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 hey people welcome to one 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.220
 new video on motor was pulling today 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:10.910
 is about a cpu-cooler and that of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.910
 thermalright and the macho 120 a lot of fun 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.190
 The naming takes some getting used to 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.170
 macho what you are now under it 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.609
 imagine 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.050
 Let's start packing 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.090
 black and white neon green very noticeable that 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.960
 whole has a multi shop system resp 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.410
 is compatible for the socket around 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.960
 rotate 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:39.390
 for the intel socket 20 11 13 66 11 56 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.050
 775 and for the poor the base am2 am2 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 + on three evenings 31 probably too 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.870
 he from the 2 so that's a little bit 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.910
 different is in the difference too 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.070
 other coolers is maybe the other 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.320
 convex copper cpu bottom plate showing 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.510
 I'll see you right now and before it 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.340
 This time I forget'm still the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.899
 details 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.390
 because they are usually very much 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.790
 interesting I already have the socket 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:14.549
 mentioned the whole is 150 15 mm high that 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.530
 Maybe that's interesting for those 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.610
 have a little smaller housing and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.270
 try many and try the try 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.390
 120 to install 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.610
 the whole is 6 134 grams heavy the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.280
 fan with it as turned around with 600 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.729
 up to 1500 revolutions per minute 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.670
 about 28.9 so we say good and 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.759
 like 30 decibels from a distance 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.680
 of about 1 tenants the pedestal I have 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.829
 already told and finally point the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.700
 once unboxing zoom out and once 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.729
 make pressure 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.090
 it took a while for this new one 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.770
 Variation of the macho was first 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.369
 sold out or not 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.899
 available 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.329
 that's why it took at the moment 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.979
 He finally arrived here too 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.899
 So now it's finally here and now 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.590
 I show you what's inside of the 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.750
 equipment 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.509
 we can have that right now 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.580
 we here 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:16.110
 also equal to the heat sink of the very 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.780
 massive you see up here 12345 the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.300
 Pipes on one side go here once 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.320
 so by not zenith pope to 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.800
 between 5 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.740
 here is the cpu bottom plate as the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.060
 appropriate tips that we look at each other 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.270
 We'll put that in more detail later 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.010
 first on it with the scope is also 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.050
 You should not just do it 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.940
 beautiful big screwdriver 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.920
 you can also call screwdrivers 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.300
 more exact are two wikipedia 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.480
 to read that I link you 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.450
 mannheim in the box then there is to 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.870
 Of course the fan comes with it 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.660
 on it also of thermalright comes 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.430
 also next to it 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:03.060
 we've made in here 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:05.280
 we ever have the installation instructions there 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.770
 is now also friendly with what 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.280
 should be there 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.690
 the components are explained here 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.780
 how the whole thing should be built up 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.230
 of course there will be again 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.440
 a separate video and who would like the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.730
 can then after installation 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.769
 of course that here in the turn 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.660
 right sticker on his size pin 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.880
 you have to do that but you can 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.080
 Some people are proud that is then 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.150
 have managed a cooler too 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.700
 install so what does it all 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.079
 very much fun 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.549
 that comes back again that 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.019
 with the screwdriver resp 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.750
 screwdriver I find that cool 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.600
 you're there, that's only now 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.579
 once the heat sink is the body 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.180
 asymmetrically constructed as one here 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.750
 able to see 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.880
 there are two heatpipes he is loading you that 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.480
 These two are basically easy 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.670
 go up to those other three 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.920
 of course, go through these peoples 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.260
 bottom plate which is nickel plated pull 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.209
 but then here to the front so that 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.790
 waste heat not only distributed here 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.430
 but will continue to move forward here as well 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.470
 The two are over this body 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.629
 Of course, it's the same heatsink 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.170
 So we say front half behind 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.270
 half 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.860
 the back half or directly supplied 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:25.320
 the front half will be here with these 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.600
 Beveled ybbs supplied with the 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.860
 Waste heat that here from the side of the 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.740
 the side are the partially a bit 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.620
 closed maybe you see that 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.150
 service optimizing the airflow 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.760
 from scratch looks like from the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.990
 On the other side it looks like this from above 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.050
 you see here 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.240
 By the way, the ends of the heatpipes are 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.090
 six millimeter heatpipes and not 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.250
 eight millimeter heatpipes and here you can 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.340
 then, of course, this fan with 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:01.050
 be connected times in 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:05.610
 which direction we see the same 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.940
 extensive of which is already on 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.090
 always very detailed in every case 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:17.460
 well printed we have one 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:21.420
 bottom plate or a backplate that comes 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.810
 as the name suggests, we backtrack 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.580
 we have more installation material 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:32.250
 with these clinging becomes the fan 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:34.890
 attached to macho 120 good that too 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:38.700
 For example, it is very good here 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.590
 that's the way you see it now 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.700
 a bit there with three on the 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.720
 is also called the individual components 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.760
 are extra well labeled 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.710
 that means you can really do almost nothing 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.460
 we have undermined here 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.510
 the thermally conductive paste name tag 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.590
 factor also of thermalright two grams 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.600
 You do not need that every two years 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:05.540
 gram for this is that more 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:08.160
 installation and is one of them 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.670
 Of course, we will work on that more 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.040
 see in the installation of the macho 120 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.810
 yes again a little look on it 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.270
 As I said the construction is not so 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.530
 straight like the other cooler ones 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.930
 Things here have a certain significance 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.630
 and what meaning right behind it 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.010
 where is the fan on which side 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.870
 can be brought and if he maybe 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.200
 Also be attached on both sides 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.060
 can 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.520
 of course you can see that in the 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.950
 installation that was the unboxing of the 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.750
 thermalright macho 120 in the newer ones 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:44.310
 version and see you next time 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.600
 on monday if you like the video 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.550
 I liked it then 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.930
 a comment and a rating above 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.090
 you can subscribe to the channel in the 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.660
 Center go to a video and right around 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.660
 a canal
