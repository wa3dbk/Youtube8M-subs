00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
really expensive one that's probably the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.680

best<00:00:44.340> out<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> them<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.570> get

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
best out of all of them because you get

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.170 
best out of all of them because you get
the<00:00:45.780> most<00:00:45.960> money<00:00:46.079> out<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.910> if<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.030> choose

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the most money out of it if you choose

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.180 
the most money out of it if you choose
one<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.780> bullet<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> vodka<00:00:49.860> or<00:00:50.039> any

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
one like the bullet or the vodka or any

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.770 
one like the bullet or the vodka or any
of<00:00:50.340> these<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.000> expensive<00:00:51.149> as

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
of these that are not as expensive as

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.959 
of these that are not as expensive as
these<00:00:52.110> then<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.980> won't<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.430> much<00:00:53.670> money

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.049 
these then you won't get as much money
and<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.539> more<00:00:54.930> productive<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:56.190> choose

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
and it's just more productive to choose

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.799 
and it's just more productive to choose
a<00:00:57.539> more<00:00:58.289> expensive<00:00:58.890> car<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.430> guess<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.940> mean<00:01:00.120> so

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
