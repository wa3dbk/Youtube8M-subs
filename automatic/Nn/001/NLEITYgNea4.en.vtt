 Automatically translated by the machine. I really like to see short curly ponytails. 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.700
 But long hair means I have to find a different way to do it! 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:27.089
 Start curling the ends of your hair. Pull the curtain up into a tall ponytail without disturbing 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.750
 Too much curling. Elasticity in the last loop, not pulling 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.530
 Hair, all the way through. Twist its front end and face curls 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.590
 A back loop like this. Push the loop so it flushes your head 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.580
 Fixed place. Just in front of the scalp needle curls 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.370
 Headband. Curls flip over and let them cover 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.479
 Loop and fluff. The hair gel is in place. 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.940
 I like this style, wrapped in a simple scarf. 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.400
 carry out! So cute! Pass more because my loop shows 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.560
 My pink ends. If your hair is a color, this will be 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.560
 of course. I hope this is a useful video, please check 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.510
