 The way rubber balls shoot

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.970
 So you are not curious 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.470

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.560
 to share with someone 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.560
 you share your life with someone 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.900
 Here I am. I think I have 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.210
 just a lot of fun I think so 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.530
 do you deserve 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.850
 It's been a long time since I was with someone 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.900
 I was in the presence of myself 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.900
 I felt so good 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.840
 how does it feel now and here 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.290
 to be alive 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.930
 I wish I could hug you 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.070
 I wish I could touch you 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.070
 How would you touch me? 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.220
 it's a crazy thing too 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.040
 falling in love 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.150
 it's sort of a kind 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:42.110
 Sociable mental illness 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:46.240
 was what a baby computer calls his 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.240
 father no idea how because there 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:00.660
 you know that I am currently using klick.de 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.840
 I do not either 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:08.670
 Now I know how I have to admit yes 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.350
 I was looking forward to higher 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.960
 For a long time I am great 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.270
 fan of spike jones --auf by working 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.760
 Phoenix just with the beard in front of some 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.160
 Years was very extravagant, I have to 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.860
 say it is a great movie for me 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.680
 so far in 2014 the best movie I have to 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.750
 say that was visually sensational to me 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.940
 I read with an aria lexa 1 2 k 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.680
 filmed fantastic pictures so there 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.850
 you can not see that 4k is still needed 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.390
 is just a cool picture too 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.070
 produce 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.710
 the acting performances were 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.110
 all top notch so especially 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.280
 martin phoenix amy adams the voice of 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.560
 scarlett johansson so i would not have 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.540
 thought that you just love so much 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.870
 and the three bring a voice there 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.970
 It's like it's there and you know it 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.440
 from spike jones that he always has to 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.760
 ready to find the right words 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.020
 but a love movie with the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.560
 advertised love movie like him 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.450
 itself says so exactly and punctually the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.070
 I would not find words for that 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.660
 possible and above all things 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.920
 not to slip into the kitsch 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.480
 I always find that the worst 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.580
 was missing dear if so kitsch 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.380
 do not slip and not touch me emotionally 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.090
 get more and it was just so 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.870
 times that is currently taking place behind practice 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.840
 not that that anymore 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.730
 So works for me is 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.250
 Absolutely so I'm completely up there 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.420
 your side and in particular I found 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.590
 the factor interesting i have mine 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.390
 Articles read that you also like 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.640
 in facebook profiles in love and me 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.310
 think it was just because moment there 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.450
 is more or less a best of 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.950
 a person from a female 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.720
 persons or male persons like 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.100
 you can imagine and I found it 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.620
 understandable that it has fallen in love with her 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.730
 and really nice too 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.620
 sebastian that was already 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.150
 anticipated but that's because 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.340
 that I am also a professional 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.690
 competent expert with the cinema 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.940
 I've seen that as well 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.320
 you him the pictures are totally violent me 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.140
 Can not describe it that is 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.000
 Sun so the coloring is so violent 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.830
 you sometimes have that dust in the air 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.159
 background only that this madness 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.080
 not so long 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:01.669
 he wanders I do not question one 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.590
 seconds whether that is possible or not 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.840
 it all looks like it's science 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.610
 fiction yes, it looks like it is 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.370
 Anyway, I always hope for tomorrow 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.349
 so easily sterile one is gone and 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.699
 Torn between he is cool what you are 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.469
 it can be done with technology 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.389
 the other side was awful though 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.620
 is actually exactly what is today 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.150
 with the people then through the 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.490
 You can only see the streets with you 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.449
 It's just as important to talk to your computer 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.800
 similar picture 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.259
 and if I go through the city right now 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.180
 everyone is watching their part that is 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:31.039
 already and run for the external 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.780
 properly run before the longest tennis 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.370
 now left utopia and dystopia 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.690
 about the actors are insane 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.610
 and I always ask myself the question 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.110
 when i see the movie we have that 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.879
 just made in the places where 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.039
 it has become a bit too long there 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.810
 it repeats itself at some places 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.159
 it will be a bit redundant 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.139
 So sometimes the movie could be a bit 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.360
 Shorten it glad that I only time I 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.039
 this opinion 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.139
 every movie too long if he is 15 too 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.550
 minutes in the middle part out but on 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.830
 in the end it's something for me 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.419
 Act right team I am from the 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.250
 film out and I've noticed so exactly 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.870
 that's why you love eating this 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.219
 to make damn shit galler here 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.110
 that I can lecture the films around 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:07.909
 to tell you this is the hammer and it 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.889
 is for me also the best movie so far 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.930
 so I have seen this year so 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.339
 Anyway, go to the movies that are films 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.750
 yes , you have to get up on the screen 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.370
 any case he sebastian now I am 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.719
 But looking forward to your review 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.520
 are with me always the guest first 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:24.830
 say what he gives ok pro was for me 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.860
 as I have already said picture 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.979
 acting director book so in principle 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.969
 everything if I had to add a counter 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.819
 Do not you have to 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:36.289
 but I would say 15 minutes less 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:36.819
 maybe not the movie 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.800
 hurt 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:42.800
 what's for points i would say 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.860
 it is indeed my movie has seen 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.039
 But eight out of ten deep give 10 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.539
 you all right I'm even so far something 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.830
 to go beyond that for me it was 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:53.839
 definitely an absolute 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.300
 Experience this film but agree with you 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:57.800
 that there are some moments that are not 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.659
 definitely fit in that too long 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.729
 But I also have the view that 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:02.990
 some scenes may be where you are 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.699
 say that would be a seven now 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.300
 or eight, but there are moments that 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:10.539
 for me 10 215 points are worth 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.030
 that's why it even gives me 90 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:14.620
 points eight and a half buys namely 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.449
 then stay rounded up with the new ones 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.250
 So incredibly great cinema 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:19.840
 you should definitely come on 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.669
 every case and who this is with you 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.360
 should write in the times 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:23.830
 Comments 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.460
 otherwise you'll find down here 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.229
 other reviews and yes who but still want to 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.819
 he now has the new travel point 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:33.280
 to watch the clicks in any case 

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:35.259
 through my face or back over
