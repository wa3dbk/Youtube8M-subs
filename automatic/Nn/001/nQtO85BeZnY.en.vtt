00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:18.020
 hope ruby how to understand that a man does not 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.210
 going to marry you civil 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.779
 marriage is when a woman thinks she is 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.929
 married 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.820
 and a man that he is free by statistics 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.769
 married men by about 10 percent 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.630
 less than married women 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.189
 Perhaps this can only be explained by 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.050
 what's a woman living in 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.370
 unregistered civilian like 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.350
 now they say in cancer 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.840
 consider themselves married and man 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.120
 calls things their names true on 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.560
 legal language is what we understand by 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.410
 common law is called 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.510
 cohabitation but tender female ears do not 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.610
 want to hear such a phrase 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.960
 imagine how you introduce and your 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.350
 loved one with friends 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.870
 meet this serozha my roommate how 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.200
 understand that civil husband never 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.820
 will decide to take you to the registry office 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.890
 very often live in a civil marriage 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.259
 loving each other man and woman 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.869
 who want to test their relationships and 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.790
 adapt to living together and have 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.940
 three options for developing relationships 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.680
 1 lived for a while together loving 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.930
 people understand that they are well with each other 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.030
 friend and go to sign and get married 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.220
 sometimes they are pushed for it 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.229
 pregnancy but not necessarily 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.950
 just they themselves came to a decision 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.930
 legitimize their relationship 2 lived 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.880
 some time together lovers 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.670
 understand that a loved one is not a hero 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.610
 my novel and diverge the third option 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.750
 having lived together for some time one of 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.580
 civil spouses 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.680
 usually a woman but sometimes it happens 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.310
 on the contrary begins to think that it is time and 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.500
 under the crown 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.200
 you have been checking your own for quite a while 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.659
 relationship the second spouse also says that 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.540
 everything is good and why change something from 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.750
 good good not looking for arguments not going to 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.119
 registry office can be very diverse 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.720
 the first princess will catch it and ring it 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.600
 will turn into woman yaga until we are married 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.360
 silk wife affectionate lunches and dinners of 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.150
 5 courses preparing socks stroking massage 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.220
 does everything in sex as soon as possible 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.170
 getting married will take away in the seat not 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.970
 let them cut beer with friends 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.010
 lie on the couch and watch TV shows 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.110
 gives birth 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.810
 the shadow will thicken and stop about me 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.890
 take care the second argument is a good deal 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.950
 will not be called marriage 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.680
 he remembers too well the quarrels of his parents 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.040
 brother or best friend family is 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.190
 responsibilities are a total headache you are not 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.760
 his dream is the rest you already know yes here 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.530

 Nobel Prize everyone has their own 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.750
 cockroaches forgive dreams in my head conclusion 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.790
 if a man does not want to marry is not worth it 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.709
 forcibly drag him to the registry office or 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.590
 specifically try to get pregnant from 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.739
 he will never be a good husband 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.540
 why do you need bad if you love him and 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.540
 ready to wait and gradually 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.819
 persuade wait and persuade if 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.780
 you live together for more than five years and he 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.239
 still not ready 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.629
 do you think he will have time to ripen to 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:20.409
 your retirement hope ruby and 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:23.099
