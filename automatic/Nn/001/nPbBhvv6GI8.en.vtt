00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:23.309
I close my eyes and I keep seeing things,
rainbow waterfalls, sunny liquid dreams...

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:36.449
Confusion creeps inside me raining doubt,
Gotta get to you but I don't know how...

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:47.360
Call me, call me,
let me know it's alright...

Please won't you call and
ease my mind...

I had your number quite some time ago,
back when we were young

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.080
