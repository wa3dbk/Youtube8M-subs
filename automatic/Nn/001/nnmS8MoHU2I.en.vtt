00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:25.060
 Sliding Fi's Nayamuko has been referred to as a classic in the acoustic guitar land are 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.730
 It is the point row of summer Matsui, but I did the awareness that I played and compared it, but it was really 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.560

 This time it is in now titled double encore while taking advantage of mu and the like of the right hand of Mr. Nagabuchi 5 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:46.840
 I mean Tsu going to do finger picking the Well that takes advantage of both 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:52.239
 Well, there are black and white and there is a song called "proposal" as well as black and white recently. 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:56.800
 But well but it is a translation or there is so and range way to try doing it well 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.210
 Say because we have raised frozen in the little finger is a technique basis, such as coming out also something of long-term 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.010
 Is quite advanced 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:09.490
 It's too , but in that phrase it's okay to say the legend 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:09.490

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.930

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.010
 4 minutes 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:31.010

 Good good 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.590
 Hmm 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.830
 Perhaps 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.330
 Hmm 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.920
 The 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.920
 What 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.190
 goo today 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.130
 al 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.130
 The 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.420
 Yup 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.610
 of 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.610
 Yup 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:02.460
 me 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:06.230
 ana non 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.230
 Yeah I know 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.360
 Hmm 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.640
 Woopy's 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.549
 Boo Woo 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.150
 Uu Ugh 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.150
 bap min 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:56.630
 As far as the sound of the acoustic guitar, this is not the case when the preference is divided 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:01.550
 The finger picking playing method that makes use of mute well 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:04.250
 It's not like I 'm feeling like an arpeggio, so I'm already holding a sound and like a muddy odor 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.570
 There is a place where things go out 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.520
 Well I'd tax's also I do not mayor of Gibson is to try playing like Well now 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.340
 I think that I think, but it is really muddy 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.430
 With an unrefined character 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.180
 It is giving birth thing in the Toro stinking both Tteyuu sound 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.930
 It's not a blues, but it's an effort to say that it is overflowing somewhere 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:28.070
 I think it's great that you can make good sounds 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.139
 Again the finger seems the Yamaha does it say Nante that it is also Yamaha 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.360
 Although there is also picking sound 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:37.229
 It was different again by putting out a good look 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.680
 I think it's no doubt that being able to produce sounds 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:43.860
 is not it 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:47.189
 Basically spear the Tteyuu those chord length and the current is Hikuku' is short on basic of Te now of both 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.719
 It seems like it 's easy, but it's just a high-level technique 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:52.020
 It's a guitar with a lot of tension , maybe it's something you can't do with that flexibility 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:53.350
 Absent 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.190
 Nde also an increase have now 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.030
 I heard you listened to the sound about 861 ahead , but this something is a short 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.410
 It's scale 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:07.420
 After all it is so-called short scale so important of after-ducer 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:09.610
 Is this the type of tape very spear easy to go up and Poon Do and so any guitar 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.340
 I have to come and go 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:18.650
 In any case, it is already red that manufacturers will show their individuality 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:21.889
 Yes, it's a feeling depending on it or something that 's done, it works like this 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.520
 That's why for that is you want to use the Dixon you want to use yamaha Toka want to use 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.040
 I think 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.900
 Also because there are different things to do the same increase Hoo 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.560
 After all I think there is a place that can not be decided with this one machine like that 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.849
 Right 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.929
 I learned something like a review of approach 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:42.940
 Would I enjoy I is not came I through the masterpieces 

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:47.350
 And Well by all means Do not you'll become a what Nari I memory will sometimes come Naa burnt meet 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.800
 That way to think but I yes that is also sends a'll see you next time 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.940
 123's 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.940
 It will be a car
