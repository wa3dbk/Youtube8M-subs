 Rainy day Mira of secret came out 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.480
 But I'm not really know this character 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:27.319
 It's characters that appear in Zenobasu 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:30.940
 Somewhat from that age of that space battleship Yamato of that good role 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.240
 However, the equivalent was blue face 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.150
 Well there is a character, but with President Deathler 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.290

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.730
 This time a little 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.250
 It would be disgusting 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.750
 Though it became video 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:12.450
