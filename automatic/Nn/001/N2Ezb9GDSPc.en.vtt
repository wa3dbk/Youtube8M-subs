00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.019
 beautiful to see you was already 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.010
 there you are 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.340
 That's not this tablet 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.990
 I saw today was work-up met 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.770
 radio belongs and there was no advertising 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.300
 from real real deal of the day tablet 7 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.289
 inch android 4.1 59 euro i would say 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.529
 the watching us now first one 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.109
 little looks at her honey brand of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.660
 the device and the packaging is already 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.690
 times it was almost a shock on the face 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 so the cheap so it is a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.510
 totally cheaper cardboard 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.550
 if you have such packaging here 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.160
 is used to where the packaging felt 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.930
 cost more than the whole thing here is 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.129
 yes, a little shock but new 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.860
 is not so bad you should not 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.800
 to comply with will say change 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.800
 times from just look beautiful falls make 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.260
 the protective film 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.630
 since this already 40 lighter 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.010
 kunz the device first then give 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.010
 we bit on the 6 1 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.990
 that looks fancy 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.670
 a good four percent on 4 writing and so on 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.550
 if you compare that now 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.620
 say about half the size of an ipad 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.000
 it has about two and a half times the 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.110
 size of one iphone 5 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.610
 you should not be put off 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.900
 Of course, from plastic where should also 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.060
 the price comes from somewhere you have to 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.010
 save if you are something as usual 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.270
 is of course another league but that 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.890
 is another price that you can 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.990
 not really compare and contrast 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.670
 That's why I will not do that 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.580
 We just pack things to the side 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.690
 the device look at here is one 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.320
 card slot tfg transfracht clear mini sd 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.010
 or micro sd on a sd card 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.620
 we have a loudspeaker rocket going on - 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.900
 this one over here 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.250
 here is the price class you learn 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.370
 of course not about the little usb 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.570
 connection to animals and extra 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.770
 charging port for this wonderful 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.970
 power supply what's down here is always 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.650
 nice about this thing in the country 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.780
 I feel as a disadvantage but at 60 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.060
 euro , I think that's not too 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.550
 big disadvantages there is still here 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.360
 is a hdmi-exit you 2 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.730
 megapixel camera names 0 3 megapixels 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.620
 facetime camera so for video calling around 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.850
 so the photos are all very weak 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.560
 but I do not have it 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.940
 buy photos it's actually bought 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.880
 it is almost not bad at all 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.830
 nice little 7 inches that's not because of it 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.570
 Feel good that's nice here 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.770
 is already a screen protector on 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.459
 I'll be nice to the mountain too 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.170
 let it go 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.060
 We are also speakers with built-in 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.950
 the device if you have it in your hand 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.150
 then the sound can be through this 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.700
 palm forward 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.090
 Christ made this practical and beautiful 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.380
 Display has 1024 x 600 characters 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.489
 of course, so little gimmicks 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.350
 built in how much is natural 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.880
 built-in 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.650
 and when all it operational as much 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.030
 needs as nice that one adapts 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.800
 is really great but I would say 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.360
 then turn on what a look first 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.160
 Of course, everyone plays what happens 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.710
 popular video formats and audio formats 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.420
 and shows off all pictures 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.600
 The display, of course, reflects 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.830
 nicely seen can not be a big problem 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.240
 this is now for the camera 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.920
 bit bad see here the 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.120
 lamp and thousands of fingerprints 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.840
 is still high is now only once 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.570
 go up 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:34.270
 just look at it too is one 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.710
 Capacious 5.6 cree see if it is 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.560
 everything works very smoothly 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.220
 you're just a dual core with 1 2 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.680
 gigahertz 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.750
 we could look like it with the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.980
 display brightness looks like that was just 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.300
 for the half now I have a bit 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.260
 brighter now you should still 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.960
 can recognize better 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.760
 Of course it is natural 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.700
 simple cheap display at the 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.400
 Price you can see the perspective 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:06.690
 I would be very limited 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.690
 call that yes now has turned 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.790
 you can see that it is very 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.819
 works fine but in itself 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.500
 can indeed can even keep it nice and good 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.079
 from the perspective yes that works 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.060
 It's just fine if we are 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.110
 shows us now works extremely but if 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.660
 it is not used that way if you use it 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.630
 dramatically not everything to everyone rather quickly 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.870
 by the production so loud strong 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.870
 increase 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.000
 I'm fine 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.830
 Really everything runs smoothly and so that 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.580
 Of course, that's not the high end now 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.650
 game 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.930
 I think so graphically intense 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.760
 games would go bad or not 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.490
 that's how well the module core cpu works 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.460
 a small graphics unit is like that 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.630
 many everyday use so for the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.130
 watch videos for photos in the 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.680
 Internet surfing a little game 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.360
 theirs the one bid so or so facebook 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.850
 a bit so everything that you like 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.530
 casual makes worry without the pc 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.270
 has to throw or if you have the pc 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.100
 heard and used that 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.410
 land eg you can still fast to 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.900
 facebook client on that you have in 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.310
 like copper or if somehow something 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.840
 After looking for an information 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.850
 has picked you can sometimes just 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.190
 Take it fast if you look now 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.120
 just look at pictures 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.620
 quality is actually quite like that 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.060
 Pingel you can not be nice with him 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.280
 the back with two fingers the 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.640
 everything works and that is 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.790
 actually it is quite relative 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.800
 liquid for what it is 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.990
 I thank him to watch with me 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.550
 The cheap little tablet needs 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.740
 one with a boss packing and 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.410
 actually quite neat 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.030
 gets a laugh and so on then give 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.660
 the part of my chance that's okay 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.230
 I do not do anything wrong with us 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.880
 would say 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.880
 until the daily news
