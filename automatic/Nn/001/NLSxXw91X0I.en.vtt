with your hand this is a pretty large

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.080 
with your hand this is a pretty large
knife<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:05.970> would<00:00:06.420> not<00:00:06.569> use<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.750> serrated<00:00:07.170> knife

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
knife I would not use a serrated knife

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.879 
knife I would not use a serrated knife
just<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.330> know<00:00:09.450> your<00:00:09.630> their<00:00:09.929> standard<00:00:10.349> flat

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
just you know your their standard flat

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.009 
just you know your their standard flat
blade<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.370> just<00:00:11.700> fine<00:00:11.910> for<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.570> again<00:00:12.900> I

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
blade is just fine for this and again I

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.900 
blade is just fine for this and again I
purposely<00:00:13.469> chose<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.950> size<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.250> shape<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.790> a

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
purposely chose this size and shape of a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.300 
purposely chose this size and shape of a
yam<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.599> can<00:00:15.719> kind<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.049> hold<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.190> it

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
yam so that I can kind of hold on to it

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.620 
yam so that I can kind of hold on to it
and<00:00:17.539> not<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.570> things<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.140> my<00:00:19.260> cutting<00:00:19.439> board

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
and not have things on my cutting board

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.300 
and not have things on my cutting board
just<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.720> hold<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.230> was<00:00:22.380> slice<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.949> I've

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
just to hold on to it was slice it I've

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.980 
just to hold on to it was slice it I've
already<00:00:23.430> had<00:00:23.880> some<00:00:24.150> gone<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.570> know<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
already had some gone you know and a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.330 
already had some gone you know and a
couple<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.380> them<00:00:25.500> didn't<00:00:25.740> turn<00:00:25.859> out<00:00:25.890> perfectly

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
couple of them didn't turn out perfectly

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.490 
couple of them didn't turn out perfectly
but<00:00:26.580> that's<00:00:27.300> okay<00:00:27.570> potato<00:00:27.930> chips<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.349> either

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
but that's okay potato chips on either

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.410 
but that's okay potato chips on either
so<00:00:28.949> that's<00:00:29.160> all<00:00:29.789> right<00:00:29.939> some<00:00:30.240> are<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> little

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
so that's all right some are a little

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.299 
so that's all right some are a little
bit<00:00:30.660> thinner<00:00:30.869> thicker<00:00:31.199> than<00:00:31.380> others<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.830> mean

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
bit thinner thicker than others I mean

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.970 
bit thinner thicker than others I mean
think<00:00:32.489> about<00:00:32.550> your<00:00:32.790> favorite<00:00:33.059> potato<00:00:33.210> chip

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
think about your favorite potato chip

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
think about your favorite potato chip
you<00:00:34.980> know<00:00:35.100> they're<00:00:35.340> not<00:00:35.370> they're<00:00:35.730> not<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
you know they're not they're not all the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.750 
you know they're not they're not all the
same<00:00:36.149> size<00:00:36.570> shape<00:00:37.110> thickness<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.550> that

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
same size shape thickness and like that

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.090 
same size shape thickness and like that
but<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.050> start<00:00:40.350> slicing<00:00:40.559> these<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.010> know

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100

but so just start slicing these you know
I<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.309> try<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.550> go<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:41.790> thin<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:41.969> possible

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
I do try to go as thin as possible

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.049 
I do try to go as thin as possible
because<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.140> want<00:00:43.350> these<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.649> bake<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.460> nice<00:00:45.030> and
