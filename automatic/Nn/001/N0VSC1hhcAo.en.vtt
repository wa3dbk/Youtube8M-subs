00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.360
The Kinabatangan River begins its remarkable
journey

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.650
deep in the mountainous interior of Sabah,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.650
and snakes its way for 560 kilometers through
a diverse range of habitats.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.780
From the misty highland forests to the limestone
caves,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.719
freshwater swamps, oxbow lakes, and mangroves
of the coast,

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.430
the river is a vital natural corridor that
links the interior to the sea.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.190
Rich cultural heritage too -

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.289
the Kinabatangan has for centuries been a
vibrant social and commercial thoroughfare

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:57.289
for the riverpeople and traders of eastern
Sabah.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.780
While much of the countryside around the upper
reaches

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.880
has been altered by logging and plantation
clearing,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.070
the lower floodplains remains the best place
in all of Asia

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.560
to experience wildlife and nature.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.330
The 27,000-hectare Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.410
is the crown in the network of conservation
areas on the coastal lowlands of Sabah,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.410
and is home to a simply astonishing range
of plant and animal life.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.580
Wildlife river tours offer visitors the chance
to experience

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.900
a breathtaking landscape teeming with birdlife,
crocodiles, orangutans,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.900
proboscis monkeys, and the chance to see rare
Asian Elephants and rhinoceros.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.799
The Lower Kinabatangan River is now an epicenter
for conservation programs,

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.959
responsible tourism initiatives, and award-winning
eco-lodges,

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.959
ensuring that this special part of wild Asia
remains wild forever.
