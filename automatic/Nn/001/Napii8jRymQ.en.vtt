00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
dentist as far as who can do root canal

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.889 
dentist as far as who can do root canal
any<00:00:45.690> licensed<00:00:46.200> dentist<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> root<00:00:47.219> canal

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
any licensed dentist can do a root canal

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.479 
any licensed dentist can do a root canal
to<00:00:48.899> become<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> root<00:00:49.590> canal<00:00:49.860> specialist<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to become a root canal specialist and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.220 
to become a root canal specialist and
then<00:00:50.579> adonis<00:00:50.940> requires<00:00:51.360> an<00:00:51.570> additional<00:00:51.809> two

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
then adonis requires an additional two

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.150 
then adonis requires an additional two
or<00:00:52.320> three<00:00:52.559> years<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.980> training<00:00:54.260> I<00:00:55.260> think<00:00:56.039> that

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
or three years of training I think that

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.130 
or three years of training I think that
doing<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> dye<00:00:56.789> treatment<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.989> bit

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
doing it a dye treatment is a little bit

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.099 
doing it a dye treatment is a little bit
like<00:00:59.120> performing<00:01:00.120> brain<00:01:00.270> surgery<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> tooth

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109

all<00:01:14.490> complex<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.270> complicated<00:01:16.130> requires<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
all complex and complicated requires a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.850 
all complex and complicated requires a
great<00:01:17.610> deal<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:18.110> skill<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.229> experience<00:01:19.320> and

great deal of skill and experience and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.320 
great deal of skill and experience and
certainly<00:01:20.070> lots<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.549> dentists<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.000> have

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
certainly lots of dentists that have

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.460 
certainly lots of dentists that have
developed<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:23.420> think<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> couple

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
developed that I think that a couple

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.740 
developed that I think that a couple
years<00:01:25.590> devoted<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.700> kind<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.540> training

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
years devoted to that kind of training

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.460 
years devoted to that kind of training
is<00:01:28.189> is<00:01:29.189> crucial<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.729> any<00:01:30.090> complex<00:01:30.509> case<00:01:30.810> many

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
is is crucial for any complex case many

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.620 
is is crucial for any complex case many
patients<00:01:32.100> may<00:01:32.310> present<00:01:32.549> themselves<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
patients may present themselves to you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
patients may present themselves to you
with<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.990> problem<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.740> may<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
with the problem but may not have the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.840

what i mean by that is unaware to the
patient<00:02:25.700> until<00:02:26.330> just<00:02:26.989> like<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.170> heart<00:02:27.380> attack

when the patient wakes up and says well

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.190 
when the patient wakes up and says well
I<00:02:30.110> think<00:02:30.410> such<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.770> terrible<00:02:31.220> toothache<00:02:31.400> and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
I think such a terrible toothache and

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.290 
I think such a terrible toothache and
and<00:02:33.200> then<00:02:33.380> they<00:02:33.830> enter<00:02:33.980> my<00:02:34.280> practice<00:02:34.819> but

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
and then they enter my practice but

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.970 
and then they enter my practice but
before<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:35.750> they<00:02:35.930> may<00:02:36.110> be<00:02:36.170> recommended<00:02:36.620> for

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
before that they may be recommended for

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.380 
before that they may be recommended for
treatment<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:37.519> might<00:02:37.640> be<00:02:37.790> recommended<00:02:38.060> for

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
treatment you might be recommended for

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.570 
treatment you might be recommended for
treatment<00:02:38.900> because<00:02:39.739> of<00:02:40.010> something<00:02:40.430> that's

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
treatment because of something that's

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.540 
treatment because of something that's
seen<00:02:41.239> right<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:42.069> senior<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.160> clinic<00:02:43.430> lea

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
seen right of a senior the clinic lea

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.210 
seen right of a senior the clinic lea
radiographically<00:02:44.239> by<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.450> dentist<00:02:44.810> and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
radiographically by a dentist and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.290 
radiographically by a dentist and
actually<00:02:46.220> that's<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.459> good<00:02:46.580> time<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.819> take<00:02:47.090> care

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
actually that's a good time to take care

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.720 
actually that's a good time to take care
of<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.510> because<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.140> big<00:02:48.830> biggest<00:02:49.190> predictor

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
of it because the big biggest predictor

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.059 
of it because the big biggest predictor
of<00:02:50.140> post-operative<00:02:51.140> pain<00:02:51.470> from<00:02:51.769> having

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
of post-operative pain from having

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.340 
of post-operative pain from having
treatment<00:02:52.459> is<00:02:52.610> read<00:02:53.120> preoperative<00:02:53.900> pain<00:02:54.110> so

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
treatment is read preoperative pain so

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.890 
treatment is read preoperative pain so
if<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.620> present<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.970> care<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.630> you're<00:02:56.780> not

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
if you present for care and you're not

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.449 
if you present for care and you're not
in<00:02:57.080> pain<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.410> chances<00:02:57.769> of<00:02:57.799> having<00:02:57.980> pain<00:02:58.280> from

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
in pain the chances of having pain from

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.229 
in pain the chances of having pain from
root<00:02:58.610> canal<00:02:58.880> are<00:02:59.060> are<00:02:59.480> minuscule<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.350> so

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
root canal are are minuscule and so

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.309
