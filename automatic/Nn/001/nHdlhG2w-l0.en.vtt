00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.200 

looks<00:01:18.500> like<00:01:18.650> when<00:01:18.860> I<00:01:18.890> raced<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.550> level<00:01:20.060> one

boss I can't be Martha at a longer
half-mile<00:01:24.830> tune<00:01:25.100> because<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.430> didn't<00:01:25.670> even<00:01:25.820> go

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
half-mile tune because I didn't even go

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.930 
half-mile tune because I didn't even go
through<00:01:26.300> level<00:01:27.040> dreaming<00:01:28.040> get<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.550> sixth

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
through level dreaming get to the sixth

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.760 
through level dreaming get to the sixth
gear<00:01:29.120> but<00:01:29.390> that's<00:01:29.720> ok<00:01:30.020> as<00:01:30.140> you<00:01:30.170> saw<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:30.470> boss

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
gear but that's ok as you saw the boss

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.390 
gear but that's ok as you saw the boss
was<00:01:31.010> very<00:01:31.190> easy<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:31.850> it's<00:01:32.000> no<00:01:32.120> big<00:01:32.150> deal<00:01:33.400> but

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
was very easy so it's no big deal but

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.670 
was very easy so it's no big deal but
I'll<00:01:34.550> try<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:34.790> use<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.840> Kreg<00:01:36.140> tune<00:01:36.380> for<00:01:36.560> the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
I'll try to use the Kreg tune for the

00:01:36.680 --> 00:02:55.190 
I'll try to use the Kreg tune for the
correct<00:01:37.220> track<00:01:37.430> length

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.740 

so<00:02:56.200> as<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.740> can<00:02:56.860> see<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.310> level<00:02:57.610> for<00:02:57.880> boss<00:02:58.150> was

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
so as you can see the level for boss was

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.130 
so as you can see the level for boss was
a<00:02:58.800> lamborghini<00:02:59.800> gallardo<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.970> beat<00:03:01.900> my

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
a lamborghini gallardo and it beat my

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.300 
a lamborghini gallardo and it beat my
level<00:03:02.530> for<00:03:02.830> BMW<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.470> even<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.680> quickest

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
level for BMW and even the quickest

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.110 
level for BMW and even the quickest
level<00:03:06.640> for<00:03:07.290> car<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.710> basically<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.610> car<00:03:09.880> here

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
level for car is basically this car here

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.430 
level for car is basically this car here
which<00:03:10.480> runs<00:03:10.750> about<00:03:10.960> a<00:03:11.350> nine<00:03:11.710> five<00:03:12.130> seven<00:03:13.440> but

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
which runs about a nine five seven but

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.500 
which runs about a nine five seven but
obviously<00:03:14.980> that's<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.460> lot<00:03:15.640> slower<00:03:16.000> than<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
obviously that's a lot slower than the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.110 
obviously that's a lot slower than the
left<00:03:16.720> for<00:03:17.050> boss<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:17.680> for<00:03:18.250> this<00:03:18.370> boss<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:18.970> I

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
left for boss so for this boss and I

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.670 
left for boss so for this boss and I

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
to use a level higher so we're gonna

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.510 
to use a level higher so we're gonna
have<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.750> go<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:23.020> level<00:03:23.290> five<00:03:23.590> car<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.340> can

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
have to go to a level five car you can

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.600 
have to go to a level five car you can
either<00:03:24.670> use<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:26.050> Aston<00:03:26.500> will<00:03:27.070> beat<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.460> or

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
either use a the Aston will beat it or

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.780 
either use a the Aston will beat it or
the<00:03:27.940> Lamborghini<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.950> you're<00:03:30.430> gonna<00:03:30.550> have<00:03:30.700> to

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
the Lamborghini but you're gonna have to

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.850 
the Lamborghini but you're gonna have to
use<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> higher<00:03:31.270> level<00:03:31.540> car<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:35.290> because<00:03:35.650> the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
use a higher level car so because the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.710 
use a higher level car so because the
fastest<00:03:36.340> level<00:03:36.640> for<00:03:36.880> car<00:03:37.120> wouldn't<00:03:37.480> be<00:03:37.570> the

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
fastest level for car wouldn't be the

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.390 
fastest level for car wouldn't be the
level<00:03:37.870> for<00:03:38.170> boss<00:03:38.380> I'm<00:03:38.650> gonna<00:03:38.830> use<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.370> same

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.500 
level for boss I'm gonna use the same
car<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.090> as<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.930> can<00:03:41.050> see<00:03:41.260> it's<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.590> level<00:03:41.800> five

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510
