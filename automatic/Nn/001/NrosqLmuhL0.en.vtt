they actually appear but that was just a
really<00:03:29.180> small<00:03:29.540> glimpse<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.080> that<00:03:30.910> if<00:03:31.910> they

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
really small glimpse of that if they

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.699 
really small glimpse of that if they

pretty crazy yep there we go there's a

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.790 
pretty crazy yep there we go there's a
full-blown<00:03:55.630> dragon<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:58.290> they<00:03:59.290> usually<00:03:59.440> come

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
full-blown dragon and they usually come

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.690 
full-blown dragon and they usually come
out<00:03:59.860> from<00:04:00.190> behind<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:00.550> rock<00:04:00.820> right<00:04:01.090> here

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
out from behind this rock right here

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.360 
out from behind this rock right here
float<00:04:03.700> around<00:04:03.820> this<00:04:04.090> area<00:04:04.330> right<00:04:04.660> here<00:04:04.720> and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
float around this area right here and

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.370 
float around this area right here and
then<00:04:06.370> just<00:04:06.550> kind<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.820> go<00:04:06.940> back<00:04:07.090> into<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.510> rocks

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.710 

as<00:04:11.380> you<00:04:11.590> guys<00:04:11.770> can<00:04:12.040> see<00:04:12.240> the<00:04:13.240> whole<00:04:13.450> ground

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
as you guys can see the whole ground

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.090 
as you guys can see the whole ground
down<00:04:13.840> there<00:04:14.200> looks<00:04:14.410> pretty<00:04:14.500> missed<00:04:14.920> in

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
down there looks pretty missed in

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.500 
down there looks pretty missed in
everything<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.460> can't<00:04:15.640> really<00:04:15.760> see<00:04:16.060> anything

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
everything you can't really see anything

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.699 
everything you can't really see anything
clear<00:04:17.109> out<00:04:17.230> of<00:04:17.380> there

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
clear out of there

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.310 
clear out of there
but<00:04:18.700> yeah<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.390> think<00:04:19.690> that's<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.959> only<00:04:19.989> place

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
but yeah I think that's the only place

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.479 
but yeah I think that's the only place
where<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.590> dragon's<00:04:20.920> eye<00:04:20.980> should<00:04:21.130> come<00:04:21.310> from

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
where the dragon's eye should come from

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.270 
where the dragon's eye should come from
