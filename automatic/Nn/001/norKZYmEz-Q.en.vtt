demonstrating how I change the clip on
my<00:00:11.349> ever<00:00:11.530> last<00:00:11.860> chain<00:00:12.280> link<00:00:12.580> swivel<00:00:13.090> the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
my ever last chain link swivel the

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.049 
my ever last chain link swivel the
procedure<00:00:14.500> is<00:00:14.769> similar<00:00:15.040> for<00:00:15.400> all<00:00:15.519> chain<00:00:15.820> link

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
procedure is similar for all chain link

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.540 
procedure is similar for all chain link
swivels<00:00:16.510> if<00:00:17.199> possible<00:00:17.800> at<00:00:17.890> the<00:00:18.010> size<00:00:18.250> of<00:00:18.460> the

swivels if possible at the size of the
master<00:00:18.939> link<00:00:19.179> may<00:00:19.330> be<00:00:19.359> different<00:00:19.929> but<00:00:20.079> for

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
master link may be different but for

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.659 
master link may be different but for
this<00:00:21.009> particular<00:00:21.279> swivel<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:23.439> link<00:00:23.739> is<00:00:23.949> an

this particular swivel the link is an

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.139 
this particular swivel the link is an
ansi<00:00:25.239> number<00:00:25.599> 60<00:00:26.140> the<00:00:27.099> packaging<00:00:27.669> says<00:00:27.909> it's

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:28.149 
ansi number 60 the packaging says it's

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.190 
ansi number 60 the packaging says it's
3/4<00:00:28.869> pitch<00:00:29.169> by<00:00:29.439> 1/2<00:00:30.009> width<00:00:30.749> if<00:00:31.749> you<00:00:31.989> were<00:00:32.079> to

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
3/4 pitch by 1/2 width if you were to

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.170 
3/4 pitch by 1/2 width if you were to
measure<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.710> link<00:00:32.950> itself<00:00:33.399> you<00:00:33.730> would<00:00:33.850> see

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
measure the link itself you would see

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.890 
measure the link itself you would see
that<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:35.500> is<00:00:35.770> approximately<00:00:36.730> 3/4<00:00:37.600> of<00:00:37.630> an<00:00:37.810> inch

center<00:00:46.540> to<00:00:46.720> Center<00:00:47.400> you<00:00:48.400> would<00:00:48.580> see<00:00:48.880> that

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
center to Center you would see that

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.170 
center to Center you would see that
senator<00:00:49.930> Center<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.500> approximately<00:00:51.370> 3/4<00:00:52.150> of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.300 

start<00:01:10.960> with<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.170> little<00:01:11.439> dielectric<00:01:12.280> grease

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
start with a little dielectric grease

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.669 
start with a little dielectric grease
which<00:01:12.819> is<00:01:12.969> really<00:01:13.299> silicone<00:01:13.840> lubricant<00:01:14.499> it

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
which is really silicone lubricant it

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:16.859 
which is really silicone lubricant it
comes<00:01:14.890> out<00:01:15.039> nice<00:01:15.219> and<00:01:15.490> clean<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:15.759> clear<00:01:16.329> but

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
comes out nice and clean and clear but

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.260 
comes out nice and clean and clear but
does<00:01:16.990> eventually<00:01:17.319> get<00:01:17.740> dirty<00:01:18.579> and<00:01:18.909> so<00:01:19.090> you'll

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
does eventually get dirty and so you'll

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.050 
does eventually get dirty and so you'll
want<00:01:19.569> to<00:01:19.689> take<00:01:20.409> care<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:21.009> protect<00:01:21.909> your

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060

want to take care to protect your
clothing<00:01:22.359> and<00:01:22.749> everything<00:01:23.409> else<00:01:23.590> in<00:01:23.859> the

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
clothing and everything else in the

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.639 
clothing and everything else in the
vicinity<00:01:24.749> I'm<00:01:25.749> not<00:01:25.990> going<00:01:26.139> to<00:01:26.200> use<00:01:26.409> it<00:01:26.560> right

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
vicinity I'm not going to use it right

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.620 
vicinity I'm not going to use it right
now<00:01:26.710> because<00:01:27.039> just<00:01:27.460> like<00:01:27.639> because<00:01:28.210> when<00:01:28.389> I<00:01:28.420> eat

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
now because just like because when I eat

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.179 
now because just like because when I eat
spaghetti<00:01:28.840> I<00:01:29.139> will<00:01:29.439> get<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.710> all<00:01:29.829> over<00:01:30.100> the

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
spaghetti I will get it all over the

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.099 
spaghetti I will get it all over the
place<00:01:30.310> but<00:01:31.090> essentially<00:01:31.569> you<00:01:31.719> would<00:01:31.869> put<00:01:32.079> a

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
place but essentially you would put a

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.709 
place but essentially you would put a
little<00:01:32.289> dab<00:01:32.590> on<00:01:32.799> your<00:01:32.920> finger<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.459> then<00:01:33.719> you

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
little dab on your finger and then you

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.319 
little dab on your finger and then you
would<00:01:34.929> wipe<00:01:35.409> it<00:01:35.590> on<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:36.069> bottom<00:01:36.579> post<00:01:36.819> wipe<00:01:37.149> it

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
would wipe it on the bottom post wipe it

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.199 
would wipe it on the bottom post wipe it
on<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.450> top<00:01:37.689> post<00:01:37.990> with<00:01:38.139> a<00:01:38.229> speed<00:01:38.499> bag<00:01:39.209> would

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
on the top post with a speed bag would

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:42.510 
on the top post with a speed bag would
go<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.749> it<00:01:41.020> just<00:01:41.200> helps<00:01:41.859> everything<00:01:42.219> slide

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
go and it just helps everything slide

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.370 
go and it just helps everything slide
along<00:01:42.789> there<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.359> no<00:01:43.450> top<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:43.719> bottom<00:01:44.170> here<00:01:44.350> by

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
along there is no top and bottom here by

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.580 
along there is no top and bottom here by
the<00:01:44.590> way<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:47.439> is<00:01:47.499> how<00:01:47.679> you<00:01:47.829> do<00:01:48.009> it<00:01:48.189> you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the way and this is how you do it you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.899 
the way and this is how you do it you
put<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.679> post<00:01:50.950> through<00:01:51.249> the<00:01:51.340> swivel<00:01:51.789> the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
put the post through the swivel the

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.769 
put the post through the swivel the
speed<00:01:52.209> bag<00:01:52.420> goes<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.779> this<00:01:52.959> end<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:55.630> on

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:55.779 
speed bag goes on this end you put on

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:59.639 
speed bag goes on this end you put on
the<00:01:56.499> retaining<00:01:57.039> plate<00:01:57.279> and<00:01:58.319> then<00:01:59.319> if<00:01:59.469> you'll

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
the retaining plate and then if you'll

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.709 
the retaining plate and then if you'll
notice<00:01:59.889> the<00:02:00.189> clip<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.639> wider<00:02:00.969> in<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.359> middle

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
notice the clip is wider in the middle

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.129 
notice the clip is wider in the middle
and<00:02:02.079> what<00:02:02.889> you<00:02:03.069> do<00:02:03.249> is<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.700> place<00:02:03.999> it<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:04.479> the

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
and what you do is you place it on the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.679 
and what you do is you place it on the
post<00:02:05.349> in<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.649> middle<00:02:05.829> and<00:02:06.219> make<00:02:07.179> sure<00:02:07.389> it's

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
post in the middle and make sure it's

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.320
