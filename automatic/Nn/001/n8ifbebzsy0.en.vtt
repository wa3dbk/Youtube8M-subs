00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.629
 in this video we will see how to do it 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.970
 the vertical on the head is healthy 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.650
 if it is the first time ever that it is 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.320
 tried to do it 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.809
 make it near the wall to start 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.000
 to take some confidence 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.640
 let's start then we put the elbows a 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.420
 land open to the distance of the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.519
 forearms and then intertwine hands and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.039
 we put the upper part of the head 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.550
 in hands 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.110
 let's see it well let's open the elbows and 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.899
 we measure the of strict san embraces and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.329
 then we put the top of the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.809
 head in his hands and with his thumbs 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.700
 we hold on the head 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.730
 then if we raise our knees and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.160
 we begin to move to approach the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.480
 walk towards the course 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.059
 let's start taking some 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.360
 confident with this position because 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.070
 obviously it's weird we are upstairs 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.370
 We begin to lift a leg and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.480
 bring it near the torso then let's try 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.260
 also with the other 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.450
 bringing it close to the course and then 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.720
 let's take some confidence precisely 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.090
 by staying upside down we can 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.880
 try how many times we give this 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.430
 this initial phase to start at 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.960
 become familiar 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.820
 when we're done, we go with the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.280
 facing the ground in the position of 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.770
 baby we recover a little in this 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.000
 position before trying to do the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.079
 complete position ok come on 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.659
 place our hands as we have said 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.479
 first the head just the part 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.340
 top of the head is very important 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.640
 we approach our feet little by little with 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.610
 the inspiration we raise or not 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.630
 we extend our legs upwards here 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.549
 let's force ourselves with our arms on the ground and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.189
 let's try to keep the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.619
 our concentration to maintain the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.350
 vertical position continuing to 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.040
 breathe normally don't go in 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.189
 apnea 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.099
 you have to do it vertically to go down 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.050
 we bring the knees back to the chest and then 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.379
 we forgive ourselves in the acquisition 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.020
 of the child to allow the 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.760
 circulation to return in a way 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.530
 normal because maybe to lift us up 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.080
 suddenly you can do need some 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.680
 the head and then we sit on ours 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.900
 heels we try again I see 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.050
 a different way to succeed from 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.610
 position then we weave the companies 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.800
 we support the head with thumbs 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.290
 gradually bring our feet closer 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.230
 while inhaling we lift our legs and legs 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.739
 we gradually spread upwards 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.890
 keeping your legs and feet together your hands 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.680
 who hold their heads well and seek 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.140
 to focus on aligning well 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.569
 spine and fixing ours 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.670
 attention at one point we can open 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.239
 legs one front one back for 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.670
 get off this trail ok this way 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.560
 flush out on the head sometimes sometimes 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.970
 it is not a difficult position 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.440
 technically however we say that what 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.989
 we have to work on more 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.690
 it is our self-conviction 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.700
 therefore a bit of willpower 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.450
 if you want to continue with the elections a 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.700
 notes on the site let us improve point com 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:33.709

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.709
