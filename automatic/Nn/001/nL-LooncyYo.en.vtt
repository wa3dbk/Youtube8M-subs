today I have a really interesting will
carry<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.460> helicopter<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.180> tell<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.540> about

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
carry a helicopter to tell you about

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.960 
carry a helicopter to tell you about
it's<00:00:13.470> the<00:00:13.680> walk<00:00:13.830> hero<00:00:14.240> v100<00:00:15.240> d03<00:00:15.950> BL<00:00:16.950> so<00:00:17.820> this

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
it's the walk hero v100 d03 BL so this

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.230 
it's the walk hero v100 d03 BL so this
is<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> mini<00:00:18.800> flybarless<00:00:19.800> helicopter<00:00:20.790> with

and<00:00:23.790> tail<00:00:24.480> rotor<00:00:24.899> this<00:00:25.590> should<00:00:25.770> make<00:00:25.860> a

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
and tail rotor this should make a

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.370 
and tail rotor this should make a
helicopter<00:00:26.610> smoother<00:00:27.239> more<00:00:27.630> efficient<00:00:28.200> and

helicopter smoother more efficient and
more<00:00:28.439> powerful<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.880> can't<00:00:30.119> wait<00:00:30.360> to<00:00:30.390> give<00:00:30.720> it

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
more powerful so I can't wait to give it

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.960 
more powerful so I can't wait to give it
a<00:00:30.899> fly<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.919> first<00:00:32.220> let's<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> look<00:00:32.880> and

back<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> radio<00:02:28.640> now<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.790> helicopters

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
back of the radio now this helicopters

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.220 
back of the radio now this helicopters
very<00:02:31.020> interesting<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.610> mini<00:02:32.849> helicopter

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
very interesting it's a mini helicopter

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.720 
very interesting it's a mini helicopter
it's<00:02:34.230> got<00:02:34.470> built<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:34.950> fly<00:02:35.250> ball<00:02:35.280> of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
it's got built in fly ball of

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.030 
it's got built in fly ball of
stabilization<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.560> got<00:02:37.739> brushless

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
stabilization and it's got brushless

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.540 
stabilization and it's got brushless
motors<00:02:38.730> on<00:02:38.880> both<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.300> main<00:02:39.510> rotor<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.830> tail

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
motors on both the main rotor and tail

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.090 
motors on both the main rotor and tail
rotor<00:02:42.080> let's<00:02:43.080> have<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> bit<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.650> look<00:02:43.769> under

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
rotor let's have a bit of a look under

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.930 
rotor let's have a bit of a look under
the<00:02:44.190> canopy<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.440> with<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> canopy<00:02:47.160> removed<00:02:47.580> we

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
the canopy so with the canopy removed we

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.570 
the canopy so with the canopy removed we
can<00:02:47.970> now<00:02:48.269> see<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.660> flybarless<00:02:49.580> stabilization

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
can now see the flybarless stabilization

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.780 
can now see the flybarless stabilization
unit<00:02:52.100> this<00:02:53.100> also<00:02:53.430> acts<00:02:53.819> as<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.330> receiver

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
unit this also acts as the receiver

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.640 
unit this also acts as the receiver
speed<00:02:56.790> controls<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.420> cipro<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.200> mounted

underneath<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.610> receiver<00:03:00.060> platform<00:03:00.810> I

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
underneath the receiver platform I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.070 
underneath the receiver platform I
really<00:03:02.250> like<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.700> idea<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:03.060> separate<00:03:03.660> speed

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
really like the idea of separate speed

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.130 
really like the idea of separate speed
controls<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:05.310> removes<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.120> heat<00:03:06.360> from<00:03:07.049> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
controls this removes the heat from the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.140 
controls this removes the heat from the
flybarless<00:03:07.799> unit<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.580> makes<00:03:08.760> everything

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
flybarless unit and makes everything

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.860 
flybarless unit and makes everything
much<00:03:09.480> more<00:03:09.540> stable<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:12.209> helicopters<00:03:12.720> got<00:03:12.840> a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
much more stable the helicopters got a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.140 
much more stable the helicopters got a
very<00:03:13.170> nice<00:03:13.380> brushless<00:03:13.830> motor<00:03:14.310> here<00:03:14.700> drive<00:03:14.970> in

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
very nice brushless motor here drive in

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.199 
very nice brushless motor here drive in
the<00:03:15.239> main<00:03:15.450> rotor<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.860> tail<00:03:17.160> rotor<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.790> also

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
the main rotor the tail rotor is also

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.289 
the main rotor the tail rotor is also

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
driven by a brushless motor really we

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.300 
driven by a brushless motor really we
need<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.570> go<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.840> give<00:03:24.959> us<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.230> fly<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.890> see<00:03:26.130> what

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
need to go and give us a fly to see what

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.819 
need to go and give us a fly to see what
it<00:03:26.430> does<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:27.000> want<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.750> do<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:27.959> now<00:03:28.350> but<00:03:28.709> there

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
it does I want to do that now but there

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.860 
it does I want to do that now but there
are<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.010> few<00:03:29.220> more<00:03:29.370> things<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.790> show<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:32.870> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
are a few more things to show you the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.199 
are a few more things to show you the
batteries<00:03:34.109> single<00:03:34.920> cell<00:03:35.190> lithium<00:03:35.670> battery

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
batteries single cell lithium battery

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.270 
batteries single cell lithium battery
350<00:03:37.170> million<00:03:37.380> capacity<00:03:39.079> and<00:03:40.079> it's<00:03:40.380> charged<00:03:41.010> of

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
350 million capacity and it's charged of

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.009 
350 million capacity and it's charged of
the<00:03:41.880> included<00:03:42.950> mains<00:03:44.390> universal<00:03:45.390> charger

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
the included mains universal charger

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.210 
the included mains universal charger
this<00:03:46.380> will<00:03:46.590> work<00:03:46.709> both<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.070> 110<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.450> 240<00:03:49.440> volts

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.520 

right<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.459> think<00:03:53.760> now<00:03:54.000> we<00:03:54.720> can<00:03:54.840> put<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.140> battery

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
right I think now we can put the battery

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.890 
right I think now we can put the battery
on<00:03:55.560> charge<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.459> go<00:03:56.790> fly<00:03:59.209> high<00:04:00.209> here<00:04:00.660> we<00:04:00.750> are

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
on charge and go fly high here we are

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.280 
on charge and go fly high here we are
with<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.200> v100<00:04:01.980> d03<00:04:02.579> BL<00:04:03.540> out<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.989> flying

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
with the v100 d03 BL out of the flying

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.059 
with the v100 d03 BL out of the flying
field<00:04:04.650> we're<00:04:05.459> about<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:05.880> give<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.180> fly<00:04:07.069> so

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
field we're about to give it a fly so

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.500 
field we're about to give it a fly so
we've<00:04:08.220> charged<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.819> battery<00:04:09.239> for<00:04:09.450> the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
we've charged the battery for the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.720 
we've charged the battery for the
helicopter<00:04:10.170> with<00:04:10.350> put<00:04:10.620> eight<00:04:10.829> AAA<00:04:11.100> batteries
