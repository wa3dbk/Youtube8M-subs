00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello kal actor's personal a super tip 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.720
 For you who are going to take the car to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.720
 align and maybe even swing 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.660
 alignment is a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.160
 routine every 10,000 kilometers 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.289
 you have to look for a company to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.180
 make the final alignment influence 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.800
 directly into your safety 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.259
 You arrive with the car in the garage. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.099
 bacaninha steering wheel right car not 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.589
 sings tire 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.439
 Anyway, you want to do that review? 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:34.980
 More after aligning the wheel stand 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.290
 calm tortoise does not despair 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.379
 you may need to make a flexion 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.780
 Famous Clam Compensation Equipment 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.890
 like the one that are three-dimensional we were 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.449
 3d 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.210
 they are cooler because it 's every 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.340
 machine alignment even had it 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.020
 guide for you to do 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.320
 to the whole procedure stir a little 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.789
 back a little forward to move around 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.590
 the wheel of the car to do this 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.480
 procedure it will identify in the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.760
 Truth the equipment takes you by the hand 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.050
 everything is very beautiful but the most 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.789
 rational that he with that picture 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.800
 white the lakers 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.710
 they sometimes have a deformation in the 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.649
 claw and claw does not make up is not 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.599
 that in this equipment it compensates 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:19.619
 this difference he knows that he is then 

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:22.679
 It already compensates there the car got crooked it is 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.509
 most likely to be in claw or laser 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.209
 inside the canister inside the cannon 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.220
 inside the piece so little out of position 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.140
 it looks like you make a pronouncement 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.179
 more traditional for you client 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.729
 interact with the repairer with aligner 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.140
 procedure that already does but it's cool 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.649
 exchange an idea with him 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.470
 if I have a different convergence and 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.720
 a different change I simply 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.270
 I'm going to get this claw here and I'm going to 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.910
 contrary to all the measures taken 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.530
 if you catch any good problem 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.929
 stay upside down 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.959
 Look how cool, you already know took the 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.330
 car for me I think the perfect couple 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:02.459
 passed the equipment aligned left the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.920
 wheel was crooked had to return the 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.520
 equipment may be the equipment 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.830
 to challenge gone no compensation was made 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.170
 so look what papaw you 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.910
 I just chatted with you 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.830
 alienator and tells him that the steering wheel 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.620
 He's crooked, he's going to 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.450
 equipment and will do the compensation 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.090
 from the clutches of alignment 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.580
 again he will turn upside down 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.830
 and will see if the measure hits or not 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.900
 could be totally the opposite 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.599
 two minutes he solves the problem 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.720
 problems happen the alienator just does not 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.569
 can it be to mask the problem it will not 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.640
 simply corrected the steering wheel because 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.160
 You're not lining up the wheels. 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.379
 correcting guilty geometry because 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.040
 when you have a deformation one of the 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.349
 claws 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.390
 you have a wrong measurement alignment and 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.670
 done wrong when you go out with the car 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.030
 He wants to get the center there, the steering wheel. 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.489
 Then change back to the bars. 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.620
 alignment or want to change the steering wheel 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.239
 position is not correct 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.760
 you need to find out where the 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.079
 problem if the aligner did not measure 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.569
 rear of the car 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.329
 the defect may be in the rear too 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.329
 rare he may the rear may want by 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.239
 one side to the other and you have the 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.860
 Steering wheel crooked but be honest you will 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.170
 want the alienator to change the position of 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.980
 wheel to compensate for the problem 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.299
 rear 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.280
 The problem is that you will not want one 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.139
 rainy day in a pleasure curve and not by 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.060
 one side and the other side 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.150
 there is a case of very old cars 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.850
 like the estate that there is a bar one 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.609
 fixed bar on a personal side has 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.769
 custom to release the steering wheel but this 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.829
 steering wheel will only be moved if the 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.660
 aligner the person who lined up 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.819
 previously wanted to correct a problem 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.639
 in the alignment equipment that was 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.069
 not moving the steering wheel but 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.810
 This is for antique car that has a 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.970
 one side that does not regulate the 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.079
 cars that have modern regulation of the 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.419
 two sides 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.730
 You do not need to move the steering wheel. 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.370
 never imagine then driving behind 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.099
 of a car with a cold air bag, right? 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.989
 but the compensation of the non- lanyard claw 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.510
 do it with the utmost ease 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.120
 so you know if the steering wheel is bent 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.340
 just tell him that glider he is going 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.169
 for the procedure will make a 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.830
 compensation of the claw that will come 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.419
 head and to do a check 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.490
 the larger the Brazilian network of 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.760
 calibrators that certify some 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.630
 companies to make a complete assessment of 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.340
 equipment 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.469
 Thanks for being in this video I'm going 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.150
 leave three more cool tips for you 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.470
 here ask you to share this 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.330
 video with your friends after all 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.150
 You can help a lot of people even 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.060
 the evaluators you friend woodcutter passes 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.500
 a gauging yardstick after all is 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:56.660
 a super fast service 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:56.660
