00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:23.880
 builders each year to have again has 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:29.619
 Curved system forth that andrea theses 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:34.710
 and a 27 inch monitor resp 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:41.020
 screen of viewsonic and indeed the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:45.370
 pixo 703 mhm so that's one 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:53.460
 led display 27 inches or 69 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:53.460
 cm diagonal and with hdmi course here 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.789
 a little different this time because it is so 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:03.070
 a bit huge and so is the package 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:06.820
 and yes I've bought at the volvo car 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.560
 and I also picked it up on the net 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.190
 by abo you can pick it up yourself 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.380
 that's why it costs nothing in shipping 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.820
 he clearly 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:23.140
 That's why I did that and me 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.610
 hope that they really made this 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.830
 work if necessary card 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.640
 Operate 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.640
 clearly works 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.540
 it's all about life 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:51.000
 first is already with cdu man like 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:55.619
 now user guide that can still 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.950
 different installation software haye 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.649
 his answers for display easy software 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.500
 Well fuck windows logic I never want 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.649
 close again and then it was also 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.959
 yes to management circuit relatively unimportant 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.430
 for me now because I like it very much 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.980
 make and try 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:20.600
 there one was still here one was 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:27.120
 awesome thing there were two pieces even 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:33.959
 once in bled once in white havana 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.989
 something else so two cables and you 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.549
 do not even see each other anymore 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:47.880
 so you can see here yes what we have 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:50.540
 here once I would the stand 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.530
 want to say 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.709
 The man sees you can not so yes 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.090
 this is still a cat slide on it 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.579
 this is the normal stand as well as it 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.859
 then here it is so comes the 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:13.500
 Plastic TV is normal 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:17.609
 We always have something like that in there 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.770
 power plug moment I grabbed sometimes 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:24.280
 you can see it better from this slide 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.810
 it blooms yes I have it all in here 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.550
 stand and then immediately 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.290
 the batteries hurt again stronger 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.630
 normal again with this 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:40.870
 the end of what comes into television comes in 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:48.280
 bild so what we have in it 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:50.320
 an audio cable quite normal 31 35 or so 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.880
 millimeter whether it can now 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.600
 not so good but think of it 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.570
 know what that is does not know what 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:09.430
 I would need that 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:26.500
 but oh well that's namely the display 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:28.230
 can make out so yes my god is there 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:34.750
 no longer in there petra thomas lehr 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:37.260
 already seen so now we have the 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.260
 display 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:51.219
 and yes that smile fast 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:05:10.479
 but the fix that their 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:05:12.759
 task so right in the picture that's how it looks 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.159
 I probably still need to do that 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:19.809
 moor or is she too mega stands 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:23.770
 he is too beautiful so that's the thing 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:30.689
 out of a bit more as long as I am 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:37.599
 I'll leave something like that plugged 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:44.159
 came along for video audio and video 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:46.180
 the plug and here the audio cable 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:48.879
 Of course everything does not look that way 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:54.219
 It was optimal for me you can 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:57.430
 recognize the device very up here that 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:59.019
 is wide enough around the sensor bar of 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.199
 grab the route and I think so 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:09.430
 cool i can see this from my side 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:14.699
 it is not the thinnest but it sees 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:17.879
 as if later on it very clear and 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:20.409
 it's the same from the other side 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:24.849
 that 's it for unboxing I would 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:28.149
 say I'm specifically 11 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:33.629
 yes oh so yes to the data worth like 

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:35.649
 said 27 inches 1080p full-hd quite normal 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:38.529
 as you are used to it 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:40.209
 16 9 format can be synonymous but others 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.039
 Formats then represent that becomes 

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:43.179
 then with a black bar here so 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.490
 Tailored when you go to the 

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:53.619
 looks at such as four to three photos 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:58.449
 or so yes reaction time is 3.6 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:07:01.389
 milliseconds or something like that 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:05.159
 he had a key all the time 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:06.939
 normal this hv thing's distance and hlg 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:11.649
 that means you can actually do everything 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:17.019
 connect to this console computer 

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:18.990
 Everything is led as I said that's what he means 

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:22.360
 consumes very little electricity 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:25.089
 I also think that's very nice for you 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.300
 have to think yes to the environment yes 

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:30.719
 that was it as far as said and until 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.719
 next time
