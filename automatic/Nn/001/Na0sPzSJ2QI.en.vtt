happen

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.110 
happen
think<00:02:18.100> delay<00:02:18.790> on<00:02:19.150> those<00:02:19.420> things<00:02:21.120> you're

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
think delay on those things you're

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.540 
think delay on those things you're
holding<00:02:22.480> back<00:02:22.510> consciously<00:02:23.290> now<00:02:24.160> moving<00:02:24.340> into

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
holding back consciously now moving into

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.339 
holding back consciously now moving into
the<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:25.600> next<00:02:25.900> measure<00:02:26.440> which<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.130> lick

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.399 

the<00:02:32.249> trick<00:02:32.459> here<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.700> first<00:02:33.659> take<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> liquid

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
the trick here is first take the liquid

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:41.539 
the trick here is first take the liquid
out<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.709> top<00:02:35.010> notes<00:02:39.920> okay<00:02:40.920> that's<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.249> crux

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
out the top notes okay that's the crux

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.009 
out the top notes okay that's the crux
of<00:02:41.700> what<00:02:42.299> we're<00:02:42.450> playing

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.390 

then<00:02:46.019> we<00:02:46.079> just<00:02:46.200> add<00:02:46.349> those<00:02:46.799> top<00:02:47.040> notes<00:02:47.280> with

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
then we just add those top notes with

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.839 
then we just add those top notes with
our<00:02:47.519> fifth<00:02:47.730> finger<00:02:52.310> okay<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.430> then<00:02:53.519> bring<00:02:53.730> in

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
our fifth finger okay and then bring in

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:00.789 
our fifth finger okay and then bring in
the<00:02:53.879> left<00:02:54.120> hand<00:02:54.420> for<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> last<00:02:55.129> five<00:02:56.129> notes

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.989 

now<00:03:01.799> this<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.129> technically<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.609> little<00:03:02.849> bit<00:03:02.939> of

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:02.999 
now this is technically a little bit of

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.059 
now this is technically a little bit of
a<00:03:03.060> challenge<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.659> always<00:03:04.590> work<00:03:04.799> on<00:03:04.919> these

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
a challenge you always work on these

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.699 
a challenge you always work on these
kinds<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.430> passages<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.060> same<00:03:06.329> way<00:03:06.540> play<00:03:07.500> it

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
kinds of passages the same way play it

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:19.009 
kinds of passages the same way play it
with<00:03:08.129> both<00:03:08.370> hands<00:03:08.700> very<00:03:09.480> very<00:03:09.599> slowly<00:03:18.019> until

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
with both hands very very slowly until

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.780 
with both hands very very slowly until
you've<00:03:19.139> got<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.379> mastered<00:03:19.829> at<00:03:20.189> a<00:03:20.250> spin<00:03:20.609> you<00:03:20.760> can

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
you've got it mastered at a spin you can

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.459 
you've got it mastered at a spin you can
break<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.239> down<00:03:21.269> into<00:03:21.629> little<00:03:21.719> things<00:03:22.230> just

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:22.469 
break it down into little things just

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:30.289 
break it down into little things just
take<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.739> first<00:03:22.980> half<00:03:28.909> so<00:03:29.909> learn<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.209> slowly

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
take the first half so learn it slowly

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.000 
take the first half so learn it slowly
and<00:03:30.750> then<00:03:30.900> as<00:03:31.109> you<00:03:31.560> get<00:03:31.680> more<00:03:31.829> comfortable

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
and then as you get more comfortable

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.580 
and then as you get more comfortable
with<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.549> at<00:03:32.730> slower<00:03:33.030> speeds<00:03:33.199> just<00:03:34.199> speed<00:03:34.560> it

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
with it at slower speeds just speed it

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:50.430 
with it at slower speeds just speed it
up

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.840 

so<00:03:51.440> it's<00:03:51.590> comfortable<00:03:52.160> in<00:03:52.310> any<00:03:52.430> speed

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
so it's comfortable in any speed

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.330 
so it's comfortable in any speed
okay<00:03:53.480> moving<00:03:53.690> into<00:03:53.960> the<00:03:54.050> groove<00:03:54.410> will<00:03:55.160> use

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
okay moving into the groove will use

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.520 
okay moving into the groove will use
those<00:03:55.580> last<00:03:55.850> notes<00:03:56.240> again<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.840> tie<00:03:57.080> what<00:03:57.410> we

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
those last notes again to tie what we

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.320 
those last notes again to tie what we
already<00:03:57.950> learned<00:03:58.160> into<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.700> next<00:03:58.970> section

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
already learned into the next section

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.920 
already learned into the next section
the<00:04:03.370> trick<00:04:04.370> here<00:04:04.670> like<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.180> is<00:04:05.270> with<00:04:05.450> most<00:04:05.810> of

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
the trick here like it is with most of

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.960 
the trick here like it is with most of
these<00:04:06.050> funk<00:04:06.350> grooves<00:04:06.620> is<00:04:06.830> putting<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.760> hands

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
these funk grooves is putting the hands

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.590 
these funk grooves is putting the hands
together<00:04:08.210> I<00:04:08.630> often<00:04:09.410> get<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.560> question<00:04:10.540> okay<00:04:11.540> I

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
together I often get the question okay I

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.820 
together I often get the question okay I
can<00:04:11.750> play<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.960> right<00:04:12.110> hand<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.620> can<00:04:12.740> play

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
can play the right hand and I can play

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.680 
can play the right hand and I can play
the<00:04:12.950> left<00:04:13.100> hand<00:04:13.400> but<00:04:13.700> I<00:04:13.760> just<00:04:13.850> can't<00:04:14.270> get<00:04:14.510> them

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
the left hand but I just can't get them

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.990 
the left hand but I just can't get them
to<00:04:14.840> play<00:04:15.350> at<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.560> same<00:04:15.590> time<00:04:16.010> well<00:04:16.610> that's<00:04:16.790> the

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
to play at the same time well that's the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.180 
to play at the same time well that's the
whole<00:04:17.150> trick<00:04:17.390> to<00:04:17.420> these<00:04:17.630> things<00:04:17.930> actually<00:04:18.799> if

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
whole trick to these things actually if

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.770 
whole trick to these things actually if
you<00:04:19.310> practice<00:04:19.790> them<00:04:20.000> one<00:04:20.299> hand<00:04:20.570> at<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.750> time

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
you practice them one hand at a time

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.120 
you practice them one hand at a time
it's<00:04:21.260> actually<00:04:21.500> going<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.680> do<00:04:21.770> you<00:04:21.890> more<00:04:22.100> harm

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
it's actually going to do you more harm

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.990 
it's actually going to do you more harm
than<00:04:22.730> good

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
than good

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.720 
than good
the<00:04:23.690> trick<00:04:23.930> is<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.110> practice<00:04:24.680> them<00:04:24.920> hands

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
the trick is to practice them hands

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.360 
the trick is to practice them hands
together<00:04:26.060> always<00:04:26.780> as<00:04:27.320> much<00:04:27.560> as<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.860> can<00:04:28.040> if

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
together always as much as you can if

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.370 
together always as much as you can if
you<00:04:28.910> need<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.150> play<00:04:29.330> one<00:04:29.510> hand<00:04:29.690> just<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.200> kind

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
you need to play one hand just to kind

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.290 
you need to play one hand just to kind
of<00:04:30.440> understand<00:04:30.860> what<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.040> notes<00:04:31.310> are<00:04:31.490> that's

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
of understand what the notes are that's

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.440 
of understand what the notes are that's
fine<00:04:32.690> but<00:04:33.200> as<00:04:33.380> soon<00:04:33.770> as<00:04:33.800> possible<00:04:34.760> get

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
fine but as soon as possible get

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.820 
fine but as soon as possible get
yourself<00:04:35.810> working<00:04:35.990> with<00:04:36.200> both<00:04:36.470> hands

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
yourself working with both hands

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.280 
yourself working with both hands
together<00:04:37.070> at<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.460> very<00:04:37.670> slow<00:04:38.030> speed<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:39.110> let's

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
together at a very slow speed so let's

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.710 
together at a very slow speed so let's
try<00:04:39.530> that<00:04:39.560> just<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.100> first<00:04:40.460> half<00:04:40.940> of<00:04:41.330> the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
try that just the first half of the

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.390 
try that just the first half of the
first<00:04:41.900> measure<00:04:42.170> of<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.560> opening<00:04:42.920> groove

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.689 

there<00:04:49.400> it<00:04:49.490> is

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.649 

notice<00:04:54.699> it's<00:04:54.849> very<00:04:55.000> much<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.180> back-and-forth

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:55.659 
notice it's very much a back-and-forth

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.809 
notice it's very much a back-and-forth
thing<00:04:56.289> I<00:04:56.470> play<00:04:56.650> a<00:04:56.680> note<00:04:56.860> in<00:04:56.949> my<00:04:57.039> left<00:04:57.340> hand<00:04:57.610> I

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
thing I play a note in my left hand I

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.969 
thing I play a note in my left hand I
note<00:04:58.120> my<00:04:58.270> right<00:04:58.300> a<00:04:58.659> note<00:04:59.050> in<00:04:59.139> my<00:04:59.229> left<00:04:59.409> a<00:04:59.680> note

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
note my right a note in my left a note

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:07.770 
note my right a note in my left a note
in<00:05:00.039> my<00:05:00.129> right<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:05.710> idea<00:05:05.800> then<00:05:06.520> slow<00:05:07.449> it<00:05:07.479> way

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
in my right the idea then slow it way

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.390 
in my right the idea then slow it way
down<00:05:07.810> again<00:05:08.199> and<00:05:08.530> move<00:05:08.860> on<00:05:09.009> to<00:05:09.129> the<00:05:09.220> next

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
down again and move on to the next

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:20.339 
down again and move on to the next
section<00:05:09.610> just<00:05:17.819> go<00:05:18.819> that<00:05:18.970> far<00:05:19.210> and<00:05:19.960> I<00:05:20.050> string<00:05:20.289> it

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
section just go that far and I string it

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:21.899 
section just go that far and I string it
together<00:05:20.470> with<00:05:21.159> the<00:05:21.280> first<00:05:21.310> breath<00:05:21.699> that<00:05:21.849> I

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
together with the first breath that I

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:35.320 
together with the first breath that I
already<00:05:22.060> learned

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:44.240 

the<00:05:36.330> idea<00:05:36.629> so<00:05:37.199> when<00:05:37.319> we<00:05:37.409> go<00:05:43.009> that's<00:05:44.009> the<00:05:44.099> part

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
the idea so when we go that's the part

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.589 
the idea so when we go that's the part
we're<00:05:44.340> going<00:05:44.430> to<00:05:44.490> look<00:05:44.550> at<00:05:44.789> next<00:05:45.030> it's<00:05:45.509> not

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
we're going to look at next it's not

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.480 
we're going to look at next it's not
actually<00:05:46.080> in<00:05:46.229> the<00:05:46.560> fourth<00:05:46.830> measure<00:05:47.069> of<00:05:47.400> the

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
actually in the fourth measure of the

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.339 
actually in the fourth measure of the
sheet<00:05:47.699> music<00:05:47.849> but<00:05:48.569> if<00:05:48.659> you<00:05:48.750> find<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.050> opening

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
sheet music but if you find the opening

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.930 
sheet music but if you find the opening
groove<00:05:49.590> later<00:05:50.039> in<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.340> piece<00:05:50.550> it<00:05:50.789> always

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
groove later in the piece it always

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.779 
groove later in the piece it always
happens<00:05:51.389> in<00:05:51.509> that<00:05:51.599> second<00:05:52.020> bar<00:05:52.370> it's<00:05:53.370> exactly

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
happens in that second bar it's exactly

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.309 
happens in that second bar it's exactly
the<00:05:53.970> same<00:05:54.120> technique<00:05:54.539> though<00:05:54.750> so<00:05:54.960> at<00:05:55.229> the

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 
the same technique though so at the

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:00.820 
the same technique though so at the
beginning<00:05:55.409> you<00:05:56.120> started<00:05:57.120> on<00:05:57.150> this<00:05:57.330> a<00:05:57.569> flat

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.730 

maybe<00:06:01.830> just<00:06:02.069> memorize<00:06:02.460> that

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.890 

knows<00:06:06.430> we're<00:06:06.610> back<00:06:06.759> in<00:06:07.030> the<00:06:07.180> first<00:06:07.509> half<00:06:07.780> of

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
knows we're back in the first half of

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:17.129 
knows we're back in the first half of
this<00:06:07.990> bar<00:06:08.229> it's<00:06:08.380> a<00:06:08.440> back<00:06:08.650> and<00:06:08.680> forth<00:06:09.099> thing

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.269 

okay<00:06:18.139> then<00:06:18.289> when<00:06:18.379> we<00:06:18.439> get<00:06:18.559> into<00:06:18.740> the<00:06:18.860> second

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:19.279 
okay then when we get into the second

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.219 
okay then when we get into the second
half<00:06:19.430> there's<00:06:20.180> sort<00:06:20.300> of<00:06:20.389> three<00:06:20.599> distinct

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
half there's sort of three distinct

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.480 
half there's sort of three distinct
parts<00:06:21.439> part<00:06:22.159> one<00:06:22.430> we<00:06:22.819> play<00:06:23.029> the<00:06:23.180> left<00:06:23.449> hand<00:06:23.809> G

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
parts part one we play the left hand G

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.299 
parts part one we play the left hand G
then<00:06:25.490> the<00:06:25.639> right<00:06:25.819> hand<00:06:26.029> a<00:06:26.270> flat<00:06:26.539> chord<00:06:27.309> okay

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:28.309 
then the right hand a flat chord okay

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:33.399 
then the right hand a flat chord okay
that's<00:06:28.550> part<00:06:28.789> one<00:06:30.699> the<00:06:31.699> next<00:06:31.969> two<00:06:32.330> notes<00:06:32.629> is<00:06:32.930> I

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
that's part one the next two notes is I

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:36.390 
that's part one the next two notes is I
move<00:06:33.680> up<00:06:33.830> to<00:06:33.979> the<00:06:34.069> a<00:06:34.099> flat<00:06:34.610> and<00:06:34.849> left<00:06:35.120> and<00:06:35.479> right

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
move up to the a flat and left and right

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.879 
move up to the a flat and left and right
there

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.250 

it's<00:06:43.889> actually<00:06:44.190> an<00:06:44.280> a<00:06:44.400> in<00:06:44.550> the<00:06:44.610> left<00:06:44.790> hand<00:06:45.260> that

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
it's actually an a in the left hand that

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.750 
it's actually an a in the left hand that
sounds<00:06:46.530> funny<00:06:46.740> at<00:06:46.889> a<00:06:46.919> slow<00:06:47.160> speed<00:06:47.190> but<00:06:47.610> that's

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
sounds funny at a slow speed but that's

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.510 
sounds funny at a slow speed but that's
those<00:06:48.090> are<00:06:48.120> the<00:06:48.270> notes<00:06:52.280> so<00:06:53.280> what's<00:06:53.400> actually

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
those are the notes so what's actually

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.700 
those are the notes so what's actually
happening<00:06:53.970> is<00:06:54.090> in<00:06:54.210> left<00:06:54.510> hand<00:06:54.600> were<00:06:54.870> walking

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
happening is in left hand were walking

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.280 
happening is in left hand were walking
up<00:06:55.950> chromatically<00:06:56.960> where's<00:06:57.960> in<00:06:58.050> the<00:06:58.139> right

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
up chromatically where's in the right

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.540 
up chromatically where's in the right
hand<00:06:59.960> we're<00:07:00.960> doing<00:07:01.139> that<00:07:01.260> lick<00:07:01.470> each<00:07:02.160> one<00:07:02.400> by

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
hand we're doing that lick each one by

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.580 
hand we're doing that lick each one by
itself<00:07:02.850> is<00:07:03.090> okay<00:07:03.570> and<00:07:03.780> not<00:07:03.930> much<00:07:04.080> of<00:07:04.110> a<00:07:04.260> problem

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
itself is okay and not much of a problem

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.840 
itself is okay and not much of a problem
it's<00:07:04.740> putting<00:07:04.919> them<00:07:05.070> together<00:07:05.160> that's<00:07:05.460> tricky

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850 
it's putting them together that's tricky

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.159 
it's putting them together that's tricky
so<00:07:06.120> work<00:07:06.630> on<00:07:06.720> them<00:07:06.870> like<00:07:06.960> this<00:07:07.200> first<00:07:08.100> to

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:09.169 
so work on them like this first to

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:22.190 
so work on them like this first to
second<00:07:10.169> to<00:07:10.320> third<00:07:11.210> to<00:07:13.610> okay<00:07:20.840> get<00:07:21.840> the<00:07:21.930> idea

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.200 
second to third to okay get the idea

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:33.320 
second to third to okay get the idea
it's<00:07:22.710> a<00:07:22.800> good<00:07:22.830> technique<00:07:31.880> you<00:07:32.880> can<00:07:32.970> master

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.330 
it's a good technique you can master

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.460 
it's a good technique you can master
anything<00:07:33.540> this<00:07:33.780> way<00:07:33.930> you<00:07:33.990> just<00:07:34.169> sort<00:07:34.320> of<00:07:34.350> take

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
anything this way you just sort of take

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.950 
anything this way you just sort of take
a<00:07:34.530> tiny<00:07:34.830> little<00:07:35.130> chunk<00:07:35.510> work<00:07:36.510> on<00:07:36.660> it<00:07:36.780> very

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 
a tiny little chunk work on it very

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.110 
a tiny little chunk work on it very
slowly<00:07:37.350> until<00:07:37.919> it's<00:07:38.010> comfortable<00:07:38.400> speed<00:07:39.000> it

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 
slowly until it's comfortable speed it

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.090 
slowly until it's comfortable speed it
up<00:07:39.240> and<00:07:39.450> then<00:07:39.540> add<00:07:39.780> it<00:07:39.930> into<00:07:40.139> other<00:07:40.530> tiny

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.100 
up and then add it into other tiny

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.860 
up and then add it into other tiny
little<00:07:41.400> chunks<00:07:41.790> that<00:07:41.850> you've<00:07:42.030> mastered<00:07:42.240> you

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:42.870 
little chunks that you've mastered you

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:48.290 
little chunks that you've mastered you
can<00:07:42.990> learn<00:07:43.050> the<00:07:43.200> whole<00:07:43.350> piece<00:07:47.000> okay<00:07:48.000> it<00:07:48.120> works

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 
can learn the whole piece okay it works

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.940 
can learn the whole piece okay it works
for<00:07:48.510> funk<00:07:48.750> it<00:07:48.900> works<00:07:49.050> for<00:07:49.229> classical<00:07:49.680> it<00:07:49.800> works

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:49.950 
for funk it works for classical it works

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.740 
for funk it works for classical it works
for<00:07:50.100> whatever<00:07:50.220> okay<00:07:50.970> let's<00:07:51.180> take<00:07:51.330> the<00:07:51.479> first

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750 
for whatever okay let's take the first

00:07:51.750 --> 00:08:01.510 
for whatever okay let's take the first
two<00:07:52.110> measures<00:07:52.590> all<00:07:53.010> together

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.460 

that's<00:08:02.520> the<00:08:02.639> general<00:08:02.910> idea<00:08:03.290> apply<00:08:04.290> those

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:04.470 
that's the general idea apply those

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.900 
that's the general idea apply those
techniques<00:08:04.650> to<00:08:05.010> the<00:08:05.130> rest<00:08:05.370> of<00:08:05.550> this<00:08:05.669> and<00:08:05.850> you

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:05.910 
techniques to the rest of this and you

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.460 
techniques to the rest of this and you
can<00:08:06.030> get<00:08:06.120> this<00:08:06.240> whole<00:08:06.450> opening<00:08:06.840> groove<00:08:07.110> the

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:07.470 
can get this whole opening groove the

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.080 
can get this whole opening groove the
rest<00:08:07.680> of<00:08:07.800> it<00:08:07.889> doesn't<00:08:08.340> change<00:08:08.490> much<00:08:08.790> for<00:08:09.030> the

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:09.090 
rest of it doesn't change much for the

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.110 
rest of it doesn't change much for the
first<00:08:09.270> eight<00:08:09.900> bars<00:08:10.200> of<00:08:10.320> this<00:08:11.000> remember<00:08:12.000> you

first eight bars of this remember you

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.790 
first eight bars of this remember you
can<00:08:12.240> get<00:08:12.330> all<00:08:12.480> of<00:08:12.600> the<00:08:12.690> backing<00:08:13.080> files<00:08:13.380> sheet
