spa websites typically don't generate

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.310 
spa websites typically don't generate
new<00:00:17.160> clients<00:00:17.760> because<00:00:18.420> they're<00:00:18.630> not<00:00:18.869> built

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
new clients because they're not built

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.890 
new clients because they're not built
correctly<00:00:19.859> from<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.460> get-go<00:00:20.970> there's<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.630> lot

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
correctly from the get-go there's a lot

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.470 
correctly from the get-go there's a lot
of<00:00:22.010> functions<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.189> features<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:24.000> need<00:00:24.330> to

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
of functions and features that need to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.070 
of functions and features that need to
be<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.779> there<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.820> generate<00:00:26.820> clients<00:00:27.480> there's

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
be in there to generate clients there's

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.769 
be in there to generate clients there's
two<00:00:28.380> things<00:00:28.619> with<00:00:28.859> websites<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.240> being

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
two things with websites one is being

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.770 
two things with websites one is being
found<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.650> internet<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.880> second<00:00:33.420> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
found on the internet and the second is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.650 
found on the internet and the second is
once<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.800> found<00:00:35.420> converting<00:00:36.420> that

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
once you are found converting that

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.709 
once you are found converting that
client<00:00:37.320> into<00:00:37.920> or<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.309> started<00:00:38.850> converting<00:00:39.450> that

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
client into or I started converting that

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.069 
client into or I started converting that
visitor<00:00:40.290> into<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> client<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.360> those<00:00:42.600> two

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
visitor into a client so those two

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.889 
visitor into a client so those two
functions<00:00:43.860> need<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.640> place<00:00:44.899> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
functions need to be in place to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.750 
functions need to be in place to
generate<00:00:46.410> clients<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
generate clients if you have one and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.850 
generate clients if you have one and
you're<00:00:48.000> missing<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.480> other<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.620> going

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you're missing the other it's not going

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.729 
you're missing the other it's not going
to<00:00:50.010> work<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.520> most<00:00:51.210> websites<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.440> built

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
to work and most websites are not built

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.770 
to work and most websites are not built
correctly<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.579> both<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.059> those<00:00:54.210> features

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
correctly with both of those features

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.439 
correctly with both of those features
and<00:00:54.960> functions<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.620> place<00:00:56.030> they're<00:00:57.030> built<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
and functions in place they're built to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.410 
and functions in place they're built to
look<00:00:57.960> pretty<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.820> show<00:01:00.030> your<00:01:00.180> friends

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
look pretty so you can show your friends

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.930 
look pretty so you can show your friends
and<00:01:00.690> family<00:01:01.140> how<00:01:01.320> old<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.980> nice<00:01:02.190> little<00:01:02.399> website

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and family how old a nice little website

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.969 
and family how old a nice little website
you<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.989> when<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> comes<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.619> down<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
you have but when it comes right down to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.340 
you have but when it comes right down to
it<00:01:05.189> they<00:01:05.369> don't<00:01:05.489> generate<00:01:05.939> clients<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.140> those

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
it they don't generate clients so those

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.740 
it they don't generate clients so those
websites<00:01:08.070> need<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.909> built<00:01:09.240> from<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
websites need to be built from the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.899 
websites need to be built from the
get-go<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.220> found<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
get-go so they can be found on the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.359 
get-go so they can be found on the
internet<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.450> once<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.500> found<00:01:13.860> they'll

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
internet and once they are found they'll

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.840 
internet and once they are found they'll
convert<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.119> visitor<00:01:15.720> into<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> client<00:01:16.770> yet<00:01:17.729> I

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
convert the visitor into a client yet I

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.330 
convert the visitor into a client yet I
could<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.240> add<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.979> know<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> lot<00:01:20.280> of
