00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
though it's going to slow down when

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.140 
though it's going to slow down when
people<00:01:29.180> get<00:01:29.510> fed<00:01:29.720> up<00:01:29.780> with<00:01:29.990> me<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:31.190> then<00:01:31.460> and

people get fed up with me and then and

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.520 
people get fed up with me and then and
then<00:01:32.390> I'll<00:01:32.480> be<00:01:32.570> able<00:01:32.660> to<00:01:32.780> do<00:01:32.930> that<00:01:33.080> then<00:01:33.290> and

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
then I'll be able to do that then and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.070

and we beat some good teams in that I

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.520 
and we beat some good teams in that I
think<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:34.060> were<00:03:34.150> quite<00:03:34.360> quite<00:03:34.810> surprised<00:03:35.290> that

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
think we were quite quite surprised that

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.050 
think we were quite quite surprised that
we<00:03:35.590> actually<00:03:35.740> want<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.460> as<00:03:36.550> well<00:03:36.700> as<00:03:36.820> we<00:03:36.910> did

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
we actually want it as well as we did

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.230 
we actually want it as well as we did
just<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:38.680> little<00:03:38.830> bit<00:03:38.920> about<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.370> specialist

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
just a little bit about a specialist

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.760 
just a little bit about a specialist
fitting<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.900> know<00:03:41.020> for<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.260> set<00:03:41.440> of<00:03:41.530> golf<00:03:41.650> clubs

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
fitting you know for a set of golf clubs

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.890 
fitting you know for a set of golf clubs
so<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.580> idea<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.210> you<00:03:43.450> can<00:03:43.690> take

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
so that the idea is that you can take

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.080 
so that the idea is that you can take
your<00:03:44.050> own<00:03:44.260> swing<00:03:44.710> you<00:03:45.160> know<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.490> golf<00:03:45.760> pro

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
your own swing you know to a golf pro

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.820 
your own swing you know to a golf pro
and<00:03:46.360> get<00:03:46.660> fitted<00:03:46.870> out<00:03:47.080> for<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:47.260> new<00:03:47.410> set<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.710> golf

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
and get fitted out for a new set of golf

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.440 
and get fitted out for a new set of golf
clubs<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:48.820> they<00:03:48.910> don't<00:03:49.060> really<00:03:49.150> want<00:03:49.420> to

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
clubs so they don't really want to

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.820 
clubs so they don't really want to
change<00:03:49.630> too<00:03:49.840> much<00:03:49.870> about<00:03:50.230> your<00:03:50.410> swing<00:03:50.680> they

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
change too much about your swing they

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.930 
change too much about your swing they
want<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:51.040> try<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.250> get<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.370> set<00:03:51.550> of<00:03:51.580> golf<00:03:51.790> clubs

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940

technology here so you know we can get
all<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.520> data<00:04:45.670> we<00:04:45.850> need<00:04:45.970> about<00:04:46.270> spin<00:04:46.810> about

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
all the data we need about spin about

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.740 
all the data we need about spin about
about<00:04:47.560> distance<00:04:48.040> our<00:04:48.310> angle<00:04:48.580> of<00:04:48.640> attack<00:04:48.750> so

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
about distance our angle of attack so

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.390 
about distance our angle of attack so
hopefully<00:04:50.080> we'll<00:04:50.200> come<00:04:50.350> back<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:50.800> you<00:04:51.280> know

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
play a bit better you know when people

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.740 
play a bit better you know when people
see<00:06:13.730> that<00:06:13.850> handicap<00:06:14.330> they're<00:06:14.510> going<00:06:14.630> to<00:06:14.690> be

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
see that handicap they're going to be

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.390 
see that handicap they're going to be
thinking<00:06:15.080> hang<00:06:15.200> on<00:06:15.320> a<00:06:15.350> minute<00:06:15.560> your<00:06:16.070> know<00:06:16.340> you

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
thinking hang on a minute your know you

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.010 
thinking hang on a minute your know you
been<00:06:16.550> for<00:06:16.700> a<00:06:16.760> fitting<00:06:16.970> for<00:06:17.240> a<00:06:17.300> day<00:06:17.450> with<00:06:17.600> Nike

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
been for a fitting for a day with Nike

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.870 
been for a fitting for a day with Nike
you<00:06:18.470> know<00:06:18.530> maybe<00:06:18.740> we<00:06:18.920> should<00:06:18.950> be<00:06:19.520> taking<00:06:19.820> a

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
you know maybe we should be taking a

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.460 
you know maybe we should be taking a
three<00:06:20.030> or<00:06:20.090> four<00:06:20.270> shots<00:06:20.510> off<00:06:20.690> that<00:06:20.930> what<00:06:21.230> I<00:06:21.260> hope

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
three or four shots off that what I hope

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.750 
three or four shots off that what I hope
so<00:06:21.710> I<00:06:21.740> mean<00:06:22.010> that<00:06:22.130> would<00:06:22.220> be<00:06:22.280> nice<00:06:22.400> when<00:06:22.610> it

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
so I mean that would be nice when it

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.280 
so I mean that would be nice when it
then<00:06:22.850> my<00:06:22.940> golf<00:06:23.180> really<00:06:23.510> improves<00:06:23.810> now<00:06:24.050> that

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
then my golf really improves now that

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.680 
then my golf really improves now that

whatever where I'm not into the ball
properly<00:06:36.820> and<00:06:37.820> can<00:06:38.210> make<00:06:38.360> such<00:06:38.630> a<00:06:38.720> difference

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
properly and can make such a difference

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.380 
properly and can make such a difference
with<00:06:39.320> with<00:06:39.740> better<00:06:40.010> clubs<00:06:40.400> and<00:06:40.970> clubs<00:06:41.270> that

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
actually a made to fit me you know like

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.920 
actually a made to fit me you know like
I<00:06:43.580> said<00:06:43.760> just<00:06:43.790> picking<00:06:44.180> up<00:06:44.270> a<00:06:44.330> standard<00:06:44.690> size

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
I said just picking up a standard size

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.570 
I said just picking up a standard size
was<00:06:45.260> the<00:06:45.380> norm<00:06:45.590> for<00:06:45.650> me<00:06:45.920> where's<00:06:46.190> now<00:06:46.430> I've

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
was the norm for me where's now I've

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.040 
was the norm for me where's now I've
just<00:06:46.610> got<00:06:46.760> that<00:06:46.970> next<00:06:47.240> a<00:06:47.300> little<00:06:47.540> bit<00:06:47.660> of

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
just got that next a little bit of

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.780 
just got that next a little bit of
length<00:06:48.500> on<00:06:48.710> the<00:06:48.830> clubs<00:06:49.070> which<00:06:49.400> makes<00:06:49.700> you<00:06:49.760> a

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 
length on the clubs which makes you a

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.950 
length on the clubs which makes you a
little<00:06:49.880> bit<00:06:50.060> more<00:06:50.240> comfortable<00:06:50.540> for<00:06:50.690> me<00:06:50.810> to

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
little bit more comfortable for me to

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.290 
little bit more comfortable for me to
stand<00:06:51.110> up<00:06:51.290> straight<00:06:51.590> and<00:06:51.770> I<00:06:52.460> just<00:06:52.880> felt<00:06:53.180> it

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
stand up straight and I just felt it

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.450 
stand up straight and I just felt it
easier<00:06:53.840> to<00:06:53.990> flow<00:06:54.200> through<00:06:54.440> the<00:06:54.500> ball<00:06:54.680> we<00:06:55.310> have

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
easier to flow through the ball we have

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.280 
easier to flow through the ball we have
