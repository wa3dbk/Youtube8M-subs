camping<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.830> really<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.400> possible<00:01:12.080> he

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
camping but it's really not possible he

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.190 
camping but it's really not possible he
is<00:01:13.170> every<00:01:13.590> place<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.159> go<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.430> camp

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
is every place that you go to camp

is every place that you go to camp
someone<00:01:16.200> else<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.619> map<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:17.070> see<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
someone else on the map can see you it

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.820 
someone else on the map can see you it
feels<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.210> two<00:01:18.509> ways<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.750> get<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
