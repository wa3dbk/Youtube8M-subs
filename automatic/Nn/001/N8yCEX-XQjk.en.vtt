00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.330 
alright we had the parts laid out in the
approximate<00:00:12.599> order<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.410> assembly<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.160> where

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
approximate order of assembly and where

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.279 
approximate order of assembly and where
they're<00:00:14.460> gonna<00:00:14.549> be<00:00:14.849> end<00:00:15.719> up<00:00:15.929> when<00:00:16.080> everything
