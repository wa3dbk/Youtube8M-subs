00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.629
 Now we come to our sporty 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.250
 training plan in the center of the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.910
 training plan is the hachinger 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.700
 game philosophy speak tactics like 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.920
 we want to prevent gates on the one hand 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.470
 but also how do we want to go 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.390
 achieve around this center as well 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.820
 stands the technology is the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.460
 personality are the cognitive 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.130
 skills of competitive skills 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.080
 are very important to us because in the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.180
 defensive and offensive 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.219
 player constantly asking what is mine 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.110
 job that's my job what can i do 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.870
 make what alternative offer 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.180
 my fellow players and depending on the situation 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.780
 then the adequate solution is adequate 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.579
 Find 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.070
 and last but not least the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.260
 conditional skills from age 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.690
 areas we have our youth in three 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.670
 areas divided into the basics 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.980
 area in the construction area and a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.120
 transition respectively 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.800
 performance area in the basic area 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.840
 from 9 to 12 because always the haching kids 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.850
 13 up to 16 is the construction area that 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.640
 are the harry teams and the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.710
 Leistungsbereich 17 and 19 are the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.689
 hachinger youngsters in high altitude 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.400
 area is the playful handling 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.470
 actually with the ball in the foreground 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.259
 Motor learning is one 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.159
 focus on social behavior in the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.200
 to learn group 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.990
 how can I place myself in the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.000
 group without correspondingly great 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.920
 but not me to notice 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.659
 to suppress or me too 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.549
 not to ask later then later 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.490
 It will always be important to own 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.970
 Personality then also in the place too 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.520
 communicate and present 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.590
 simple techniques as comfortable as we are in there 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.240
 the area already fits on technology 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.280
 Technology and shooting technique both 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.520
 course left as right speaks 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.040
 physics the achim teams our construction 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.299
 range from the u13 to 16 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.770
 characterized it characterized 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.409
 that we naturally on the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.030
 years now build up speak the active ones 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.070
 we are learning to try 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.439
 to consolidate but also to expand 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.569
 or to optimize that 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.459
 many mini tor in the game will be there 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.500
 there you will certainly still in 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.410
 one or the other dvd I thee 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.460
 wants to put it very close to your heart 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.050
 be informed about the different ones 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.570
 just variations what the cognitive 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.280
 Training is very important here 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.940
 very big focus laid by us 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.670
 been 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.370
 the hachinger game philosophy speak 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.310
 tactical elements become slow here 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.860
 with integrated what means defensive 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.050
 of course starting from the island tactics 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.270
 about the group tactics then also to 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.220
 team tactics but what does not mean 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.920
 defend one-on-one defensively 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.330
 or in one-on-one offensively then 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.520
 also to enforce 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.160
 the conditional stories there 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.600
 Let's start with you 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.850
 stability exercises with athletics training 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.489
 since we think that we are 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.410
 with your own body weight absolutely in 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.510
 already integrated into the area 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.660
 but not anymore but also 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.000
 need to be able to act preventively 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.190
 in the services transition area speak 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.680
 u17 until the 19th 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.120
 which called the hair youngsters there 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.280
 Let's try this haching 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.470
 game philosophy already strong 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.090
 implement so if the player 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.580
 he comes out of the youth in the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.630
 Seniorenbereich knows exactly what it is 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.910
 above the speech 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.920
 because below and above is in ours 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.660
 Principle always the same we try here 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.700
 was always in the field of games 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.890
 again the possibility to give in too 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.530
 units during training at the professionals 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.930
 to be there with you is the focus 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.630
 wednesday our yes our promotion training 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.299
 so to say where we got one eleven against eleven in 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.160
 different game world biggest there yet 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.170
 perform and sometimes even up to 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.090
 three teams also have from time to time 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.250
 time a young b youth already 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.040
 with integrated if of course 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.110
 his constitution then at all 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.989
 is also possible and makes sense 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.660
 then try all the techniques then 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.600
 really under competitive conditions 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.670
 To implement that really means back pressure 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.650
 time pressure space pressure these things always 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.329
 the guys then compete 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.160
 really prepare for it 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.260
 here in the area we play with 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.780
 haching, of course , were the lie 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.150
 very high currently corresponds to the 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.729
 A-Jugend-Bundesliga and currently at the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.650
 u17 still at nick and try but 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.740
 here in the 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.940
 to set up the young bundesliga 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.000
 Conceptual approach if we both 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.400
 See federal time 419 a youth 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.860
 bundesliga and the u17 b youth 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.930
 bundesliga would conceptually be the b 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.550
 youth league important since we 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.590
 believe that development here and 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.780
 The requirement is much more important here 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.419
 are as then in the a-jugend-bundesliga 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.280
 as good a youth player anyway 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.169
 when Haching look at the first 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.580
 Team are also in this 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.039
 but also in all others 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.320
 areas is, so to speak, superior 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.210
 also our athletic training the schorsch 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.340
 Wallner he has already starting there 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.770
 very very important and good 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.030
 Information given there you can 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.220
 then inform yourself what 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.039
 movement raps value stability 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.870
 just perform the functional training 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.669
 we are very very football-specific 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.370
 that is what requirements set 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.199
 play on the body and accordingly 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.539
 how can we get there too ? 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.060
 prepare for injury 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.570
 Preventive then well prevented 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.570
 become
