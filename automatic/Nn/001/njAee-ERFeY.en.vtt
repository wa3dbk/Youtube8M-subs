sodium 370 calories but i think that's

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.770 
sodium 370 calories but i think that's
that's<00:01:47.520> not<00:01:47.670> too<00:01:47.880> bad<00:01:47.909> would<00:01:48.119> expect<00:01:48.509> quick

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that's not too bad would expect quick

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.380 
that's not too bad would expect quick
fix<00:01:49.049> meal<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:50.100> another<00:01:50.579> thing<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.030> struck

fix meal so another thing that struck

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.560 
fix meal so another thing that struck
different<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.740> me<00:01:52.920> about<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.030> it's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
different to me about this is that it's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.179 
different to me about this is that it's
actually<00:01:54.720> recommended<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.680> cooked<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.070> the

actually recommended to be cooked in the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.929 
actually recommended to be cooked in the
microwave<00:01:56.270> with<00:01:57.270> most<00:01:57.570> things<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:58.170> always<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
microwave with most things it's always a

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.310 
microwave with most things it's always a
you<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.060> conventional<00:02:00.630> oven<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> way<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you know conventional oven is the way to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.530 
you know conventional oven is the way to
go<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.130> may<00:02:02.610> take<00:02:02.880> longer<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.360> it's

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
go you know it may take longer but it's

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.810 
go you know it may take longer but it's
crispy<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:04.110> better<00:02:04.320> whatever<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.670> one

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
crispy or better whatever but this one

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.459 
crispy or better whatever but this one
is<00:02:05.939> actually<00:02:06.090> recommended<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.170> cooked

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
is actually recommended to be cooked

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.219 
is actually recommended to be cooked
inside<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.640> microwave<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.450> think<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> main

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
inside of the microwave I think the main

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.530 
inside of the microwave I think the main
reason<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.800> because<00:02:11.039> it's<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.700> special

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
reason is because it's a special

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.350 
reason is because it's a special
container

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
container

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.090 
container
so<00:02:13.780> as<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.200> can<00:02:14.320> see<00:02:14.440> those<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.740> directions

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
so as you can see those the directions

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.460 
so as you can see those the directions
right<00:02:15.280> there<00:02:15.840> simple<00:02:16.840> stuff<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.230> I'm<00:02:17.320> going<00:02:17.440> to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
into that alright one quick thing that I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.580 
into that alright one quick thing that I
wanted<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.060> mention<00:02:31.270> was<00:02:31.660> when<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.200> opened<00:02:32.500> I

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
wanted to mention was when I opened I

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.660 
wanted to mention was when I opened I
said<00:02:32.770> first<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.070> thought<00:02:33.190> there<00:02:33.370> was<00:02:33.460> two

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
said first I thought there was two

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.430 
said first I thought there was two
different<00:02:33.820> subs<00:02:34.330> in<00:02:34.510> there<00:02:34.720> but<00:02:35.260> then<00:02:35.410> I

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
different subs in there but then I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.410 
different subs in there but then I
realized<00:02:35.920> after<00:02:36.070> reading<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> directions<00:02:36.790> is

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
realized after reading the directions is

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.970 
realized after reading the directions is
the<00:02:37.810> whole<00:02:38.020> trick<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.590> was<00:02:38.710> saying<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
the whole trick like I was saying the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.500 
the whole trick like I was saying the
reason<00:02:39.070> it's<00:02:39.340> recommended<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.120> microwave

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
reason it's recommended in the microwave

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.180 
reason it's recommended in the microwave
because<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:41.440> got<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:41.709> little<00:02:41.800> thing<00:02:42.160> right

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
because it's got this little thing right

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.980 
because it's got this little thing right
here<00:02:42.340> which<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.880> heats<00:02:43.330> up<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.690> kind<00:02:43.900> of

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
here which it heats up and I kind of

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.410 
here which it heats up and I kind of
actually<00:02:44.230> toaster<00:02:44.709> grills<00:02:45.130> your<00:02:45.820> bread<00:02:46.120> and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
actually toaster grills your bread and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.850 
actually toaster grills your bread and
so<00:02:46.810> you're<00:02:46.959> actually<00:02:47.080> supposed<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.470> cook<00:02:47.680> it

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
so you're actually supposed to cook it

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.070 
so you're actually supposed to cook it
with<00:02:47.950> each<00:02:48.250> half<00:02:48.610> being<00:02:49.209> on<00:02:49.480> this<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.990> then

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
with each half being on this and then

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.449 
with each half being on this and then
after<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.380> cook<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.770> just<00:02:50.890> sandwich<00:02:51.280> it

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
after you cook it you just sandwich it

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.920 
after you cook it you just sandwich it
together<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.420> then<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.570> got<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.720> perfect

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
together and then you got a perfect

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.690 
together and then you got a perfect
sandwich<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.500> like<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:54.190> actually<00:02:54.340> looks

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
sandwich and like it actually looks

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.280 
sandwich and like it actually looks
pretty<00:02:54.880> Hardy<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.390> mean<00:02:55.600> if<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.780> look<00:02:55.959> at<00:02:56.110> that

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
pretty Hardy I mean if you look at that

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.170 
pretty Hardy I mean if you look at that
both<00:02:56.920> side<00:02:57.160> has<00:02:57.310> covered<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.730> nice<00:02:57.940> heaping

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
both side has covered a nice heaping

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.810 
both side has covered a nice heaping
amount<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.630> cheese<00:02:58.930> meat<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.680> veggies<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.790> I

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
amount of cheese meat and veggies so I

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.400 
amount of cheese meat and veggies so I
mean<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.209> actually<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.690> looking<00:03:02.050> really

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
mean this actually is looking really

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.270 
mean this actually is looking really
really<00:03:02.530> good<00:03:02.800> but<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:03.640> did<00:03:03.700> those<00:03:03.910> paninis<00:03:04.390> so

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
really good but so did those paninis so

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.380 
really good but so did those paninis so
so<00:03:06.280> yeah<00:03:06.400> that's<00:03:06.520> what<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:06.790> looks<00:03:06.880> like<00:03:07.090> frozen

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390
