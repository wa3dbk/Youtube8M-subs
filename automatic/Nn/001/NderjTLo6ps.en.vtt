00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 after being bombarded 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.160
 mediated by their social outlets 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.080
 vicente matÃ­as vuoso broke the silence 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.550
 that he kept throughout the tournament and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.500
 criticized the media that published 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.750
 photographs of him at a dance on Sunday 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.870
 at night 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.480
 obvious that does bother annoying like 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.330
 bother a lot of things seems to just 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.880
 all this semester it seems that the aunt 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.710
 goes to a concert and they already title it 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.180
 partying for all 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.100
 I went to vallarta in a week that did not 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.630
 He played and say there needs to be 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.680
 give the face as are the things I 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.750
 I always come and give my face 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.820
 I do not have anime or problem if you have any 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.320
 problem with me I did it when 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.850
 I have problems with you and me too 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.769
 I do not speak for the same thing because there are people 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.269
 after hurting many people also that 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.790
 it has nothing to do 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.010
 I say they put public-private things that do not 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.840
 that they do not go the case was with regard to what 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.730
 others who make a campaign with me 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.079
 it seems that they want to blame me for something 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.860
 when I played three games nothing more in 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.290
 the whole tournament 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.150
 and they want to blame something I talk more 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.240
 this week from me that the salvation of the 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.239
 completion thing that for me neither at 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.040
 If that is I'm not beyond 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.140
 silver or anything I'm a guy who came 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.810
 to do things well and nothing else if 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.030
 they want to throw me things that are not 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.649
 it is already the case of other people and without 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.509
 memory you did not tell me the first thing if 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.960
 obviously I am a guy who always goes 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.960
 in front 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.230
 On the other hand, the Argentine defender 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.210
 leandro cufrÃ© announced that they will not follow the 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.800
 atlas the next season then according to 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.690
 He said there was no interest from the leadership and 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.880
 of the coaching staff so that his 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.680
 race with the foxes also indicated that 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.390
 the next atlas game could be 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.020
 the last one for him and he said that he 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.520
 dismiss from the hobby 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.170
 there is also something left to say to greet 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.140
 this weekend to the fans of the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.579
 back because good surely this is 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.829
 an important match where we 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.990
 we have to win and good is the last 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.610
 party that we are going to have of local and gives 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.149
 the circumstance is this going to be my 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.500
 surely my last game at home 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.439
 in front of the people I'm probably going to 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.630
 say hello as if people do not base me 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.179
 in reality, the most important thing is 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.819
 reality or indicates that it was not 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.610
 my representative here but but hey no 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.620
 there was nothing clear then it is very clear 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.069
 and it is very clear how is the situation and 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.069
 always happy happy because 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.550
 two and a half years that came here leads 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.590
 many battles and libero I had to live 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.370
 very important moments and I still think 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.629
 that we hope to enter 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.750
 liguilla and that we are going to try and 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.720
 well I already played a league and we had 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.030
 three times fighting not to descend and 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.000
 the objectives were met so 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.739
 surely if I have to go, I will go very 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.129
 happy and very happy with what was done and 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.440
 If you will not be later but good 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.260
 reality indicates that this weekend 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.400
 It will be my last game with 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.439

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.390
