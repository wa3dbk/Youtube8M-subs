00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:21.000
NINA: The way Pain Doctor has treated me, it is just incredible. I love gardening, if

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.340
you give me dead plant I can revive it for
you and it will bloom. Pain is dull, is very

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.730
sharp, it is impossible to think of anything
when the pain is eating you up. And I go hanging

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.050
plants; I can move them around, they are my
children.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.220
Dr. Anderson: Well Nina, she is very active;
one of things that she loves to do and something

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.460
that she is passionate about is gardening.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.430
NINA: Anything that requires more work, I
have to adjust my life and I can’t bend

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.980
too much, I can only bend from my hips down
because of my roots in my back.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.340
Dr. Anderson: When she comes in the room,
she just lights it up, because she is so elated

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.869
that she is held to do the things she have
been wanting to do.

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.829
NINA: If it wasn’t for Pain Doctor Arizona,
I would be a cripple; not a cripple I would

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.819
be compromised in a wheel chair. We have done
many diagnostic tests to figure out what exactly

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.159
is causing her pain. She’s done extensive
chiropractic therapy and physical therapy.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.990
Dr. Anderson: We got her custom fit back braise
and we have done multiple procedures to target

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.590
this specific areas of pain.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.670
NINA: I feel so good, when I feel good I can
do what I want to do more. But I now know

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.009
if I go to him, what we can doctor.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.779
Dr. Anderson: Each visit we will sit down
and talk about her goals, and what we can

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:59.079
do to achieve those.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.139
NINA: So I go to dances, I do everything but
in small point, this is all just adjusting.

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:06.450
These doctors have done so much for me.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.670
Dr. Anderson: I don’t expect Nina to slow
down at all.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.129
NINA: By all rights and purposes I should
be in a wheel chair or bed. They completely

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:17.930
changed my life.
