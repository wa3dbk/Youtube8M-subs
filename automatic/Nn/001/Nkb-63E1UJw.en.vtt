00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.990
 make a geodesic domes 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.780
 with the help of arques has the whole 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.740
 tutorial will be over several units 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.859
 if all at once would be too long 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.539
 as a reason name is as a basis 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.630
 for an idiotic dome serves for 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.320
 example a koaliton the problem is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.109
 a circle usually can not be found in 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.489
 a larger amount in any one 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.110
 amount three are shared and therefore 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.600
 you go away with energetic dome 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 from that, for example, rectangles here 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.579
 in the golden section on the part 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.320
 ratio apprentice incontinent cut 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.850
 over all axes on top of each other and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.219
 the corner points connect it three 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.239
 Corner then you have one regularly 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.039
 circumscribed as it were, and man 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.379
 subdivided and so a triangle in 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.670
 more triangles and projects the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.340
 intersections often outwards 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:08.189
 spherical surface that's exactly what we will become 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.680
 together with the help of the tool then 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.280
 do 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.280
 I'll give that to the side 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.270
 on the point just gone 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.840
 so 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.000
 construct the golden section there 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:32.080
 There are several options for 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.080
 Example 1 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.220
 also 1 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.370
 then 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.370
 here a sting 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.880
 the length 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.780
 then we have the page ratio here 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.710
 golden cut so that can 1000 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.710
 make the turn 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.860
 that we cut across the relationship group 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:08.950
 corresponds for example to a4 of 29 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.950
 7 to 21 good 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.530
 that's just a helper I 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.290
 give me that on the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.370
 zero I say it for example me 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.750
 would like a geodesic dome with 20 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.750
 make meter radius 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.660
 so 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.200
 20 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.440
 and then scale this one here 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.080
 change biggest inner graphically 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.380
 determine 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.770
 from here 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.770
 to here 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.000
 to here 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.660
 then i can do my village right here 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.660
 draw the same 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.109
 I turn me equal to s goes 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.109
 light 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.890
 from here 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.480
 there was almost a copy here 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.200
 so control 3 I want to then 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.630
 dear in axino metro 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:31.300
 then I need another wall to wall 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:33.310
 on 05 with 2 with wide 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.730
 that means only similar construction 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.730
 this wall 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.950
 so that I have a level I have this 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.230
 can kick now 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.540
 turn so turn on with free turn 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.720
 corner point here is free talking about this 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.940
 Point 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.640
 right mouse button editing level 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.160
 record level 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.790
 So this level from here 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.790
 to here 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.790
 and 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:18.019
 then control the same big again 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:21.519
 from here to here turn in the floor plan 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.970
 from here to here 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:29.729
 right here again 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.729
 mouse button rotate freely 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.480
 at this point direction mouse button 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.840
 level of processing 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.840
 this level 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.670
 only the other level 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.670
 not correct 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.370
 so again 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.370
 turn free 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.760
 around 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.890
 this point right mouse button 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.780
 record processing level 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.260
 hereof here 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.260
 marked 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.630
 and here is from here 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.630
 hereafter my triangle here 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.580
 this one here 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.759
 and now I could do all these 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.300
 connecting vertices with triangles 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:31.490
 just got an iq so hedron and 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.280
 we divide this triangle into 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.490
 then step into further small ones 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.490
 carrier
