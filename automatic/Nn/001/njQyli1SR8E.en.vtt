before at some point during my wandering

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.520 
before at some point during my wandering
of<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.610> eastern<00:04:26.000> seaboard<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.840> also<00:04:27.140> hit

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
of the eastern seaboard I also hit

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.530 
of the eastern seaboard I also hit
another<00:04:28.070> button<00:04:28.400> in<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.730> Cadillac<00:04:28.970> that

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
another button in the Cadillac that

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.640 
another button in the Cadillac that
looked<00:04:29.810> like<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.110> had<00:04:30.260> some<00:04:30.290> type<00:04:30.620> of

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
looked like it had some type of

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.620 
looked like it had some type of
information<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.640> hit<00:04:31.940> a<00:04:31.970> button<00:04:32.180> on<00:04:32.390> the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
information I hit a button on the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.810 
information I hit a button on the
dashboard<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.800> said<00:04:34.070> if<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.550> want<00:04:34.730> to

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
dashboard and it said if you want to

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.070 
dashboard and it said if you want to
calibrate<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.950> compass<00:04:36.950> which<00:04:38.020> seemed<00:04:39.020> like

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
calibrate the compass which seemed like

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.770 
calibrate the compass which seemed like
a<00:04:39.200> good<00:04:39.350> idea<00:04:39.530> I<00:04:39.770> hit<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.160> button<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.820> the

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
a good idea I hit the button and the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.330 
a good idea I hit the button and the
instructions<00:04:42.320> are<00:04:42.410> telling<00:04:42.680> me<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.890> drive<00:04:43.130> in

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
instructions are telling me to drive in

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.880 
instructions are telling me to drive in
circles<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:44.060> guess<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.200> was<00:04:45.320> looking<00:04:45.620> for

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
circles I guess it was looking for

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.340 
circles I guess it was looking for
magnetic<00:04:46.490> north<00:04:46.970> but<00:04:47.540> I<00:04:47.720> always<00:04:47.990> thought<00:04:48.290> a

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
magnetic north but I always thought a

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.300 
magnetic north but I always thought a
hole

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
hole

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.430 
hole
which<00:04:49.580> was<00:04:49.790> to<00:04:50.060> avoid<00:04:50.360> traveling<00:04:51.140> in<00:04:51.260> circles

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
which was to avoid traveling in circles

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.130 
which was to avoid traveling in circles
anyway<00:04:52.310> eventually<00:04:52.880> got<00:04:53.450> to<00:04:53.630> where<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.780> wanted

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
anyway eventually got to where I wanted

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.230 
anyway eventually got to where I wanted
to<00:04:54.260> go<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:55.100> invisible<00:04:55.580> couple<00:04:55.940> stopped

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
to go and the invisible couple stopped

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.530 
to go and the invisible couple stopped
arguing<00:04:56.600> after<00:04:57.080> I<00:04:57.110> turned<00:04:57.380> off<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.680> car

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
arguing after I turned off the car

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.730 
arguing after I turned off the car
luckily<00:04:59.540> there<00:04:59.780> were<00:04:59.930> nowhere<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.470> be<00:05:00.620> found

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
luckily there were nowhere to be found

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.860 
luckily there were nowhere to be found
when<00:05:01.280> I<00:05:01.310> got<00:05:01.580> back<00:05:01.790> to<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.000> car<00:05:02.270> and<00:05:02.600> drove

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
when I got back to the car and drove

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.740 
when I got back to the car and drove
home<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.350> car<00:05:03.890> was<00:05:04.250> also<00:05:04.640> exactly<00:05:05.360> where<00:05:05.720> I

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
home the car was also exactly where I

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.960
