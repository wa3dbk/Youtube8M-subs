 which is called dreams alex no this 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.039
 the collection is still out last year but 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.859
 on still produces a sensation in the lacquer 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.660
 the community still has bloggers about this 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.150

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.150
 in this statistic that I spend to me 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.269

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.489
 el corazon among bloggers 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.250
 many bloggers have huge 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.739
 lacquer collections and where more than two hundred 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.590
 three hundred varnishes collection from many i 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.469
 I heard that the same varnish they 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.050
 painted their nails several times for 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.160
 bloggers have more applications when you can 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.350
 every day of the year 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.620
 use some new shade this 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.449
 says a lot in my opinion and so on 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.530
 what is the given 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.719
 collection 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.910
 this collection which sat themselves 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.860
 very delicate spring shades that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.490
 can really be found in the spring 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.200
 nature which is just awakening and 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.900
 regards to those shades that I have 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.189
 I have three colors and all these colors are just 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.950
 awesome also this whole collection 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.000
 unusual because every love includes 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.380
 yourself so light blue shimmer such 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.290
 sparkles and it creates very unusual 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.000
 lacquer shades unusual effects 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.650
 something like that in other brands i'm not 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.070

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.340
 unique to no one like me anywhere 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.530
 I met and so the first varnish that 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.689

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.060
 collections at number 1 and is called 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.759
 flowering time this is such a gentle 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.189
 lilac shade that's real 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.170
 lilac stunning all shades swatch i 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.970

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.040
 cafe and detail you can see 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.090
 my blog, I released a post about this 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.009
 collections the next shade is this here 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.060
 such here at number five is called 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.300
 Forest Nymph 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.940
 also a very beautiful name for this 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.550
 collections and this is such a green tint 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.739
 also here are reminiscent of dissolving 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.810
 foliage 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.050
 young some such leaves are very 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.060
 beautiful and here's another one 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.769
 the eight call of a bell is really 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.310
 I think in the forest you can meet such 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.950
 bells of such a beautiful color I 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.830
 delighted with this collection you see 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.799
 that behind me is a huge stand with varnishes 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.989
 but these lights are from my most-loved ones 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.819
 that is, if I choose that more 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.269
 just like that of course this trio 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.940
 will enter the top ten most favorite but 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.680
 varnishes to the most technical specifications 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.780
 these mages despite being here 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.200
 Glitter present is easy 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.560
 are shot well worn whether they carried by 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.820
 week without top cover 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.420
 the only thing that wipe a little 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:10.980
 tips but if you put the top then this 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.230
 problems will not not like huskies quickly 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.260
 dry and that I like everything 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.140
 like solid mountain zones, that is not necessary 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:24.030
 wait a long time while put the first layer on 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.870
 one hand 2 has already dried up ie at least 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.209
 15 minutes and the manicure is ready so what 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.590
 now I will show you by chance 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.900

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.500

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.270
