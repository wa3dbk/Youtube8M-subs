00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
thing figured out pretty good so let's

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.109 
thing figured out pretty good so let's
try<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.620> ride<00:00:10.800> backwards<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:17.550> best<00:00:17.850> way<00:00:18.060> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
try to ride backwards the best way to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.910 
try to ride backwards the best way to
kind<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.390> start<00:00:18.660> doing<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.470> walking

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
kind of start doing this is just walking

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.170 
kind of start doing this is just walking
your<00:00:20.039> bike<00:00:20.189> backwards<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.789> way<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.000> can

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
your bike backwards that way you can

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.609 
your bike backwards that way you can
kind<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.390> feel<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> mechanics<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
kind of feel the mechanics of what the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.310 
kind of feel the mechanics of what the
bike<00:00:22.800> does<00:00:23.100> when<00:00:23.699> you're<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:24.000> backwards

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
bike does when you're going backwards

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.439 
bike does when you're going backwards
your<00:00:25.320> steering's<00:00:25.890> backwards<00:00:26.460> you're<00:00:27.119> going

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
your steering's backwards you're going

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.300 
your steering's backwards you're going
backwards<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.590> you're<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.830> really<00:00:29.010> watching

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
backwards and you're not really watching

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.740 
backwards and you're not really watching
where<00:00:29.670> you're<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.240> keep<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.630> mind

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
where you're going so keep that in mind

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.690 
where you're going so keep that in mind
too<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:33.500> would<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.680> kind<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.250> hike<00:00:35.460> back

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
too I would just kind of just hike back

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.490 
too I would just kind of just hike back
and<00:00:35.969> forth<00:00:36.180> across<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.630> parking<00:00:37.079> lot<00:00:37.170> getting

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
and forth across the parking lot getting

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.040 
and forth across the parking lot getting
it<00:00:37.770> figured<00:00:38.100> out<00:00:38.219> putting<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.210> feet<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.540> or

now you get your roll backs you got to

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.230 
now you get your roll backs you got to
get<00:01:22.030> out<00:01:22.179> of<00:01:22.210> it<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.450> do<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.600> half<00:01:22.810> cap<00:01:27.240> what

dial<00:02:32.599> before<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.080> try<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:33.319> move<00:02:37.870> it's

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
dial before you try this move it's

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.479 
dial before you try this move it's
basically<00:02:39.200> taking<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.650> 180<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:40.220> going<00:02:40.400> an

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
basically taking that 180 and going an

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.250 
basically taking that 180 and going an
extra<00:02:40.730> hundred<00:02:40.880> eighty<00:02:41.150> degrees<00:02:41.269> it's<00:02:42.230> a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
extra hundred eighty degrees it's a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.920 
extra hundred eighty degrees it's a
little<00:02:42.380> bit<00:02:42.500> harder<00:02:42.800> than<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:42.980> sounds<00:02:43.220> though

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.720 

so<00:02:47.930> what<00:02:48.080> you're<00:02:48.170> going<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.350> do<00:02:48.500> roll<00:02:49.340> along<00:02:49.549> at

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
so what you're going to do roll along at

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.150 
so what you're going to do roll along at
about<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.060> same<00:02:50.090> pace<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.630> would<00:02:50.810> 180<00:02:51.350> you're

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
about the same pace you would 180 you're

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.590 
about the same pace you would 180 you're
