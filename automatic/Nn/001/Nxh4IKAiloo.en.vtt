00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
at that view from that camera now

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.480 
at that view from that camera now
wherever<00:01:27.630> he<00:01:28.049> moves<00:01:28.320> no<00:01:28.770> matter<00:01:28.950> how<00:01:29.070> done<00:01:29.310> in

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.899 
certain morphs to be done on certain
frames<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.229> go<00:01:49.350> ahead<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.070> start

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
frames now can go ahead and and start

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.940 
frames now can go ahead and and start
messing<00:01:51.840> around<00:01:51.960> with<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.290> all<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
messing around with that all right and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.370 
messing around with that all right and
of<00:01:53.340> course<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.939> not<00:01:53.990> going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
of course this is not going to be in the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.560 
of course this is not going to be in the
final<00:01:55.680> product<00:01:55.920> here<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.520> alright<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.360> is

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
final product here so alright so that is

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.800 
final product here so alright so that is
one<00:01:58.020> tip<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:59.159> found<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.210> pretty<00:02:00.570> useful

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
one tip that I found to be pretty useful

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.719 
one tip that I found to be pretty useful
and<00:02:01.790> if<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:02.909> were<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.060> go<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:04.520> lightwave<00:02:05.520> has

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
and if we were to go here lightwave has

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.310 
and if we were to go here lightwave has
this<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.329> could<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.780> example<00:02:06.810> in

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
this so we could for example in

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.779 
this so we could for example in
lightwave<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:07.890> could<00:02:08.039> select<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> head<00:02:08.610> bone

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
lightwave we could select the head bone

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.430 
lightwave we could select the head bone
and<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.660> lightwave<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.289> little

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
and in lightwave you have this little

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.350 
and in lightwave you have this little
target<00:02:10.709> icon<00:02:10.950> here<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.520> when<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.209> select

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
target icon here and when you select

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.190 
target icon here and when you select
that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.470 
that
the<00:02:13.560> view<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:13.980> always<00:02:14.640> going<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.849> orbit<00:02:15.239> from

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the view is always going to orbit from

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.479 
the view is always going to orbit from
around<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.470> always<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.950> follow<00:02:17.190> that

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
around it's always going to follow that

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.479 
around it's always going to follow that
so<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.030> can<00:02:18.120> still<00:02:18.330> orbit<00:02:18.720> around<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
so you can still orbit around that the

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.710 
so you can still orbit around that the
advantage<00:02:20.489> of<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:20.879> that<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.330> can<00:02:21.360> orbit

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
advantage of this is that you can orbit

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.589 
advantage of this is that you can orbit
around<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.140> thing<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:23.450> disadvantage<00:02:24.450> is

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
around this thing the disadvantage is

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.559 
around this thing the disadvantage is
that<00:02:24.660> if<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.349> select<00:02:25.739> something<00:02:25.830> else<00:02:26.250> as<00:02:26.569> you

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
that if you select something else as you

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.180 
that if you select something else as you
can<00:02:27.690> see<00:02:27.840> i<00:02:27.870> selected<00:02:28.319> something<00:02:28.620> else<00:02:28.800> you

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
can see i selected something else you

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.470 
can see i selected something else you
know<00:02:29.280> your<00:02:29.459> view<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.730> going<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.940> snap<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.180> that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
know your view is going to snap to that

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.589 
know your view is going to snap to that
item<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:32.519> can<00:02:32.670> use<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.940> camera<00:02:33.150> technique

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
item so you can use the camera technique

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.170 
item so you can use the camera technique
because<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:34.769> use<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.610> camera<00:02:35.819> technique

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
because you can use the camera technique

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.940 
because you can use the camera technique
using<00:02:36.810> any<00:02:36.959> 3d<00:02:37.260> software<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.739> can<00:02:37.800> have

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
using any 3d software you can have

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.400 
using any 3d software you can have
multiple<00:02:38.069> cameras<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.760> there<00:02:38.880> all<00:02:39.540> right<00:02:39.690> oh<00:02:39.870> I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
multiple cameras in there all right oh I

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.289 
multiple cameras in there all right oh I
hope<00:02:40.709> my<00:02:40.830> light<00:02:41.010> wave<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.370> isn't<00:02:41.819> crashing<00:02:42.180> now

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
hope my light wave in isn't crashing now

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.809 
hope my light wave in isn't crashing now
there<00:02:42.569> we<00:02:42.629> go<00:02:42.769> okay<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:43.830> that's<00:02:44.160> one<00:02:44.400> thing<00:02:44.610> and

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
there we go okay so that's one thing and

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.350 
there we go okay so that's one thing and
let's<00:02:45.569> go<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.870> another<00:02:46.530> item<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:48.120> scene

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
let's go to another item this scene

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.640 
let's go to another item this scene
unfortunately<00:02:48.900> doesn't<00:02:49.049> show<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.349> off<00:02:49.470> too

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
unfortunately doesn't show it off too

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:59.240 
unfortunately doesn't show it off too

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
well but let's get a more dynamic seen

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.729 
well but let's get a more dynamic seen
here<00:02:59.579> that<00:02:59.880> will<00:03:00.000> show<00:03:00.030> off<00:03:00.329> some<00:03:00.690> more<00:03:00.989> action

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
here that will show off some more action

alright so here's General Grievous

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.870 
alright so here's General Grievous
coming<00:03:04.380> down<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.590> steps<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:05.459> can't<00:03:05.700> see

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
coming down the steps you can't see

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.000 
coming down the steps you can't see
there's<00:03:06.090> all<00:03:06.209> big<00:03:06.420> flaming<00:03:07.200> particle<00:03:07.709> system

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
there's all big flaming particle system

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.979 
there's all big flaming particle system
in<00:03:08.099> front<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.400> him<00:03:08.519> here<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.540> let's<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:09.900> kind

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
in front of him here so let's just kind

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.770 
in front of him here so let's just kind
of<00:03:10.079> play<00:03:10.319> this<00:03:10.470> animation<00:03:10.709> here<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.599> then<00:03:12.599> he

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
of play this animation here and then he

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.190 
of play this animation here and then he
kind<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.260> walks<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.709> comes<00:03:13.860> at<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.069> camera

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
kind of walks and comes at the camera

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.960 
kind of walks and comes at the camera
now<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.590> animation<00:03:17.010> isn't<00:03:17.280> completely<00:03:17.700> done

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
now this animation isn't completely done

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.809 
now this animation isn't completely done
yet<00:03:18.000> but<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.620> if<00:03:19.889> you're<00:03:20.190> looking<00:03:20.400> at<00:03:20.670> this

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
yet but so if you're looking at this

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.879 
yet but so if you're looking at this
animation<00:03:21.180> you're<00:03:21.510> thinking<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.769> know

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
animation you're thinking you know

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.349 
animation you're thinking you know
there's<00:03:23.100> something<00:03:23.280> about<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.639> don't<00:03:23.880> quite

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
there's something about I don't quite

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.770 
there's something about I don't quite
like<00:03:24.930> I'm<00:03:25.260> not<00:03:25.530> sure<00:03:25.799> what<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.420> we<00:03:27.420> can<00:03:27.600> do

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
like I'm not sure what it is we can do

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.590 
like I'm not sure what it is we can do
is<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.680> found<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.430> from<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.760> Jurassic<00:03:30.389> Park

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
is I found this from the Jurassic Park

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.170 
is I found this from the Jurassic Park
DVDs<00:03:31.019> actually<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.670> sometimes<00:03:32.670> if<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:32.910> watch

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
DVDs actually is sometimes if you watch

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.650 
DVDs actually is sometimes if you watch
the<00:03:33.480> animation<00:03:33.989> in<00:03:34.380> Reverse<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.660> actually

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
the animation in Reverse it actually

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.520 
the animation in Reverse it actually
cues<00:03:37.319> you<00:03:37.470> in<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:38.489> some<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.850> animation<00:03:39.239> of

cues you in to some of the animation of

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.830 
cues you in to some of the animation of
mistakes<00:03:40.940> again<00:03:41.940> this<00:03:42.060> one<00:03:42.299> doesn't<00:03:42.690> really

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
mistakes again this one doesn't really

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.900 
mistakes again this one doesn't really
i'm<00:03:43.200> not<00:03:43.410> sure<00:03:43.799> i<00:03:43.829> felt<00:03:44.220> like<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.880> way

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
i'm not sure i felt like that the way

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.789 
i'm not sure i felt like that the way
the<00:03:45.090> hands<00:03:45.329> work<00:03:45.540> but<00:03:45.959> sometimes<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.560> this

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
the hands work but sometimes you this

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.920 
the hands work but sometimes you this
different<00:03:47.160> perspective<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.910> i<00:03:48.329> found<00:03:48.870> that

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
different perspective and i found that

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.740 
different perspective and i found that
that<00:03:49.109> really<00:03:49.440> helps<00:03:49.859> out<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.880> you<00:03:50.970> can<00:03:51.209> just<00:03:51.269> go

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
that really helps out so you can just go

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.199 
that really helps out so you can just go
back<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.049> forth<00:03:52.410> playing<00:03:52.829> it<00:03:53.010> forwards<00:03:53.940> in<00:03:54.120> it

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
back and forth playing it forwards in it

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.420 
back and forth playing it forwards in it
in<00:03:54.299> reverse<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:54.840> i<00:03:55.680> think<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.400> really

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
in reverse and i think that it really

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.960 
in reverse and i think that it really
really<00:03:57.200> helps<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.290> kind<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.709> isolate<00:03:59.639> some<00:03:59.910> of

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970
