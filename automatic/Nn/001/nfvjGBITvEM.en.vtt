doing the same on paper what will happen
sometimes<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.280> process<00:01:05.610> there<00:01:06.299> may<00:01:06.570> not

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.859 
be a hundred percent coverage of the
leafing<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.170> looks<00:01:13.200> kind<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.430> job<00:01:15.390> left

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
clean it and here is a good example

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.910 
clean it and here is a good example
where<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.819> didn't<00:03:08.360> press<00:03:08.660> down<00:03:08.959> very<00:03:09.319> hard<00:03:09.590> and

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
where I didn't press down very hard and

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.729 
where I didn't press down very hard and
the<00:03:10.730> leafing<00:03:11.150> before<00:03:11.569> I<00:03:11.600> started<00:03:12.049> brushing<00:03:12.319> it

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
the leafing before I started brushing it

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.009 
the leafing before I started brushing it
there's<00:03:13.489> two<00:03:13.790> things<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.239> might<00:03:14.480> want<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.840> try

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
there's two things you might want to try

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.849 
there's two things you might want to try
to<00:03:15.139> do<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.739> just<00:03:16.670> press<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.540> back<00:03:17.989> in<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:20.859> the

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
to do is just press it back in and the

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.879 
to do is just press it back in and the
heat<00:03:22.370> activated<00:03:23.150> glue<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.940> powerful<00:03:26.299> that

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
heat activated glue is so powerful that

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.340 
heat activated glue is so powerful that
you<00:03:27.889> can<00:03:28.130> actually<00:03:28.690> correct<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:29.989> little

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
you can actually correct that little

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.210 
you can actually correct that little
area<00:03:31.209> it's<00:03:32.209> when<00:03:32.540> there<00:03:32.930> isn't<00:03:33.349> enough<00:03:33.829> glue

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
area it's when there isn't enough glue

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.229 
area it's when there isn't enough glue
that<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.810> leafing<00:03:36.440> might<00:03:37.220> not<00:03:37.459> stick<00:03:38.000> to

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
that that leafing might not stick to

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.339 
that that leafing might not stick to
that<00:03:38.540> area<00:03:38.870> so<00:03:39.650> it's<00:03:39.859> no<00:03:40.069> problem<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.760> add<00:03:41.349> just

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
that area so it's no problem to add just

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.900 
that area so it's no problem to add just
a<00:03:42.620> touch<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.950> glue<00:03:43.430> back<00:03:44.389> into<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.989> area<00:03:45.410> and

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
a touch of glue back into the area and

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.530 
a touch of glue back into the area and
try<00:03:46.910> it<00:03:47.060> again<00:03:47.209> in<00:03:48.040> this<00:03:49.040> case<00:03:49.340> I'm<00:03:50.120> going<00:03:50.180> to

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
try it again in this case I'm going to

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.150 
try it again in this case I'm going to
leave<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:51.049> just<00:03:51.230> like<00:03:51.380> that<00:03:51.739> because<00:03:51.950> that

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
leave it just like that because that

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.390 
leave it just like that because that
black<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:53.630> little<00:03:54.380> touch<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.889> black<00:03:55.130> is

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
black that little touch of black is

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.670 
black that little touch of black is
quite<00:03:55.760> attractive<00:03:57.010> now<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.370> have<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.680> nice

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
to do at this time is i use a baby wipe

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.990 
to do at this time is i use a baby wipe
to<00:04:59.120> clean<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.960> glue<00:05:00.230> off<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:01.250> paintbrush

to clean the glue off of the paintbrush
and<00:05:03.370> it's<00:05:04.370> pretty<00:05:04.670> well<00:05:05.000> cleaned<00:05:05.240> off<00:05:05.600> now<00:05:05.900> and

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
and it's pretty well cleaned off now and

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:13.320 
and it's pretty well cleaned off now and
i'm<00:05:06.560> going<00:05:06.920> to<00:05:07.040> use<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:08.260> Stampin<00:05:09.260> stick<00:05:10.240> clear

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.800 

glue<00:05:17.200> we<00:05:18.200> don't<00:05:18.440> need<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:18.920> use<00:05:19.190> a<00:05:19.480> lot<00:05:20.480> of<00:05:20.510> this

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
glue we don't need to use a lot of this

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.020 
glue we don't need to use a lot of this
product<00:05:21.320> it's<00:05:21.500> very<00:05:22.040> very<00:05:22.400> effective<00:05:24.610> so<00:05:25.610> over

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
product it's very very effective so over

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.090 
product it's very very effective so over
here<00:05:26.060> now<00:05:26.660> we're<00:05:26.990> going<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.200> do<00:05:27.380> another<00:05:27.620> spot

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
here now we're going to do another spot

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.180 
here now we're going to do another spot
and<00:05:28.810> this<00:05:29.810> makes<00:05:30.170> it<00:05:30.380> a<00:05:30.500> little<00:05:30.740> bit<00:05:30.950> more

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
and this makes it a little bit more

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.750 
and this makes it a little bit more
challenging<00:05:31.490> because<00:05:32.090> it's<00:05:32.570> clear<00:05:32.930> and<00:05:33.760> if

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
challenging because it's clear and if

little bit of pressure in the design

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.730

I will back my cleaning area again with
the<00:07:06.270> just<00:07:06.630> the<00:07:06.870> slightest<00:07:07.530> touch<00:07:07.830> of<00:07:08.100> where

the glue might have transferred from the
rubbing<00:07:12.630> process<00:07:13.260> this<00:07:13.920> is<00:07:14.160> the<00:07:14.970> most

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
rubbing process this is the most

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:50.050 
embossing powder and glitter and so now
we<00:07:46.170> have<00:07:47.120> pretty<00:07:48.120> close<00:07:48.480> to<00:07:48.780> the<00:07:48.810> same<00:07:48.960> visual

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.060 
we have pretty close to the same visual

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.120 
we have pretty close to the same visual
however<00:07:51.060> if<00:07:51.540> I<00:07:51.930> did<00:07:52.230> not<00:07:52.410> have<00:07:52.470> the<00:07:52.830> black

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:53.130 
however if I did not have the black

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.250 
however if I did not have the black
under<00:07:53.400> there<00:07:53.760> it<00:07:54.060> wouldn't<00:07:54.450> look<00:07:54.690> very<00:07:54.750> nice

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:55.260 
under there it wouldn't look very nice

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.830 
under there it wouldn't look very nice
and<00:07:55.710> I'd<00:07:55.800> have<00:07:56.010> to<00:07:56.130> do<00:07:56.310> it<00:07:56.460> over<00:07:56.640> in<00:07:57.030> the<00:07:57.090> spot

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 
and I'd have to do it over in the spot

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.670 
and I'd have to do it over in the spot
that<00:07:57.870> I<00:07:58.170> miss<00:07:58.440> but<00:07:58.680> I<00:07:58.860> am<00:07:59.010> going<00:07:59.220> to<00:07:59.280> leave<00:07:59.460> it
