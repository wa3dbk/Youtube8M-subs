00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 as you readers and the throws stretches 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.859
 anti-bully club point link is in the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 description and don't forget the code and 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.059
 use the galaxy for a 5% discount 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.340
 hello all broken what am I missing 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.690
 they went in which my new 2014 world cup 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.519
 predictions yeast I had none 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.650
 then my voice will just come 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.539
 completely off button was hit every minute 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.820
 my voice is pure three times 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.439
 because when we want the Netherlands 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.300
 That reminded me that my vote was half 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.340
 hidden where i can feel as good as 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.470
 back I already had some problems with it 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.840
 the CPU is not too bad 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.189
 level leave as dear like as you 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.140
 a nice episode of course 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.480
 let's try the video to round list 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.980
 so pick it up completely and top are the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 new today we have a program 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.059
 against the united states and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.290
 Argentina against Switzerland only them 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.000
 which I will cover 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.460
 as for the scavenger house setup 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.809
 belgium since belgium is naturally ours 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.250
 I have southern neighbors too, of course 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.039
 apparently a number of Belgian ones 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 viewers so I just started out Belgium 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.829
 light as it were most important 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.050
 competition today and I also find the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.000
 most important competition because I see 18 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.399
 just win that match with one 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.710
 I guess two I guess so 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.420
 level energy I just as quickly from the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.729
 previous las are there from 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.450
 the netherlands i was right that netherlands 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.060
 continued 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.260
 only I had wasted 2022 an I think 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.700
 not very far apart 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.320
 and costa rica greek then I had the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.689
 result good as a one for no so 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.920
 minute but I didn't have the one that good 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.049
 because I had said 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.490
 greece and became costa rican i think 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.930
 that the netherlands is happier than the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.119
 then play against costa rica 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.700
 Greece regards Costa Rica too 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.350
 what attacking team team is because 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.820
 greece dessel greece that goes 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.290
 just play ultra defender in that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.250
 wait much everything himself worse by 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.420
 The Netherlands 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.869
 and then the Netherlands will just have a hard time 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.280
 against to score as it were 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.750
 that of the belgium against the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.640
 United States 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.170
 as regards the suspensions the is 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.850
 course suspended one game 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.189
 namely this feed that for smeg one 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.540
 rancid tacker made one through the red 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.670
 got or very stupid tackling queer 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.860
 new what exactly was marine from it 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.149
 red so that is new to suspended 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.240
 the side of the friends states are there 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.579
 really true no suspensions 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.229
 and injuries on the Belgian side 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.000
 is a play that plays but it is 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.310
 or a severe injury actually 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.410
 vanden borre the man with the great 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.970
 beard actually who had that 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.270
 training received by 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.160
 lie 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.500
 friends can no longer take action 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.020
 again have no injuries 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.880
 the formation of belgium i was expecting 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.780
 4231 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.490
 at the strange state or beautiful 4411 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.980
 vivi one will hear it out soon 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.600
 china view which is too large in the longitudinal 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.790
 actually for the framework 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.890
 but yes here of formation 4231 for the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.590
 Belgians think this was a setup 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.420
 on purpose good where it is just good 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.940
 left back that you simply with 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.010
 the match was last against South Korea 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.810
 then you still have company and outside from 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.520
 outside may be a bit slow but he 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.070
 is one of the best videos to do 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.990
 I think Communion is better with Belgium 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.190
 but comp is of course also just fixed 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.210
 power behind and 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.800
 all that again because I don't know I think 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.810
 him go as right back I just think it is 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.240
 not really a right back I like the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.830
 just slow for that but you play there 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.350
 well the music is still playing nicely 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.880
 so very little to criticize 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.930
 shy with witsel the play just 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.490
 constant 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.440
 that just plays a decent one 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.200
 then defend the other 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.940
 in the middle is fellini which i am doing 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.590
 we scored by getting them on the knife 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.570
 what was right for Belgian find 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.340
 I also played well and for United 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.050
 just really dredging 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.720
 on a left side with gaza that have 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.640
 also got him on the knife why that 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.510
 We don't know he's just fascist at it 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.880
 that oil that but why that one 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.490
 the green boxes with the 290 carafe 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.840
 also a bit ridiculous for that 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.209
 actually anti-western just no 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.530
 mallet to get the match 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.910
 or maybe the chickens from the tick 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.920
 when they are against which country it is exactly 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.420
 like way of the brown and we then on 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.430
 comb and beg like crazy 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.050
 dries mertens who also have respect 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.420
 very important role in those two 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.620
 a win over algeria and then in the 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.880
 peak hour I just still expect 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.920
 lukaku 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.959
 I don't want anything ideologies or starter 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.820
 but i think that 's lukaku anyway 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.430
 let start the same case as the netherlands 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.790
 that they don't let the ball start 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.920
 since seeing the as a substitute or much 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.140
 has done better so I think it is 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.209
 With this kind of thing this was it is 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.739
 lukaku also starts and is just the case 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.300
 place an oil that but then oil that 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.510
 in the second half just the income 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.370
 then the setup of america i put like 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.930
 looks weird regarding the framework 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.600
 just too small as it were for 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.900
 this line-up that shines full of purpose as 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.060
 a 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.550
 is not central in the rear of a base 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.259
 and best and gonzalez 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.180
 respect johnson who normally i left back 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.039
 and offers yon other which is normal 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.080
 nothing with the kids super though 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.729
 just play on both exactly and on 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.020
 the left to have the society 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.460
 sussie 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.860
 predictable in the previous game 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.229
 played right winger I thought about ESBIT 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.590
 in central midfield bradley and is 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.030
 Beckham and then as Redman Jones 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.590
 I think that's a bit more central 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.270
 will play a role in places really and 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.919
 right with roll and that johnson like it 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.360
 ware who takes over the right role as 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.650
 right back are the 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.060
 and that john's there just that 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.070
 defensive duties about one in that 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.260
 I expect to have pouring then 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.840
 dempsey important man at america like 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.220
 pennies on and the striker Joe by CLT 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.580
 he had dropped out injured 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.139
 against ghana but he will be back 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.760
 expected as it were 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.160
 so that will probably just as well 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.039
 play full here because there are competitions 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.419
 I expect to go through Belgium but me 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.470
 think it is a very tricky pot 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.000
 with for belgium 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.620
 since the foreign states is what's there 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.910
 a dempsey just very good at corners 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.370
 are just so dangerous and they have 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.960
 a great keeper is belgium ' goes the 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.760
 get c class but regarding the 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.160
 Belgium has quite a lot of players 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.930
 better team and really only there are 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.330
 a few b think out of the 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.289
 among the americans making america anyway 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.750
 still has a chance 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.280
 so it thinks it's the end of the 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.409
 Was it right would be ludo or and one 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.800
 an i honestly think i see them 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.870
 both score and I see 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.820
 finally belgium nevertheless continue led 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.500
 for the pallet is actually or maybe 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.169
 even on the pallets with think before it 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.229
 what the liberating google from her or 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.490
 of the brown ones for example here 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.349

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.000

 certainly not in the bowl is what 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.220
 you expect from this competition 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.020
 who you expect to continue and the 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.070
 results from also from argentina against 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.570
 Switzerland 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.490
 always nicer to read back the others 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.470
 people think about the competition 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.760
