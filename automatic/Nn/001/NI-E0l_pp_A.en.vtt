turned<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.610> deck<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.939> concocted<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.720> all

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
turned out the deck I concocted is all

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.679 
turned out the deck I concocted is all
about<00:01:13.470> +1<00:01:13.979> +1<00:01:14.159> counters<00:01:14.850> animar<00:01:15.330> gets<00:01:15.509> them

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
about +1 +1 counters animar gets them

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.090 
about +1 +1 counters animar gets them
every<00:01:15.900> time<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.140> cast<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.500> creature<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
every time you cast a creature and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.249 
every time you cast a creature and
subsequent<00:01:18.030> creatures<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> Cass<00:01:18.810> end<00:01:19.140> up

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
subsequent creatures you Cass end up

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.350 
subsequent creatures you Cass end up
being<00:01:19.470> cheaper<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.520> thought<00:01:20.759> I'd<00:01:20.939> use<00:01:21.150> this

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
being cheaper and I thought I'd use this

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.359 
being cheaper and I thought I'd use this
to<00:01:21.600> our<00:01:21.630> advantage<00:01:21.780> by<00:01:22.530> throwing<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.189> whole

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
to our advantage by throwing in a whole

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.429 
to our advantage by throwing in a whole
bunch<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.670> different<00:01:23.939> spells<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.540> add<00:01:24.780> +1<00:01:25.259> +1

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
bunch of different spells that add +1 +1

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.730 
bunch of different spells that add +1 +1
counters<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.220> him<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.990> move<00:01:28.140> +1<00:01:28.619> +1

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
counters to him you can move +1 +1

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039 
counters to him you can move +1 +1
counters<00:01:29.280> around<00:01:29.340> from<00:01:29.970> creatures<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:30.930> you

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
counters around from creatures so if you

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.420

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
have other things that come out with +1

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.010 
have other things that come out with +1
+1<00:01:32.670> cameras<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.630> move<00:01:33.780> them<00:01:33.900> on
