 this edition will be number 44 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.060
 utrecht psv has been the last few years 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.310
 competition with a red border because 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.710
 in the previous four editions fell and the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.449
 no less than 23 yellow cards and the 5 times 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.730
 became the red print 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.590
 shown by the arbitrator of service two 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.779
 of those red cards were for PSV 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.940

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.940

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.780
 [Applause] 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.910
 fc utrecht psv is not just the duel 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.489
 from 22 players on the field but also from 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.309
 the trainer jan wouters and phillip cocu 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.769
 they played people that 95 96 must together 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.250
 in the midfield of psv but are now 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.330
 So 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:14.950
 opposite each other in the galgenwaard 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.950
 [Applause] 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.070
 PSV had last season and three of 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.450
 utrecht players in the selection but 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.340
 Kevin Strootman 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.500
 dries mertens and erik pieters chose 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.970
 all for abroad at utrecht 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.980
 is a psv 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.570
 Timothy Derijck is called for one 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.570
 rented out to the people of the city season 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.049
 the match is on Sunday 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.000
 management of pol van boekel guide 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.280
 once earlier this season and whistled 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.950
 league games of psv in 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.939

 [Music] 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.569
 [Applause] 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.090
 and the 8990 season booked psv de 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.100
 biggest win in utrecht 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.260
 SÃ¸ren Lerby scored the first name 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.210
 psv and blast wrists and jug 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.800
 Ellerman were accurate 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.210
 but the big man at the Eindhoven nasty 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.120
 was how could it be otherwise 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:26.310
 romario so can the pot with the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.030
 replay ball in the course of romario that 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.030
 is a gift 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:40.709
 and that is of course not possible with romario 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:43.320
 get up or 20 minutes and derby in free 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:48.450
 position on of a raven hey let it on 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:51.390
 romario and it's a 5 nice 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.020
 played off of course 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.020
 gerard 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.909
 so it's time for Mario again 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.620
 top scorer now of psv because with 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.700
 his name is now 12 4 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.140
 Lizzie 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.250
 could score kieft who we injured 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.700
 say 10 was more than enough 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.700
 passed 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.860
 in 2007 witnessed among what 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.989
 found another miracle in vc history 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.280
 place on the final day of the 98 season 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.109
 99 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.730
 Arnold Bruggink makes it whole for you 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.629
 important goal point causing the 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.710
 champion's league 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.809
 still met 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.809
 [Applause] 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.080
 and come on hey pat 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.350
 what they see are called 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.350
 e2 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.430
 absolutely unmerited what is true 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.180
 the cow birds 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:55.030
 van is a nice 31 goals in the 32nd 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.610
 are worth millions of us j 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.550
 points out 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.570
 it stood as i can, so fucking can 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.510
 meaningful 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.500
 a good one 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.090
 I'm making this goal 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.260
 no good agree to win in the 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.690
 galgenwaard is a difficult task 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.580
 since fc utrecht about 14 games 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.890
 in a row has not lost in its own 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.900
 stadium the last three home games 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.510
 the next rider even kept his goal 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.400
 clean and that while psv already seven 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.650
 did not win away matches 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.120
 a difficult task so when ola 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.950
 toivonen without coming into action 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.710
 means that are two hundredths 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.630
 official competition in the shirt of psv 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.790
 Toivonen is also interested in scoring PSV 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.710
 matches against utrecht in seven 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.150
 he knew the net three times 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.400
 to find 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.020
 PSVs must be the two most experienced players 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.090
 in matches against FC Utrecht 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.040
 captain georginio wijnaldum is already 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.570
 long injured and therefore cannot be 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.740
 eleventh game against the domedics 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.660
 play 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.250
 Stijn is scarce with 14 games 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.290
 most experienced but also he is 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.870
 injured 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.120
 Sunday afternoon half past four so the number seven 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.140
 t the number 10 in other words 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.140
 fc utrecht psv
