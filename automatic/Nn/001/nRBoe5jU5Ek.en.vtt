to<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.150> squeeze<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.480> little<00:00:27.750> bit<00:00:27.900> more<00:00:28.080> juice

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
to do is squeeze a little bit more juice

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.700 
to do is squeeze a little bit more juice
earlier<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.460> as<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.060> name<00:00:30.570> suggests<00:00:30.840> so

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
while it's not a great sounding pedal on

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.600 
while it's not a great sounding pedal on
its<00:00:33.390> own<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:34.350> great<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.770> what<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.070> does<00:00:35.250> so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
really great sounding overdrive if I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
really great sounding overdrive if I
pump<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> pulp<00:01:00.300> which<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.809> bass<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.469> pull

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
pump up the pulp which is bass and pull

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.270 
pump up the pulp which is bass and pull
down<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.430> Tang<00:01:02.730> which<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.570> treble<00:01:04.280> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
down the Tang which is the treble and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.770 
down the Tang which is the treble and
while<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.610> does<00:01:05.729> I'll<00:01:05.880> switch<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.240> off<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.720> is

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
while it does I'll switch it off this is

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.210 
while it does I'll switch it off this is
the<00:01:06.900> distortion<00:01:07.350> channel<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.890> my<00:01:08.070> aunt

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the distortion channel of my aunt

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.330 
the distortion channel of my aunt
without

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:27.100 

and<00:01:15.340> this<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.180> what<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.450> pit

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.460 

so<00:01:28.070> really<00:01:28.430> patents<00:01:29.150> it<00:01:29.300> up<00:01:29.450> makes<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:30.020> bit

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
so really patents it up makes it a bit

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.740 
so really patents it up makes it a bit
more<00:01:30.500> sort<00:01:30.890> of<00:01:30.920> ballsy<00:01:31.550> almost<00:01:32.420> sounds<00:01:32.690> a

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
more sort of ballsy almost sounds a

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.060 
more sort of ballsy almost sounds a
little<00:01:32.810> bit<00:01:33.020> like<00:01:33.170> you've<00:01:33.380> got<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.530> humpback<00:01:33.800> at

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
little bit like you've got a humpback at

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.890 
little bit like you've got a humpback at
the<00:01:34.190> air<00:01:34.310> when<00:01:34.490> really<00:01:34.760> it's<00:01:35.030> just<00:01:35.090> your<00:01:35.750> old

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
the air when really it's just your old

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.200 
the air when really it's just your old
kind<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.290> single<00:01:36.620> coil<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.250> this<00:01:38.000> is<00:01:38.120> without

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
kind of single coil so this is without

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:49.950 
kind of single coil so this is without
the<00:01:38.510> pedal

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.539 

pretty<00:01:50.960> much<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.380> mainly<00:01:51.829> use<00:01:52.130> this<00:01:52.310> with<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
pretty much I mainly use this with the

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.670 
pretty much I mainly use this with the
strat<00:01:52.969> not<00:01:53.420> really<00:01:53.719> anything<00:01:53.930> else<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.560> my

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
strat not really anything else and my

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.260 
strat not really anything else and my
other<00:01:54.829> my<00:01:55.280> other<00:01:55.460> guitars<00:01:55.759> have<00:01:56.000> bridge

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
other my other guitars have bridge

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.149 
other my other guitars have bridge
hamburgers<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.380> don't<00:01:57.560> need<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:57.950> much

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
hamburgers so I don't need it so much

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.340 
hamburgers so I don't need it so much

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
but still can sound quite cool with

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.649 
but still can sound quite cool with
those<00:02:00.530> but<00:02:01.130> yeah<00:02:01.340> great<00:02:01.670> little<00:02:01.909> pedal<00:02:02.210> if<00:02:02.360> you
