00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.810 

thought<00:00:15.730> you<00:00:15.759> said

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.020 

no<00:00:23.860> as<00:00:24.860> much<00:00:25.100> different<00:00:25.520> from<00:00:25.580> right

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.260 

very<00:00:29.660> gently

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.150 

so<00:00:35.270> I<00:00:35.300> have<00:00:35.600> I<00:00:35.930> guess<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:36.590> want<00:00:36.770> full<00:00:37.010> speed

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
so I have I guess you want full speed

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.190 
so I have I guess you want full speed
pretty<00:00:37.760> much<00:00:37.880> yeah<00:00:38.180> it's<00:00:38.510> not<00:00:38.720> terribly<00:00:39.050> I

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
pretty much yeah it's not terribly I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.540 
pretty much yeah it's not terribly I
don't<00:00:39.350> have<00:00:39.440> it<00:00:39.530> set<00:00:39.710> up<00:00:39.740> terrible<00:00:40.070> faster

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
don't have it set up terrible faster

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.260 
don't have it set up terrible faster
motor<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:41.240> haven't

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
motor I haven't

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.320 
motor I haven't
okay<00:00:43.780> so<00:00:43.840> I<00:00:43.960> got<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.110> lot<00:00:44.410> of<00:00:44.440> up<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:46.000> great

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
okay so I got a lot of up it's great

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.090 
okay so I got a lot of up it's great
though<00:00:46.540> it's<00:00:46.750> it's<00:00:46.900> very<00:00:47.170> graceful<00:00:47.740> I<00:00:47.890> would

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
though it's it's very graceful I would

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.800 
though it's it's very graceful I would
have<00:00:48.160> expected<00:00:48.340> this<00:00:48.790> thing<00:00:48.970> to<00:00:49.060> be<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:49.180> rocket

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
have expected this thing to be a rocket

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.750 
have expected this thing to be a rocket
now<00:00:50.470> that's<00:00:50.680> what<00:00:50.830> I<00:00:50.860> like<00:00:50.920> about<00:00:51.130> it<00:00:51.430> is<00:00:51.700> that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
now that's what I like about it is that

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.720 
now that's what I like about it is that
to<00:00:52.150> me<00:00:52.330> it<00:00:53.200> flies<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.500> lot<00:00:53.860> like<00:00:54.100> you'd<00:00:54.280> expected

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
to me it flies a lot like you'd expected

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.030 
to me it flies a lot like you'd expected
so<00:00:54.880> I<00:00:54.910> think<00:00:55.120> it's<00:00:55.270> real<00:00:55.540> time<00:00:55.810> yeah<00:00:56.230> yeah<00:00:56.680> if

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
so I think it's real time yeah yeah if

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.280 
so I think it's real time yeah yeah if
you<00:00:57.250> watch<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.700> jet<00:00:57.970> you'll<00:00:58.330> buy<00:00:58.540> at<00:00:58.840> that<00:00:58.870> size

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
you watch a jet you'll buy at that size

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.350 
you watch a jet you'll buy at that size
that's<00:00:59.559> actually<00:00:59.920> scale<00:01:00.250> pretty<00:01:00.640> darn<00:01:00.850> i<00:01:01.210> was

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
that's actually scale pretty darn i was

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.880 
that's actually scale pretty darn i was
going<00:01:01.540> to<00:01:01.600> say<00:01:01.660> this<00:01:01.930> is<00:01:02.110> scale<00:01:02.379> at<00:01:02.800> speed

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.660 

during<00:01:09.890> real<00:01:10.130> life

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.170 

actually<00:01:16.450> this<00:01:16.600> is<00:01:16.840> easy<00:01:17.020> for<00:01:17.140> me<00:01:17.320> because

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
actually this is easy for me because

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.010 
actually this is easy for me because
fixed-wing<00:01:19.180> iphone<00:01:19.570> at<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.840> wine<00:01:19.990> the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
fixed-wing iphone at the wine the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
fixed-wing iphone at the wine the

yeah<00:01:56.330> look<00:01:56.600> like<00:01:56.780> its<00:01:56.960> ligand<00:01:57.320> like<00:01:57.530> really

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
yeah look like its ligand like really

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
see there's the glide it's like I've got

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.760 
see there's the glide it's like I've got
barely<00:02:02.150> any<00:02:02.300> title<00:02:02.840> on<00:02:02.900> it's<00:02:03.080> all
