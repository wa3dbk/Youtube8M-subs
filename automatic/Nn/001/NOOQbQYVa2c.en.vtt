00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 yes 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.360
 very good to all people how is it 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.060
 tito yes being house and I'm a failure 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.460
 we have new information in a trailer 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.900
 that they have taken out of the new dlc vengeance and 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.340
 Well, I will comment on the little things that 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.490
 have left for the volleyball map and 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.189
 We have two newer new drinks 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.900
 two confirmed drinks really new 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.970
 information about new characters a 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.440
 kind of ghost then the big one in 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.120
 So now I'm going to tell you how 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.250
 it works so we 're not going to analyze anything 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.710
 the trailer more deeply in images 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.570
 and the first thing we found nothing else 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.789
 start the trailer is like this a small 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.219
 esplanade where we can seem to access 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.629
 several buildings and it also seems that 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.940
 will be one of the few areas where 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.309
 we can collect zombies because in all 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.050
 the other videos that we have or of the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.760
 other trailer is good we have seen 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.890
 still nothing any area where you 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.329
 can join comfortably and good more 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.710
 forward continuing a little here 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.930
 we have a kind of mansion 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.700
 underground that is all within the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.350
 same map as a giant mansion and 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.420
 just what is in the middle of the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.970
 mansion here I put a little action 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.350
 because in my opinion this seems like a 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.659
 kind of ghost that we are now going to 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.729
 See later 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.560
 and well as I told you right here we 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.270
 this image reappears but it is 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.329
 behind a window with which no 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.469
 we know if this girl 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.179
 I may have been told several 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.549
 people that may be that blanket I do not 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.469
 I believe it because apparently although not all 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.209
 enough of the story the zombies already 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.250
 I'm telling you but in my opinion I would change 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:38.920
 radically everything a bit because it 's something 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.689
 quite unexpected but good is a 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.149
 kind of ghost that as I said 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.920
 we'll see how he acts later and that 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.990
 maybe move around the mansion we do not 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.759
 we go found already in two windows 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.319
 different with which maybe I'll go 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.629
 wandering around that mansion does not 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.239
 we know the truth nothing here we see a 

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:57.039
 zombie coming out of the earth and all this 

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.509
 huge horde of zombies walking by what 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.310
 which is the area that I have taught you in 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.599
 first screenshot well several things has 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.360
 commented on this image very 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.340
 important is first of all the bottom 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.170
 more or less on the right we see a 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.209
 sort of green light that I think that 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.190
 is going to be this good to me it gives me 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.840
 enough indications about speed tail not 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.060
 you see absolutely nothing with which no 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.099
 I'm not at all sure but good is my 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.200
 opinion that I think speed queue and the 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.000
 once we have a blue light with which 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.350
 may also be indications that the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.480
 box we have it there 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.490
 what does this mean that the lights 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.770
 blue as we have already had in several 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.200
 other maps may be what you indicate 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.050
 where will the box be in different 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.760
 points on the map but of course 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.560
 underground has a little more of 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.730
 mystery because we can not look at the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.620
 sky since we will have rocks 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.180
 supposedly with which this would have 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.920
 than to investigate it in more detail but 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.260
 good can be a possibility what 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.320
 that this light will indicate us the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.120
 box and well right after this we see here 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.890
 the first image of this new 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.930
 character that we had not seen in the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.730
 first trailer a kind of witch a 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.260
 kind of weeping girl have also 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.060
 called the truth I have no idea of 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
 that was going to be what it's going to be for but 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.450
 good hours later I'm going to 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.640
 to detract from a little theory that I have 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.620
 commented that the truth can be true 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.270
 now you are going to see it and also right here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.340
 Well, we have another image in which 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.500
 we see that this character we are going to 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.030
 to be able to kill maybe we are worth to some 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.620
 thing now I will explain more 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.430
 go ahead this thing that I'm talking about 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.220
 as they have commented 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.770
 or maybe bonuses or maybe we 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.510
 things I know about pieces and the truth is not 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.070
 I have no idea what it's going to be worth 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.660
 this character but something something secret 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.670
 they have to have 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.800
 and right here continuing we see the 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.590
 zombies leave a very narrow corridor 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.090
 and the titan drink confirmed that the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.250
 titan is on all the maps 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.690
 it was practically confirmed in all 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.370
 the maps without even knowing it but 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.560
 it's good to know where you're going to be 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.300
 located and we can see that just 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.210
 over some barrels and in a corridor 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.770
 that is going to be very narrow with which I 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.330
 what I think about this is that once 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.210
 let us lie down the truth will be very 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.770
 complicated to get the titan if we 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.810
 we have to put there we do not have another 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.390
 exit there is practically impossible 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.240
 go around 24 zombies with which he goes to 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.430
 be quite complicated so that 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.650
 I seem to get the titan as 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.060
 I say once we lie down not any 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.400
 story if we're playing solo and 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.040
 we take monkeys for the truth that goes 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.750
 to be quite difficult and well 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.400
 we continue with the trailer here new 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.440
 images of good what is the weapon 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.410
 special that they will put and attention 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.910
 we have new images of what is 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.440
 be zombie be big that still 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.480
 nobody knew what was going to 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.580
 use and also green to note that 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.320
 right at the back we have samuel as if 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.840
 was he who had freed him to 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.820
 this bug on the table and a 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.860
 the drinks that I really do not know I do not know 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.070
 how important they are but they are there 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.960
 no and the truth that we will use all trier 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.760
 he always puts things for some reason 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.040
 and we have some drinks there we do not know 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.900
 what will they be for but well we also see 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.639
 friendship and calling him attention and fair 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.560
 here the giant like that is asking 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.750
 to eat not so now you're going to see in the 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.570
 next picture what what you like 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.250
 the giant and here comes my theory that is 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.040
 the truth that is not really mine is 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.110
 a schalke that has passed me what good 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.479
 here is his name put by was 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.090
 Thank you very much and we see good 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.440
 a plate full of candy and what is it 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.479
 what this good kid told me 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.580
 one of the possible theories is 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.870
 that maybe the witch or the ghost that 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.580
 we have seen before maybe 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.919
 we will have to kill him so that she 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.169
 halloween is not the one that gives us the 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.850
 goodies kind of something if you know the 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.280
 history of hansel and gretel as good 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.080
 something similar is nothing confirmed already 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.000
 I say it's a bit of a theory in the plan 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.210
 but he hears the theory is there 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.010
 maybe it could be true and nothing more for 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.270
 end we see here the big guy giving 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.669
 a couple of hosts and helping and 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.880
 finally, well, the final date of 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.710
 exit like all 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.840
 we know so nothing this is all about 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.430
 the trailer to see if they bring it to us already 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.140
 I tell you the truth that we all have 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.670
 really want and I hope that I have 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.320
 liked this analysis we see ourselves in the 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.500
 next video until the next people of 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.500
 bye
