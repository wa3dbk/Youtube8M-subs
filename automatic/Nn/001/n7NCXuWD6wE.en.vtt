always<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:58.030> male<00:03:58.240> dancers<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.990> think<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.650> I

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
always the male dancers I think that I

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.190 
always the male dancers I think that I
feel<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:01.090> want<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.450> do<00:04:01.600> more<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:01.960> more

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
feel you want to do more and more

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.960 
feel you want to do more and more
because<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.770> see<00:04:02.980> these<00:04:03.100> dancers<00:04:03.670> who<00:04:03.910> are

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
because you see these dancers who are

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.090 
because you see these dancers who are
older<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:05.260> want<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.530> reach<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:06.070> that

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
older and you want to reach to that

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.630 
older and you want to reach to that
level<00:04:06.520> but<00:04:07.330> I<00:04:07.600> think<00:04:07.660> you're<00:04:08.260> still<00:04:08.800> in<00:04:09.130> a

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
level but I think you're still in a

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.660 
level but I think you're still in a
place<00:04:10.030> where<00:04:10.390> you're<00:04:10.570> growing<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.670> that's

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
place where you're growing and that's

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.730 
place where you're growing and that's
when<00:04:12.940> I<00:04:13.150> would<00:04:13.300> say<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.720> have<00:04:14.200> patience

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
when I would say to have patience

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.280 
when I would say to have patience
because<00:04:14.830> that<00:04:15.310> will<00:04:15.550> come<00:04:15.820> here<00:04:16.239> by<00:04:16.450> ear<00:04:16.810> and

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
because that will come here by ear and

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.900 
because that will come here by ear and
you<00:04:17.440> will<00:04:17.560> progress<00:04:17.770> you<00:04:18.220> will<00:04:18.250> understand

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
you will progress you will understand

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.150 
you will progress you will understand
more<00:04:19.150> what<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.170> do<00:04:20.350> how<00:04:20.709> to<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:23.380> reach<00:04:23.920> that

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
more what to do how to to reach that

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.520 
more what to do how to to reach that
level<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:25.090> think<00:04:25.480> patience<00:04:26.230> would<00:04:26.380> be

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
level so I think patience would be

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.070 
level so I think patience would be
number<00:04:26.890> one
