one of the most important mathematical
concepts<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.379> understand<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.340> order<00:00:08.580> of

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
concepts to understand is the order of

have both multiplication and division

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.959

you<00:00:49.379> work<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> multiplication<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.550> division

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
you work the multiplication and division

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.270 
you work the multiplication and division
from<00:00:51.000> left<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> right<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.289> whatever<00:00:53.100> order

from left to right in whatever order
they<00:00:53.640> happen<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.940> come<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> same

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
they happen to come and it's the same

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.770 
they happen to come and it's the same

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
thing with addition and subtraction

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.139 
thing with addition and subtraction
let's<00:00:57.780> look<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> example<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:59.149> first

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
let's look at the example here first

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.099 
let's look at the example here first
thing<00:01:00.300> we're<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.600> look<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:00.930> is

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
thing we're going to look for is

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.560 
thing we're going to look for is
parentheses<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.760> two<00:01:03.149> sets<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
parentheses we have two sets of

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.710 
parentheses we have two sets of
parentheses<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.119> need<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.390> resolve

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
parentheses and so we need to resolve

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.710 
parentheses and so we need to resolve
them<00:01:06.960> first<00:01:07.549> 8<00:01:08.549> minus<00:01:08.970> 5<00:01:09.270> equals<00:01:09.960> 3<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:11.390> 9<00:01:12.390> plus

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
them first 8 minus 5 equals 3 and 9 plus

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.340 
them first 8 minus 5 equals 3 and 9 plus
3<00:01:13.130> equals<00:01:14.130> 12<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.570> resolved<00:01:16.170> our

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
3 equals 12 so we resolved our

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.359 
3 equals 12 so we resolved our
parentheses<00:01:17.000> next<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.450> exponents<00:01:19.369> we

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
parentheses next we have exponents we

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.730 
parentheses next we have exponents we
only<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.820> exponent<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.350> 4

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
only have one exponent here and it's 4

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.950 
only have one exponent here and it's 4
to<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> second<00:01:23.520> power<00:01:23.549> which<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.990> 16<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.630> we've

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
to the second power which is 16 so we've

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.380 
to the second power which is 16 so we've
resolved<00:01:28.409> exponents<00:01:29.270> next<00:01:30.270> is

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
resolved exponents next is

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.090 
resolved exponents next is
multiplication<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.170> division<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.860> first

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
multiplication and division but first

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.969 
multiplication and division but first
let's<00:01:32.310> rewrite<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:33.450> what's<00:01:33.630> left<00:01:33.979> we

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
let's rewrite this to see what's left we

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.679 
let's rewrite this to see what's left we
have<00:01:35.130> 3<00:01:35.640> times<00:01:36.630> 6<00:01:37.049> plus<00:01:38.270> 16<00:01:39.799> divided<00:01:40.799> by<00:01:40.829> 2

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
have 3 times 6 plus 16 divided by 2

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.170 
have 3 times 6 plus 16 divided by 2
times<00:01:42.689> 12<00:01:43.759> divided<00:01:44.759> by<00:01:44.790> 3<00:01:46.759> that<00:01:47.759> will<00:01:47.939> work

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
times 12 divided by 3 that will work

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.660 
times 12 divided by 3 that will work
from<00:01:48.600> left<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.500> multiplication<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
from left to right on multiplication and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.840 
from left to right on multiplication and
division<00:01:51.500> 3<00:01:52.500> times<00:01:52.770> 6<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.460> 18<00:01:54.979> 16<00:01:55.979> divided<00:01:56.610> by<00:01:56.640> 2

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
division 3 times 6 is 18 16 divided by 2

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.260 
division 3 times 6 is 18 16 divided by 2
is<00:01:57.360> 8<00:01:57.920> I'll<00:01:58.920> rewrite<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.579> rest<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.030> on

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
is 8 I'll rewrite the rest of this on

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.830 
is 8 I'll rewrite the rest of this on
here<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.140> 8<00:02:02.009> times<00:02:02.399> 12<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.210> 96

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.690 

96<00:02:06.840> divided<00:02:07.259> by<00:02:07.500> 3<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.789> 32<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.160> see<00:02:11.520> we

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
96 divided by 3 is 32 and so you see we

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.740 
96 divided by 3 is 32 and so you see we
had

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
had

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.300 
had
string<00:02:12.960> of<00:02:13.050> operations<00:02:13.560> here<00:02:13.710> with<00:02:13.890> division

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
string of operations here with division

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.430 
string of operations here with division
and<00:02:14.490> multiplication<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.020> work<00:02:16.200> from

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
and multiplication and we just work from

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.970 
and multiplication and we just work from
left<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.770> right<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.450> what<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.630> left<00:02:18.870> now

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
left to right so what we have left now

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.530 
left to right so what we have left now
is<00:02:19.980> 18<00:02:20.670> plus<00:02:21.630> 32<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:24.030> that's<00:02:24.180> just<00:02:24.270> one

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
is 18 plus 32 and so that's just one

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.170 
is 18 plus 32 and so that's just one
operation<00:02:25.080> we'll<00:02:25.890> add<00:02:26.070> these<00:02:26.280> two<00:02:26.520> up<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.060> we

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
operation we'll add these two up and we

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.260 
operation we'll add these two up and we
