00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.160
 an indigenous man from Central America had found peace in 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.269
 God 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.110
 I had changed radically 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.449
 of a life of depravity 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.089
 drunkenness and infidelity 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.230
 to a life of true satisfaction pipes 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:26.799
 He always talked about his salvation and what Jesus Christ had done for him 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.889
 he did not care where they were and who was living the jobs 

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:32.750
 'champions' what 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.090
 he gave them all the testimony of his conversion 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.950
 one day 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.490
 a friend asked him 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.950
 and because you talk so much about Christ 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.380
 he did not respond immediately 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.490
 but he started to pick 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.430
 a few sticks and a dry sponge that was placed one on another in a circle 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.880
 then I search until I find a little worm 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.230
 and put it in the center of the circle 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.650
 still without saying a word he lit a match and brought it to the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.390
 leaves and dry sticks 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.050
 the fire went around the dry fuel 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.200
 and the trapped worm began to logically look for how to get out 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.090
 but I cant 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.939
 at last 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.909
 the fire moved towards the center and more and more 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.090
 and the heat was getting closer the worm 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.610
 this desperate raised his head high to breathe at least 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.130
 a little bit of fresh air 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.749
 the little worm knew that his only refuge would have to come from above 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.650
 Seeing him like this, the Indian bowed and extended his fingers 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.630
 the annual course 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.789
 it has been theirs and the indigenous brought the worm out of the midst of the fire 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.799
 it was until then that he issued his first word 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.670
 this explained 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.340
 is what Christ did for me 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.350
 I was caught in the vices of sin 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.969
 and there was no hope of departure 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:16.239
 I had tried by all possible means to save myself 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.749
 but it was impossible 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:22.319
 then the gentleman leaned towards me 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.510
 and he extended his hand to me the only thing I had to do was 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.289
 It has been a baby 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.319
 Christ pulled me out of that prison 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.779
 that's why I can not stop telling everyone what he did for me 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:41.459
 The truth is that the Indian discovered to perfection what 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.650
 Christ can 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.859
 and wants to do for each one of us 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.889
 without Christ we are trapped 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:54.279
 we better recognize once and for all that real life did not support 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.489
 the popular argument that says 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.029
 the day I want to leave the vice I can leave it 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.039
 if not for help that comes from above 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.469
 we will die that our sins 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.879
 Christ is near us and does not extend his hand 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.469
 we just have to have been one of her 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.049
 the indigenous did 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.589
 and found peace 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:22.449
 as well as er millions and millions more have already made peace 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.989
 why not do it too 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:26.920
 Christ 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.879
 wants to rescue us 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.879
 refuse mushrooms 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.540
 to hear more precarious the red 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.830
 must return on land 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.939
