00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello mister goal come to a small 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.160
 unboxing the encase snap case for that 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.550
 iphone 5 the crash net case is one 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.590
 relatively expensive case but also the money 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.020
 worth I have so far already at 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.910
 've used the iPhone 4 two years 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 long in use it has say 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.470
 and write three to five falls were 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.820
 about survived the case had one though 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.010
 a few scraps but the iphone was 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.019
 completely intact for this reason 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.160
 I invested this 30 euros and thinks 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.359
 they are very good this time 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.550
 invested 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.920
 long story short we catch that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.059
 whole just out of the packaging 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.730
 very simple 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.920
 this much easier to remove 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.539
 like the previous model 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:52.590
 then we have a bit here too 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:54.899
 Packed and then have packaging 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.420
 we also here the case small 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.090
 paper in it 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.350
 then we have the lettering from here 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.909
 encase up here for the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.490
 control elements served in the tiebreak 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.220
 button here for these loudly soft keys 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.180
 and here below also omitted and yes it 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.210
 is nice and clear 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.680
 Here we have a flash lite ring 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.780
 I'll just call it now 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.250
 This is to prevent you from the lightning 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.159
 of the iphones for washed out at the picture 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.770
 so then we would just have the whole thing 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.759
 Here I have to say I always have 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.380
 fear because of this elixir story 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:43.200
 that I scratch my iphone here 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.829
 but brought in and how to get here 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.220
 able to see 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.259
 the recess for the sleep button 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.840
 Perfect for the loud quiet rules 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.659
 as well as the mute button also 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.360
 super accessible and down here the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.680
 Audio socket wide connector and boxes 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.730
 excellently left out 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.860
 the back of the flash lite ring too 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.120
 excellent to see 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.660
 not personally it bothers one now 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.320
 Little bit that I am here so this 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.250
 spaceman have water stains 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.240
 apart from the fingerprints 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.620
 but it can also be related to it 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.450
 that i already have on my iphone 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.970
 have applied protective film and this 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.470
 stop accordingly now 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.550
 appears as it looks like fits 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.310
 the perfect I have one too 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.780
 slight survive I do not know if you can 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.300
 that can see so accurately 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.760
 that protects me the iphone or the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.110
 display if I have it here, of course 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:47.350
 put on it and say great 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.720
 Part 30 euro sits perfectly you can 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.830
 do not complain 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.160
 So you can also like a device 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.360
 Invest 30 euros in tschuldigung 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.090
 That's what it was, too 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.440
 already a whole unboxing lightweight 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.150
 next time give more videos 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.120
 Let's see how I get to it and 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.680
 how to handle the equipment 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.790
 I am still filming with the ipad 3 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 but it does not matter now 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.540
 in this sense, I wish you still 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.540
 Have a nice evening until then
