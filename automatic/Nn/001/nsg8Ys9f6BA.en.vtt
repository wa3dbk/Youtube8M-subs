we

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
we

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.920 
we
on<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.830> road<00:01:52.950> at<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.130> time<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.390> without

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
on the road at that time so without

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.930 
on the road at that time so without
further<00:01:55.170> ado<00:01:55.560> let's<00:01:55.920> get<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.340> we're<00:01:56.850> going

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
further ado let's get to it we're going

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.240 
further ado let's get to it we're going
to<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.120> a<00:01:57.150> bunch<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.600> in-car<00:01:58.170> testing<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
to do a bunch of in-car testing and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.410 
to do a bunch of in-car testing and
we're<00:01:59.400> going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.550> show<00:01:59.760> you<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.060> real-world

Rockford Fosgate 100 farad unit that's
been<00:02:17.220> gutted<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.260> kind<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.470> what<00:02:19.560> happens

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
been gutted this is kind of what happens

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.230 
been gutted this is kind of what happens
to<00:02:19.980> stuff<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.400> when<00:02:20.760> it's<00:02:20.880> around<00:02:21.120> a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
to stuff like this when it's around a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.330 
to stuff like this when it's around a
laboratory<00:02:21.630> environment<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.650> then<00:02:23.220> we're

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
laboratory environment and then we're

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.980 
laboratory environment and then we're
also<00:02:23.490> going<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.820> measure<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.270> performance<00:02:24.390> of

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
also going to measure the performance of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.890 
also going to measure the performance of
the<00:02:25.200> amplifier<00:02:25.350> with<00:02:26.160> no<00:02:26.459> pass<00:02:26.790> or<00:02:27.000> whatsoever

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the amplifier with no pass or whatsoever

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.270 
the amplifier with no pass or whatsoever
now<00:02:28.170> what<00:02:28.410> amplifier<00:02:28.830> do<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.100> in<00:02:29.190> this

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
now what amplifier do we have in this

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.800 
now what amplifier do we have in this
vehicle<00:02:29.670> we<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.410> Rockford<00:02:31.410> T<00:02:31.850> 2500<00:02:32.850> one

vehicle we have a Rockford T 2500 one
BDCP<00:02:35.000> alright<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.660> let's<00:02:36.810> get<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.140> it

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
BDCP alright so let's get to it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.570 
BDCP alright so let's get to it
I<00:02:37.470> know<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.830> guys<00:02:38.040> want<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.370> know<00:02:38.459> these

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
I know you guys want to know these

00:02:38.580 --> 00:03:36.319 
I know you guys want to know these
answers

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.910 

so<00:03:37.329> for<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.599> one<00:03:37.749> fair<00:03:38.019> cap<00:03:38.319> testing<00:03:38.769> we've

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
so for the one fair cap testing we've

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.309 
so for the one fair cap testing we've
located<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.969> capacitor<00:03:40.540> right<00:03:40.780> next<00:03:41.139> to<00:03:41.230> the

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
located the capacitor right next to the

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.500 
located the capacitor right next to the
amplifier<00:03:41.829> we've<00:03:42.040> got<00:03:42.189> about<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.760> don't<00:03:43.389> know

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
amplifier we've got about I don't know

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.089 
amplifier we've got about I don't know
eight<00:03:43.749> inches<00:03:44.019> of<00:03:44.079> wire<00:03:44.319> between<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.799> app<00:03:44.920> and

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
eight inches of wire between the app and

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.009 
eight inches of wire between the app and
the<00:03:45.189> cap<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:45.730> this<00:03:46.060> is<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.299> best<00:03:46.510> way<00:03:46.659> to<00:03:46.689> do<00:03:46.900> it

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
the cap so this is the best way to do it

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.780 
the cap so this is the best way to do it
we'll<00:03:47.499> see<00:03:47.709> what<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.189> results<00:03:48.519> are<00:03:48.609> on<00:03:48.700> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
we'll see what the results are on the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:04:48.520 
we'll see what the results are on the
dyno

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.890 

all<00:04:49.530> right<00:04:49.680> so<00:04:49.830> now<00:04:49.979> we've<00:04:50.130> got<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.610> 100<00:04:51.600> fare

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
all right so now we've got the 100 fare

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.290 
all right so now we've got the 100 fare
add<00:04:52.080> carbon<00:04:52.699> ultracapacitor<00:04:53.699> hooked<00:04:53.910> up<00:04:54.090> and

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
add carbon ultracapacitor hooked up and

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.540 
add carbon ultracapacitor hooked up and
same<00:04:54.810> thing<00:04:54.840> right<00:04:55.710> next<00:04:55.979> to<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.130> amplifier

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
same thing right next to the amplifier

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.280 
same thing right next to the amplifier
same<00:04:56.850> length<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.270> cables<00:04:57.660> actually<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.080> same

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
same length of cables actually the same

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.280 
same length of cables actually the same
cables<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.970> so<00:04:59.970> we<00:05:00.240> will<00:05:00.510> do<00:05:00.690> some<00:05:00.720> dyno<00:05:01.020> runs

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
cables and so we will do some dyno runs

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.110 
cables and so we will do some dyno runs
with<00:05:01.500> this<00:05:01.650> one<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.040> see<00:05:02.850> where<00:05:02.970> that<00:05:03.060> takes

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
with this one and see where that takes

00:05:03.120 --> 00:06:00.190 
with this one and see where that takes
us

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.260
