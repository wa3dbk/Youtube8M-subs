mikey digital now coming into the market

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.580 
mikey digital now coming into the market
and<00:00:32.270> what's<00:00:33.270> different<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:33.660> mikey<00:00:34.140> digital

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and what's different about mikey digital

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.760 
and what's different about mikey digital
is<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.790> now<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> digital<00:00:37.350> device<00:00:37.470> which

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
is it now is a digital device which

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.590 
is it now is a digital device which
means<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.190> put<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> lot<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.910> processing

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
means we can put a lot of the processing

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.920 
means we can put a lot of the processing
inside<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.350> box<00:00:40.790> that<00:00:41.790> allows<00:00:41.970> us<00:00:42.150> to<00:00:42.480> do<00:00:42.630> some

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
inside the box that allows us to do some

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
inside the box that allows us to do some
interesting<00:00:43.110> things<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.890> instance<00:00:44.220> auto

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
interesting things for instance auto

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.540 
interesting things for instance auto
level<00:00:45.329> sensing<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> back<00:00:47.310> of<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
level sensing so on the back of the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.580 
level sensing so on the back of the
device<00:00:47.670> you've<00:00:48.510> got<00:00:48.720> a<00:00:48.750> low<00:00:49.050> setting<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.560> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
device you've got a low setting and a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.229 
device you've got a low setting and a
high<00:00:49.739> setting<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.520> were<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.210> in

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
high setting so if you were you know in

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.030 
high setting so if you were you know in
the<00:00:51.390> back<00:00:51.540> of<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.930> hall<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.380> a<00:00:52.410> lecture<00:00:52.710> you

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
the back of the hall at a lecture you

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.229 
the back of the hall at a lecture you
can<00:00:53.190> put<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.579> low<00:00:53.700> setting<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
can put it in the low setting and it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.630 
can put it in the low setting and it
will<00:00:54.329> pick<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.540> a<00:00:54.809> lot<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.200> sound<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.399> put

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
will pick up a lot of sound you can put

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.830 
will pick up a lot of sound you can put
it<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> high<00:00:57.059> setting<00:00:57.390> if<00:00:57.600> you're<00:00:57.720> at

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it in the high setting if you're at

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.540 
it in the high setting if you're at
front<00:00:58.320> row<00:00:58.440> at<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.620> rock<00:00:58.800> concert<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.430> it's

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
front row at a rock concert and it's

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.120 
front row at a rock concert and it's
really<00:01:00.300> blowing<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.719> input<00:01:01.260> too<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:02.070> too

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
really blowing the input too it's too

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.789 
really blowing the input too it's too
hot<00:01:02.399> coming<00:01:02.700> to<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:02.880> input<00:01:03.589> but<00:01:04.589> what's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
hot coming to the input but what's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.050 
hot coming to the input but what's
really<00:01:05.009> interesting<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.700> center

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
really interesting is this center

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.850 
really interesting is this center
position<00:01:06.240> now<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.690> called<00:01:07.170> auto<00:01:07.380> level

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
position now is called auto level

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.670 
position now is called auto level
sensing<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.750> we've<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.320> much<00:01:10.470> power

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
sensing and we've got so much power

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.649 
sensing and we've got so much power
inside<00:01:11.190> this<00:01:11.460> device<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.090> we're<00:01:12.240> able<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> do

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
inside this device that we're able to do

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.719 
inside this device that we're able to do
an<00:01:12.750> advanced<00:01:13.200> version<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.729> essentially

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
an advanced version of that essentially

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.609 
an advanced version of that essentially
taking<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> longer<00:01:15.270> sample<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> average

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
taking a longer sample or the average

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.950 
taking a longer sample or the average
input<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.490> setting<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> input<00:01:18.720> gain

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
input and setting the input gain

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.859 
input and setting the input gain
automatically<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.909> very<00:01:21.270> excited<00:01:21.360> about<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
automatically so very excited about that

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.719 
automatically so very excited about that
the<00:01:22.710> second<00:01:23.070> thing<00:01:23.190> I<00:01:23.280> want<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.490> highlight

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the second thing I want to highlight

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.600 
the second thing I want to highlight
about<00:01:24.180> Mikey<00:01:24.630> digital<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.950> input<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
about Mikey digital is the input on the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.910 
about Mikey digital is the input on the
top<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> device<00:01:27.320> we've<00:01:28.320> had<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
top of the device we've had this in the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.010 
top of the device we've had this in the
prior<00:01:29.250> version<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.720> did<00:01:30.869> something

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
prior version but we did something

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.420 
prior version but we did something
different<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.500> time<00:01:31.560> rather<00:01:32.040> than<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.400> just

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
different this time rather than it just

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.789 
different this time rather than it just
being<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.119> line<00:01:33.330> input<00:01:33.750> we've<00:01:34.350> done<00:01:34.590> some

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
being a line input we've done some

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.109 
being a line input we've done some
interesting<00:01:34.920> things<00:01:35.310> again<00:01:35.610> because<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.030> have

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
interesting things again because we have

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.730 
interesting things again because we have
so<00:01:36.240> much<00:01:36.330> processing<00:01:36.840> power<00:01:36.990> inside<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
so much processing power inside the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.810 
so much processing power inside the
device<00:01:38.090> we<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.390> now<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:41.010> inputs<00:01:41.460> not

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
device we can now can have inputs not

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.760 
device we can now can have inputs not
just<00:01:42.090> line<00:01:42.330> we<00:01:42.510> can<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> lavalier

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
just line we can have a lavalier

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.940
