00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
alright we're pretty excited about this

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.410 
alright we're pretty excited about this
is<00:00:13.380> our<00:00:13.590> new<00:00:13.710> predator<00:00:14.190> model<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.700> adds<00:00:15.269> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
is our new predator model and adds a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.880 
is our new predator model and adds a
series<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.750> boats<00:00:16.020> we<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> shorter

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
series of boats we have a shorter

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.830 
series of boats we have a shorter
version<00:00:17.010> which<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.460> called<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> MX<00:00:18.119> as<00:00:18.330> for

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
version which is called the MX as for

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.720 
version which is called the MX as for
mixed<00:00:19.109> water<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.529> then<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> 13<00:00:20.550> foot

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
mixed water and then we have a 13 foot

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.460 
mixed water and then we have a 13 foot
model<00:00:21.029> which<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.270> behind<00:00:21.449> us<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.900> little<00:00:22.260> bit

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
model which is behind us a little bit

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.810 
model which is behind us a little bit
longer<00:00:22.740> boat<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.250> going<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> be<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> little

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
longer boat it's going to be a little

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.279 
longer boat it's going to be a little
more<00:00:23.910> efficient<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> water<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.930> paddle

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
more efficient on the water to paddle

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.929 
more efficient on the water to paddle
but<00:00:25.980> they<00:00:26.099> all<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> lot<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> same

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
but they all have a lot of the same

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.910 
but they all have a lot of the same
features<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> things<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.740> worked

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
features so one of the things we worked

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.470 
features so one of the things we worked
on<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.250> came<00:00:29.369> out<00:00:29.519> with<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> try<00:00:29.939> hull<00:00:30.179> design

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
on is we came out with a try hull design

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.120 
on is we came out with a try hull design
and<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.230> allows<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> do<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.949> it

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and what that allows you to do is it

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.340 
and what that allows you to do is it
paddles<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.270> nice<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.660> very<00:00:33.840> efficient

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
paddles really nice it's very efficient

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.930 
paddles really nice it's very efficient
but<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.800> also<00:00:35.040> wanted<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.610> have<00:00:35.700> enough

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
but we also wanted it to have enough

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.119 
but we also wanted it to have enough
stability<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.020> want<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:38.010> grab

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
stability so if you want to you can grab

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.459 
stability so if you want to you can grab
simply<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> strap<00:00:39.270> right<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.510> okay<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
simply the strap right here okay and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.540 
simply the strap right here okay and
that's<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.770> allow<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> stand<00:00:41.370> up

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that's going to allow you to stand up

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.400 
that's going to allow you to stand up
and<00:00:42.030> now<00:00:42.480> you're<00:00:42.629> standing<00:00:43.050> up<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.290> you're

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
position as well we incorporated it rod

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.319 
position as well we incorporated it rod
management<00:00:53.039> was<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.489> important<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.149> us<00:00:54.300> so

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
management was really important to us so

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.560 
management was really important to us so

biggest feature though that we put on it
is<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.590> much<00:01:28.740> even<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:29.040> fishing<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
is not so much even for fishing it's a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.420 
is not so much even for fishing it's a
seating<00:01:30.420> system<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:32.130> came<00:01:32.280> out

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
seating system that we do so we came out

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.300 
seating system that we do so we came out
with<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.610> new<00:01:33.090> seating<00:01:33.390> system<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:35.130> beauty

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
with a new seating system and the beauty

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.800 
with a new seating system and the beauty
of<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.610> was<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> has<00:01:36.390> multiple

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
of it was is that it has multiple

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.230 
of it was is that it has multiple
positions<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.189> there's<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.670> high<00:01:38.970> position

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
positions so there's a high position

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.569 
positions so there's a high position
which<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.079> was<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.259> sitting<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.829> seated<00:01:41.460> in
