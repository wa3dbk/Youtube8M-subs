 The main reservoirs can dry in

 the current rate of growth without 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.590
 consider new specifications the obvious 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.340
 that would be in the defeat of the 7th of

 authorization to raise another 116 billion 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.640
 of liters of the reserve 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.890
 the withdrawal of 25 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.350
 billion liters of volume water 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.379
 dead of the high tietê system 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.500
 we are exhausting our reserves 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.689
 Is this the best way 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.680
 Are you reaching your check limit? 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.250
 Special 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.360
 It's a shame you keep spending that 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.479
 You 're already breaking the limit. 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.659
 special or you would have to change your 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.860
 posture and start saving because the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.509
 people have to work with water as if 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.470
 it was a resource we used to use 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.930
 free when there is this resource is vital right? 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.229
 essential of human activity and life 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.540
 without it it does not exist and we need it 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.420
 water not just to bathe to kill 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.030
 for the very maintenance of life and 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.790
 without this resource would be war 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.439
 I think you've never seen people fight 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:53.220
 a bottle of water that would be a 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:56.880
 situation of water shortage but consumption 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.280
 this is a pretty black picture and the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.649
 dark why we should 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.899
 save as much as possible today because 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.399
 today's economy may be the 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.399
 tomorrow's supply guarantee
