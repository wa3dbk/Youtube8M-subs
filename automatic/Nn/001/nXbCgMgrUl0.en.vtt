00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:15.610
 yes, we'll take another question soon 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:18.340
 here in the first row this is one 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.980
 hard question because most of the time 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.609
 people invest in europe only at the 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.890
 page 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.650
 and why is it that only the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.289
 Television of Ukrainian oligarchs and 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.140
 the other internet like the woman 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.239
 from democratic green we said 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.940
 have seen this on the internet but one 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.699
 know that on the internet that in special 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.920
 prepared groups like for example 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.620
 Democratic coach him too is where 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.530
 These students have good instructions 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.409
 how does lie information conjecture 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.989
 media how do you have to tell a lie she has to 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.989
 to use wrong pictures 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.879
 she has to be Austrian for me 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.040
 also a group of Austrian 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.320
 censorship media how to choose it 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.500
 which is good because it is not good why 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.049
 use facebook and youtube 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.030
 if anyone can do a right one 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.210
 Information then find so-called 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.670
 groups simply make aleix with the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.980
 video is automatically rotated why 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.960
 no one says that that is to say they 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.020
 emblazoned on the current government, the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.610
 Factory did not choose only a lot 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.810
 from extremists and grazing and 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.120
 information war but our people a lot 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:43.390
 have more Ukrainian this was never 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:45.909
 made thank elections been used 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.540
 but the fact is that this government 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.220
 has been used by the chosen 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.430
 Members in parliament just wanted that 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.990
 I show and before and after use 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.880
 determined at home 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.500
 they are easy on it we do one 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.659
 short breaks are right back and that 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.370
 come here again how concerns us 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.330

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.330
