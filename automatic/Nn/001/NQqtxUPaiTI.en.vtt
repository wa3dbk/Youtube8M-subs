with the 34 damage model basically your

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.330 
with the 34 damage model basically your
opponents<00:01:19.470> don't<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:19.890> realize<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
fast 1.9 second reload time so you don't

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
fast 1.9 second reload time so you don't
have<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.070> time<00:01:53.310> your<00:01:53.520> reloads<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.240> perfectly

have to time your reloads to perfectly

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.840 
have to time your reloads to perfectly
and<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.710> play<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:55.979> close<00:01:56.250> quarters<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and you can play in close quarters and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.700 
and you can play in close quarters and
take<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> lot<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.509> opponents<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.350> usually

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
take out a lot of opponents and usually

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.350 
take out a lot of opponents and usually
get<00:01:58.860> your<00:01:59.009> next<00:01:59.219> reload<00:01:59.610> off<00:01:59.759> before<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
get your next reload off before the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.840 
get your next reload off before the
other<00:02:00.689> guy<00:02:00.930> comes<00:02:01.290> around<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.770> corner<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.399> you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
other guy comes around the corner so you

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.910 
other guy comes around the corner so you
can<00:02:03.030> continue<00:02:03.329> using<00:02:03.869> your<00:02:04.200> primary<00:02:04.649> rather

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
can continue using your primary rather

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.620 
can continue using your primary rather
than<00:02:05.189> having<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.670> rely<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.149> very<00:02:06.420> powerful

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
than having to rely on a very powerful

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.809 
than having to rely on a very powerful
secondary<00:02:07.500> weapon<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.069> has<00:02:08.280> some<00:02:08.459> powerful

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
secondary weapon it has some powerful

vertical recoil but virtually negligible
side-to-side<00:02:12.000> recoil<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.050> be<00:02:13.170> very

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
side-to-side recoil so you can be very

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.860

guns<00:03:15.599> in<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.930> game<00:03:15.959> it's<00:03:16.440> very<00:03:16.769> good<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.340> it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
guns in the game it's very good and it

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.120 
guns in the game it's very good and it
can<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.790> very<00:03:18.209> effective<00:03:18.630> however<00:03:19.350> its<00:03:19.829> rate

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
can be very effective however its rate

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.099 
can be very effective however its rate
of<00:03:20.160> fire<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.850> not<00:03:21.180> going<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.569> make<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.900> one<00:03:22.079> of

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
of fire is not going to make it one of

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.140 
of fire is not going to make it one of
the<00:03:22.319> higher<00:03:22.650> damaging<00:03:23.340> guns<00:03:23.549> out<00:03:23.760> there<00:03:23.790> it's

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
the higher damaging guns out there it's

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.330 
the higher damaging guns out there it's
got<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.269> very<00:03:24.540> slow<00:03:24.870> rate<00:03:25.049> of<00:03:25.079> fire<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.470> 620

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
got a very slow rate of fire of 620

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.890 
got a very slow rate of fire of 620
rounds<00:03:26.639> per<00:03:26.760> minute<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:27.480> it's<00:03:27.569> gonna<00:03:27.690> be<00:03:27.870> a

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
rounds per minute so it's gonna be a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.539 
rounds per minute so it's gonna be a
little<00:03:28.109> bit<00:03:28.350> trickier<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.920> use<00:03:29.130> if<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.430> don't

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
little bit trickier to use if you don't

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.089 
little bit trickier to use if you don't
have<00:03:29.670> pinpoint<00:03:30.450> accuracy<00:03:31.079> make<00:03:31.739> sure<00:03:31.920> you're

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
have pinpoint accuracy make sure you're

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.740 
have pinpoint accuracy make sure you're
a<00:03:32.130> marksman<00:03:32.489> before<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:32.970> pick<00:03:33.209> up<00:03:33.359> this<00:03:33.569> gun

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
a marksman before you pick up this gun

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.240 
a marksman before you pick up this gun
otherwise<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.290> might<00:03:34.440> be<00:03:34.500> having<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.980> rough

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
otherwise you might be having a rough

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.009 
otherwise you might be having a rough
time<00:03:35.310> now<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.000> tricky<00:03:36.420> thing<00:03:36.599> about<00:03:36.630> this

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
time now the tricky thing about this

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.050 
time now the tricky thing about this
weapon<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.739> has<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.859> very<00:03:37.980> slow<00:03:38.579> muzzle

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
weapon is that it has a very slow muzzle

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.729 
weapon is that it has a very slow muzzle
velocity<00:03:39.599> so<00:03:39.840> if<00:03:39.930> you're<00:03:40.079> trying<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.500> hit

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
velocity so if you're trying to hit

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.680 
velocity so if you're trying to hit
moving<00:03:41.010> targets<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.730> gotta<00:03:41.940> get<00:03:42.150> used<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.480> how

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
moving targets you gotta get used to how

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.940 
moving targets you gotta get used to how
much<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.019> have<00:03:43.139> to<00:03:43.319> lead<00:03:43.530> them<00:03:43.739> especially

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
much you have to lead them especially

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.039 
much you have to lead them especially
have<00:03:44.669> further<00:03:45.060> ranges<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:45.780> could<00:03:45.900> be<00:03:46.019> a

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
have further ranges that could be a

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.289 
have further ranges that could be a
little<00:03:46.349> bit<00:03:46.620> tricky<00:03:47.040> medium<00:03:47.609> range<00:03:47.849> no

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299

longer range targets while they're
running<00:03:56.430> side-to-side<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.690> may<00:03:57.930> require

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
running side-to-side and may require

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.229 
running side-to-side and may require
your<00:03:58.500> full<00:03:58.739> magazine<00:03:59.280> or<00:03:59.459> even<00:03:59.760> more<00:04:00.030> than<00:04:00.209> a

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
your full magazine or even more than a

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.449 
your full magazine or even more than a
full<00:04:00.480> magazine<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.109> try<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:01.650> drop<00:04:01.950> them<00:04:02.250> the

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
full magazine to try and drop them the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.270 
full magazine to try and drop them the
muzzle<00:04:02.819> velocity<00:04:02.849> is<00:04:03.359> a<00:04:03.480> pitiful<00:04:03.959> 410<00:04:04.889> meters

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
muzzle velocity is a pitiful 410 meters

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.309 
muzzle velocity is a pitiful 410 meters
per<00:04:05.489> second<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.060> it's<00:04:06.090> almost<00:04:06.510> as<00:04:06.870> slow<00:04:07.139> as

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
per second so it's almost as slow as

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.080 
per second so it's almost as slow as
some<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.620> these<00:04:07.709> suppressed<00:04:08.340> weapons<00:04:08.819> out

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
some of these suppressed weapons out

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.900 
some of these suppressed weapons out
there<00:04:09.470> compared<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.620> say<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:10.950> Augie<00:04:11.160> 3<00:04:11.700> one<00:04:11.880> of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
there compared to say the Augie 3 one of

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.909 
there compared to say the Augie 3 one of
the<00:04:12.030> faster<00:04:12.720> muzzle<00:04:13.079> velocities<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.799> the

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
the faster muzzle velocities of the

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.940 
the faster muzzle velocities of the
assault<00:04:14.250> rifles<00:04:14.549> out<00:04:14.669> there<00:04:14.880> that<00:04:15.269> shoots<00:04:15.540> at

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
assault rifles out there that shoots at

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.440 
assault rifles out there that shoots at
670<00:04:16.950> meters<00:04:17.250> per<00:04:17.459> second<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.000> it's<00:04:18.150> gonna<00:04:18.269> be

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
670 meters per second so it's gonna be

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.849 
670 meters per second so it's gonna be
much<00:04:18.599> easier<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.109> hit<00:04:19.200> your<00:04:19.380> long-range

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
much easier to hit your long-range

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.830 
much easier to hit your long-range
targets<00:04:20.190> with<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.519> compared<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.510> scar-h

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
is perfectly fine

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.340 
is perfectly fine
all<00:04:27.190> day<00:04:27.430> but<00:04:27.790> if<00:04:27.970> they're<00:04:28.180> moving<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:29.020> got<00:04:29.230> to

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
all day but if they're moving you got to

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.960 
all day but if they're moving you got to
watch<00:04:29.500> out<00:04:29.740> for<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:30.100> at<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.520> moment<00:04:30.670> I'm

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
watch out for it at the moment I'm

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.760 
watch out for it at the moment I'm
playing<00:04:31.120> restaurant<00:04:31.570> suck<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.230> dragging<00:04:32.650> in

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
playing restaurant suck and dragging in

playing restaurant suck and dragging in
the<00:04:32.920> scar-h<00:04:33.250> performed<00:04:34.000> really<00:04:34.480> well<00:04:34.660> here<00:04:35.200> it

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
the scar-h performed really well here it

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.260 
the scar-h performed really well here it
allows<00:04:35.620> me<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:35.860> pick<00:04:36.100> off<00:04:36.310> my<00:04:36.520> targets<00:04:36.940> at<00:04:37.090> long

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
allows me to pick off my targets at long

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.240 
allows me to pick off my targets at long
range<00:04:37.510> especially<00:04:37.690> since<00:04:38.290> on<00:04:38.440> rush<00:04:38.680> there's<00:04:39.190> a

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
range especially since on rush there's a

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.400 
range especially since on rush there's a
lot<00:04:39.460> of<00:04:39.580> people<00:04:39.820> camping<00:04:40.300> still<00:04:40.750> locations

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
lot of people camping still locations

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.570 
lot of people camping still locations
you<00:04:41.530> don't<00:04:41.680> have<00:04:41.770> to<00:04:41.920> worry<00:04:42.100> too<00:04:42.340> much<00:04:42.370> about

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
you don't have to worry too much about

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.000 
you don't have to worry too much about
mobile<00:04:43.330> targets<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.050> so<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.530> can<00:04:44.740> pick<00:04:44.890> them

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
mobile targets and so you can pick them

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.980 
mobile targets and so you can pick them
off<00:04:45.190> just<00:04:45.610> fine<00:04:45.880> at<00:04:46.150> range<00:04:46.450> with<00:04:46.660> this<00:04:46.780> weapon

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
off just fine at range with this weapon

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.990 
off just fine at range with this weapon
when<00:04:47.590> you<00:04:47.740> need<00:04:47.890> to<00:04:48.010> move<00:04:48.160> in<00:04:48.370> close<00:04:48.610> quarters

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
when you need to move in close quarters

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.850 
when you need to move in close quarters
you've<00:04:49.180> got<00:04:49.360> that<00:04:49.510> nice<00:04:49.810> fast<00:04:50.110> reload<00:04:50.530> if<00:04:50.710> you

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
you've got that nice fast reload if you

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.770 
you've got that nice fast reload if you
actually<00:04:51.040> want<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.520> go<00:04:51.670> for<00:04:51.970> an<00:04:52.030> M<00:04:52.210> come<00:04:52.480> armed

actually want to go for an M come armed

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.600 
actually want to go for an M come armed
now<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.140> gotta<00:04:53.500> say<00:04:53.710> even<00:04:54.070> though<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.250> rush

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
now I gotta say even though the rush

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.580 
now I gotta say even though the rush
balancing<00:04:55.210> in<00:04:55.360> bf4<00:04:55.780> is<00:04:55.900> not<00:04:56.050> particularly

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
balancing in bf4 is not particularly

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.950 
balancing in bf4 is not particularly
great<00:04:57.100> it<00:04:57.370> still<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.910> one<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.270> my<00:04:58.390> favorite

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
great it still is one of my favorite

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.750 
great it still is one of my favorite

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
out which area of your assault needs

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.910 
out which area of your assault needs

defenses<00:05:17.950> are<00:05:18.700> weakest<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.330> strongest<00:05:20.020> and

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
defenses are weakest and strongest and

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.350

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
now for the most part sunken dragon is

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.400

my<00:05:24.460> least<00:05:24.760> favorite<00:05:24.880> map<00:05:25.420> in<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.720> new<00:05:25.900> DLC<00:05:26.380> but

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
my least favorite map in the new DLC but

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.620 
my least favorite map in the new DLC but
I<00:05:26.620> do<00:05:26.740> find<00:05:27.160> it<00:05:27.340> tolerable<00:05:27.880> while<00:05:28.360> playing

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
I do find it tolerable while playing

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.060 
I do find it tolerable while playing
rush<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.170> I<00:05:29.230> think<00:05:29.410> this<00:05:29.530> is<00:05:29.680> actually<00:05:29.860> the

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
rush and I think this is actually the

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.220 
rush and I think this is actually the
first<00:05:30.310> time<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:30.820> played<00:05:31.330> it<00:05:31.510> during<00:05:31.690> rush<00:05:32.080> I

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
first time I played it during rush I

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.100 
first time I played it during rush I
like<00:05:32.500> that<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.830> actual<00:05:33.310> sea<00:05:33.910> dragon<00:05:34.420> hotel<00:05:34.840> or

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
like that the actual sea dragon hotel or

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.650 
like that the actual sea dragon hotel or
restaurant<00:05:35.530> is<00:05:36.040> the<00:05:36.520> last<00:05:36.790> place<00:05:37.090> you<00:05:37.270> get<00:05:37.450> to

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
restaurant is the last place you get to

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.480 
restaurant is the last place you get to
in<00:05:37.810> this<00:05:37.930> map<00:05:38.200> and<00:05:38.440> it<00:05:38.710> is<00:05:38.860> one<00:05:39.070> of<00:05:39.100> the<00:05:39.310> more

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
in this map and it is one of the more

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.760 
in this map and it is one of the more
challenging<00:05:39.850> em<00:05:40.330> comes<00:05:40.600> to<00:05:40.930> assault<00:05:41.410> because

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
challenging em comes to assault because

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.830 
challenging em comes to assault because
the<00:05:41.920> enemy<00:05:42.190> has<00:05:42.370> multiple<00:05:42.910> floors<00:05:43.210> of<00:05:43.450> chaos

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
the enemy has multiple floors of chaos

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.080 
the enemy has multiple floors of chaos
and<00:05:44.350> places<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:44.920> camp<00:05:45.160> and<00:05:45.460> take<00:05:45.610> you<00:05:45.790> out<00:05:45.820> as

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
and places the camp and take you out as

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.430 
and places the camp and take you out as
you<00:05:46.210> get<00:05:46.390> in<00:05:46.510> there<00:05:46.690> it<00:05:46.900> was<00:05:46.990> so<00:05:47.140> challenging

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
you get in there it was so challenging

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.680 
you get in there it was so challenging
to<00:05:47.800> actually<00:05:48.280> break<00:05:48.490> into<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:49.060> sea<00:05:49.240> dragon

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
to actually break into the sea dragon

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.210 
to actually break into the sea dragon
that<00:05:49.870> once<00:05:50.080> we<00:05:50.290> made<00:05:50.500> it<00:05:50.650> up<00:05:50.740> to<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:51.010> front

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
that once we made it up to the front

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.250 
that once we made it up to the front
steps<00:05:51.610> and<00:05:51.760> around<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.210> perimeter<00:05:52.690> rather

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
steps and around the perimeter rather

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.470 
steps and around the perimeter rather
than<00:05:53.500> pushing<00:05:53.770> in<00:05:54.040> immediately<00:05:54.730> we<00:05:55.060> kind<00:05:55.330> of

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
than pushing in immediately we kind of

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.240 
than pushing in immediately we kind of
guarded<00:05:55.870> the<00:05:55.990> perimeter<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:56.770> made<00:05:56.980> it<00:05:57.130> so

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
guarded the perimeter and made it so

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.830 
guarded the perimeter and made it so
that<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.550> defending<00:05:58.060> team<00:05:58.240> could<00:05:58.480> not<00:05:58.660> get

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
that the defending team could not get

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.990 
that the defending team could not get
out<00:05:58.960> and<00:05:59.230> reinforce<00:05:59.980> their<00:06:00.190> defensive<00:06:00.730> setup

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
out and reinforce their defensive setup

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.120 
out and reinforce their defensive setup
basically<00:06:01.930> allow<00:06:02.200> our<00:06:02.350> teammates<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.860> get<00:06:03.010> up

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
basically allow our teammates to get up

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.100 
basically allow our teammates to get up
there<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.430> the<00:06:03.460> perimeter<00:06:03.970> and<00:06:04.180> reinforce<00:06:04.900> us

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
there to the perimeter and reinforce us

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.470 
there to the perimeter and reinforce us
before<00:06:05.770> we<00:06:05.920> made<00:06:06.130> any<00:06:06.340> sort<00:06:06.550> of<00:06:06.700> serious<00:06:07.240> push

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
before we made any sort of serious push

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.930 
before we made any sort of serious push
towards<00:06:08.140> the<00:06:08.290> income<00:06:08.710> because<00:06:09.010> if<00:06:09.430> you<00:06:09.580> run<00:06:09.790> in

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
towards the income because if you run in

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.700 
towards the income because if you run in
there<00:06:10.090> and<00:06:10.150> get<00:06:10.360> some<00:06:10.570> sort<00:06:10.720> of<00:06:10.840> crazy<00:06:11.140> wild

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
there and get some sort of crazy wild

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.710 
there and get some sort of crazy wild
arm<00:06:12.010> and<00:06:12.220> then<00:06:12.640> there's<00:06:12.850> nobody<00:06:13.150> to<00:06:13.300> back<00:06:13.510> you

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
arm and then there's nobody to back you

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.720 
arm and then there's nobody to back you
up<00:06:13.750> you<00:06:13.990> get<00:06:14.140> taken<00:06:14.410> out<00:06:14.680> then<00:06:15.370> they<00:06:15.520> just

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
up you get taken out then they just
