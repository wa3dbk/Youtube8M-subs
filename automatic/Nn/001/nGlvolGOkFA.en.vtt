00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.519
 welcome to the Amsterdam Zuidas 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.919
 have been in this place in recent years 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.929
 a lot of tiles cracked 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.460
 in a world where banks like ing door 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.020
 the state government must be held 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.070
 or even completely 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.970
 nationalized 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.100
 hello abn amro hello sns reaal is there 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.010
 little room for powderiness or 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.230
 flinging with big applies here too I can 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.570
 all quite a bit less 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.530
 and now audi seems exactly the 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.530
 have the right car for it 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.800
 this is namely the audi a8 hybrid the 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.270
 most affordable hybrid limousine on the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.740
 market 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.450
 under the skin, this a8 is a stick 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.160
 more modest than you are based on 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.590
 expected 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.110
 at least the big secret of this car 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.360
 actually prefer his little secret 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.360
 namely here is a 4 cylinder 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.620
 yes, let it take it easy again 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.650
 train you 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.150
 an audi a8 with a four-cylinder 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.830
 until recently, a six-cylinder was 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.300
 actually a bit the minimum 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.310
 this top class 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.070
 but also grabbing here thanks to his heart 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.630
 around because this car will be 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.300
 actually just equipped with a 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.570
 four-cylinder two-liter turbo engine that you 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.040
 also encounter golf in a volkswagen and 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.200
 audi is not the only brand because 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.170
 jaguar has an xj with the four seline 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.910
 Mercedes-Benz has an S 250 CDI 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.520
 although a four-cylinder diesel 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.610
 but still this is a turning point in the 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.610
 history 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.540
 yes well it seems like a few days 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.180
 in this car but honestly I think 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.790
 it's hard to decide what I am now 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.560
 actually from this a8 he got my mind 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.180
 highest my heart be with all the time 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.709
 each other struggles for the pros and cons 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.890
 of this powertrain 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.050
 against each other because if you 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.640
 rational look really is little to 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.410
 notice this car 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.150
 mean to power it is all that mentions 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.020
 if you have a whole system power 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.420
 address 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.550
 lamp you can theoretically in less than 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.050
 eight counts of around popping 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.350
 you do not want a little neatly 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.970
 efficiency zone that indicates that 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.090
 you need theoretical and consumption and 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.700
 repeat one on June 15 that got used to or 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.420
 you can go against such arguments 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.420
 but difficult on 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.769
 but what is actually my problem 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.620
 well the top class car country is now 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.420
 not into a purely rational world 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.560
 a car wash after eight you want spoiled 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.420
 to become 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.550
 and although that engine combination 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.260
 pretty ingenious 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.000
 mean the electric motor is in the 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.820
 eight-speed transmission made really cool 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.739
 tidy but actually it falls in the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.370
 practice what this I really had more 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.370
 expected 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.960
 especially when starting off the first pair 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.040
 gears that are just decent 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.720
 jerky 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.890
 here the traffic lesson that well I bread 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.400
 will just demonstrate what I am 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.710
 actually mean and engine pact sat 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.850
 neat but then the first pair 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.690
 gears are just with however 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.710
 jerky 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.290
 it all just doesn't go smoothly 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.570
 enough and also if you like it more 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.010
 power is going to appeal then you notice that 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.990
 you might still look it occasionally 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.660
 must work properly hear is good 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.740
 isolated is very much roar minute 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.110
 but it is clear that you are with one 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.150
 four cylinder are on the way well you would 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.190
 can say that is in your head roland 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.690
 but frankly I don't think so 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.520
 problem with this powertrain is that 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.290
 that four-cylinder cannot fall back on 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.700
 a huge amount of torque 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.760
 as you for example feel in 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.800
 a 7 series he was from bmw or an s 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.980
 class he got from the cedars to get over the 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.630
 lxus is not to mention 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.310
 again they are all details but 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.709
 precisely in this segment is that heavy 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.140
 car is really not distinguished 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.860
 yes i still think this he is just praying 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.860
 slightly out of competition 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.430
 anyway you also need some other ones 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.470
 save planes if you with this he 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.180
 ran logos whizzing around wild look 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.980
 agree to this trunk why package 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.980
 no less than lithium-ion batteries 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.360
 175 liters saved 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.930
 and that while you are on a full load 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.700
 only 3 miles away will be fine 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.860
 few pains days later I have to 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.600
 say therefore this a8 ensures that 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.820
 your very few things fall short 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.550
 you have a beautiful how to do whole 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.910
 smooth driving all sorts of people get a change 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.430
 you go 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.780
 reels push 341 with millions 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.390
 adjustable 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.890
 so Jim still has enough comfort 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.690
 but i can't deny that you are correct 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.150
 by the engine you feel it 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.400
 save and then it will succeed 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.630
 where nowhere in a world where 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.890
 we as an annual salary of 550,000 euros 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.640
 reasonable 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.640
 dare to label
