00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.220
 I do not know why I have the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.710
 maybe stripped down because I like 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.630
 I have no idea 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:41.250

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.100
 have done something and or something 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.320

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:33.090

 both games then on sunday the 4th 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.090
 and then it starts again and then always 

00:01:55.889 --> 00:02:00.299
 the same thing 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.039
 and yes I have this project how cool 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.939
 we almost all do not know ourselves yet 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.069
 what it is but good will as a motto 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.860
 really cool 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:16.440
 yes and I did not have the round I got 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:25.440
 the lost games on the sheet because 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:26.819
 so but you can definitely 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.110
 you write in the comments what you 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.450
 you have made for the next year 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.799
 I've made a mix like me 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.019
 already said 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.630
 and somehow it is somehow full 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.870
 quickly gone so no 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.260
 I guess next what I'm doing there 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.670
 I will not go to gamescom again 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.799
 as indeed but I was just 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.060
 my day and there, michael realized that 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.980
 next many, I know now 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:01.100
 already a bigger fan base or am i 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.480
 but I'm probably there 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.190
 2013 was actually full schilliger 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.790
 year christmas was a bit 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.130
 packed what it shook so I had 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.220
 almost no one has a great mood 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.989
 on it so for example also no 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.849
 great mood on it because it was just 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.730
 no snow it was nothing two 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.049
 weeks of christmas gifts such a 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.849
 little so this year christmas 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.960
 It was not like that because it was not 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.940
 snow and even because they are so stupid 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.130
 and yes, we have New Year's Eve 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.700
 said that we are not around 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:39.120
 ballern always shoot whatever 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.380
 because well, maybe you will always be 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.450
 We already do that I think so 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.470
 make and then he shoots now time 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.820
 our neighbors and each one 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.500
 Now I can do that against many 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.000
 people then write first animal then 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.280
 of course I am only for 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.250
 all have gone too incompetent why 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.140
 approach me then i could 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.310
 I hardly have one more 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.620
 and then he comes one more 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.130
 I think but I know how cloud there 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.130
 there is another 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.390
 and yes because the stage is already the 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.050
 round went much too fast and normal 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.830
 story for girls after the other 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.049
 student better but okay 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.350
 even noticed relatively late 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:28.160
 that wanted to work that I do 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:31.560
 for deleted ok 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.330
 and definitely next year 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.380
 gamescom most likely 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.630
 maybe not maybe 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.060
 could not go completely with 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:45.240
 They were happy or with colleagues 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:48.030
 What do I know somehow this year ? 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.470
 was somehow the time like the hottest 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.020
 player out there I do not know 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.290
 Battlefield 4 cashless were beginning 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.669
 a bit shit so it can 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:02.010
 really horny games out and I am 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.230
 from 2013 also started with youtube so 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.180
 what nine months do i believe i have 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.800
 started 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.500
 it's amazing how much I do that 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.940
 have done and again to you 6000 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:26.370
 a nice new one is the last one 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:30.780
 video I already said in 2013 and 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.550
 a good slip not too deep though 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.889
 you someone most certainly looks her 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.729
 People have even been there at one 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.620
 recording with you have indeed synonymous if you 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.169
 I'll keep that to Munich anyway 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.720
 look forward to a like 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.669
 and yes you can write what he does 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.760
 New Year is waiting for you on youtube 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:53.430
 and I would implement it so and so 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.289
 What I've done so well this year 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.760
 I have the gameplay running now 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.990
 couple of seconds ago I 'm with the guy 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:09.440

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:09.440
