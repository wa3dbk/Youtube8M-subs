 excluding live actually to talk to you 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.349
 simply not the news of the 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.560
 tests of the new dlc that will come out 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:24.020

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.170
 the sierra murloc big game int 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.900
 so it will be more in a mood 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.780
 actually jungle river actually there are some 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.969
 rivers all in a jungle atmosphere 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.499
 so to furnish all this in fact I 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.469
 you make a little gameplay in fact two 

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:42.710

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.719
 did you show the five symbols five 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.649
 wide symbols that are there sanctuary 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.289
 then simply 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:52.190
 it is this dlc will add new 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.019

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.619
 and also d armor of the arts normally I 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.140
 would you put a link in the video in 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.400
 made in the description s'cusez me 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.100
 all the weapons so first of all I have 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.070
 could have two screenshots of twelve 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.630
 weapons then the weapons they are 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.430
 really not bad I looked a little bit 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.770
 styles are really beautiful I you 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.200
 would leave you even then these 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.740
 abandoned normally she went 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.930
 planned 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.580
 if I say no nonsense Norman it's 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.920
 for December 27th but it's not 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.130
 sure by cons it's not sure maybe 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.420
 worse at worst january but according to that 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.440
 I understood would come out on December 27 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.960
 between those who have seasons spend a 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.950
 you'll have it without paying and 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.140
 what else do I mean 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.130
 yes then set del seebach will add as 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.720
 usually new skins 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.000
 new gold heads I saw a head of 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.460
 the murderer who is really horrible by 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.600
 against I do not know the leash quine 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.210
 characters turned who did not put 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.680
 many screenshot the aca skin 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.330
 5 and everything to see and who is really the 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.659
 head and really weird so here's the 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.159
 fourth is also a new vehicle 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.840
 actually this vehicle down that will be a 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.340
 boat that would simply be in 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.810
 boat from what I understood this 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.360
 boat will actually do corrosive damage 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.959
 and explosive if I have no nonsense if I 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.560
 say no nonsense excuse me ah no I 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.700
 were passing by there for last symbols and 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.580
 68 what drowns i do not know if i say them 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.780
 68 skin slope or for to customize 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.450
 your boat what I wanted 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.550
 tell you dot again on this dlc then 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.700
 these normally drool dlc will add 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.620
 worries main and 12 missions 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.800
 secondary then it's really skinny 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.200
 It's from my understanding that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.160
 will have a customization pack for 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.319
 the five classes 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.830
 so I got the names in mind after 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.780
 I have included in 3 years 3 packs 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.970
 I do not know if in fact it will be necessary 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.099
 to repay by dr I do not know at all I 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.510
 do not go by cons it's a crazy there the 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.959
 first steps count his first steps 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.510
 do not take them seriously then already 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.620
 for for the cult of wide it's done 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.000
 I will give you a little tip 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.069
 fingers for if everyone knows it 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.860
 scary i do not know it will be we can say 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.269
 useful or useless tips 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.040
 well it's for actually going to trade your 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.600
 weapons between your characters in fact you 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.799
 have the little chest where there is claptrap 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.350
 in fact if you have several 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.090
 characters or when you are cum 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.340
 on a staff you and all your weapons 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.019
 legendary you have too many and that 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.359
 wanted to switch to your characters actually 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.010
 will help you in this chest you do 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.709
 that you choose a weapon here I 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.130
 take the nuc end I put it there I'm going 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.859
 make quit save your chosen sa 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.639
 note the character in question you that 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.660
 you want to continue here then 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.790
 what else did I want to say about this 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.200
 extension to wade new quests of 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.609
 new seraph weapons there will be some 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.000
 new arms seraph weapons 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.049
 unique 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.639
 there will be a lot of jacobs weapons already 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:59.299
 already a nice sniper rifle first which 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:01.430
 is called the elephant gun name became 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.650
 sniper then he's without glasses 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.060
 on the other hand, he is doing a lot of damage and I 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.549
 think he's doing you very quickly 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.000
 see it's a screenshot it's 40 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:16.310
 miles of damage plus 150% damage 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.720
 criticism that is 150% of damage 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.519
 here I think after all about 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.570
 the extension you are very fast 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.930
 three assault rifles three years ago 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.270
 I already have two three shotguns 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.940
 and moreover there is a gun 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.690
 jacobs gun who and that's a 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.160
 Toulouse I think I'll go 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.600
 leave the sasson I would put you links 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.620
 of any list that shocks me that feels this 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.470
 will surely have I put everything it's in 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.150
 done on the facebook page actually does it 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.530
 be she on the facebook page you 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.270
 put indirect allies to avoid 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.889
 seek five years normally the album 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.320
 is called the arms of the dlc of syrah 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.790
 Merlot fact that I think that's bah 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.350
 I told you everything I think I already 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.639
 I'm not broke this time so much 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.020
 is that I had to start again from a 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.229
 video I had that I was shown 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.180
 that 4.6 and after this video has yes I 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.720
 wanted to tell you that after this 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.160
 video there will be that of the bunker sitting 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.110
 on actually I would just like to do the 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.520
 editing after I think it'll be good after 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.950
 there will be plenty of other weapons still 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.510
 do I'm trying to activate a little 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.370
 still 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.260
 that's gold for borderlands 1 I do not know 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.800
 I stop I still can not do it 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.229
 to remove this problem that I do not want 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.000
 only ancient in fact windows tells me like 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.470
 what borderlands stopped working 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.289
 good maybe I did it on xbox on 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.310
 going to see am not sure that's good bah I 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.090
 let you go 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.090
