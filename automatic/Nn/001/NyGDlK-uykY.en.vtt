00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.660 
out it actually looks like it's got two
levels<00:03:11.870> pull<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.770> out<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.160> first<00:03:13.430> level

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
levels pull it out to the first level

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.070 
levels pull it out to the first level
clicks<00:03:14.300> into<00:03:14.510> place<00:03:16.540> second<00:03:17.540> level<00:03:17.810> clicks

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
clicks into place second level clicks

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.750 
clicks into place second level clicks
into<00:03:18.290> place<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.860> wouldn't<00:03:19.250> go<00:03:19.370> much<00:03:19.520> further

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
into place I wouldn't go much further

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.390 
into place I wouldn't go much further
than<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.180> second<00:03:20.570> level<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.770> pushes<00:03:22.100> back

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
than the second level and it pushes back

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.920 
than the second level and it pushes back
in<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.300> let's<00:03:23.480> see<00:03:23.690> how<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:23.930> fits<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.440> phone

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
in so let's see how it fits the phone

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.260 
in so let's see how it fits the phone
but<00:03:26.930> before<00:03:27.260> we<00:03:27.470> do<00:03:27.710> that<00:03:27.740> just<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.580> quick<00:03:29.000> look

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
but before we do that just a quick look

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.800 
but before we do that just a quick look
around<00:03:29.390> it's<00:03:29.840> got<00:03:30.020> really<00:03:31.000> slippery<00:03:32.000> seems

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
around it's got really slippery seems

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.370 
around it's got really slippery seems
like<00:03:33.110> material<00:03:33.800> here<00:03:34.100> got<00:03:34.700> Teflon<00:03:35.350> plastic

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.140 

there's<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:39.560> felt<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:40.370> talked<00:03:40.850> about

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
there's that felt that I talked about

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.820 
there's that felt that I talked about
the<00:03:41.330> other<00:03:41.420> one<00:03:41.660> this<00:03:41.810> is<00:03:41.870> actually<00:03:42.350> brand<00:03:42.620> new

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
the other one this is actually brand new

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.130 
the other one this is actually brand new
so<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.100> doesn't<00:03:43.310> have<00:03:43.400> any<00:03:43.580> desk<00:03:43.880> or<00:03:44.720> anything

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
so it doesn't have any desk or anything

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.460 
so it doesn't have any desk or anything
collected<00:03:45.650> on<00:03:45.770> it<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.990> sits<00:03:48.230> there

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
collected on it so it sits there

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.130 
collected on it so it sits there
comfortably<00:03:48.950> doesn't<00:03:49.370> get<00:03:49.490> scratched<00:03:50.140> it

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
comfortably doesn't get scratched it

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.010 
comfortably doesn't get scratched it
should<00:03:51.380> be<00:03:51.530> as<00:03:51.650> easy<00:03:51.860> as<00:03:52.130> sliding<00:03:52.490> it<00:03:52.700> in<00:03:53.320> their

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
should be as easy as sliding it in their

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.060 
should be as easy as sliding it in their

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
quick for some reason I might be

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.330

thinking<00:05:48.409> of<00:05:48.500> another<00:05:48.710> phone<00:05:49.039> that<00:05:49.219> i've

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340

android<00:05:53.990> phones<00:05:54.229> I<00:05:54.979> thought<00:05:55.729> there<00:05:55.909> was<00:05:56.029> a

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
android phones I thought there was a

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.089 
android phones I thought there was a
hole<00:05:56.330> up<00:05:56.599> here<00:05:56.630> towards<00:05:57.440> the<00:05:57.560> top<00:05:57.919> right<00:05:58.250> for<00:05:58.940> a

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
hole up here towards the top right for a

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.480 
hole up here towards the top right for a
second<00:06:01.099> noise<00:06:01.310> cancelling<00:06:01.909> but<00:06:02.599> oh<00:06:03.490> actually

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
second noise cancelling but oh actually

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.480 
second noise cancelling but oh actually
you<00:06:04.729> know<00:06:04.849> what<00:06:04.969> here<00:06:05.240> it<00:06:05.300> is<00:06:05.419> at<00:06:05.569> the<00:06:05.659> top<00:06:06.460> so<00:06:07.460> I

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
you know what here it is at the top so I

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.820 
you know what here it is at the top so I
was<00:06:07.699> mistaken<00:06:07.880> anyway<00:06:08.840> case<00:06:09.259> looks<00:06:09.529> great

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
was mistaken anyway case looks great

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.709 
was mistaken anyway case looks great
feels<00:06:10.130> great<00:06:10.340> in<00:06:10.580> the<00:06:10.610> hand<00:06:10.699> might<00:06:11.479> have<00:06:11.599> to

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 
feels great in the hand might have to

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.100 
feels great in the hand might have to
watch<00:06:11.930> it<00:06:11.960> slips<00:06:12.650> out<00:06:12.830> fairly<00:06:13.460> easily<00:06:14.110> but

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
watch it slips out fairly easily but

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.100 
watch it slips out fairly easily but
other<00:06:15.229> than<00:06:15.349> that<00:06:15.440> it<00:06:15.620> fits<00:06:15.919> really<00:06:16.219> well<00:06:16.400> and

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
other than that it fits really well and

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.719 
other than that it fits really well and
it's<00:06:18.110> available<00:06:18.229> in<00:06:18.620> black<00:06:18.949> and<00:06:19.279> white<00:06:19.490> with

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
it's available in black and white with

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.730 
it's available in black and white with
the<00:06:19.759> kickstand<00:06:20.389> as<00:06:20.690> well<00:06:20.900> as<00:06:21.050> the<00:06:21.229> normal<00:06:21.590> case

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
the kickstand as well as the normal case

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.100 
the kickstand as well as the normal case
I<00:06:21.949> also<00:06:22.069> saw<00:06:22.370> it<00:06:22.430> at<00:06:22.639> bestbuy<00:06:23.020> where<00:06:24.020> it

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
I also saw it at bestbuy where it

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.480 
I also saw it at bestbuy where it
doesn't<00:06:24.379> include<00:06:24.469> a<00:06:24.710> kickstand<00:06:25.099> I<00:06:25.129> think<00:06:25.370> it's

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
doesn't include a kickstand I think it's

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.570 
doesn't include a kickstand I think it's
five<00:06:25.639> dollars<00:06:25.940> cheaper<00:06:27.219> don't<00:06:28.219> quote<00:06:28.370> me<00:06:28.550> on

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
five dollars cheaper don't quote me on

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.230 
five dollars cheaper don't quote me on
that<00:06:28.699> but<00:06:29.029> it<00:06:29.509> should<00:06:29.690> just<00:06:29.870> you<00:06:30.379> know<00:06:31.210> be<00:06:32.210> a

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.920 
that but it should just you know be a
regular<00:06:32.779> case<00:06:33.139> like<00:06:33.469> the<00:06:33.740> old<00:06:33.889> evo<00:06:34.219> cases<00:06:34.930> so

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930
