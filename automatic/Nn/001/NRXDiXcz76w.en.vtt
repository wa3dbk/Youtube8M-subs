00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.480
 to lottery 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:13.380

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.439
 our president that the shells bring 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.150
 message to her 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.310
 this is the worst political moment for the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.669
 President Dilma Chief since his 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.460
 election in 2010 dilma has only 10 per 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.649
 approval rate and this is the most 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.840
 of his career in the palace of the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.120
 plateau the former president lula criticized 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.360
 today his own party said that the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.469
 pt lost the dream and only thinks about positions and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.610
 elections 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.710
 I think the pt lost a bit of tone 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.410
 and we only think of people who are not 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.550
 think the job there, we just think you know 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.550
 be elected 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.770
 help me 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.790
 the summer I decided to do something 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.860
 different 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.710
 President Dilma Facing Fall 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.680
 record of popularity tries to change the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.070
 speech and a positive agenda 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.070
 we have the maria cassava're stinking 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.940
 and here we are as manioc wins 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:38.340
 with corn 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:42.760
 and a childhood of cassava 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.370
 and certainly we will have a series of 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.400
 other essential products 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.400
 for the development of the whole 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.210
 civilization over the centuries 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.830
 So, today, I have sunshine, I'm greeting you. 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.770
 the cassava 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.190
 I think it's one of the biggest 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.190
 Brazil 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.700
 For me, this ball is a symbol of our 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.700
 evolution 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:21.019
 when we created a ball of these knots 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:24.219
 we become wise men or 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.219
 wise women 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.829
 Wow
