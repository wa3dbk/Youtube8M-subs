00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.980
 or the new one that I bring you a new 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.769
 makeup tutorial and I'm following 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.900
 the line of videos made of looks 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.920
 basic as is a baggy ones more 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.410
 browns a harem a pine forest opens a 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.450
 torn light of this type if there is any 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.250
 I have climbed the channel or I will upload it 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.650
 Well, I'm going to add it in 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.260
 annotations in the each information for 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.449
 what do you want if you are interested 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 facts all all these places are 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.039
 made with the naked basis palette 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.200
 only because how are the basics and 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.790
 everyone is neutral because I think that these 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.970
 colors are quite easy 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.950
 find in other brands and good that 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.690
 that if you see that it is very strong what 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.719
 that is as eye contour 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.030
 simply because you avoid them suppress and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.809
 you put on mascara directly others but 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.879
 I do my black outline I do not see myself 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.800
 I'm very weird I hope you liked it 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.800
 and that you stay to see the step by step 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.109
 you will see how quick and easy it is 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.820
 this look we started as always with a 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:22.069
 shadow prebase I will use the one of 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.780
 the encrym later with the paint pot 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.450
 pinter li I will match the tone of the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.000
 eyelid any shade in cream or if 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.060
 you want even a shadow that equal the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.090
 skin tone all over the fixed eyelid 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.859
 and mobile to make it easier later 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.310
 work the shadows on top and also 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:42.369
 we like the tone of the eyelid 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.680
 and now we use the naked shadows or 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.329
 of the easy naked palette and we're going to 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.640
 create us the basin this is what 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.200
 will help that later 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.360
 it is not easier to blur the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.610
 darker brown and so we would have the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.100
 degraded done already after we illuminate and 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.070
 others but always usually to me 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.350
 like to start these lights in this way 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.600
 and now with the fine shadow let's go 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.479
 covering the entire mobile eyelid already 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.399
 little touches as you see is super 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.680
 easy to integrate it already with what we have 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.980
 applied as there are umbrellas under it is 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.049
 very easy to blur it already with the basin 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.840
 blurred that we have done before 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.060
 we are simply placing the color to 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.680
 touch to make it intense and 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.590
 later with the same brush 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.480
 blur what we used before because what 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.030
 let's finish integrating but now 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.400
 you will see that it is practically alone and 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.129
 very easy 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.620
 and now with a brown pencil this is the 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.569
 tiramisu number 13 of sephora de los 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.280
 water proof you can use a black if 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.829
 you want it more intense that's always going to 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.110
 everyone's taste we are going to delineate very 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.780
 close to what is the reverse tab 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.400
 for later we are going to blur it 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.140
 then it is better to do it to the eyelashes 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.659
 finite so that we do not have a line 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.450
 very thick and then with the crave shadows 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.849
 and playing with the farc, we're going to 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.939
 go blurring with a brush type goal and 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.859
 Today we're going to do that to everyone's taste 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.109
 intense that you want the blurred 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.049
 who wants it we can also help 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:12.870
 of the brush to blur from before to 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.790
 finish blurring it or also like 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.519
 I did to give more intensity with the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.769
 shadow I created from eyelashes I went through with 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.650
 a lip brush very finite taste 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.260
 Then we passed the brown eyeliner 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.599
 also by the lower lashes and 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.819
 we went through the same process we blew it 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.560
 with the shadow find avoid a bit the 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.510
 I thought because it can get very dark 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.639
 this area so more than anything 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.630
 would do with the thin and the bottom and 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.480
 then I would delineate the water 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.420
 in brown or black what you have 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.550
 preferred even meat color and now only 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.680
 would curl lashes and apply two 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.170
 good mascara layers to make more 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.110
 intense and prettier eyes that is a 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.180
 fundamental part and that I was leaving 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.090
 forgetting with the watch shadows I'm going to 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.430
 finish blurring the banana 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.110
 let's say or the blur and with the less 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.810
 I will give a point of light the most 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.660
 high eyebrows and it would be our 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.390
 light of the finished as you see is 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.550
 very soft and intensified a little 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.860
 the tabs and now I'm going to tell you that 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.690
 I'm going to put the rest of the basic face 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.000
 of makeup to use the rule with 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.730
 beige colors in the tone at 180 sanz 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.310
 beige and I'm going to apply it with the sponge 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.440
 without latex perfect blender I do it from 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.410
 this way because I applied the product 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.230
 much better more homogeneous less quantity 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.350
 just the right amount because this base 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.210
 for example, it leaves me if I wear a lot 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.030
 amount mind is a very effect 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.740
 powdered and dry since I have the skin 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.300
 pulling dry and this long base 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.370
 duration so 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.400
 in my case of this base I like more 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.290
 apply it with this type of sponges 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.270
 as a corrector to use this 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.310
 corrector or illuminator only to give 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.910
 some small corrections in the area 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.400
 the eyecup and then with a synthetic brush 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.919
 of hair more or less loose because I'm going to 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.770
 go extending and applying so that 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:10.280
 be more natural I will do the 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.530
 contour with the blush in the stop tone 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.449
 of nix the truth is that I am 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.610
 starting to use since I'm not so 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.130
 brunette and I'm really enjoying the 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.550
 result is very natural I like it more 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.800
 I really like the benefit ball 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.789
 how is it left, there is not even 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.689
 dusty neither nor superimposed on the 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.389
 skin so I love it 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:36.219
 of illuminator I will use these of 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.610
 essen of the edition collection 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:43.119
 limited breaking dawn that are very 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.339
 natural golden brown the truth is that 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:46.869
 They are the longest but the truth 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:49.739
 is that it has finished is very natural and 

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:52.689
 very nice and you do not notice it is very bright 

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:55.749
 and of rouge I will use about two 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:57.699
 many with doradito brightness to 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:01.119
 go play with the illuminator and this is 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:03.699
 the ars laser and as you can see there is a 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:05.729
 a very beautiful orange toasted tone and 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.069
 very natural 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.319
 and we have already passed the lips I will give two 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:13.550
 options the first one is going to be the mate my 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:17.430
 part and pink of slip to give there a 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.729
 quite intense effect remains precious to 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.949
 me for my taste I really like how 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.680
 are smoked and so soft still 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.559
 a little bit more powerful and the second 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.409
 option is the laser and nemak which is a 

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:34.319
 lip gloss that remains as very watery 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:36.960
 yes very natural also for all 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.669
 days and it's beautiful the truth is that 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.380
 one of my favorite lipsticks but not 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.510
 be the ones that last me the longest 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.030
 Well nothing until here you have all the 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.280
 fucking of another basic with the anei that is 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.710
 It goes like this I hope you liked it 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.230
 you already know you have social networks 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.880
 here below links we can in the 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.650
 next month videos of huge and 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.650
