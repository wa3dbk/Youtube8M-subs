00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.369 
back down here plugs on and out my stays
on<00:02:06.119> our<00:02:06.240> kind<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.509> snug<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.910> but<00:02:08.910> anyway

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.479 
on our kind of snug so but anyway
articulation<00:02:10.379> with<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.590> guy<00:02:10.739> got<00:02:11.220> some<00:02:11.370> up

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
articulation with this guy got some up

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.040 
articulation with this guy got some up
and<00:02:11.640> down<00:02:11.760> shoulder

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and down shoulder

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.260 
and down shoulder
and<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.800> spin<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.370> well<00:02:14.670> his<00:02:14.820> elbows<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.210> a

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
and the spin is well his elbows on a

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.670 
and the spin is well his elbows on a
ball<00:02:15.480> joint<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.930> does<00:02:16.080> spin<00:02:16.320> around<00:02:16.440> and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
ball joint so it does spin around and

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.050 
ball joint so it does spin around and
move<00:02:16.830> up<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.070> down<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:17.340> all<00:02:17.430> kinds<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.820> stuff

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
move up and down on all kinds of stuff

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.320 
move up and down on all kinds of stuff
and<00:02:18.360> his<00:02:19.260> wrist<00:02:19.770> doesn't<00:02:19.950> bend<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.210> out

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
and his wrist doesn't bend in and out

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.990 
and his wrist doesn't bend in and out
but<00:02:21.630> that's<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.440> because<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:23.520> has<00:02:23.760> to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
but that's just because it has to

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.910 
but that's just because it has to
because<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.510> transformation<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.770> these

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
because of the transformation and these

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.950 
because of the transformation and these
little<00:02:26.130> wings<00:02:26.280> back<00:02:26.490> here<00:02:26.730> do<00:02:26.940> move<00:02:27.630> up<00:02:27.810> and

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
little wings back here do move up and

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.600 
little wings back here do move up and
down<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.470> can<00:02:28.620> fatten<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.130> course<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:29.520> I

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
down so you can fatten of course like I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.640 
down so you can fatten of course like I
said<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.940> head<00:02:30.350> does<00:02:31.350> spin<00:02:32.120> either<00:02:33.120> way<00:02:33.270> and

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
said the head does spin either way and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.120 
said the head does spin either way and
up<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.800> down<00:02:34.890> because<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.730> spring<00:02:36.030> action

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
up and down because of the spring action

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.980 
up and down because of the spring action
he's<00:02:38.130> got<00:02:38.370> nothing<00:02:38.880> at<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.090> hip<00:02:39.270> here<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.720> no

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
he's got nothing at the hip here so no

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.170 
he's got nothing at the hip here so no
big<00:02:40.170> deal<00:02:40.350> ball<00:02:40.860> joints<00:02:41.220> at<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.370> waist<00:02:41.610> or<00:02:41.910> the

big deal ball joints at the waist or the
ball<00:02:42.420> joint<00:02:42.690> did<00:02:43.170> hips<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.190> swivel<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.300> bend

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
ball joint did hips and swivel and bend

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.840 
ball joint did hips and swivel and bend
at<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.750> knee<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.320> can<00:02:46.500> do<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.070> he's

you got to push down here slide in to
those<00:04:50.500> two<00:04:50.800> pegs<00:04:51.310> right<00:04:51.580> here<00:04:51.790> on<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:51.970> back

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180

understood<00:04:57.790> all<00:04:57.910> that<00:04:57.940> because<00:04:58.210> I<00:04:58.420> probably

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
understood all that because I probably

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.550 
understood all that because I probably
didn't<00:04:59.080> really<00:04:59.260> understand<00:04:59.770> myself<00:04:59.950> either

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
didn't really understand myself either

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.830 
didn't really understand myself either

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.490 
in there's a little hole right there peg
this<00:05:44.919> on<00:05:45.600> and<00:05:47.220> we'll<00:05:48.220> get<00:05:48.280> this<00:05:48.340> lined<00:05:48.730> up<00:05:49.500> and

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
this on and we'll get this lined up and

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.060 
this on and we'll get this lined up and
then<00:05:50.650> push<00:05:50.860> that<00:05:51.280> back<00:05:51.580> down<00:05:52.560> line<00:05:53.560> up<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.830> end

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
then push that back down line up the end

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.250 
then push that back down line up the end
of<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:54.280> barrel<00:05:54.490> inside<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.180> pig<00:05:55.780> there's<00:05:56.110> like

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
of the barrel inside a pig there's like

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.080 
of the barrel inside a pig there's like
an<00:05:56.440> inside<00:05:56.830> slot<00:05:57.220> right<00:05:57.370> there<00:05:57.550> by<00:05:57.700> my<00:05:57.730> thumb

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
an inside slot right there by my thumb

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.330 
an inside slot right there by my thumb
and<00:05:58.690> then<00:05:59.020> there's<00:05:59.200> some<00:05:59.350> tabs<00:05:59.830> right<00:06:00.040> there

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
and then there's some tabs right there

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.470 
and then there's some tabs right there
let's<00:06:00.910> line<00:06:01.240> them<00:06:01.270> up<00:06:01.510> with<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:01.900> legs<00:06:02.140> and

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
let's line them up with the legs and

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.440 
let's line them up with the legs and
everything<00:06:04.480> should<00:06:04.960> peg<00:06:05.290> right<00:06:05.590> together

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
everything should peg right together

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.510 
everything should peg right together
just<00:06:07.450> like<00:06:07.660> that<00:06:07.990> make<00:06:08.710> sure<00:06:08.740> the<00:06:09.040> feet<00:06:09.220> are<00:06:09.370> up

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
just like that make sure the feet are up

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.070 
just like that make sure the feet are up
and<00:06:10.450> there<00:06:11.080> you<00:06:11.230> go<00:06:12.180> so<00:06:13.180> it<00:06:13.330> just<00:06:13.570> depends<00:06:13.900> on

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
and there you go so it just depends on

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.100 
and there you go so it just depends on
how<00:06:14.320> you<00:06:14.380> want<00:06:14.560> oops<00:06:15.460> let<00:06:15.820> me<00:06:15.850> get<00:06:16.090> this<00:06:16.240> right
