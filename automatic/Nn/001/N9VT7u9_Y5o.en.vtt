00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
finger down here on the fourth string

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.400 
finger down here on the fourth string
and<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.290> pluck<00:02:28.560> four<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.280> one<00:02:29.430> two<00:02:31.070> three<00:02:33.410> four

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
and I pluck four and one two three four

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.110 
and I pluck four and one two three four
and<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:34.710> two<00:02:34.980> three

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.869 

and<00:02:38.480> that's<00:02:38.599> how<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.780> goes<00:02:39.050> so<00:02:39.640> all<00:02:40.640> together

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
and that's how that goes so all together

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.220 
and that's how that goes so all together
it<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.989> first<00:02:42.200> looks<00:02:42.680> like<00:02:42.830> this<00:02:43.780> -<00:02:44.780> one<00:02:44.959> zero

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
it the first looks like this - one zero

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.059 
it the first looks like this - one zero
zero<00:02:45.459> four<00:02:46.459> two<00:02:46.489> zero<00:02:46.760> zero<00:02:47.440> six<00:02:48.440> four<00:02:48.830> zero

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
zero four two zero zero six four zero

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:57.240 
zero four two zero zero six four zero
zero<00:02:50.410> seven<00:02:51.410> six<00:02:51.920> zero<00:02:52.129> zero<00:02:52.790> two

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.840 

so<00:02:58.180> that's<00:02:58.960> if<00:02:59.740> you<00:02:59.890> can<00:02:59.920> stretch<00:03:00.430> your<00:03:00.460> finger

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
so that's if you can stretch your finger

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.940 
so that's if you can stretch your finger
up<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.240> that<00:03:01.600> spot<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.140> sometimes<00:03:02.530> have<00:03:02.860> trouble

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
up to that spot I sometimes have trouble

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.520 
up to that spot I sometimes have trouble
with<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.520> comes<00:03:03.700> out<00:03:03.820> wonky<00:03:04.300> but<00:03:04.530> you

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
with it and it comes out wonky but you

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.930 
with it and it comes out wonky but you
know<00:03:05.620> c'est<00:03:05.920> la<00:03:05.980> vie

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
know c'est la vie

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.560 
know c'est la vie
so<00:03:07.630> that's<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.870> verse<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.860> chorus<00:03:09.480> starts<00:03:10.480> in

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
so that's the verse the chorus starts in

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.150 
so that's the verse the chorus starts in
the<00:03:10.630> same<00:03:10.720> position<00:03:11.400> to100<00:03:13.290> goes<00:03:14.290> up<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.710> four

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
the same position to100 goes up to four

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.730 
the same position to100 goes up to four
two<00:03:15.400> zero<00:03:15.430> zero<00:03:16.590> six<00:03:17.590> four<00:03:17.980> zero<00:03:18.010> zero<00:03:18.430> and

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
two zero zero six four zero zero and

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.640 
two zero zero six four zero zero and
then<00:03:21.240> and<00:03:23.190> then<00:03:24.190> from<00:03:24.370> there<00:03:24.520> six<00:03:25.440> seven<00:03:26.440> six

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
then and then from there six seven six

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.830 
then and then from there six seven six
zero<00:03:26.800> zero<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:29.410> let<00:03:30.010> me<00:03:30.310> tell<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.240> I<00:03:31.300> love

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.650 
them two one zero zero there so I did
four<00:03:47.620> there<00:03:47.770> let's<00:03:48.130> just<00:03:48.280> go<00:03:48.400> up<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.640> 4200

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.589 

for<00:03:52.380> if<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.860> should<00:03:53.340> become<00:03:53.790> stranger

know that it would mean more than so

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.199 
know that it would mean more than so
we're<00:04:00.010> in<00:04:00.099> that<00:04:00.159> same<00:04:00.400> position<00:04:00.489> six<00:04:00.999> four
