00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
million but to be accurate i think they

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.019 
million but to be accurate i think they
they're<00:00:18.029> more<00:00:18.420> closer<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.140> 19<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.520> half<00:00:20.550> to

they're more closer to 19 and a half to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.160 
they're more closer to 19 and a half to
20<00:00:21.390> million<00:00:21.630> give<00:00:22.289> or<00:00:22.320> take<00:00:22.590> they<00:00:23.580> say<00:00:24.170> 11.2

twelve and a half you know VG child's be
a<00:00:34.200> little<00:00:34.440> off<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.370> closest

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
a little off but this is the closest

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.110 
a little off but this is the closest
that<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.210> gonna<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> actual<00:00:38.120> numbers

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
that we gonna get to the actual numbers

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.270 
that we gonna get to the actual numbers
but<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.870> ain't<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> real<00:00:40.649> reason<00:00:41.070> why<00:00:41.190> I'm

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
but this ain't the real reason why I'm

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.799 
but this ain't the real reason why I'm
making<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.610> video<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.270> mean<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
making this video I mean this is the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.850 
making this video I mean this is the
real<00:00:42.989> reason<00:00:43.020> why<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.379> making<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.649> video

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
real reason why I'm making this video

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860 
real reason why I'm making this video
but<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.550> not<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.760> only<00:00:44.910> reason<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> was

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
but this is not the only reason it was

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.750 
but this is not the only reason it was
something<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.200> caught<00:00:46.469> my<00:00:46.649> eye<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.520> think

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
something that caught my eye and I think

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.060 
something that caught my eye and I think
that<00:00:47.910> all<00:00:48.120> y'all<00:00:48.450> should<00:00:48.780> arm<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that all y'all should arm see this and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.880 
that all y'all should arm see this and
play<00:00:50.250> play<00:00:50.879> um<00:00:51.180> close<00:00:51.570> attention<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
play play um close attention to this and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
play play um close attention to this and
I<00:00:52.980> think<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> lot<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> X<00:00:53.820> twice<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.449> trying

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
I think that a lot of X twice was trying

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.229 
I think that a lot of X twice was trying
to<00:00:54.960> discourage<00:00:55.440> us<00:00:55.800> by<00:00:56.250> throwing<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.850> oh<00:00:57.030> my
