today's<00:00:05.490> lesson<00:00:05.879> is<00:00:05.940> going<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.270> be<00:00:06.450> about

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
today's lesson is going to be about

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.500 
today's lesson is going to be about
different<00:00:07.140> types<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.500> numbers<00:00:08.179> now<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.240> first

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
different types of numbers now the first

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.020 
different types of numbers now the first
type<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.690> number<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:11.309> natural<00:00:11.790> or<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
type of number is the natural or the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.550 
type of number is the natural or the
counting<00:00:12.809> number<00:00:17.420> now<00:00:18.420> like<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.380> name

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
counting number now like the name

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.640 
counting number now like the name
counting<00:00:20.100> suggests<00:00:20.789> these<00:00:21.630> are<00:00:22.170> numbers<00:00:22.470> that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
counting suggests these are numbers that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:32.269 
counting suggests these are numbers that
you<00:00:22.859> count<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:24.019> 1<00:00:25.039> 2<00:00:26.150> 3<00:00:27.349> 4<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:31.279> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
you count with 1 2 3 4 and so on the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.860 
you count with 1 2 3 4 and so on the
next<00:00:32.430> type<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.850> number<00:00:33.180> would<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> whole

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
next type of number would be the whole

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.920 
next type of number would be the whole
number<00:00:36.920> now<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> whole<00:00:38.190> number<00:00:38.719> contains<00:00:39.719> all

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
number now the whole number contains all

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
number now the whole number contains all
the<00:00:40.110> counting<00:00:40.469> numbers<00:00:40.800> plus<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.850> also

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the counting numbers plus it also

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.510 
the counting numbers plus it also
contains<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.809> numbers<00:00:43.110> 0<00:00:45.950> now<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.100> wanted

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
contains the numbers 0 now if we wanted

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.369 
contains the numbers 0 now if we wanted
to<00:00:47.700> look<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.360> counting<00:00:48.870> numbers<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
to look at the counting numbers in the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.970 
to look at the counting numbers in the
whole<00:00:49.559> numbers<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.640> diagram<00:00:51.829> we<00:00:52.829> could

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
whole numbers in a diagram we could

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.810 
whole numbers in a diagram we could
simply<00:00:53.309> draw<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> circle<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:55.820> say

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
simply draw a circle here and say

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.180 
simply draw a circle here and say
everything<00:00:57.449> inside<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.899> circle<00:00:58.079> are<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
everything inside this circle are the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.090 
everything inside this circle are the
counting<00:00:59.640> numbers<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.680> then<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> little<00:01:01.980> bit

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
counting numbers and then a little bit

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.910 
counting numbers and then a little bit
bigger<00:01:02.309> circle<00:01:02.760> right<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:07.470> everything

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
bigger circle right here and everything

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
bigger circle right here and everything
inside<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.430> circle<00:01:08.610> would<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> whole

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
inside that circle would be the whole

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.270 
inside that circle would be the whole
numbers<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.350> little<00:01:10.590> bigger<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
numbers it's a little bigger because it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.030 
numbers it's a little bigger because it
contains<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.820> 0<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:16.229> next<00:01:16.500> important<00:01:16.890> type

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
contains the 0 the next important type

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
contains the 0 the next important type
of<00:01:17.070> number<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:19.170> integer<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:25.140> integers

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
of number is the integer the integers

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.920 
of number is the integer the integers
contain<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.520> whole<00:01:26.729> numbers<00:01:27.229> 0<00:01:28.229> 1<00:01:28.729> 2

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
contain all of the whole numbers 0 1 2

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.010 
contain all of the whole numbers 0 1 2
and<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.400> in<00:01:32.400> addition<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.840> whole

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and so on in addition to the whole

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.100 
and so on in addition to the whole
numbers<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.710> integers<00:01:35.100> also<00:01:35.369> include<00:01:36.110> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
2 and so on going back to the diagram we

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.010 
2 and so on going back to the diagram we
can<00:01:46.200> simply<00:01:46.530> draw<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:47.070> circle<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.090> closing<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
can simply draw a circle and closing the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.749 
can simply draw a circle and closing the
two<00:01:49.170> previous<00:01:49.590> circles<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.579> drew<00:01:52.759> and

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
two previous circles that I drew and

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.609 
two previous circles that I drew and
I'll<00:01:53.909> put<00:01:54.090> an<00:01:54.180> eye<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:55.079> showing<00:01:55.439> that

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
I'll put an eye in there showing that

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.130 
I'll put an eye in there showing that
anything<00:01:56.219> inside<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.759> circle<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.360> an

the<00:03:00.470> rational<00:03:00.860> numbers<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.250> wrote<00:03:01.430> here<00:03:01.730> are

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
the rational numbers I wrote here are

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.120 
the rational numbers I wrote here are
fractions<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:05.299> answer<00:03:05.630> is<00:03:05.810> any<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:07.010> the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
fractions and the answer is any of the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.030 
fractions and the answer is any of the
integers<00:03:07.489> can<00:03:07.819> be<00:03:07.880> written<00:03:08.180> as<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:09.530> ratio<00:03:09.560> of

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
integers can be written as a ratio of

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.390 
integers can be written as a ratio of
two<00:03:10.340> numbers<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:12.200> reason<00:03:12.530> why<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:12.709> anything

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
two numbers the reason why is anything

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.210 
two numbers the reason why is anything
for<00:03:13.670> instance<00:03:14.000> negative<00:03:14.510> two<00:03:14.980> divided<00:03:15.980> by<00:03:16.100> one

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
for instance negative two divided by one

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.199 
for instance negative two divided by one
is<00:03:17.090> simply<00:03:17.769> negative<00:03:18.769> two<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.940> can<00:03:20.090> do

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
is simply negative two and you can do

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.319 
is simply negative two and you can do
this<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.569> any<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.049> integers<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:22.150> by<00:03:23.150> doing

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
this to any of the integers and by doing

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.780 
this to any of the integers and by doing
this<00:03:23.600> you're<00:03:23.810> writing<00:03:24.109> it<00:03:24.230> as<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.410> ratio<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.130> two

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
this you're writing it as a ratio of two

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.509 
this you're writing it as a ratio of two
integers<00:03:26.510> therefore<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.799> rational<00:03:28.250> numbers

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
integers therefore the rational numbers

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.640 
integers therefore the rational numbers
contain<00:03:28.940> all<00:03:29.180> integers<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:33.200> next<00:03:33.470> type<00:03:33.620> of

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
contain all integers the next type of

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.890 
contain all integers the next type of
number<00:03:34.160> is<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:35.359> irrational<00:03:36.019> number<00:03:40.540> now<00:03:41.540> kind

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
number is the irrational number now kind

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.170 
number is the irrational number now kind
of<00:03:41.930> like<00:03:42.109> the<00:03:42.230> name<00:03:42.380> suggests<00:03:43.180> irrational

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
of like the name suggests irrational

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.009 
of like the name suggests irrational
basically<00:03:44.989> means<00:03:45.200> not<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:46.209> ratio<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.540> cannot<00:03:47.810> be

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
basically means not a ratio it cannot be

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.120 
basically means not a ratio it cannot be
written<00:03:48.230> as<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.829> ratio<00:03:48.859> of<00:03:49.609> two<00:03:50.269> integers<00:03:51.130> so

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
written as a ratio of two integers so

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.199 
written as a ratio of two integers so
some<00:03:52.340> examples<00:03:52.819> of<00:03:53.000> irrational<00:03:53.690> numbers<00:03:53.780> are

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
some examples of irrational numbers are

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:02.620 
some examples of irrational numbers are
pi<00:03:56.650> which<00:03:57.650> is<00:03:57.680> 3.14<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.780> so<00:04:00.530> on<00:04:01.630> another

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
and E has the value of 2.718 and so on

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.460

little<00:05:55.400> bit<00:05:55.550> off<00:05:56.230> my<00:05:57.230> spaces<00:05:57.710> aren't<00:05:57.920> exactly

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
little bit off my spaces aren't exactly

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.340 
little bit off my spaces aren't exactly
spaced<00:05:58.580> evenly<00:05:58.790> like<00:05:59.120> they<00:05:59.300> should<00:05:59.450> be<00:05:59.600> but

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
spaced evenly like they should be but

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.570 
spaced evenly like they should be but
hopefully<00:06:00.740> you<00:06:00.860> can<00:06:01.010> forgive<00:06:01.280> me

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
hopefully you can forgive me

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.980 
hopefully you can forgive me
and<00:06:03.400> basically<00:06:04.400> all<00:06:04.760> of<00:06:04.820> the<00:06:05.360> irrational

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
and basically all of the irrational

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.320 
and basically all of the irrational
numbers<00:06:06.320> and<00:06:06.530> the<00:06:07.310> rational<00:06:07.760> numbers<00:06:08.060> and<00:06:08.210> all

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
numbers and the rational numbers and all

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.870 
numbers and the rational numbers and all
of<00:06:08.450> its<00:06:08.570> contents<00:06:09.080> can<00:06:09.800> all<00:06:10.040> be<00:06:10.340> written<00:06:10.580> on

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
of its contents can all be written on

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.010 
of its contents can all be written on
the<00:06:11.780> real<00:06:11.960> number<00:06:12.350> line<00:06:12.380> so<00:06:13.300> for<00:06:14.300> instance<00:06:14.660> pi

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
the real number line so for instance pi

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.550 
the real number line so for instance pi
would<00:06:15.920> go<00:06:16.100> right<00:06:16.580> about<00:06:16.760> here<00:06:17.320> 3.14<00:06:18.320> because

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
would go right about here 3.14 because

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.940 
would go right about here 3.14 because
this<00:06:18.680> is<00:06:18.800> 4<00:06:19.150> that's<00:06:20.150> 3<00:06:20.420> that's<00:06:20.660> 4<00:06:20.950> 3.14

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
this is 4 that's 3 that's 4 3.14

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.890 
this is 4 that's 3 that's 4 3.14
somewhere<00:06:22.430> in<00:06:22.550> between<00:06:22.780> that<00:06:23.780> would

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
somewhere in between that would

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.010 
somewhere in between that would
represent<00:06:24.020> pi<00:06:24.500> of<00:06:25.100> course<00:06:25.730> 1<00:06:26.540> is<00:06:26.660> here

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
represent pi of course 1 is here

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.750 
represent pi of course 1 is here
negative<00:06:27.560> 2<00:06:27.680> is<00:06:27.830> here<00:06:28.040> those<00:06:28.370> are<00:06:28.400> fairly

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
negative 2 is here those are fairly

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.150 
negative 2 is here those are fairly
obvious<00:06:28.880> any<00:06:29.780> of<00:06:30.290> these<00:06:30.440> any<00:06:30.860> of<00:06:31.010> these

obvious any of these any of these

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.700 
obvious any of these any of these
numbers<00:06:31.430> right<00:06:31.790> here

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
numbers right here

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.000 
numbers right here
can<00:06:33.280> be<00:06:33.430> represented<00:06:34.300> as<00:06:34.419> a<00:06:34.479> point<00:06:34.870> on<00:06:35.050> a

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
can be represented as a point on a

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.920 
can be represented as a point on a
number<00:06:36.550> line<00:06:38.040> so<00:06:39.040> that<00:06:39.389> brings<00:06:40.389> us<00:06:40.660> to<00:06:40.840> the

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
number line so that brings us to the

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.260 
number line so that brings us to the
last<00:06:41.139> type<00:06:41.410> of<00:06:41.440> number<00:06:41.919> and<00:06:42.520> really<00:06:43.090> all<00:06:43.240> I

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
last type of number and really all I

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.520 
last type of number and really all I
want<00:06:43.540> to<00:06:43.630> say<00:06:43.780> about<00:06:43.870> the<00:06:44.080> last<00:06:44.260> type<00:06:44.500> of

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
want to say about the last type of

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.650 
want to say about the last type of
number<00:06:44.889> that<00:06:45.220> number<00:06:45.400> is<00:06:45.729> an<00:06:46.000> imaginary

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
number that number is an imaginary

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:53.430 
number that number is an imaginary
number<00:06:51.090> now<00:06:52.090> I'll<00:06:52.389> go<00:06:52.720> ahead<00:06:52.750> and<00:06:53.110> cover<00:06:53.260> the

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
number now I'll go ahead and cover the

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.129 
number now I'll go ahead and cover the
imaginary<00:06:54.190> numbers<00:06:54.550> a<00:06:54.580> little<00:06:55.000> bit<00:06:55.120> more<00:06:55.360> in<00:06:55.660> a

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:56.139 
imaginary numbers a little bit more in a

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:59.189 
imaginary numbers a little bit more in a
later<00:06:56.590> tutorial<00:06:56.970> but<00:06:57.970> right<00:06:58.449> now<00:06:58.630> all<00:06:58.660> I<00:06:58.930> want

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 
later tutorial but right now all I want

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.280 
later tutorial but right now all I want
you<00:06:59.260> to<00:06:59.410> know<00:06:59.530> about<00:06:59.680> imaginary<00:07:00.400> numbers<00:07:00.790> is

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
you to know about imaginary numbers is

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:10.710 
you to know about imaginary numbers is
that<00:07:02.290> they<00:07:02.500> do<00:07:02.860> not<00:07:05.789> they<00:07:06.789> do<00:07:06.850> not<00:07:06.940> go<00:07:07.389> on<00:07:09.720> the

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
that they do not they do not go on the

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:22.170 
that they do not they do not go on the
real<00:07:10.900> number<00:07:11.199> line<00:07:19.350> that<00:07:20.350> is<00:07:20.880> this<00:07:21.880> number

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180 
real number line that is this number

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:28.529 
real number line that is this number
line<00:07:22.360> that<00:07:22.389> I<00:07:22.630> drew<00:07:22.810> earlier<00:07:27.360> there's<00:07:28.360> no

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:28.539 
line that I drew earlier there's no

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:30.210 
line that I drew earlier there's no
point<00:07:28.840> on<00:07:28.990> this<00:07:29.139> number<00:07:29.380> line<00:07:29.500> that<00:07:29.949> can

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:30.220 
point on this number line that can

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.650 
point on this number line that can
represent<00:07:30.510> an<00:07:31.510> imaginary<00:07:32.050> number<00:07:32.470> and<00:07:33.660> I'll

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660 
represent an imaginary number and I'll

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.420 
represent an imaginary number and I'll
get<00:07:34.840> into<00:07:35.110> imaginary<00:07:35.530> numbers<00:07:35.860> later<00:07:36.070> like<00:07:36.310> I

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.430 
get into imaginary numbers later like I

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.850 
get into imaginary numbers later like I
said<00:07:36.669> so<00:07:37.000> basically<00:07:37.930> that's<00:07:38.500> all<00:07:38.650> I<00:07:38.680> really

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:38.860 
said so basically that's all I really

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.140 
said so basically that's all I really
want<00:07:39.099> you<00:07:39.190> to<00:07:39.250> know<00:07:39.340> about<00:07:39.580> imaginary<00:07:40.030> numbers

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.150 
want you to know about imaginary numbers

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.810 
want you to know about imaginary numbers
right<00:07:40.539> now<00:07:40.570> is<00:07:40.900> they<00:07:41.889> are<00:07:42.280> not<00:07:42.460> real<00:07:42.639> numbers

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:42.820 
right now is they are not real numbers

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.930 
right now is they are not real numbers
that<00:07:43.030> can<00:07:43.450> be<00:07:43.479> represented<00:07:43.930> on<00:07:44.620> a<00:07:45.400> number<00:07:45.760> line

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:45.940 
that can be represented on a number line

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.710 
that can be represented on a number line
that<00:07:46.320> will<00:07:47.320> be<00:07:47.410> the<00:07:47.530> end<00:07:47.710> of<00:07:47.830> this<00:07:47.979> tutorial<00:07:48.720> I
