00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
sometimes it'll just cover up the audio

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.730 
sometimes it'll just cover up the audio
port<00:02:34.510> not<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.960> big<00:02:35.140> deal<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.440> just<00:02:35.560> kind<00:02:35.710> of

that<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.600> covering<00:02:37.960> up<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.230> it's<00:02:38.350> covering

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
that it is covering up is it's covering

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.620 
that it is covering up is it's covering
your<00:02:38.680> microphone<00:02:39.130> port<00:02:39.640> right<00:02:39.820> there<00:02:39.880> okay<00:02:40.390> so

your microphone port right there okay so
that's<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.810> little<00:02:40.870> unfortunate<00:02:41.230> over<00:02:41.890> here<00:02:42.010> on

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
that's a little unfortunate over here on

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.130 
that's a little unfortunate over here on
the<00:02:42.130> side<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.700> volume<00:02:42.940> rocker<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.390> fine<00:02:43.660> but

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
the side the volume rocker is fine but

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.800 
the side the volume rocker is fine but
it's<00:02:44.890> blocking<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.640> rotation<00:02:46.300> lock<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.720> know

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
it's blocking the rotation lock you know

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.840 
it's blocking the rotation lock you know
so<00:02:46.960> you<00:02:47.130> can't<00:02:48.130> get<00:02:48.250> access<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.700> rotation

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
so you can't get access to the rotation

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.120 
so you can't get access to the rotation
lock<00:02:49.240> really<00:02:49.570> unless<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:51.040> know<00:02:51.100> really

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
lock really unless you you know really

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.890 
lock really unless you you know really
do<00:02:51.580> something<00:02:51.790> interesting<00:02:52.090> this<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.570> one<00:02:52.840> of

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
do something interesting this is one of

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.230 
do something interesting this is one of
the<00:02:52.960> ones<00:02:53.050> it's<00:02:53.290> not<00:02:53.500> it's<00:02:54.400> not<00:02:54.550> elastic<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.210> it

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
the ones it's not it's not elastic so it

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.460 
the ones it's not it's not elastic so it
doesn't<00:02:55.510> budge<00:02:55.720> too<00:02:55.990> much<00:02:56.140> so<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.320> have<00:02:56.410> to

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
doesn't budge too much so you have to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.220 
doesn't budge too much so you have to
really<00:02:56.670> pry<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:57.880> there<00:02:58.090> too<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.330> get<00:02:58.930> at<00:02:59.110> it

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
really pry in there too to get at it

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.360 
really pry in there too to get at it
okay<00:02:59.290> this<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.650> worst<00:02:59.890> part<00:03:00.100> right<00:03:00.340> here

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
okay this is the worst part right here

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.340 
okay this is the worst part right here
and<00:03:01.300> trying<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.540> access<00:03:01.900> something<00:03:02.080> on<00:03:02.290> the

and trying to access something on the

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.410 
and trying to access something on the
bottom<00:03:02.650> you're<00:03:03.550> fine<00:03:03.790> with<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.270> dock

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
bottom you're fine with the dock

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.120 
bottom you're fine with the dock
connector<00:03:04.810> right<00:03:05.140> here<00:03:05.200> you're<00:03:05.680> blocking<00:03:06.040> one

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
connector right here you're blocking one

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.590 
connector right here you're blocking one
of<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.280> speakers<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.150> again<00:03:07.330> it's<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.450> little

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
of the speakers so again it's a little

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.880 
of the speakers so again it's a little
unfortunate<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:08.080> lose<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.290> little<00:03:08.500> bit<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.710> the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
unfortunate you lose a little bit of the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.090 
unfortunate you lose a little bit of the
audio<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.610> know<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:10.690> know<00:03:11.100> amplification

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
audio you know you know amplification

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.280 
audio you know you know amplification
from<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.490> ipad<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:12.880> guess<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.570> won't<00:03:14.110> get

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
from the ipad I guess it won't get

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.900 
from the ipad I guess it won't get
everything<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.710> you<00:03:14.800> kid<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.250> ipad<00:03:15.670> so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
everything that you kid I the ipad so

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.640 
everything that you kid I the ipad so
you<00:03:16.450> know<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.570> don't<00:03:16.960> really<00:03:17.110> have<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.380> solution

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
you know I don't really have a solution

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.260 
you know I don't really have a solution
you<00:03:18.100> know<00:03:18.160> maybe<00:03:18.280> except<00:03:18.700> maybe<00:03:18.820> make<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.120> a

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
you know maybe except maybe make it a

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.490 
you know maybe except maybe make it a
little<00:03:19.390> bit<00:03:19.540> bigger<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:20.110> know<00:03:20.230> make<00:03:20.410> the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
little bit bigger you know make the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.780 
little bit bigger you know make the
straps<00:03:20.770> a<00:03:20.920> little<00:03:21.100> bit<00:03:21.190> bigger<00:03:21.370> but<00:03:21.520> then<00:03:21.670> you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
straps a little bit bigger but then you

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.100 
straps a little bit bigger but then you
might<00:03:21.940> be<00:03:21.970> blocking<00:03:22.240> you<00:03:22.630> know<00:03:22.720> part<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:22.990> the

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
might be blocking you know part of the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.100 
might be blocking you know part of the
screen<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:23.740> you<00:03:24.610> know<00:03:25.390> just<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:25.690> whole<00:03:25.810> strap

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
screen so you know just this whole strap

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.199 
screen so you know just this whole strap
idea<00:03:26.500> doesn't<00:03:26.770> seem<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.190> play<00:03:27.370> perfectly<00:03:27.880> for

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
idea doesn't seem to play perfectly for

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.630 
idea doesn't seem to play perfectly for
the<00:03:28.330> ipad<00:03:28.720> but<00:03:28.930> other<00:03:29.860> than<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.459> know<00:03:30.490> it

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
the ipad but other than that you know it

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.920 
the ipad but other than that you know it
seems<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:30.940> work<00:03:31.060> okay<00:03:31.300> the<00:03:31.420> big<00:03:31.570> one<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.780> think

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
seems to work okay the big one I think

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.680 
seems to work okay the big one I think
is<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.200> rotation<00:03:32.680> lock<00:03:32.800> so<00:03:33.100> just<00:03:33.310> know<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:34.600> know

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
is a rotation lock so just know you know

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.400 
is a rotation lock so just know you know
you're<00:03:34.810> probably<00:03:34.959> going<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.230> have<00:03:35.320> the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
you're probably going to have the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.650 
you're probably going to have the
rotation<00:03:35.800> lock<00:03:35.920> set<00:03:36.190> how<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.400> want<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.820> before

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
rotation lock set how you want it before

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.580 
rotation lock set how you want it before
you<00:03:37.720> put<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:37.959> there<00:03:38.050> is<00:03:38.200> probably<00:03:38.440> what<00:03:38.560> I

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
you put in there is probably what I

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.540 
you put in there is probably what I
would<00:03:38.650> say<00:03:38.860> okay<00:03:39.070> that's<00:03:39.160> probably<00:03:39.340> the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
would say okay that's probably the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.130 
would say okay that's probably the
biggest<00:03:39.640> knock<00:03:39.970> on<00:03:40.270> this<00:03:40.480> case<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.840> would<00:03:40.990> say

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
biggest knock on this case I would say

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.140 
biggest knock on this case I would say
is<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.100> placement<00:03:42.520> of<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.790> holding

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
is the the placement of the holding

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.300 
is the the placement of the holding
straps<00:03:43.510> something<00:03:44.350> else<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.560> looked<00:03:44.800> at<00:03:44.950> was

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750
