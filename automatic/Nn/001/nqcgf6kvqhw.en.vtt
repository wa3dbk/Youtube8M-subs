a little bit about body confidence

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.290

different person but maybe that you

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.560 
different person but maybe that you
relate<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.530> yourself<00:04:23.860> differently<00:04:24.610> maybe<00:04:25.390> you

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
relate to yourself differently maybe you

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.029 
relate to yourself differently maybe you
care<00:04:25.840> about<00:04:26.050> yourself<00:04:26.169> a<00:04:26.590> little<00:04:26.680> bit<00:04:26.979> more

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
care about yourself a little bit more

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:27.780 
care about yourself a little bit more
enough

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
enough

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.950 
enough
like<00:04:28.290> wake<00:04:29.290> up<00:04:29.440> early<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:29.860> go<00:04:30.010> to<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.190> gym<00:04:30.460> or

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
like wake up early and go to the gym or

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.630 
like wake up early and go to the gym or
eat<00:04:31.960> an<00:04:32.170> extra<00:04:32.320> serving<00:04:32.920> of<00:04:33.010> like<00:04:33.220> leafy

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640

greens<00:04:33.940> or<00:04:34.300> something<00:04:35.040> but<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.070> think<00:04:36.460> that<00:04:36.640> the

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
greens or something but I think that the

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.850 
greens or something but I think that the
mind<00:04:37.240> shift<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.960> happens<00:04:38.320> with<00:04:38.470> weight<00:04:38.710> loss

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
mind shift that happens with weight loss

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.390 
mind shift that happens with weight loss
is<00:04:39.280> incredibly<00:04:40.120> scary<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:40.930> if<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:41.590> continue

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
is incredibly scary and if you continue

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.630 
is incredibly scary and if you continue
to<00:04:42.430> think<00:04:42.580> about<00:04:43.350> like<00:04:44.350> your<00:04:44.620> plus<00:04:44.890> I<00:04:45.070> self<00:04:45.400> is
