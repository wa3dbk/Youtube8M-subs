I<00:05:32.060> learned<00:05:32.510> actually<00:05:33.139> better<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.680> use<00:05:33.860> it<00:05:33.889> more

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
I learned actually better to use it more

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.150 
I learned actually better to use it more
flexibility<00:05:35.270> about<00:05:35.450> sound<00:05:35.960> and<00:05:36.380> sometimes

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
flexibility about sound and sometimes

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.280 
flexibility about sound and sometimes

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560

if<00:06:14.910> I'm<00:06:15.150> good<00:06:15.389> inform<00:06:15.810> if<00:06:16.080> I<00:06:16.169> really<00:06:16.500> practice

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
if I'm good inform if I really practice

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.550 
if I'm good inform if I really practice
very<00:06:17.639> well<00:06:17.880> then<00:06:18.150> of<00:06:18.750> course<00:06:19.020> it<00:06:19.139> depends<00:06:19.410> on

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
very well then of course it depends on

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.490 
very well then of course it depends on
me<00:06:19.680> as<00:06:19.800> well<00:06:19.979> not<00:06:20.190> just<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:20.430> violin<00:06:21.110> then<00:06:22.110> my

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
me as well not just the violin then my

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.520 
me as well not just the violin then my
violin<00:06:22.800> sounds<00:06:23.130> actually<00:06:23.340> quite<00:06:24.289> quite<00:06:25.289> big

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
violin sounds actually quite quite big

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.820 
violin sounds actually quite quite big
and<00:06:25.710> quite<00:06:25.860> rich<00:06:26.100> and<00:06:26.430> very<00:06:27.330> dark<00:06:27.600> I'm<00:06:28.500> still

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
and quite rich and very dark I'm still

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.129 
and quite rich and very dark I'm still
finding<00:06:29.100> new<00:06:29.280> colors<00:06:29.789> actually<00:06:30.330> it's<00:06:30.900> you

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
finding new colors actually it's you

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.689 
finding new colors actually it's you
know<00:06:31.259> it's<00:06:31.470> it's<00:06:31.680> to<00:06:31.949> play<00:06:32.130> an<00:06:32.190> instrument<00:06:32.610> so

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 
know it's it's to play an instrument so

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.450 
know it's it's to play an instrument so
as<00:06:32.910> a<00:06:32.940> philosophy<00:06:33.479> the<00:06:33.930> better<00:06:34.110> the

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
as a philosophy the better the

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.730 
as a philosophy the better the
instruments<00:06:35.509> the<00:06:36.509> more<00:06:36.780> you<00:06:37.020> can<00:06:37.229> find<00:06:37.500> and

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
instruments the more you can find and

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.499 
instruments the more you can find and
the<00:06:37.800> more<00:06:37.979> time<00:06:38.280> you<00:06:38.520> need<00:06:38.669> to<00:06:38.940> find<00:06:39.180> something

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:39.509 
the more time you need to find something

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.680 
the more time you need to find something
and<00:06:39.990> then<00:06:40.979> the<00:06:41.130> bow<00:06:41.310> is<00:06:41.520> also<00:06:41.880> plays<00:06:42.330> a<00:06:42.360> role

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
and then the bow is also plays a role

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.050 
and then the bow is also plays a role
and<00:06:43.169> strings<00:06:43.889> and<00:06:44.280> actually<00:06:44.820> it's<00:06:44.910> quite

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
and strings and actually it's quite

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:56.480 
and strings and actually it's quite
quite<00:06:45.630> something<00:06:45.810> to<00:06:46.050> think<00:06:46.169> about<00:06:55.220> the<00:06:56.220> more

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
quite something to think about the more
