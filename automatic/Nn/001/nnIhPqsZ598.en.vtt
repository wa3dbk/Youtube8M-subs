00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.170
 any company from any country 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.640
 cms we can send them either from 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.200
 any computer or also from 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.000
 any mobile device whether it's a 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.349
 tablet or some smartphone no matter 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.730
 the operating system with which it is 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.080
 account and well then this procedure 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.150
 it's pretty simple and pretty fast 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.830
 all we have to do is enter 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.060
 to any of my two web pages the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.559
 which in the description of the video 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.239
 You can find the links so that 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.559
 can access them in case 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.160
 enter my page with the domain 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.660
 dot com 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.519
 we go to the bottom of the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.050
 page and how can you see in this part 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.850
 we will have this tool that is with the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.829
 which we can send the sms so 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.840
 unlimited and in case they enter my 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.190
 web page with the domain dot net only 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.170
 simply pass the mouse cursor 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.090
 over this area or touching it in case 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.039
 we are on a mobile device and how 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.329
 see that box will be displayed so 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.039
 what we are going to do is fill in the 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.360
 information that asks us the name we are going 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.360
 to put the name that we want 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.620
 the mobile number we are going to put the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.270
 number to which we will send the sms without 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 include any kind of long code 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.630
 distance or something similar 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.100
 we simply put the number of the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.480
 mobile as we would to send it 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.220
 as not annually at once 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.470
 we select the country to which it belongs 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.970
 the number to which we are going to send the sms and 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.980
 then we selected the company to the 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.930
 which number belongs now in the 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.650
 next box we write the message 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.270
 what we want to send 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.130
 and finally in the box 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.480
 work let's introduce the code that 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.720
 it appears in the bottom part and what 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.720
 we send 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.000
 now as you can see we see a 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.490
 counter in which we will have to 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.170
 wait 60 seconds these 60 seconds do not 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.300
 it means that the message will take 60 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.920
 seconds to be sent this means 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.260
 we'll have to wait 60 seconds 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.490
 to be able to send the following sms on 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 time in which messages are sent 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.580
 It may vary although usually 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.580
 take between 20 or 30 seconds 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.560
 and as you see here, we have just arrived 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.360
 the message 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.579
 with the name we had placed that 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.890
 which was from CE and the message which 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.380
 it said is more than proof so I hope it 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.729
