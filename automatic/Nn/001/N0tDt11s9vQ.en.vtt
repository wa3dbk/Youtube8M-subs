00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
okay so I got this case when fiber

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.969 
okay so I got this case when fiber
anillo<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> plain<00:01:16.560> pink

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
anillo it's just like a plain pink

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.840 
anillo it's just like a plain pink
bumper<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.880> transparent<00:01:18.570> back<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:20.610> what

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
bumper with the transparent back so what

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.060 
bumper with the transparent back so what
I<00:01:20.880> did<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.210> basically<00:01:21.630> apply<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:22.470> Gorilla

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
I did is basically apply some Gorilla

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.340 
I did is basically apply some Gorilla
Glue<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> transparent<00:01:24.240> back<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.780> then<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
Glue to the transparent back and then I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
Glue to the transparent back and then I
just<00:01:25.560> added<00:01:25.799> my<00:01:25.920> studs<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.549> top<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
just added my studs on top of it and I

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.690 
just added my studs on top of it and I
kept<00:01:27.780> doing<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.710> went<00:01:28.950> making<00:01:29.460> sure

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
kept doing this as I went making sure

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.340 
kept doing this as I went making sure
like<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.060> beds<00:01:30.299> were<00:01:30.450> close<00:01:30.720> right<00:01:30.900> next<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
like this beds were close right next to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.319 
like this beds were close right next to
each<00:01:31.409> other<00:01:31.790> it's<00:01:32.790> pretty<00:01:33.030> self-explanatory

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
each other it's pretty self-explanatory

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:41.520 
each other it's pretty self-explanatory
you<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.170> keep<00:01:34.380> doing<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.670> way<00:01:35.790> down

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.230 

so<00:01:42.530> basically<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:43.039> kept<00:01:43.399> doing<00:01:43.579> this<00:01:43.820> technique

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
so basically I kept doing this technique

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.209 
so basically I kept doing this technique
all<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.600> way<00:01:44.719> down<00:01:44.929> I<00:01:45.170> went<00:01:45.469> for<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.770> diagonal

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
all the way down I went for a diagonal

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.190 
all the way down I went for a diagonal
shape<00:01:46.700> basically<00:01:47.509> you<00:01:47.780> could<00:01:47.899> just<00:01:48.049> follow

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
shape basically you could just follow

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.020 
shape basically you could just follow
the<00:01:48.320> pattern<00:01:48.500> here<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:49.189> can<00:01:49.340> also<00:01:49.520> use<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.759> hot

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
the pattern here you can also use a hot

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.389 
the pattern here you can also use a hot
glue<00:01:50.060> gun<00:01:50.299> or<00:01:50.719> another<00:01:51.500> type<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.799> craft<00:01:52.159> glue

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
glue gun or another type of craft glue

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.399 
glue gun or another type of craft glue
don't<00:01:52.700> use<00:01:52.880> regular<00:01:53.390> glue<00:01:53.420> if<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.960> wanted<00:01:54.229> to

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
don't use regular glue if you wanted to

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.300 
don't use regular glue if you wanted to
say

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.250 

everyone

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.690 

so<00:02:06.260> I<00:02:06.290> didn't<00:02:06.590> want<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.770> go<00:02:06.920> out<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.310> go<00:02:07.490> by

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
so I didn't want to go out and go by

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.090 
so I didn't want to go out and go by
modpodge<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.630> made<00:02:08.840> some<00:02:09.080> homemade<00:02:09.440> mock

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
modpodge so I made some homemade mock

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.520 
modpodge so I made some homemade mock
cogs<00:02:10.369> mixing<00:02:11.120> equal<00:02:11.300> amounts<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:12.020> glue<00:02:12.319> and

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
cogs mixing equal amounts of glue and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.620 
cogs mixing equal amounts of glue and
water<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:13.190> basically<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:14.510> like

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
water and basically this is just like

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.449 
water and basically this is just like

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
it's gonna stay to the case I saw one of

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.350 
it's gonna stay to the case I saw one of
these<00:03:00.410> cases<00:03:00.739> online<00:03:01.100> like<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:01.880> could<00:03:02.060> set<00:03:02.239> in

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
these cases online like you could set in

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.540 
these cases online like you could set in
a<00:03:02.450> picture<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.290> customize<00:03:03.800> your<00:03:03.950> own<00:03:04.010> case<00:03:04.280> and

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
it was fifty dollars so I decided I

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.559
