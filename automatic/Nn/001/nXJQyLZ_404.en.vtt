00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.670
 okay then now we go with our 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.700
 step number 5 in which we already have to 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.599
 pick up our cross and call it cross 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.570
 perfect 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.430
 which is the perfect cross the perfect cross 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.650
 means that then we already have the 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.890
 yellow house made then these 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.100
 colors are already aligned, notice that 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.550
 here is yellow green yellow red 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.829
 yellow blue yellow orange instead 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.570
 here the colors are here so much 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.059
 here is yellow red yellow green 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.550
 blue yellow then to solve 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.140
 this we are only going to use then 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.489
 technically it would be an algorithm 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.649
 only that we're going to do it at 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.679
 right and we will go backwards between 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.870
 bahamas where the first case or what 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.960
 first thing to do is always 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.499
 take our cross and adjust it with a 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.140
 color with an edge color and that 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.780
 rest is wrong explain me for example 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.280
 here we are going to align it with blue as 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.190
 blue nose and we have it with blue 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.200
 so we have to analyze what is 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.000
 this the only color that feeds the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.620
 blue yellow breed 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.659
 ok is that it has to look good 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.789
 yellow green yellow orange 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.560
 and the red coincided already means that 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.909
 with this color you can not then 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.409
 we have to do it that matches the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.520
 another for example with the orange we are going to 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.319
 see here do not coincide do not coincide in the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.319
 only have to match 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.640
 one color matching one list in 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.850
 which should be coinciding in this 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.189
 case there is 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.140
 then after we have 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.729
 rotated and that we match a single color 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.460
 What we do is take the list 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.759
 correct that you look at us and 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.229
 we look at the tab on the left is and 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.119
 let's analyze the following of what 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.540
 color is this card this card is from 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.250
 red color and let's look at where the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.299
 we have to carry this tab you have to 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.789
 leave for here then if the record is 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.770
 goes up because that's her way because 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.170
 it's red and here to the red center over 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.090
 this tab is going to go to houses and is 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.300
 blue you have to go here and it's 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.340
 green pretend here then when 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.319
 this happens that this file goes to here 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.459
 the algorithm that we are going to do is this 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.930
 it's very easy to turn on and go up 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.930
 what would be the prima 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.190
 Her cousin 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.530
 a bonus 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:45.910
 cl premium and q2 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.370
 and he is and see that then he was already 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.319
 all the colors of our cross 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.439
 they coincided repeatedly 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.629
 we have aligned only this and the 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.310
 tab has to go to next that's 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.499
 when the one that has to go towards 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.280
 up when it is from here 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:09.079
 left then it would be here we look and 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.200
 we go down we turn again we go up and two 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:15.610
 times and we go down and we stay is the 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.630
 first case the second case would be 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.440
 when we have the color aligned 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.180
 and the card here goes to the other side to the 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.350
 right in this case the tab was going 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.910
 here up 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.980
 now the national file for there but 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.480
 I was pricking him here because it's blue 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.390
 then the solution and qureshi for the 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.340
 blue center is when that tab goes here 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.110
 zone here is a case and when it goes 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.670
 for home because I already explained the 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.620
 previous in the case when the tab if 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.300
 It is going for here when the crisis lets 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.370
 here is the same case right now 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.250
 that we have to do it because 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.260
 I first explained otherwise go up 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.760
 true now as this is what we are going to 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.760
 to do is this 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.310
 and repress 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.799
 and u2 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.170
 and we go down and we can see that in 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.810
 followed and all the edges the judgments 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.890
 they only exist because they are the cases in 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.560
 which the tab 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.600
 this is going for the right one goes for 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.600
 up then I will repeat again 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.470
 at home we look align a single color 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.660
 and this tab is going to the other side it 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.340
 to right in this way when it's 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:33.000
 for here then we have to make them 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:38.710
 here achilles we turn down we turn 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.180
 we go up ere and pu 2 and repress 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.960
 and we are the only two algorithms 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.880
 that they exist but there is one last 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.430
 possibility that can happen is 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.620
 that there is a case in which we are aligned 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.420
 two colors the blue and the green to line 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.060
 then that does not work 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.120
 and if I look at it for example with red 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.830
 then the red and the orange line is 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.740
 what to do in this case when I line up 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.240
 the opposite is done any of the 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.190
 two algorithms that we did right now that 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.210
 for example I will do the any of 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:18.070
 you can both be here here we go down 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:20.650
 we turn up and turn twice and 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.650
 we come back and now we 're always going to turn 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.620
 the layer until I match a single 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.080
 color example here I match the blue and 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.720
 let's look here they do not match 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.550
 they coincide full matching this face 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.380
 this case I do it and we are going to analyze 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.360
 minds here I have lines we look at the 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.240
 pitcher left this tab for a 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.069
 I wish it goes for here 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.930
 has green since the center of the 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.880
 green has green and cities for 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.370
 CarriÃ³ is how it goes here we do the 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:55.190
 algorithm that we upload here here we go down 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:58.310
 we look up and twice 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.220
 and here we have then already engaged 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.540
 the chips were the perfect cross 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.940
 that would be the corresponding thing for that 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.970
 only this step there is nothing else for 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.150
 here then we will continue 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.370
 soon with step number 6 and 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.990
 then step number 7 to finish 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.210
 to assemble our entire cube of 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.320
 rubik 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.320
