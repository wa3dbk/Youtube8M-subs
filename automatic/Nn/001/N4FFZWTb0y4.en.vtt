on<00:01:21.310> this<00:01:21.490> one

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
on this one

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.230 
on this one
this<00:01:23.620> piece<00:01:24.010> here<00:01:24.280> being<00:01:24.580> about<00:01:24.790> four<00:01:25.030> or<00:01:25.090> five

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.280 
this piece here being about four or five
inches<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.870> then<00:01:26.560> then<00:01:26.980> you<00:01:27.010> can<00:01:27.250> see<00:01:28.290> we

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
inches and then then you can see we

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.960 
inches and then then you can see we
rated<00:01:29.830> here<00:01:30.250> on<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.240> outside<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.860> also<00:01:33.310> put<00:01:33.820> in

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
rated here on the outside I also put in

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.070 
rated here on the outside I also put in
about<00:01:34.360> an<00:01:34.480> inch<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.840> half

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
about an inch and a half

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.540 
about an inch and a half
violet<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.820> reason<00:01:37.120> for<00:01:37.150> that<00:01:37.420> is<00:01:37.990> is

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
violet and the reason for that is is

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.290 
violet and the reason for that is is
just<00:01:39.550> to<00:01:39.700> give<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.240> more<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:41.140> look<00:01:41.350> of

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
just to give this more of a look of

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.940 
just to give this more of a look of
thickness<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:44.220> also<00:01:46.290> later<00:01:47.290> on<00:01:47.380> it's<00:01:47.740> going

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
thickness and also later on it's going

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.210 
thickness and also later on it's going
to<00:01:48.010> be<00:01:48.130> more<00:01:48.490> like<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.850> mold<00:01:49.630> for<00:01:50.530> another<00:01:50.950> piece

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
to be more like a mold for another piece

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.810 
to be more like a mold for another piece
that<00:01:51.250> I'm<00:01:52.000> reading

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
that I'm reading

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.480 
that I'm reading
there<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:54.190> so<00:01:56.680> after<00:01:57.680> cutting<00:01:57.890> out<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.220> vinyl

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
there and so after cutting out the vinyl

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.300 
there and so after cutting out the vinyl
I<00:02:00.910> obviously<00:02:01.910> I<00:02:02.060> stapled<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:02.930> right<00:02:03.920> down<00:02:04.040> on

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
I obviously I stapled it right down on

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.359 
I obviously I stapled it right down on
the<00:02:04.370> ink<00:02:04.729> underneath<00:02:05.440> both<00:02:06.440> places<00:02:06.740> all<00:02:07.220> the

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
the ink underneath both places all the

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.770 
the ink underneath both places all the
way<00:02:07.490> around<00:02:10.120> now<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.150> used<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.660> one-inch<00:02:12.020> foam<00:02:12.500> so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
looks like so I'll start off doing this

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.050 
looks like so I'll start off doing this
because<00:04:45.310> it's<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.790> least<00:04:45.970> messy<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:48.060> then

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
because it's the least messy and then

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.210 
because it's the least messy and then
from<00:04:49.300> there<00:04:49.510> I'll<00:04:49.750> jump<00:04:50.050> on<00:04:50.260> cut<00:04:50.950> out<00:04:51.070> my

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
from there I'll jump on cut out my

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.410 
from there I'll jump on cut out my
plywood<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:52.800> my<00:04:53.800> my<00:04:54.400> holes<00:04:54.730> for<00:04:55.060> my<00:04:55.180> cup

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
plywood and my my holes for my cup

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.550 
plywood and my my holes for my cup
holders<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.110> from<00:04:56.980> there<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.520> can<00:04:57.700> stain<00:04:58.240> it

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
holders and from there I can stain it

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.190 
holders and from there I can stain it
over<00:04:59.560> overnight<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.640> that's<00:05:00.990> that's<00:05:01.990> the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
over overnight and that's that's the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.190 
over overnight and that's that's the
first<00:05:02.470> step<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:03.220> then<00:05:04.120> later<00:05:04.390> on<00:05:04.510> what<00:05:05.110> i'll

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200
