game<00:00:29.970> development<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.990> new<00:00:31.140> era<00:00:31.349> where<00:00:32.309> we

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
game development in the new era where we

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.780 
game development in the new era where we
can<00:00:32.969> prioritize<00:00:33.809> things<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.860> way<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.640> makes

sense to dig to the new you know the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
sense to dig to the new you know the
developing<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.640> public<00:00:38.940> essentially<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
developing in public essentially you

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.590 
developing in public essentially you
know<00:00:39.660> where<00:00:39.840> your<00:00:40.969> it's<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> nice<00:00:42.149> phrase<00:00:42.450> I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
know where your it's a nice phrase I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720 
know where your it's a nice phrase I
like<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.899> develop<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.379> public<00:00:43.829> yes<00:00:44.370> it's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
like that develop in public yes it's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.299 
like that develop in public yes it's
funny<00:00:44.969> we're<00:00:45.180> sort<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.379> way<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.620> sort

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
funny we're sort of it's the way we sort

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.889 
funny we're sort of it's the way we sort
of<00:00:47.399> we're<00:00:47.850> developing<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.329> game<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.629> shipping

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
of we're developing a game and shipping

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.350 
of we're developing a game and shipping
it<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.710> develop<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:50.670> some

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it as we develop it so there some

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.000 
it as we develop it so there some
interesting<00:00:51.840> different<00:00:52.350> priorities<00:00:52.800> there

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
interesting different priorities there

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.549 
interesting different priorities there
and<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.850> obviously<00:00:54.510> you're<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> go

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
and so it obviously you're going to go

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.779 
and so it obviously you're going to go
through<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> whole<00:00:55.949> thing<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.280> pick<00:00:56.460> out<00:00:56.610> one

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
through the whole thing but pick out one

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
through the whole thing but pick out one
of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> things<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.539> highlighted<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.649> in

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
of the things that you highlighted it in

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.299 
of the things that you highlighted it in
your<00:00:59.039> talk<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.989> new<00:01:01.199> trend<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.710> new<00:01:01.829> thing<00:01:02.190> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
your talk is a new trend or new thing to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.880 
your talk is a new trend or new thing to
think<00:01:02.489> about<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:03.080> think<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.229> trying<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.710> make

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
think about I think it's trying to make

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.219 
think about I think it's trying to make
sure<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.460> put<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.479> very<00:01:06.600> focused

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
sure what you put out is is very focused

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.080 
sure what you put out is is very focused
and<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> communicate<00:01:08.369> very<00:01:08.640> strongly

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and that you communicate very strongly

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.510 
and that you communicate very strongly
with<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.229> people<00:01:10.530> who<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:10.979> engaging<00:01:11.340> with

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
with the people who are engaging with

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.830 
with the people who are engaging with
the<00:01:11.610> game<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.090> two-way<00:01:12.240> process<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the game but it's a two-way process that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.969 
the game but it's a two-way process that
they<00:01:12.960> feel<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.350> they're<00:01:13.500> being<00:01:13.619> listened<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
they feel that they're being listened to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.010 
they feel that they're being listened to
as<00:01:14.070> well<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.490> certainly<00:01:15.299> from<00:01:15.450> from<00:01:15.869> my

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
as well I think certainly from from my

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.350 
as well I think certainly from from my
side<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.619> been<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.640> been<00:01:17.700> enjoyable<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
side it's been it's been enjoyable and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.030

it's been really positive really really

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.920 
it's been really positive really really
useful<00:01:20.189> hopefully<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.210> has<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.659> back<00:01:21.780> as

Kickstarter<00:01:47.970> process<00:01:48.600> how<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.200> how<00:01:49.619> is

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
Kickstarter process how is it how is

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.740 
Kickstarter process how is it how is
that<00:01:49.890> bin<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> obviously<00:01:51.600> you're

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
that bin for you and obviously you're

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.810 
that bin for you and obviously you're
talking<00:01:51.990> today<00:01:52.110> about<00:01:52.399> alpha<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.610> terms

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
talking today about alpha and in terms

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.609 
talking today about alpha and in terms
of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.509> communication<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.290> what<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.530> need

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
of the communication and what you need

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.160 
of the communication and what you need
to<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.299> how<00:01:57.299> has<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.479> been<00:01:57.600> different

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to do and how has it been different

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.080 
to do and how has it been different
overall<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.979> development<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.880> games

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
overall to development of games

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.609 
overall to development of games
previously<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.140> something<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.500> you

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
previously and is it something that you

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.720 
previously and is it something that you
would<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.189> again

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
would like to do again

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.790 
would like to do again
yes<00:02:03.660> we<00:02:03.900> would<00:02:03.990> very<00:02:04.140> much<00:02:04.260> like<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.710> it

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
yes we would very much like to do it

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.650 
yes we would very much like to do it
again<00:02:05.010> I<00:02:05.160> mean<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.550> way<00:02:06.150> it's<00:02:06.300> different

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
again I mean the way it's different

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.710 
again I mean the way it's different
really<00:02:06.900> is<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.460> we're<00:02:08.720> we're

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
really is you know that we're we're

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.060 
really is you know that we're we're
developing<00:02:10.140> with<00:02:10.320> like-minded<00:02:10.620> individuals

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
developing with like-minded individuals

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.780 
developing with like-minded individuals
you<00:02:11.880> know<00:02:11.910> when<00:02:12.120> you're<00:02:12.240> working<00:02:12.960> with<00:02:13.200> a

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
you know when you're working with a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.360 
you know when you're working with a
publisher<00:02:14.790> for<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.330> sound<00:02:16.050> reasons<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:17.280> know

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
publisher for the sound reasons you know

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.010 
publisher for the sound reasons you know
the<00:02:17.490> people<00:02:18.060> involved<00:02:18.330> are<00:02:18.810> all<00:02:21.020> there

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
the people involved are all there

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.940 
the people involved are all there
looking<00:02:22.260> at<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.410> with<00:02:22.590> sort<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.770> different

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
looking at it with sort of different

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.560 
looking at it with sort of different
agendas<00:02:23.460> you're<00:02:23.640> writing<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.000> an<00:02:24.210> imagined

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
agendas you're writing for an imagined

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.700 
agendas you're writing for an imagined
audience<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.140> everyone<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.500> sort<00:02:25.680> of

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
audience and everyone is sort of

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.650 
audience and everyone is sort of
second-guessing<00:02:26.130> what<00:02:26.400> they<00:02:26.520> might<00:02:26.640> like<00:02:26.820> and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
second-guessing what they might like and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.020 
second-guessing what they might like and
so<00:02:27.960> there<00:02:28.920> are<00:02:29.040> various<00:02:29.070> competing<00:02:29.700> things

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
so there are various competing things

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.030 
so there are various competing things
one<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> things<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.020> end<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:31.680> trying

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
one of the things is you end up trying

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.100 
one of the things is you end up trying
to<00:02:32.160> simplify<00:02:32.400> things<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:33.210> my<00:02:33.450> view<00:02:33.660> often<00:02:33.990> too

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
to simplify things in my view often too

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.950 
to simplify things in my view often too
much<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:35.580> know<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> audiences<00:02:36.780> aren't

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
much you know that the audiences aren't

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.830 
much you know that the audiences aren't
stupid<00:02:37.290> but<00:02:38.130> sometimes<00:02:38.670> with<00:02:39.030> focus<00:02:39.390> tests<00:02:39.750> on

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
stupid but sometimes with focus tests on

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.260 
stupid but sometimes with focus tests on
a<00:02:39.870> small<00:02:40.230> period<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.560> time<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:41.370> can<00:02:41.400> people<00:02:42.120> can

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
a small period of time it can people can

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.000 
a small period of time it can people can
you<00:02:42.840> know<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.080> can<00:02:43.710> give<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.920> wrong

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
you know it can give the wrong

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.740 
you know it can give the wrong
impression<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.270> think<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.540> other<00:02:45.660> thing

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
impression and I think the other thing

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.070 
impression and I think the other thing
is<00:02:45.960> that<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:47.190> deal<00:02:47.490> there<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.420> concept<00:02:48.870> of

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
is that this deal there is a concept of

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.020 
is that this deal there is a concept of
a<00:02:49.170> vertical<00:02:49.560> slice<00:02:50.010> which<00:02:50.310> has<00:02:50.820> always

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
a vertical slice which has always

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.480 
a vertical slice which has always
frustrated<00:02:51.750> me<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.080> game<00:02:52.380> development<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.130> we

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
frustrated me in game development and we

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.590 
frustrated me in game development and we
don't<00:02:53.670> have<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.970> do<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.150> when<00:02:54.450> we're

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
don't have to do that when we're

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.620 
don't have to do that when we're
developing<00:02:54.750> public<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.680> wonderful

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
developing public and that is wonderful

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.030 
developing public and that is wonderful
the<00:02:57.630> concept<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.140> vertical<00:02:58.560> slice<00:02:58.770> I<00:02:58.920> was

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
the concept of vertical slice I was

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.260 
the concept of vertical slice I was
trying<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.280> figure<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.580> out<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.030> I've<00:03:00.090> got<00:03:00.240> a

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
trying to figure it out and I've got a

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.180 
trying to figure it out and I've got a
few<00:03:00.510> ideas<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.960> my<00:03:01.020> head<00:03:01.050> big<00:03:01.350> elaborate<00:03:02.070> I

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190

slightly naf terms the theory is imagine
a<00:03:05.970> cake<00:03:06.180> with<00:03:06.420> lots<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.690> layers<00:03:06.900> if<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.650> slice

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
a cake with lots of layers if you slice

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.199 
a cake with lots of layers if you slice
through<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> layers<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.670> get<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.820> little<00:03:08.970> bit

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
through the layers you get a little bit

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.510 
through the layers you get a little bit
of<00:03:09.240> each<00:03:09.450> layer<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.530> have<00:03:10.709> an<00:03:10.800> idea<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.220> how

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
of each layer so you have an idea of how

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.940 
of each layer so you have an idea of how
of<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.820> game<00:03:12.000> would<00:03:12.180> feel<00:03:12.770> one<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
of the game would feel one of the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.160 
of the game would feel one of the
problems<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:15.360> means<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.840> end<00:03:16.020> up

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
problems is it means you end up

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.960 
problems is it means you end up
prioritizing<00:03:16.950> things<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.430> are<00:03:17.550> really<00:03:17.700> not

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
prioritizing things that are really not

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.060 
prioritizing things that are really not
a<00:03:18.000> risk<00:03:18.330> they're<00:03:18.630> not<00:03:18.780> difficult<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.290> do<00:03:19.500> but

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
a risk they're not difficult to do but

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.410 
a risk they're not difficult to do but
often<00:03:20.370> they're<00:03:20.489> quite<00:03:20.670> expensive<00:03:20.700> like

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
often they're quite expensive like

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.790 
often they're quite expensive like
generating<00:03:21.900> artwork<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.410> all<00:03:22.500> that's<00:03:22.590> the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
generating artwork and all that's the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.970 
generating artwork and all that's the
thing<00:03:23.750> whereas<00:03:24.750> if<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> very<00:03:25.739> focused
