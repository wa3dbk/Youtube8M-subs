00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
because you would look at what's going

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.210 
because you would look at what's going
on<00:02:54.600> with<00:02:54.810> Roman<00:02:55.110> reigns<00:02:55.140> right<00:02:55.590> now<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.070> you

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
see because I've looked at that as it's

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.820 
see because I've looked at that as it's
kind<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.350> like<00:04:00.260> dehumanizing<00:04:01.260> Roman<00:04:01.620> reigns

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
kind of like dehumanizing Roman reigns

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.990 
kind of like dehumanizing Roman reigns
but<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:02.490> a<00:04:02.790> good<00:04:03.000> way<00:04:03.060> because<00:04:04.580> Paul<00:04:05.580> Heyman

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
but in a good way because Paul Heyman

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.910 
but in a good way because Paul Heyman
talked<00:04:06.210> about<00:04:06.480> how<00:04:06.690> Roman<00:04:07.020> reigns<00:04:07.320> could<00:04:07.680> beat

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
any other man in history but he isn't

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.550 
any other man in history but he isn't
going<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.430> be<00:04:11.490> facing<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.970> man<00:04:12.240> at<00:04:12.600> WrestleMania

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
Roman reigns is up to that same level of

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.920 
Roman reigns is up to that same level of
look<00:06:13.400> you<00:06:13.669> know<00:06:13.789> and<00:06:13.940> he's<00:06:14.030> got<00:06:14.240> the<00:06:14.479> the

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
look you know and he's got the the

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.830 
look you know and he's got the the
strength<00:06:15.259> to<00:06:15.500> do<00:06:15.830> it<00:06:15.860> in<00:06:16.490> terms<00:06:16.699> of<00:06:16.880> storyline
