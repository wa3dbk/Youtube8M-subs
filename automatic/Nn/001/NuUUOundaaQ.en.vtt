00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.360
 hello everybody today we're going to prepare the 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.700
 called rose cake this way 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.369
 for its characteristic shape that 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.869
 will take over but we'll see later later 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.500
 these are the necessary ingredients 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.890
 then 300 g of double zero flour 3 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.539
 red egg yolks 3 tablespoons always 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.390
 of the great kitchen of sugar 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.780
 caster 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.699
 of olive 150 g of sourdough yeast 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.559
 mother or alternatively we can 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.249
 also use brewer's yeast and ne 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.890
 just a cube, then the rind of a 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:45.039
 lemon privatize a tablespoon of 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.469
 whole milk and then to taste or 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.850
 hazelnut cream or from jams 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.609
 in this case we have to give birth to 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.530
 apricots logically for cooking there 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:58.569
 we will serve a sawmill then you have 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.889
 thought all the ingredients not 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.440
 let's do nothing but take ours 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:04.269
 yeast in this case or the sourdough 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.799
 mother yeast but it is the same 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.229
 procedure also with yeast of 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.060
 pity and add some of the liquids 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.289
 that is the three tablespoons of oil 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.000
 extra virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon of 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:20.189
 oil 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.350
 I apologize for milk ok this way 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.810
 that after we go to put it also 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.500
 sugar that will help the yeast work 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.509
 better and now I pass the whole 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.909
 planetary with the pathologically hook 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.530
 only at the planetary you can do it 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.740
 there is no handrail in a bowl 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.740
 problem 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.600
 then this is the result that 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.000
 we have obtained precisely by adding the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.979
 our mother yeast 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.789
 oil and milk 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:58.649
 what we do then let's add 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:58.649
 the bumps take place in this way the flour 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.330
 and the lemon rind without overdoing it 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.950
 I would say half effort 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.320
 just remember how we already have 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.950
 said that it can be done either with yeast 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.500
 of beer than with sourdough but is one 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.390
 which changes from mainly and the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.250
 duration of leavening in the sense that 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.590
 is that sourdough we will notice a 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.030
 rise at least for the author while with 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.750
 two brewer's yeast will suffice 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.750
 bada 3 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.580
 then this is the result that 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.780
 we got kneading is one thing 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.500
 what I've done is to add 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.000
 another two tablespoons of milk as it 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.980
 it also depends on the fairy from how much 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.690
 absorption capacity and 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.790
 consequently the pasta is more or less 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.330
 the texture and texture are less soft 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.690
 you see 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.160
 and these here as if he were doing 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.440
 of noodles the impact seems almost 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.580
 that practically so we must 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.560
 roll it out and we will make an almost oval shape 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.230
 rectangular with a thickness of approx 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.390
 half a centimeter in this case it 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.209
 I split it in two and spread it because I have two 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.680
 types of stuffing so I want to do 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.959
 this thing a little different but 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.330
 substantially the procedure does not change 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:16.580
 and we have buttered and floured the 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:20.840
 Our pan then it spread a little of 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:24.010
 flour under and now I don't smile with it 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.010
 stand fruitfully 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.290
 I repeat I have to make a fund enough 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:42.530
 long in such a way that I have with i 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.530
 allows you to cut and make strips 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.940
 how do you see this here the form that? 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:54.540
 I gave now now I'm tonia cream 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.000
 hazelnut without overdoing it because 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.670
 after otherwise in the cooking phase of 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.700
 cal was all under and it wo n't be 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.420
 beautiful to see 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:13.139
 we hope well after that we will go to 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:16.769
 roll up and cut, but here it is only recently 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:19.519
 often my cream 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.460
 now we are going to fill them 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.139
 gently take a ride 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.120
 easy 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.680
 in this way, trying maybe not 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.229
 scepter equal and half as you see 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.789
 simple and then we go to cut a 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.090
 what we will do next will be 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:42.120
 become our roses like 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.660
 see in this way and leandro of 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.660
 sport here in the cake pan almost one 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.699
 do not attack yourself because later 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.410
 leavening go home alone 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.030
 then we continue in this way up to 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.030
 completely fill our land 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.370
 here we are then this here ours 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.560
 final result as I had already said in 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.380
 previously we did two types of 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.820
 one filling with jam and one 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.860
 instead with our hazelnut cream 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.449
 the promises in this way because 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.289
 spaces were filled during the 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.380
 leavened 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.180
 so now let's put down 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.699
 we cover with a cloth in this 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.650
 so I leave the mother yeast with 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.680
 doctor nativity scene with brewer's yeast 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.039
 it takes two hours after which it will go into 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.190
 oven at 180 degrees for about 30 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.190
 minutes 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:38.449
 here we are after about eight hours of 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.309
 leavening we have achieved this 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.229
 result 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:44.240
 Now to describe the oven 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.149
 a few minutes at 200 degrees 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:56.839
 then we will bring it to 180 and cook 

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:59.659
 openly minutes here we are after about 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:02.509
 half an hour of cooking at 180 degrees front 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:04.610
 the result costs us nothing else and 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.110
 I know that making it cool will remove our own 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.379
 in and serve it 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.379
 enjoy your meal
