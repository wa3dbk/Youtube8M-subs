00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.460
 Well, only the blush that started is で in the teacher's Blu-ray course 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.250
 Navigator I Why Aka Red Pen Ayukawa Sensei Ano Nene Everyone Blu-ray 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.480
 I am uneasy about whether you know about 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:23.730
 When you see that movie, are you dvds or are you still the blue layer? 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.190
 Another come from the other by far the Blu-ray of good if the look at home to keep saying it that First 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.850

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.150
 0 I would like to see in 0 I wonder if there are any differences I do not know in detail 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.330
 The 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:39.880
 Simply put , what is the good thing if the capacity gets bigger because the capacity is about 6 times 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:40.570
 If you look at a movie you watch in the theater and try to say that, the capacity is huge and the image quality and sound quality are lowered 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.180
 I have to 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:49.880
 But because Blu-ray has a large capacity, it is in the high-quality changing room 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:54.920
 As for the matter that can be recorded, that is, the result is more than twice as many pixels as dvd 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:59.060
 And acoustic sounds I is Blu-ray of Tteyuu'll enjoy close state by the movie theater 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.559
 We recommend Blu-ray if you see at home in Otaka, and then Blu-ray 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.170
 Minutes when the capacity is awkward 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:08.100
 After all, I did the work because the bonus video became too large 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.820
 Looking at not only the team but also making and interviews and enjoy one more movie

 For example, an easy rider directed by Dennis Hopper 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.289
 It is this easy rider book 95 minutes, but bonus picture 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:24.130
 I think I'm approaching Guigui to 65 minutes and the main and ag rider 45 Anniversary

 It's not only Blu-ray in the box, but it comes with a bike 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.170
 I can't get on or there is no blur, but because the bike comes with me , there are other ghost busters 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.719
 ghost busters number 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.540

 It's 13 minutes, but the bonus video is supposed to be funny Total bonus of bonus video 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:48.620
 161 minutes 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:50.300
 About 3 hours shift and cat blue Well it's come with ghosts whopping and buy with me 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.740

 If it sees at a house because it will arrange the bones more and more quickly 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.840
 It was a course in the blue of Akapeni Ashikawa teacher
