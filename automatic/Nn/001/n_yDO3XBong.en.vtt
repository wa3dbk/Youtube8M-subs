 In September, each working group democratically chooses the 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.020
 representatives that will make up the editorial group 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.520
 composed of 23 members 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.580
 One of the first decisions that this group takes is to divide the law into two 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.650
 parts 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.350

 the second that aims to improve the working conditions of the musician 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.720
 After four months of work, the first draft of the law was generated. 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.720
 is enriched with contributions from musicians from different provinces 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.409

 different events are held in order to disseminate the contents of the law 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.039

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:56.139
 artists 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:59.319
