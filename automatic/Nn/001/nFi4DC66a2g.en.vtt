bans phase and how it went for full

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.170 
bans phase and how it went for full
sword<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.130> mean<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.460> were<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.640> really

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
sword I mean we were all really

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.650 
sword I mean we were all really
surprised<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.610> new<00:00:36.270> new<00:00:36.420> pic

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
surprised to see that that new new pic

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.940 
surprised to see that that new new pic
coming<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.050> again<00:00:37.260> especially<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.829> an

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
coming up again especially with an

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.790 
coming up again especially with an
caster<00:00:38.730> carry<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:40.020> Corky<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.469> mean<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.680> make

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
caster carry like Corky I mean it make

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.530 
caster carry like Corky I mean it make
sense<00:00:41.010> later<00:00:41.070> once<00:00:41.579> he<00:00:41.730> gets<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> infinity

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
sense later once he gets the infinity

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.389 
sense later once he gets the infinity
edge<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.379> there's<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> lot<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.010> synergy

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
edge but there's not a lot of synergy

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.010 
edge but there's not a lot of synergy
right<00:00:44.579> after<00:00:44.850> he<00:00:44.940> gets<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.660> trinity

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
right after he gets the the trinity

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.410 
right after he gets the the trinity
force<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.520> also<00:00:47.520> i<00:00:47.550> think<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:47.850> agreed<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
force and also i think we all agreed to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.479 
force and also i think we all agreed to
that<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.739> composition<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.309> if

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
that that's that's a composition that if

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.979 
that that's that's a composition that if
you<00:00:50.610> fall<00:00:51.030> behind<00:00:51.210> you're<00:00:51.510> gonna<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.899> an

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you fall behind you're gonna have an

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.229 
you fall behind you're gonna have an
extremely<00:00:52.410> difficult<00:00:52.980> time<00:00:53.670> getting<00:00:53.699> back

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
extremely difficult time getting back

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.240 
extremely difficult time getting back
into<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> game<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:56.039> very

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
into the game it's it's not very

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.369 
into the game it's it's not very
versatile<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.000> all<00:00:57.210> about<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.480> siege<00:00:58.020> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
versatile it's all about that siege I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.750 
versatile it's all about that siege I
think<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.160> was<00:00:59.280> interesting<00:00:59.640> though

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
think that was interesting though

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.209 
think that was interesting though
because<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.989> core<00:01:01.530> strengths<00:01:02.039> for

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
because one of the core strengths for

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.950 
because one of the core strengths for
sword<00:01:02.489> coming<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.910> match<00:01:03.120> was<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.750> think

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
sword coming to this match was I think

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.479 
sword coming to this match was I think
their<00:01:04.080> individual<00:01:04.619> lane<00:01:04.830> skill<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.309> saw<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
their individual lane skill we saw the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.880 
their individual lane skill we saw the
2v<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.150> win<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.659> game<00:01:07.290> 2<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.470> through<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.770> saw

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
2v to win in game 2 in through you saw

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.649 
2v to win in game 2 in through you saw
the<00:01:07.950> 1v1<00:01:08.400> win<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.180> Game<00:01:09.360> two<00:01:09.390> in

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the 1v1 win for them in Game two in

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
the 1v1 win for them in Game two in
three<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:09.990> well<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:11.040> think<00:01:11.250> that

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
three as well and I think that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
three as well and I think that
guarantees<00:01:12.420> them<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.960> pretty<00:01:13.619> decent<00:01:13.920> early

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
guarantees them a pretty decent early

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.190 
guarantees them a pretty decent early
game<00:01:14.310> lead<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:15.060> from<00:01:15.270> minion<00:01:15.600> farm<00:01:15.869> that

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
game lead just from minion farm that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.690 
game lead just from minion farm that
they<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.619> transition<00:01:17.280> into<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
they can just transition into that and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.160 
they can just transition into that and
the<00:01:17.790> new<00:01:17.909> new<00:01:18.030> gives<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.330> dragon<00:01:18.659> control<00:01:18.990> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the new new gives them dragon control to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.170 
the new new gives them dragon control to
guarantee<00:01:19.799> some<00:01:20.070> more<00:01:20.310> early<00:01:20.549> game<00:01:20.700> leads<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
guarantee some more early game leads and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
guarantee some more early game leads and
just<00:01:21.479> play<00:01:21.689> from<00:01:21.869> ahead<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.710> everything

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
just play from ahead I think everything

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.410 
just play from ahead I think everything
you've<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.280> mentioned<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.939> Lee<00:01:24.090> sin<00:01:24.299> would

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
you've just mentioned that Lee sin would

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.130 
you've just mentioned that Lee sin would
have<00:01:24.540> done<00:01:24.659> better<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.280> more<00:01:26.280> listen<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
have done better and more listen if you

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.660 
have done better and more listen if you
want<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> kind<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.650> jungle<00:01:28.829> okay<00:01:29.220> new<00:01:29.369> new<00:01:29.400> can

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
want a kind of jungle okay new new can

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.100 
want a kind of jungle okay new new can
work<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.270> zero<00:01:30.570> counter<00:01:30.869> jungling

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
work but there was zero counter jungling
