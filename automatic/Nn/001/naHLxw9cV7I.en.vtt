00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
know we don't make it maybe won't be a

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.310 
know we don't make it maybe won't be a
team<00:00:32.730> anymore<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.510> how<00:00:33.660> afraid<00:00:33.930> were<00:00:34.170> you

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
team anymore so how afraid were you

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.979 
team anymore so how afraid were you
going<00:00:34.530> into<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.100> matches<00:00:35.610> um<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.719> mean

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
going into the matches um I mean

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.810 
going into the matches um I mean
basically<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.129> didn't<00:00:38.309> meet<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.520> season

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
basically if we didn't meet in season

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.270 
basically if we didn't meet in season
three<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.960> wouldn't<00:00:40.230> really<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.469> relevant<00:00:40.920> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
three we wouldn't really be relevant I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.670 
three we wouldn't really be relevant I
guess<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> large<00:00:42.360> majority<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.260> scene<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
guess for a large majority the scene so

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.160 
guess for a large majority the scene so
it<00:00:43.829> was<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.070> do-or-die<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
it was like do-or-die and like for a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.229 
it was like do-or-die and like for a
team<00:00:46.379> that's<00:00:46.410> been<00:00:46.829> like<00:00:47.039> getting<00:00:47.520> beating

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
team that's been like getting beating

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.520 
team that's been like getting beating
out<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.539> every<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.020> team<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.469> past

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
out like every and a team for the past

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.920 
out like every and a team for the past
few<00:00:49.860> months<00:00:49.980> after<00:00:50.399> i<00:00:50.670> joined<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.510> think<00:00:51.750> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
few months after i joined I think that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.720 
few months after i joined I think that
everyone<00:00:52.410> really<00:00:52.739> expected<00:00:53.100> us<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> go

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
everyone really expected us to go

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
everyone really expected us to go
through<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.079> was<00:00:55.230> kind<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.620> why

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
through and I think that was kind of why

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.200 
through and I think that was kind of why
there<00:00:56.039> was<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.280> much<00:00:56.399> pressure<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.850> us<00:00:56.910> because

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
there was so much pressure on us because

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
there was so much pressure on us because
it's<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.570> oh<00:00:57.750> yeah<00:00:58.350> cursed<00:00:58.620> you're<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it's like oh yeah cursed you're a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.700 
it's like oh yeah cursed you're a
shoo-in<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.350> damn<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.590> if

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
shoo-in and then it's like damn what if

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.110 
shoo-in and then it's like damn what if
we<00:01:01.800> lose<00:01:01.980> or<00:01:02.280> something<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.000> was

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
we lose or something so it was

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.490 
we lose or something so it was
definitely<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.539> those<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> lot<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.140> our<00:01:04.229> minds

think<00:04:38.630> it's<00:04:38.720> really<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.170> toss-up<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.710> say<00:04:39.860> who's

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
think it's really a toss-up to say who's

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
but once you eventually get that to that

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.760 
but once you eventually get that to that
point<00:04:56.300> you'll<00:04:56.900> have<00:04:57.080> to<00:04:57.200> be<00:04:57.290> ready<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.620> throw

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
point you'll have to be ready to throw

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.050 
point you'll have to be ready to throw
down<00:04:57.800> some<00:04:58.130> money<00:04:58.310> on<00:04:58.460> stuff<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:58.760> let's<00:04:58.940> say

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
down some money on stuff so let's say

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.520 
down some money on stuff so let's say
you<00:04:59.120> had<00:04:59.360> to<00:04:59.510> throw<00:04:59.660> down<00:04:59.780> money<00:04:59.990> on<00:05:00.200> any<00:05:00.380> of

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
you had to throw down money on any of

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.140 
you had to throw down money on any of
the<00:05:00.620> four<00:05:00.800> teams<00:05:01.040> that<00:05:01.190> are<00:05:01.280> still<00:05:01.460> in<00:05:01.640> who

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
the four teams that are still in who

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.440 
the four teams that are still in who
would<00:05:02.300> you<00:05:02.420> put<00:05:02.600> that<00:05:02.840> down<00:05:03.260> on<00:05:03.550> mmm<00:05:04.550> honestly

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
would you put that down on mmm honestly

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.890 
would you put that down on mmm honestly
I<00:05:06.190> would<00:05:07.190> probably<00:05:07.460> say<00:05:10.480> it's<00:05:11.480> a<00:05:11.600> dirt<00:05:11.870> nap

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
I would probably say it's a dirt nap

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.950 
I would probably say it's a dirt nap
because<00:05:12.610> i<00:05:13.610> think<00:05:14.360> they've<00:05:14.600> been<00:05:14.720> playing

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
because i think they've been playing

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.050 
because i think they've been playing
pretty<00:05:15.440> solid<00:05:15.950> here<00:05:16.070> like<00:05:16.430> they<00:05:16.760> just<00:05:16.910> be

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
pretty solid here like they just be

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.970 
pretty solid here like they just be
dessert<00:05:17.390> oh<00:05:17.660> no<00:05:18.110> they<00:05:18.320> still<00:05:18.470> got<00:05:18.620> games<00:05:18.830> to

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
dessert oh no they still got games to

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.070 
dessert oh no they still got games to
play<00:05:19.100> but<00:05:19.490> i<00:05:19.790> think<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:20.450> between<00:05:20.930> me

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
play but i think that between me

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.690 
play but i think that between me
playground<00:05:21.620> marne<00:05:21.860> I<00:05:21.950> think<00:05:22.130> those<00:05:22.250> it's

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
playground marne I think those it's

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.270 
playground marne I think those it's
pretty<00:05:22.940> even<00:05:23.180> matchup<00:05:23.360> I<00:05:24.010> want<00:05:25.010> to<00:05:25.130> say

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
pretty even matchup I want to say

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.180 
pretty even matchup I want to say
Martin's<00:05:25.610> gonna<00:05:25.730> take<00:05:26.000> it<00:05:26.210> but<00:05:26.540> it<00:05:27.500> depends<00:05:27.860> if

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
Martin's gonna take it but it depends if

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.180 
Martin's gonna take it but it depends if
they<00:05:28.310> do<00:05:28.490> their<00:05:28.640> bands<00:05:28.820> and<00:05:29.000> pics<00:05:29.150> right<00:05:30.190> yeah

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
they do their bands and pics right yeah

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
they do their bands and pics right yeah
I<00:05:31.250> think<00:05:31.370> dirt<00:05:31.610> naps<00:05:31.820> going<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.060> come<00:05:32.150> out

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
I think dirt naps going to come out

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.150 
I think dirt naps going to come out
ahead<00:05:32.330> they<00:05:32.990> have<00:05:33.170> really<00:05:33.410> good<00:05:33.500> players<00:05:33.830> like

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
ahead they have really good players like

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.920 
ahead they have really good players like
probably<00:05:34.430> the<00:05:34.550> Beast<00:05:34.880> I've<00:05:35.420> always<00:05:35.660> thought

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
probably the Beast I've always thought

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.070 
probably the Beast I've always thought
he's<00:05:36.080> been<00:05:36.290> really<00:05:36.500> good<00:05:36.650> and<00:05:37.180> yeah<00:05:38.180> I<00:05:38.480> think

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
he's been really good and yeah I think

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.330 
he's been really good and yeah I think
they<00:05:39.170> have<00:05:39.200> what<00:05:39.320> it<00:05:39.440> takes<00:05:39.680> but<00:05:40.070> we'll<00:05:40.310> just
