00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
is really interesting we've got the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.640

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
Galaxy NX so it doesn't make sense for

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.780 
Galaxy NX so it doesn't make sense for
us<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.420> get<00:02:23.660> better<00:02:23.900> camera<00:02:24.709> phones<00:02:25.069> or<00:02:25.459> phones

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
us to get better camera phones or phones

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.850 
us to get better camera phones or phones
that<00:02:26.030> are<00:02:26.120> cameras<00:02:26.540> or<00:02:26.720> whatever<00:02:27.020> but<00:02:27.260> we<00:02:27.680> also

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
that are cameras or whatever but we also

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.800 
that are cameras or whatever but we also
want<00:02:28.310> better<00:02:28.610> imaging<00:02:29.090> quality<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.690> it's

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
want better imaging quality and it's

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.420 
want better imaging quality and it's
interesting<00:02:30.050> since<00:02:30.410> Samsung<00:02:30.830> has<00:02:30.950> decided<00:02:31.400> to

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
interesting since Samsung has decided to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.160 
interesting since Samsung has decided to
ditch<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.940> whole<00:02:32.090> optical<00:02:32.959> image

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
ditch the whole optical image

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.410 
ditch the whole optical image
stabilization<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.100> 2014<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.120> going<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.300> be<00:02:35.390> a

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
stabilization so 2014 is going to be a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.240 
stabilization so 2014 is going to be a
very<00:02:35.480> interesting<00:02:36.110> year<00:02:36.320> but<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:37.010> leads<00:02:37.190> me

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
very interesting year but that leads me

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.070 
very interesting year but that leads me
to<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.520> question<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.910> day<00:02:37.970> what<00:02:38.930> would

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
to the question of the day what would

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.990 
to the question of the day what would

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
merger because for example in my

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.260 
merger because for example in my
particular<00:02:42.650> case<00:02:42.950> what<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.280> would<00:02:43.520> love<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:44.090> to

have a smartphone that does not require
expandable<00:02:47.989> lenses<00:02:48.470> but<00:02:48.709> then<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.070> can<00:02:49.220> also

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
expandable lenses but then you can also

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.430 
expandable lenses but then you can also
attach<00:02:49.970> them<00:02:50.269> like<00:02:50.450> we've<00:02:50.660> seen<00:02:50.900> some<00:02:51.140> clips

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
attach them like we've seen some clips
