these this would change depending on the
weather<00:02:37.140> but<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.530> get<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.709> sense<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.190> what<00:02:38.400> kind

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
weather but you get a sense of what kind

weather but you get a sense of what kind
of<00:02:38.730> graphics<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.300> expect<00:02:40.040> here<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.160> have

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310

stocks<00:02:41.670> Twitter<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.569> settings<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.980> rest

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
stocks Twitter and settings so the rest

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.800 
stocks Twitter and settings so the rest
of<00:02:44.340> them<00:02:44.519> are<00:02:44.640> pretty<00:02:44.880> much<00:02:45.120> their<00:02:45.330> default

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
of them are pretty much their default

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.800

graphics<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.940> team<00:02:48.120> that's<00:02:48.330> working<00:02:48.569> on

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
graphics so the team that's working on

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.960 
graphics so the team that's working on
this<00:02:48.959> has<00:02:49.260> provided<00:02:49.709> several<00:02:50.130> skin<00:02:50.489> choices

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
this has provided several skin choices

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.479 
this has provided several skin choices
for<00:02:51.209> many<00:02:51.450> parts<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.900> sense<00:02:52.230> I've<00:02:52.830> gone<00:02:53.190> with

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
for many parts of sense I've gone with

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.550 
for many parts of sense I've gone with
this<00:02:53.670> setup<00:02:53.940> but<00:02:54.600> if<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.989> don't<00:02:55.170> like<00:02:55.350> this

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
this setup but if you don't like this

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.330 
this setup but if you don't like this
clock<00:02:56.360> skin<00:02:57.360> or<00:02:57.600> you'd<00:02:58.019> rather<00:02:58.049> go<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:58.890> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
clock skin or you'd rather go with the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.880 
clock skin or you'd rather go with the
analog<00:02:59.790> one<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.269> showed<00:03:00.810> earlier<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.560> actually

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
analog one I showed earlier you actually

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.680 
analog one I showed earlier you actually
have<00:03:02.010> some<00:03:02.220> other<00:03:02.430> options<00:03:02.670> available<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.450> you

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
have some other options available to you

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.990 
have some other options available to you
and<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.739> same<00:03:04.890> goes<00:03:04.950> for<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> slider<00:03:05.760> and

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
and the same goes for the slider and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.690 
and the same goes for the slider and
wallpaper<00:03:06.390> among<00:03:07.380> other<00:03:07.620> things<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:08.160> believe

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
wallpaper among other things I believe

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.640 
wallpaper among other things I believe
they're<00:03:08.910> also<00:03:09.030> working<00:03:09.360> on<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.750> custom<00:03:10.380> task

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
they're also working on a custom task

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.600 
they're also working on a custom task
bar<00:03:12.260> they're<00:03:13.260> actively<00:03:13.709> updating<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.310> theme

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
bar they're actively updating the theme

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.059 
bar they're actively updating the theme
so<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.660> should<00:03:15.989> evolve<00:03:16.290> more<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.769> more<00:03:16.950> as

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
so it should evolve more and more as

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.729 
so it should evolve more and more as
time<00:03:17.099> goes<00:03:17.609> on<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.500> thing<00:03:19.680> that

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
time goes on so this is the thing that

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.130 
time goes on so this is the thing that
