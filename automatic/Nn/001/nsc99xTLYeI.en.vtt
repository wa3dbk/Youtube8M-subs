00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
look too too bad to rebuild and here's

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.569 
look too too bad to rebuild and here's
what<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.809> looks<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.460> they're<00:00:47.460> size<00:00:47.879> C<00:00:49.579> let's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
what it looks like they're size C let's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.270 
what it looks like they're size C let's
say<00:00:50.700> sub<00:00:51.149> C<00:00:51.390> batteries<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.500> they're<00:00:52.620> 1.2

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
say sub C batteries I think they're 1.2

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.970 
say sub C batteries I think they're 1.2
volts<00:00:53.520> there's<00:00:54.360> 16<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> them<00:00:55.320> there's<00:00:55.500> five<00:00:55.800> in

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
volts there's 16 of them there's five in

volts there's 16 of them there's five in
a<00:00:56.039> row

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
a row

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.060

and five on the back and there's one on
top<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:03.000> I'll<00:01:03.149> pop<00:01:04.610> I'll<00:01:05.610> take<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.150> here

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
top and I'll pop I'll take this out here

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.450 
top and I'll pop I'll take this out here
and<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.869> batteries<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.530> little<00:01:10.830> tabs<00:01:11.130> on

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and the batteries have little tabs on

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.820 
and the batteries have little tabs on
them<00:01:11.640> they<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.810> they're<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.380> welded

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
them they like they're like welded

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.850 
them they like they're like welded
together<00:01:14.240> like<00:01:15.240> here's<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.990> positive<00:01:16.290> right

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
together like here's a positive right

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.480 
together like here's a positive right
here<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.850> welded<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> negative<00:01:18.659> and

here and it's welded to a negative and
here's<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.580> another<00:01:21.270> negative<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.530> welded

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
here's a another negative that's welded

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.060 
here's a another negative that's welded
to<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> positive<00:01:23.990> they<00:01:24.990> all<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.799> either

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
to a positive they all go in either

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.760 
to a positive they all go in either
directions<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.210> plus<00:01:27.720> there<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.470> plus

and yes compared to $100 for two brand
new<00:01:49.110> batteries

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
new batteries

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.249 
new batteries
I<00:01:49.860> could<00:01:50.759> buy<00:01:50.939> batteries<00:01:51.299> online<00:01:51.960> right<00:01:52.229> now

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259

for 22 99 for 16 of them that's enough
to<00:01:56.369> rebuild<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.750> one<00:01:58.020> battery<00:01:58.439> pack<00:01:58.710> right

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
to rebuild this one battery pack right

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.780 
to rebuild this one battery pack right
here<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.270> I'm<00:02:00.390> going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.689> try<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:02.340> see<00:02:02.549> how
