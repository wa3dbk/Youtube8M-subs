00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
enforcement but might have some business

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.350 
enforcement but might have some business
applications<00:00:35.460> as<00:00:35.640> well<00:00:35.670> perhaps<00:00:36.210> an

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
applications as well perhaps an

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
a complete disk image as well and I'll

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.130 
a complete disk image as well and I'll
quickly<00:01:08.340> show<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.610> how<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.970> works<00:01:09.140> comes

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
quickly show you how this works comes

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.990 
quickly show you how this works comes
with<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.320> power<00:01:10.619> supply<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.520> plug<00:01:11.820> it

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
with a power supply that you plug it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.020 
with a power supply that you plug it
into<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.840> USB<00:01:12.869> side<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.820> plug

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
into the USB side here and then you plug

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.789 
into the USB side here and then you plug
it<00:01:15.180> into<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> side<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:16.110> phone<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:16.650> now

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
it into the side of your phone right now

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.140 
it into the side of your phone right now
again<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.250> works<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.640> motorola<00:01:18.030> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
again it just works with motorola and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.460 
again it just works with motorola and
samsung<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.689> are<00:01:18.780> designing<00:01:19.140> some

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
samsung they are designing some

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.330 
samsung they are designing some
additional<00:01:20.159> adapters<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.030> well<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:22.040> i<00:01:23.040> hit

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
additional adapters as well and i hit

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580 
additional adapters as well and i hit
the<00:01:23.369> start<00:01:23.729> button<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.150> what<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.170> doing<00:01:25.320> now

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the start button and what it's doing now

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.890 
the start button and what it's doing now
is<00:01:25.860> taking<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.119> information<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
is taking all that information on the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
is taking all that information on the
phone<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.290> sticking<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.070> into<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.400> actual

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
phone and sticking it into the actual

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.330 
phone and sticking it into the actual
flash<00:01:30.030> drive<00:01:30.680> typically<00:01:31.680> takes<00:01:31.860> about<00:01:31.950> 20

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
flash drive typically takes about 20

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.920 
flash drive typically takes about 20
minutes<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.729> i've<00:01:32.850> already<00:01:33.270> done<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.659> ahead

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
minutes so i've already done this ahead

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.260 
minutes so i've already done this ahead
of<00:01:33.990> time<00:01:34.189> but<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.880> once<00:01:36.000> it's

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
of time but what you do once it's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.270 
of time but what you do once it's
finished<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.900> plug<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.799> into<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> side<00:01:38.220> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
finished is plug it into the side of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.249 
finished is plug it into the side of
your<00:01:38.460> laptop<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> software<00:01:40.229> that

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
your laptop and with the software that

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.010 
your laptop and with the software that
comes<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.159> device<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:42.270> called<00:01:42.600> DS

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
comes with the device it's called DS

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.080 
comes with the device it's called DS
lite<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.159> dumps<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> information

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
lite it then dumps all that information

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.149 
lite it then dumps all that information
into<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.720> program<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.770> look<00:01:46.920> at

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
into this program and you can look at

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.830 
into this program and you can look at
pretty<00:01:47.460> well<00:01:47.640> everything<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> call

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
pretty well everything all the call

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.499 
pretty well everything all the call
history<00:01:49.130> text<00:01:50.130> messages<00:01:50.610> even<00:01:51.060> things<00:01:51.420> like

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
history text messages even things like
