00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
applying a glue stick to the two leading

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.950 
applying a glue stick to the two leading
and<00:00:04.200> trailing<00:00:04.350> edges<00:00:08.719> attaching<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
and trailing edges attaching to the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.369 
and trailing edges attaching to the
front<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.380> wing<00:00:14.480> okay<00:00:15.480> I've<00:00:15.839> got<00:00:16.020> five

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
front of the wing okay I've got five

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.560 
front of the wing okay I've got five
two-inch<00:00:17.070> pieces<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.760> blind<00:00:18.119> glue<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.539> one

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
two-inch pieces of blind glue to one

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.439 
two-inch pieces of blind glue to one
side<00:00:19.580> of<00:00:20.580> these<00:00:20.820> five<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:22.789> everyone<00:00:23.789> has<00:00:24.060> glue

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
side of these five so everyone has glue

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.450 
side of these five so everyone has glue
at<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:25.350> end<00:00:26.150> taking<00:00:27.150> three<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.250> they<00:00:29.250> get

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
at one end taking three and they get

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.540 
at one end taking three and they get
clue<00:00:29.730> at<00:00:30.269> one<00:00:30.599> end<00:00:30.779> as<00:00:30.990> well<00:00:32.030> and<00:00:33.649> then<00:00:34.649> all

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
clue at one end as well and then all

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.880 
clue at one end as well and then all
five<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.090> these<00:00:37.070> need<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.430> glue<00:00:38.879> stick<00:00:39.890> attached

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
five of these need a glue stick attached

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.979 
five of these need a glue stick attached
to<00:00:41.250> them<00:00:42.290> there's<00:00:43.290> some<00:00:43.530> glue<00:00:43.770> stick<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.250> them

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
to them there's some glue stick on them

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.450 
to them there's some glue stick on them
so

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.279 

we<00:00:50.520> stick<00:00:51.030> violent

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
we stick violent

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.300 
we stick violent
like<00:00:53.859> so

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.939 

okay

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
okay

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.750 
okay
so<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.820> ones<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.269> two<00:01:01.250> ends<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.460> glue

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so the ones with two ends with glue

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.320 
so the ones with two ends with glue
become<00:01:03.359> wingtips

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.260 

and<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:12.140> wing<00:01:12.290> center<00:01:12.770> actually

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.480 

and<00:01:16.840> use<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.200> six<00:01:17.470> inch<00:01:17.680> here<00:01:18.009> to<00:01:18.100> find<00:01:18.369> the

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
and use this six inch here to find the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.899 
and use this six inch here to find the
centers<00:01:18.909> needed<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.770> then<00:01:24.220> this<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.670> the

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
centers needed and then this is the

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:32.840 
centers needed and then this is the
trailing<00:01:25.689> edge<00:01:26.759> right<00:01:27.759> here

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.149 

like<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.720> make<00:01:34.320> sure<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.740> joints

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
like so make sure we have joints

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.810 
like so make sure we have joints
everywhere<00:01:35.690> well<00:01:36.690> connected<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.610> ones

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
everywhere well connected and the ones

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.469 
everywhere well connected and the ones
with<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.960> blue<00:01:40.830> become<00:01:41.640> winglets<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.330> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
with one blue become winglets with the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.410 
with one blue become winglets with the
glue<00:01:42.660> stick<00:01:42.930> facing<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.530> outside<00:01:44.300> so<00:01:45.300> they

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
glue stick facing the outside so they

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.420 
glue stick facing the outside so they
just<00:01:45.630> sit<00:01:45.810> there

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
just sit there

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.430 
just sit there
glue<00:01:47.430> sticks<00:01:47.729> facing<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> outside<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.410> that

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
glue sticks facing the outside so that

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.390 
glue sticks facing the outside so that
that's<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> wrong<00:01:50.610> way<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:53.040> sticky

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
that's the wrong way there so the sticky

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.930 
that's the wrong way there so the sticky
part<00:01:54.229> is<00:01:55.229> facing<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.860> way<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.700> way<00:01:56.880> so

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
part is facing that way and that way so

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.420 
part is facing that way and that way so
that<00:01:57.119> when<00:01:57.300> we<00:01:57.450> flip<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.869> tissue<00:01:58.110> up<00:01:58.410> it<00:01:59.220> will

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
that when we flip the tissue up it will

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.160 
that when we flip the tissue up it will
be<00:02:00.259> nice<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.290> easy<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.860> stick<00:02:02.100> them<00:02:02.369> there

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
be nice and easy to stick them there

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.969 
be nice and easy to stick them there
this<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.470> is<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.830> be<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:06.649> wing<00:02:07.649> mount

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
this here is going to be the wing mount

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.040 
this here is going to be the wing mount
so<00:02:08.520> I'm<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.789> gluing<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.179> 4-inch<00:02:09.690> piece

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
so I'm just gluing this 4-inch piece

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.240 
so I'm just gluing this 4-inch piece
there<00:02:10.700> like<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.360> then<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.290> wing<00:02:13.890> shim

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
there like so and then the wing shim

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.690 
there like so and then the wing shim
which<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.270> spacer<00:02:15.750> underneath<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.320> front

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
which is the spacer underneath the front

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.340 
which is the spacer underneath the front
it<00:02:17.700> goes<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:20.010> goes<00:02:20.250> underneath<00:02:20.880> here<00:02:22.580> like<00:02:23.580> so

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
it goes it goes underneath here like so

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.449 
it goes it goes underneath here like so
drop<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.380> front<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.830> wing<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:28.040> now<00:02:29.040> for

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
drop the front of the wing up now for

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.810 
drop the front of the wing up now for
the<00:02:29.550> tail<00:02:29.820> feathers<00:02:30.470> we<00:02:31.470> need<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.980> add<00:02:32.340> some

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
the tail feathers we need to add some

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.589 
the tail feathers we need to add some
glue<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.390> six-inch<00:02:33.900> piece<00:02:34.170> here

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
glue to the six-inch piece here

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.679 
glue to the six-inch piece here
it's<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:37.049> bit<00:02:37.230> much<00:02:37.670> I'll<00:02:38.670> remove<00:02:38.969> it<00:02:39.180> there<00:02:39.540> we

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
it's a bit much I'll remove it there we

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.500 
it's a bit much I'll remove it there we
go<00:02:40.939> like<00:02:41.939> so

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
and then this goes to the front of the

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:54.199 
and then this goes to the front of the
elevator<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.890> same<00:02:51.700> thing<00:02:52.170> we're<00:02:53.170> gluing

and<00:03:36.320> now<00:03:37.010> gluing<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.460> rudder<00:03:38.380> at<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.620> back

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
and now gluing the rudder at the back

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.900 
and now gluing the rudder at the back
smear<00:03:42.940> some<00:03:43.940> glue<00:03:44.240> on<00:03:44.510> there<00:03:45.760> stick<00:03:46.760> the

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
smear some glue on there stick the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.510 
smear some glue on there stick the
rudder<00:03:48.100> right<00:03:49.100> up<00:03:49.250> up<00:03:49.430> there<00:03:50.980> call<00:03:51.980> it<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.250> fin

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
rudder right up up there call it the fin

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.660 
rudder right up up there call it the fin
or<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.880> rider<00:03:53.800> Thunder<00:03:54.800> hanging<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.310> bit<00:03:55.460> there

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
or the rider Thunder hanging a bit there

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.770 
or the rider Thunder hanging a bit there
by<00:03:55.850> 16<00:03:56.420> remove<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.410> extra<00:03:57.740> tissue<00:03:57.980> there<00:03:58.780> like

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
by 16 remove the extra tissue there like

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.800 
by 16 remove the extra tissue there like
so

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.600 

and<00:04:06.810> we're<00:04:07.439> going<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.620> glue<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.950> toothpick<00:04:08.430> in

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
and we're going to glue the toothpick in

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.229 
and we're going to glue the toothpick in
now<00:04:09.650> take<00:04:10.650> this<00:04:10.829> small<00:04:11.159> toothpick<00:04:11.760> put<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.060> bit

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
now take this small toothpick put a bit

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.479 
now take this small toothpick put a bit
of<00:04:12.269> glue<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.780> here<00:04:13.760> for<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:15.680> just<00:04:16.680> like<00:04:16.919> so<00:04:16.949> this

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
of glue on here for it just like so this

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.810 
of glue on here for it just like so this
is<00:04:17.609> hopefully<00:04:17.850> elastic<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:19.739> then<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.459> secure

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
is hopefully elastic and then to secure

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.490 
is hopefully elastic and then to secure
that<00:04:21.000> in<00:04:21.180> place<00:04:21.209> we<00:04:22.049> need

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.530 

this<00:04:27.010> piece<00:04:27.340> here<00:04:27.700> which<00:04:27.910> is<00:04:28.060> just<00:04:28.090> like<00:04:28.510> a

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
this piece here which is just like a

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.490 
this piece here which is just like a
little<00:04:29.160> spare<00:04:30.160> piece<00:04:30.460> of<00:04:30.670> wood<00:04:31.200> moving<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.350> to

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
little spare piece of wood moving it to

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.050 
little spare piece of wood moving it to
the<00:04:32.620> bottom<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.130> will<00:04:33.220> secure<00:04:33.910> the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
the bottom that will secure the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.140 
the bottom that will secure the
toothpick<00:04:34.510> against<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.770> rudder<00:04:36.550> piece<00:04:36.850> and

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
toothpick against the rudder piece and

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.690 
toothpick against the rudder piece and
just<00:04:40.150> enough<00:04:40.540> glue<00:04:40.870> left<00:04:41.200> here<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:43.270> glue<00:04:44.700> the

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
just enough glue left here to glue the

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.630 
just enough glue left here to glue the
elevator<00:04:46.450> on<00:04:46.780> so<00:04:47.500> we'll<00:04:47.650> just<00:04:47.860> smear<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.310> thin

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
elevator on so we'll just smear a thin

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:56.910 
elevator on so we'll just smear a thin
layer<00:04:48.850> on<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:50.380> bottom<00:04:50.800> like<00:04:51.610> so<00:04:55.380> just<00:04:56.380> eyeball

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
layer on the bottom like so just eyeball

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.900 
layer on the bottom like so just eyeball
for<00:04:57.190> Center<00:04:57.580> and<00:04:58.200> touch<00:04:59.200> it<00:04:59.410> off<00:04:59.700> now<00:05:00.700> we're

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
for Center and touch it off now we're

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.260 
for Center and touch it off now we're
going<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.060> trim<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.510> extra<00:05:01.750> tissue<00:05:02.140> now<00:05:02.530> I

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
going to trim the extra tissue now I

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.270 
going to trim the extra tissue now I
like<00:05:04.270> triangles

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
like triangles

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.330 
like triangles
some<00:05:06.280> people<00:05:06.550> make<00:05:07.030> this<00:05:07.210> round<00:05:07.540> instead<00:05:08.340> it's

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
some people make this round instead it's

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.460 
some people make this round instead it's
up<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:09.760> you<00:05:10.680> make<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.860> rudder<00:05:12.360> triangle<00:05:13.470> like

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
up to you make the rudder triangle like

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.700 
up to you make the rudder triangle like
so<00:05:14.500> so<00:05:15.280> this<00:05:15.430> piece<00:05:15.640> is<00:05:15.670> now<00:05:16.030> complete<00:05:16.710> this

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
so so this piece is now complete this

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.790 
so so this piece is now complete this
needs<00:05:17.950> to<00:05:18.100> dry<00:05:18.370> so<00:05:18.700> we<00:05:18.730> leave<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.180> like<00:05:19.660> so<00:05:19.990> to

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
needs to dry so we leave it like so to

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.370 
needs to dry so we leave it like so to
dry<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:22.270> wing<00:05:22.510> here<00:05:23.370> isn't<00:05:24.370> dry<00:05:24.640> yet<00:05:24.700> but<00:05:25.380> if

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
dry the wing here isn't dry yet but if

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.470 
dry the wing here isn't dry yet but if
we<00:05:26.800> put<00:05:27.669> the<00:05:27.850> winglets<00:05:28.270> up<00:05:28.830> like<00:05:29.830> so<00:05:30.300> trick<00:05:31.300> is

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
we put the winglets up like so trick is

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.750 
we put the winglets up like so trick is
hold<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:31.840> down<00:05:32.169> start<00:05:32.590> at<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.770> bottom<00:05:32.919> work

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
hold that down start at the bottom work

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.420 
hold that down start at the bottom work
your<00:05:34.000> way<00:05:34.120> up<00:05:34.350> and<00:05:35.350> we<00:05:35.590> give<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:35.950> haircut

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
your way up and we give it a haircut

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.610 
your way up and we give it a haircut
simply<00:05:39.430> I<00:05:39.730> like<00:05:40.419> triangles<00:05:40.900> make<00:05:41.350> that<00:05:41.590> a

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
simply I like triangles make that a

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.230 
simply I like triangles make that a
triangle<00:05:43.140> and<00:05:44.140> same<00:05:44.560> on<00:05:44.590> this<00:05:45.010> side

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.450 

so<00:05:49.290> and<00:05:50.290> then<00:05:50.919> we<00:05:51.250> prop<00:05:51.729> that<00:05:51.940> to<00:05:52.150> dry

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
so and then we prop that to dry

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.850 

and<00:05:55.060> we're<00:05:55.270> ready<00:05:55.390> we<00:05:56.230> let<00:05:56.380> that<00:05:56.530> dry<00:05:56.800> and

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
and we're ready we let that dry and

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.580 
and we're ready we let that dry and
ready<00:05:57.220> to<00:05:57.280> fly
