00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 the alive and brown 92 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:14.110
 and there are very good to all vaquitas 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.369
 we are here with another epic tutorial and 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.320
 good to the naked eye as you are seeing 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.869
 you are a part of a castle which 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.610
 I invented and good what really you 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.640
 I'm going to teach today is to create an entry 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.290
 secret but very secret in these 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.970
 stairs that you are seeing here is worth 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.650
 a very simple reston tutorial now 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.300
 you will see it will take four minutes 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.039
 with which you will not have any 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.629
 good problem because at first glance they are 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.629
 stairs are uploaded by casualties 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.600
 but it's not worth it because here in this 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.290
 little button that I have behind is worth what 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.630
 I'm going to press 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.990
 if you look at the stairs when I 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.360
 I beat it this box opens and we 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.040
 generates as a secret entrance which 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.010
 then you can not have a chest with objects 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.080
 can have what you want is worth 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.489
 and good if we press the button 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.440
 closes it's worth like this you can 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.300
 defend a castle to the fucking 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.650
 psychopaths that approach us worth what 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.380
 that you want is worth but super 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.630
 epic and good I will explain the tutorial 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.850
 by parts is not as difficult as the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.140
 secret tree which was very complicated 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.509
 I'm going to leave it here for the people who 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.130
 like and good at the end of the video I'll leave 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.800
 One little thing that you're going to like is going to 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.720
 cost a lot and nothing guys we start with 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.720
 the epic tutorial 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.750
 Now, guys, we're already in the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.880
 tutorial and the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.470
 is to create a base of four wide by 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.910
 seven long how to be seeing vale and 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.530
 if I speak faster than usual it is 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.720
 logical since I want it to last as long 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.040
 brief as possible this tutorial is good 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.210
 because once the base is made we start to 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.130
 build the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.450
 create as a multiplication sign in 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.430
 the second in the second row I'm going to 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.479
 create two erase the middle one and now 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.770
 here I think as a sign of 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.840
 multiplication is worth fixing 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.340
 perfect here is where the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.810
 little button with which I will put a 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.780
 drop of reston vale 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.159
 then I'm going to put a little path here and 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 I take it behind multiplication 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.990
 good value behind multiplication 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.399
 I'm going to place four repeaters and the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.649
 two of us in the middle we are going to apply three 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.869
 fish is worth 1 2 3 1 2 3 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.929
 perfect ok and the gaps that remain 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.250
 stuffed with rest so it's ok we have the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.379
 first part now we're going to go to the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.420
 back we're going to place two 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.069
 normal blocks and then two pistons 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.900
 looking up is saying one of two 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.000
 looking up and one and two looking 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.890
 up here are going to go the stairs 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.510
 that are going to be executed are worth the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.010
 we put this time I'm going to put white 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.700
 so that it is a little bit different 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.500
 OK 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.299
 then I will place another two pistons 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.610
 looking up in this 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.190
 position and we cover again with 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.210
 stairs as if I here placed a 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.610
 button 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.220
 ok and we execute it how can you 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.280
 observe the stairs are executed not of 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.720
 the way I want but they run ok 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.830
 we close again nothing happens that is 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.660
 stay up 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.210
 no matter what's good, let's continue with 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.800
 the tutorial and I will place here a 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.510
 wheel the wheel will go this way 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.890
 ok that is, let's make the form of 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.080
 a valid wheel is that I want the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.150
 people really understand it and here in 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.880
 half of the kike wheel I put a 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.190
 repeater as we go to the other 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.940
 part and we do again exactly what 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.940
 same a wheel 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.849
 here is worth and in the middle of the wheel a 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.220
 repeater and we just take it 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.299
 four droplets of reston and we put two 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.860
 here two here and we block worth this 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.629
 Reston exit blocked with a 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.970
 normal block to see there would not be to that 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.720
 it's perfect, we do the same again 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.150
 here it's worth it we just block it 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.740
 perfect, well, we have enough 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.650
 practically nothing left we go with the 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.510
 second part guys, well, let's go with the 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.980
 last part of the tutorial is the part 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.750
 most critical with which I recommend you 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.550
 that is very attentive to the gameplay ballet and 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.350
 let's go to the good mess the first thing I'm going to 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.920
 to do, it's worth fixing there, we have the 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.710
 wheels from before as I will place 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.690
 there a block is valid and this block will go 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.670
 a perfect redstone torch 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.190
 then down here we put another block and 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.050
 here is going to go a droplet then I'm going to 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.640
 place a piston facing up and 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.950
 any block like this one goes for 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.580
 make the perfect lock we put a 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.410
 block here another here up and another here 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.510
 perfect here in this we place a 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.150
 Reston droplet and to avoid contact 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.100
 with the other we put another block here 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.810
 above that is to say two wheels are created as 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.150
 you can observe it is now worth the measurement 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.100
 part of inside is worth in this part of 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.260
 inside since I'm going to place a block 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.560
 here and we're going to place two repeaters 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.380
 one here and another 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.510
 here perfect now I'm going to place a 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.270
 block here above will go a 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.889
 reston droplet as is this droplet of 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.510
 Reston must be covered and blocked 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.669
 what I do is put a block here 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.710
 anybody up here I'm going to place 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.340
 another block so that it stays locked 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:54.610
 that rest droplet 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:58.270
 we put a block here another there and another 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.430
 here it is worth what is going here 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.260
 repeater and here another repeater and already 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.660
 we have mounted the chiringuito 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.340
 If I press the little button here 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.130
 stairs goes up if I push it again 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.960
 the stairs go down and leave me open 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.430
 the secret entrance now the only thing that 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.320
 we should do is cover a little 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.449
 here I'm going to give you a little bit of 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.490
 way for you to understand it this would be 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.500
 pressed as it would be 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.170
 escaleritas albert sorry there 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.940
 and up here for the same reason we continue 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:30.200
 we continue creating the stairs like this 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.310
 the truth is that it is a pass as you have 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.960
 observed the tutorial does not have 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.520
 practically nothing because I explain it very 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.290
 brief and very well if you have had any 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.400
 doubt do not worry, check out the 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.110
 tutorial that you're going to have no 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.850
 problem and well let's check that 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.800
 this really works is worth this 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.960
 just cover up and I tell you we cover 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.760
 here in here is that I can not take 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.849
 There is now 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.800
 and we cover again a little bit here 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.959
 so I think that is enough 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.179
 my mother is worth great now 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:57.649
 simply so this also covered not 

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:59.809
 I think good everyone that gives you the 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:02.119
 way that it comes out of the udders worth I'll 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:03.919
 to click the little button and here it would be 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:06.770
 our secret entrance our treasure chest 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.679
 that we want to put, it is worth fixing what 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.479
 Nice room is beautiful and lovely 

00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:13.129
 good guys you have had some doubt and 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.539
 after reviewing the video you have not 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.969
 got it done do not worry because 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.469
 I left you in the description the link 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:20.719
 with the download of these ladders 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.519
 but his thing is that you're going to do it 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:24.860
 these little things and I want you to tell me in

 comments if you want me to bring a 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.360
 series of castles to make a 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.949
 super epic automatic castle is worth it 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.289
 you know that I started on youtube bringing 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:35.240
 a super epic castle which had 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.309
 millions of visits from that in fact I 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.019
 I put everyone's number one in 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:40.159
 castles then I want you to tell me 

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:41.809
 in comments if you want me to bring 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.490
 something towards the channel a very series 

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:46.219
 short but very beautiful, and that 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.589
 enjoy all and nothing guys we 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:50.509
 we see in upcoming gameplays by the way 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:53.569
 I'm going to tell you a trick that you have 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:56.050
 asked and is that you tell me how can I 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.879
 see here in a cinematic way 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.970
 hi is worth the camera moves in a way 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:02.830
 very soft very sensual very sexy sexy baby 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.650
 and I'll explain how it is worth 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:09.009
 simply in controls it is worth low 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:11.800
 now down you have where are you 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:13.889
 acn not here perfect you will change 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.360
 change the layer change or you'll end 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:18.400
 kinematics is worth it then you put a key 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.440
 anybody I have put the f8 because I 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.030
 very comfortable and is already pushing the what 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.849
 execute and if I push it again by the 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.259
 it took off the pulse works the cala quito
