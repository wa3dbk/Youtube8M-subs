00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello to you all danil and today we 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.900
 I want to show more accurately tell very 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.450
 interesting thing and gta 5 which came out on 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.730
 while in general the situation is like this 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.320
 Minimum system requirements etazhki 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:28.170
 that is, everything is fine with me except 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:31.410
 I have one video card is not on the geek she 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.540
 yes, I have 512 megabytes 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.050
 at 512 megabytes overall i was saddened by 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.820
 of this 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.120
 Well, I still thought it would be fine 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.579
 because still 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.100
 I checked compatibility through steam and 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.510
 He told me that I have a computer 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.699
 corresponds to the minimum system 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.410
 requirements 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:59.600
 In general, I shorter downloaded gta-shku and she 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.090
 did not go by the way but I went 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.820
 so that 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.600
 Many people will probably be happy because 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.750
 what is possible you are not so systemic 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.170
 requirements 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.770
 but can not be a little less but I 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.660
 I went to the clock even show right now 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 I will show my video card that is, but I have 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:24.570
 not on geek even here please me 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.700
 nvidia geforce g force 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.950
 250 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.070
 on 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.490
 512 megabytes and it says that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.970
 minimum system requirements 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.760
 on on geek yes so rockstar rockstar 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.070
 is trying 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.120
 fool broken players 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.030
 but of course the game rolls still downloaded 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.470
 pirates so maybe litsuhi me 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.229
 it would be even better 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.619
 a short very generally was busy for a long time 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.900
 everything went all went of course there 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.900
 some say so 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.490
 general look 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.140
 conditions are direct to the game, that is, you must 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:18.480
 to play in this resolution 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.730
 resolution of 800 by 600 and of all sabretache 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.160
 does not lag vata cool on video 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.630
 perhaps it will be because of the bandikama lays but 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.660
 without bandikama 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.000
 and play calmly even though they are so 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.280
 permission well and grafon bring Jew 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.920
 the minimum will still be at 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.480
 I donâ€™t even go to the season 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.069
 game settings now she is only 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.069
 will start that is it will be loaded 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.900
 so it's very nice knowing the thing that I 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.480
 even the computer does not fit the system 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.080
 requirements I can play my favorite 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.080
 gta-shku 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.520
 and here I appear, that is 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.100
 kind of hk this is not a video this 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.820
 until I stand I can take the weapon 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.300
 here let's shoot here the tip 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.860
 skyscrapers this cops will come to me 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.690
 all functions work like this 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.610
 view switching is generally not cool 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.850
 liked see something like me and 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.450
 for a minimum of ogres he's such and such 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:49.200
 not bad even vodka before the shadow is there but 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.060
 you can see that the texture is so so on my yes 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.280
 by the way, let's show you the settings for an hour 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.790
 probably ofigegete 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:01.380
 then he sees the game settings but 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.750
 shorter look graphics 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:09.000
 then yes that just killed me i 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.620
 long laughed 868 megabytes from 512 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.900
 megabytes that is, I even have 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.750
 so much is it not used and not 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.190
 know where this is ahead is very funny 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.890
 and I will not change anything for now 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.750
 change the law is not a window well, not the best 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:29.570
 Equestrian play because when i choose 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:33.120
 let's say full screen you have it all 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.880
 shorter stretch and it turns out at all 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.680
 horrible picture 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.310
 Azar see here I can play calmly and 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.760
 lags here everything is clear of course you see 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.760
 these ones 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.430
 it's all grafon we're not going at all the game 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.810
 should not drink and 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.020
 still such 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.740
 pixel minecraft up 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.479
 cool 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.139
 let's play some 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:01.240
 show them exactly what for he doesn't go 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:05.380
 it could be for someone bright 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.300
 play it need 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.160
 what else do I want to say 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.930
 pirates to install install 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.550
 [music] 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.550
 diverticulum of all these account 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.500
 because of the other parts that will go on foot 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.070
 general 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.070
 pirate 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.470
 in drove 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.470
 eat clear points here to 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.370
 stand okay I will not put the foil 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.940
 still want to walk normally 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.480
 to talk 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.610
 shorter than the town 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.249
 so you 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.319
 it works of course but 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:46.659
 here are some missions alone not 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:49.809
 work so i cut off all in a stranger 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.379
 and pass the mission probably only 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:54.039
 litsuhi 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:58.269
 Well litsuhu I do not think to buy all the same 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:00.959
 play in this resolution so it's easier 

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:04.820
 go to the market buy normal vidyuhi 

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:07.450
 already play adequate 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.500
 he and look well it's just even his 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.410
 the minimum is the most minimal 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.430
 grafonom car just fire 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.430
 you see then 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.770
 the subwoofer is installed and wears it 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.790
 trouble signals February 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:29.969
 fail 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:36.169
 than see change sees us you 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:36.169
 she looks good on me 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:43.960
 you even began to get fly away 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.960
 I want the gate closed 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.899
 that's a static ride 

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:54.040
 but all I wanted to tell you that is 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:56.140
 so funny 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.390
 I do not know yet far tank but we will see 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.250
 old bets could make a game 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.350
 a little bit smaller 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.620
 system requirements meaning you see 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.550
 what have i got 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.490
 even with mia vidyukhy game not logan 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.990
 I can basically only play 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.520
 preferably of course litsuhu 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.180
 Well, such an interesting fact 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.380
 maybe someone 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.820
 pupil 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.980
 eased wilderness meaning you can 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.610
 try to download on your weak 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.430
 computer 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:26.820
 floor to buy at least play what 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:29.610
 permission to jump run garbage 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:32.100
 deal all with you was dale
