up<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.659> down<00:01:45.720> buttons<00:01:46.229> right<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.670> hard<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
up and down buttons right here hard to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.030 
up and down buttons right here hard to
make<00:01:47.939> out<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.210> camera<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.990> assure<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.860> they

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
make out on camera but I assure you they

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
make out on camera but I assure you they
are<00:01:50.070> there<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.299> full<00:01:51.750> access

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
are there then you have like full access

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.830 
are there then you have like full access
to<00:01:52.259> all<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.619> your<00:01:52.890> ports<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.520> controls<00:01:53.840> for

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
to all of your ports and controls for

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.179 
to all of your ports and controls for
some<00:01:55.079> that's<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> negative<00:01:55.770> like

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
some that's going to be a negative like

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.149 
some that's going to be a negative like
the<00:01:56.369> bezel<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.880> completely<00:01:57.420> exposed<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.560> if

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
the bezel is completely exposed so if

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.499 
the bezel is completely exposed so if
you're<00:01:59.310> someone<00:01:59.610> that's<00:01:59.670> hard<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.180> your<00:02:00.299> phone

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
yeah it's probably going to take a bit

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.030 
yeah it's probably going to take a bit
of<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.280> beating<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.479> also<00:02:03.840> prop<00:02:04.770> up

as<00:02:24.060> far<00:02:24.300> as<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.569> flap<00:02:24.810> goes<00:02:25.110> I'm<00:02:25.709> kind<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
as far as the flap goes I'm kind of a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.619 
as far as the flap goes I'm kind of a
little<00:02:26.190> bit<00:02:26.550> bothered<00:02:26.940> by<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.150> fact<00:02:27.239> that<00:02:27.480> it

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
little bit bothered by the fact that it

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.839 
little bit bothered by the fact that it
doesn't<00:02:27.959> rest<00:02:28.230> comfortably<00:02:28.650> down<00:02:29.190> I'm<00:02:29.550> sure

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
doesn't rest comfortably down I'm sure

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.720 
doesn't rest comfortably down I'm sure
though<00:02:30.599> after<00:02:31.110> time<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.680> once<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.430> leather

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
though after time and once this leather

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.759 
though after time and once this leather
kind<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.120> gets<00:02:33.269> worked<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.140> probably<00:02:34.680> will

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
kind of gets worked in it probably will

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.890 
kind of gets worked in it probably will
stay<00:02:34.980> closed<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:35.580> for<00:02:35.790> right<00:02:35.940> now<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.629> does

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
stay closed but for right now it does

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.800 
stay closed but for right now it does
kind<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.230> flop<00:02:37.590> up<00:02:37.970> when<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.360> know<00:02:39.480> when<00:02:39.690> it

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
kind of flop up when it you know when it

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.509 
kind of flop up when it you know when it
shouldn't<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.470> again<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.920> do<00:02:41.010> have<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.370> lined

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
shouldn't and again I do have it lined

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.490 
shouldn't and again I do have it lined
up<00:02:41.730> pretty<00:02:42.000> well<00:02:42.120> at<00:02:42.720> first<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:43.080> thought<00:02:43.290> well

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
up pretty well at first I thought well

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.869 
up pretty well at first I thought well
maybe<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.769> don't<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.129> lined<00:02:44.280> up<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:44.670> I

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
maybe I don't have it lined up but I

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.850 
maybe I don't have it lined up but I
think<00:02:45.330> as<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.630> mentioned<00:02:45.989> over<00:02:46.140> time<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.680> more

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
think as I mentioned over time the more

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.400 
think as I mentioned over time the more
you<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> use<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.510> more<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.870> kind<00:02:49.349> of

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
you I use this the more this kind of

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.740 
you I use this the more this kind of
scene<00:02:49.799> gets<00:02:50.040> broken<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.549> it'll<00:02:51.150> rest<00:02:51.420> more

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
scene gets broken in it'll rest more

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.360 
scene gets broken in it'll rest more
comfortably<00:02:51.989> there's<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.950> little<00:02:53.069> bit<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.250> a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
comfortably there's a little bit of a

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.160 
comfortably there's a little bit of a
gap<00:02:53.610> there<00:02:53.640> as<00:02:54.060> well<00:02:54.239> on<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.480> back<00:02:54.690> let<00:02:54.989> me<00:02:55.049> see

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
gap there as well on the back let me see

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.710 
gap there as well on the back let me see
if<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.349> hold<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.799> like<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:57.030> can<00:02:57.180> see<00:02:57.390> there

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
if I hold it like that you can see there

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.199 
if I hold it like that you can see there
and<00:02:58.019> that's<00:02:58.470> where<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.950> hinge<00:02:59.310> mechanism<00:02:59.610> is

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
and that's where that hinge mechanism is

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.569 
and that's where that hinge mechanism is
for<00:03:00.989> propping<00:03:01.560> your<00:03:01.709> phone<00:03:01.890> up<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.310> doesn't

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
for propping your phone up that doesn't

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:03.770 
for propping your phone up that doesn't
bother<00:03:02.670> me<00:03:02.879> I<00:03:03.000> realize<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.480> that's

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
bother me I realize that that's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.229 
bother me I realize that that's
functional<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:05.129> see<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.400> there<00:03:05.459> on<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.000> top

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
functional you see it there on the top

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.100 
functional you see it there on the top
as<00:03:06.599> well<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:08.010> really<00:03:08.879> like<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.299> design<00:03:09.690> you

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
as well so I really like this design you

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.050
