00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
mode i should say these four panels down

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.530 
mode i should say these four panels down
here<00:02:10.670> are<00:02:10.760> customizable<00:02:11.510> in<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.660> full<00:02:11.840> game

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.330 

and<00:02:15.930> if<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:16.379> were<00:02:16.530> playing<00:02:16.799> in<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.920> other<00:02:17.099> mode

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and if we were playing in the other mode

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.819 
and if we were playing in the other mode
we<00:02:18.239> wouldn't<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.689> the<00:02:18.810> touch<00:02:18.959> panel<00:02:19.170> or<00:02:19.500> just

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
we wouldn't have the touch panel or just

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.069 
we wouldn't have the touch panel or just
so<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.159> way<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.310> works<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.909> pro<00:02:21.420> mode<00:02:21.629> you

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
so the way it works with a pro mode you

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.479 
so the way it works with a pro mode you
can<00:02:22.109> do<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.769> do<00:02:22.859> all<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.129> specials

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
can do you have to do all the specials

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.250 
can do you have to do all the specials
manually<00:02:24.000> which<00:02:24.629> is<00:02:24.719> what<00:02:24.840> I've<00:02:24.959> spent<00:02:25.140> my

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
pro mode you'd have to do all of your

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.170 
pro mode you'd have to do all of your
special<00:02:47.129> inputs<00:02:47.400> manually<00:02:47.819> but<00:02:47.939> you<00:02:48.030> can

still map button combinations so for

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.110 
still map button combinations so for
instance<00:02:49.829> like<00:02:50.189> Zangief<00:02:50.609> spinning<00:02:50.939> pile

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
all three kicks it can be a little

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.800 
all three kicks it can be a little
tricky<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.139> hit<00:02:55.409> that<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.799> 3ds<00:02:56.720> set<00:02:57.720> up

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.569 
tricky to hit that on the 3ds set up
here<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.620> could<00:02:58.739> map<00:02:58.980> for<00:02:59.159> instance<00:02:59.430> all

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
here so you could map for instance all

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
again you can map different combinations

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.159 
again you can map different combinations
down<00:03:50.519> here<00:03:50.760> on<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:50.879> bottom<00:03:51.000> buttons<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.810> you
