00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.919
 Hi there, another video from the fashion department 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.759
 forests and today decided to tell them 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.289
 some nuances are very helpful 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.980
 programs with which it is convenient 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.529
 edit to anyone called 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.810
 Altai plus plus 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.029
 the program is free it can be easily found 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.869
 on her official website 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.499
 the installation process is extremely simple 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.529
 so dwell on 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.960
 it can't 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.330
 I have been using it for a long time and it is nicer 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.590
 also more convenient than the standard window 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.620
 her boy is so wide that it allows 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.330
 ease of falling complicated operation and 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.570
 to save time 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.380
 In this I will only say the same about those functions. 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.350
 which in my opinion is a new order and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.800
 the opponent he amendments 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.790

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.120
 first of all from him good advice 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.260
 first yes it is together dixie hard to choose 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.660
 language in my opinion is most clearly it 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.589
 java script 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.780
 also added and useful points 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.040
 clicking on the curly brackets we will see where 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.950
 it closes following the syntax 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.460
 other things as well as one comma can 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.240
 could not work correctly 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.290
 and second 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.780
 if pali contains a large amount 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.330
 the recommended lines will be plus 0 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.180
 this way we will minimize all strings 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.220
 here are the pros 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.370
 very comfortably 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.820
 if you didn't pick me sexist language then 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.420
 the blocks will not collapse

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.120
 opening multiple files in one 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.980
 the program 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.430
 It is very convenient for work and just 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.370
 switch between them what time
