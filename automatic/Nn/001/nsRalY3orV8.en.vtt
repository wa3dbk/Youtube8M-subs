a ps4 and the reason I am using my phone

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.919 
a ps4 and the reason I am using my phone
is<00:00:28.050> because<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.099> cannot<00:00:29.689> record<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.750> screen

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
is because you cannot record the screen

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
is because you cannot record the screen
with<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> ps4<00:00:31.529> capture<00:00:32.040> stuff<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> would

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
with the ps4 capture stuff and I would

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.770 
with the ps4 capture stuff and I would
usually<00:00:32.969> rip<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.020> off<00:00:34.050> Facebook<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.780> post

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
usually rip that off Facebook and post

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.840 
usually rip that off Facebook and post
it<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.110> YouTube<00:00:37.469> or<00:00:37.620> whatever<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.430> can't<00:00:38.730> do
