tolerance 05 50 this knife was released
in<00:00:17.460> early<00:00:17.690> 2012<00:00:18.690> around<00:00:19.530> the<00:00:19.710> same<00:00:20.010> time<00:00:20.039> as

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
in early 2012 around the same time as

the eagerly expected zero tolerance 05
60<00:00:23.490> which<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.300> also<00:00:24.510> hinder<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.050> design<00:00:25.380> though

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190 
60 which is also hinder in design though

60 which is also hinder in design though
basically<00:00:26.820> zero<00:00:27.300> tolerance<00:00:27.539> we're<00:00:28.020> competing

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
basically zero tolerance we're competing

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.250 
basically zero tolerance we're competing
with<00:00:28.619> themselves<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:30.000> top<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.020> first

let's<00:00:50.879> go<00:00:51.030> quickly<00:00:51.359> over<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.809> specifications

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
let's go quickly over the specifications

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.209 
let's go quickly over the specifications
the<00:00:53.879> blade<00:00:54.089> length<00:00:54.299> is<00:00:54.629> 90<00:00:55.409> millimeters<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the blade length is 90 millimeters and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.809 
the blade length is 90 millimeters and
the<00:00:56.760> handle<00:00:57.030> length<00:00:57.209> is<00:00:58.219> 150<00:00:59.219> millimeters

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
the handle length is 150 millimeters

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.149 
the handle length is 150 millimeters
which<00:01:00.329> makes<00:01:00.659> it<00:01:00.869> an<00:01:00.989> overall<00:01:01.440> length<00:01:01.679> of<00:01:02.010> two

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159

this<00:02:14.890> was<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.070> reaction<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.850> tidy<00:02:16.060> tent<00:02:16.450> in

the stiff lock bar but i'm not sure if

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.470 
the stiff lock bar but i'm not sure if

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
same drill holes but the old clip wasn't

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.490 
same drill holes but the old clip wasn't
close<00:03:54.050> in<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.350> box<00:03:55.090> yeah<00:03:56.090> well<00:03:56.570> that's<00:03:56.870> better

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
close in the box yeah well that's better

than this but still it makes me frown
fortunately<00:04:01.310> I'm<00:04:01.550> right-handed<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.660> this

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
fortunately I'm right-handed so this

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.160 
fortunately I'm right-handed so this
doesn't<00:04:03.680> concern<00:04:03.890> me<00:04:04.100> directly<00:04:04.610> so<00:04:05.170> let's

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
doesn't concern me directly so let's

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.010 
doesn't concern me directly so let's
just<00:04:06.470> say<00:04:06.740> this<00:04:07.310> was<00:04:07.520> intended<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.240> be<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.690> fully

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
just say this was intended to be a fully

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.110 
just say this was intended to be a fully
ambidextrous<00:04:09.260> knife<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.890> knife<00:04:12.920> is<00:04:13.340> screwed

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
ambidextrous knife the knife is screwed

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.010 
ambidextrous knife the knife is screwed
together<00:04:14.270> with<00:04:14.720> like<00:04:15.200> torque<00:04:15.530> screws

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020

unfortunately three different sizes the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.660 
unfortunately three different sizes the
pivot<00:04:21.200> screw<00:04:21.790> requires<00:04:22.790> a<00:04:22.850> smaller<00:04:23.210> bit<00:04:23.540> and

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
pivot screw requires a smaller bit and

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.840 
pivot screw requires a smaller bit and
the<00:04:25.670> clip<00:04:25.880> screws<00:04:26.210> an<00:04:26.750> even<00:04:27.200> smaller<00:04:27.290> bit

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
the clip screws an even smaller bit

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.210 
the clip screws an even smaller bit
there<00:04:28.850> is<00:04:28.970> no<00:04:29.180> back<00:04:30.020> spacer<00:04:30.320> which<00:04:30.590> allows<00:04:30.920> for

there is no back spacer which allows for

there is no back spacer which allows for
