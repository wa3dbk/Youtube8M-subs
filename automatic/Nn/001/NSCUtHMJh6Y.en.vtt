00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:01.339
 magic debug 

00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:04.100
 oh well it depends it's really I can not answer you that the 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.310
 characters who have been working on stage for a very long time 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.120
 the ones that pop up% and almost on TV I needed to provide the 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.260
 material sponsors any of which the character's text needed that 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.269
 I'm going to look for them 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.230
 things that I could pretty much know 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.510
 that's basic in total there hand and I congratulate them 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.100
 aiming at the cafÃ©-theater because I made Tuesday the lenga in the 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.560
 north a movie scene in the back against serves as a character like 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.490
 for example tile totally invented in an hour but in an hour what I 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.300
 say no 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.790
 certainly he was bad parmalat and was inspired me to 1 on 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.550
 several days maybe even several months 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.000
 there are some on which you really rowed you loved 26 year old mom 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 was not a little rogue 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.230
 yes I did once we do not take into account the reality indeed it does the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.210
 Nine 9 street station and stage with actors 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.780
 no but she said 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.310
 and the special characters was a step 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.390
 I would love spying but absent he had all the time and I know 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.950
 he's the eldest 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.070
 the Pakistani army did what I did a skit like that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.250
 mauritius they do not fear the hit 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.550
 totally burlesque blindness and then I did not care who we do not know 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.070
 which origin I'm talking about 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.930
 it's a character who is not returned to the case for example it means that 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.710
 if there is a breakaway I do not know how to do it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.030
 for others on the other hand and vietnam armenia why she is the enemy of the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.560
 mauritius like you while her lover 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.260
 at the last festival 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.190
 quit at nantes just for laughing you've filmed and hired rise 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.190
 absolutely and villa rent 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.380
 no 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.070
 it's a mega mega download 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.670
 and then it's true that when we see it we say we're almost too fast 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.740
 see in the pond by announcing Monday morning but with time and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.070
 wedding rings and pool 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.510
 I love my elders 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.430
 well yes once we have to go to the end of the thing what and she is already 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.620
 so good that I wanted so caricatural but stephen fry then we 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.760
 believes that a digital device 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.350
 for the moment we can laugh about it 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.520
 and then to come back on the room the bus shelter so c I believe will be the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.259
 first time you're with a partner on stage on no coin 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.569
 theater built since 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.729
 you started with top models in lyon 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.800
 - that was really humorous ride time too but more than two cafes 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.039
 theaters% you had in halves 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.339
 and the fears of being with a partner again 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.689
 I wanted to because otherwise I would not have already done the president 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.139
 would be informed about one of the magnets does not refuse her buttocks finally fascinating 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.739
 not in writing but I mean it was the logic wanted that the 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:25.409
 consistency 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.859
 so if I did there is really a lack 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.139
 p it's still very eager to share in the game of om it's 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.139
 something very pleasant but Franco-German pressures 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.949
 a book what's going on benefit to reuters an Arab League official 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.429
 yesterday after a while touring in this sense a little lonely at no time in 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.729
 trains crazy laughs on stage we want who is much more who is 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.739
 more permits the man obviously that was the best 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.249
 way to find his victim 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:51.559
 and if you were not afraid to be with a partner just catching 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.559
 of the year the flaw of flying hours the only one on stage 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.799
 it's punishment 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.889
 the dad will launch in September 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.699
 to work, she assures 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:14.899
 here 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:17.829
 it is usually not necessarily obvious all of a sudden 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.279
 share the stage with actors who have other input habits 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.369
 selected solitary in the seventh cycle 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.319
 the golf is huge but it's still a little before so that the 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.629
 five young people also work with philippe sohier 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.409
 the director who made it so we could we were all three 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.809
 in the same boat for at least a year 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:36.360
 but I think boss 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.460
 so the euro goes beyond saying I do not have the pressure but it's not 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.979
 necessarily because 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.179
 for florence 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.659
 in 2008 the five scenes of looting 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.419
 to play tomorrow 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.189
 wanted to know where we're going from 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.919
 goes into detail what reminds us that the sea 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.399
 and many others 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:59.329
 yesterday and I was chatting with six years before and the presentation he was with 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.669
 we the l1 before the eternal is still many Quebecers to repair them 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.049
 yes and in a fabric come but that does not have with a camera that has us 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.249
 followed behind the scenes 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:11.670
 we have it where we saw it you run and 10 and especially did not let him go 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.519
 did not want to let go otherwise it's fucking what he meant by that a 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.459
 passenger ballet 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.519
 No but 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.430
 this time it's the most important in a room and it's not because 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.430
 that you're ready to 1,206 do not get tired kind of situation 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.889
 oracle is threatened by the war in afghanistan since early 2010 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.169
 around the tables 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.550
 it is true that we are on France 4 in a world 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.379
 now he knows it's super important for my abandonment we say it must be the 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.650
 to say again say that to return to households is when we are together that we 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.749
 speak and listen 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.749
