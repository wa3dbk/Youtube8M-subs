triple<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> time<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.119> was<00:01:30.270> really

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
triple the time because I was really

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.060

around<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.490> lot<00:01:32.610> easier<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.180> now<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.329> had<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
around a lot easier but now I had to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.240

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
imagine a higher center of gravity makes

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.469 
imagine a higher center of gravity makes
it<00:01:43.439> trickier<00:01:43.770> yeah<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.490> does<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.210> got<00:01:45.360> to
