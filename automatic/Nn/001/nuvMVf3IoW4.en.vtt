eyes the tiny mica flakes in the

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.160 
eyes the tiny mica flakes in the
pigments<00:00:33.250> creates<00:00:33.670> this<00:00:33.850> beautiful<00:00:34.600> metallic

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170

non-toxic and safe and they are

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.779 
non-toxic and safe and they are
colorfast<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:40.359> they<00:00:40.510> won't<00:00:40.719> fade<00:00:40.989> over<00:00:41.199> time

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789

and I'm going to show two different
variations<00:00:46.899> of<00:00:47.109> how<00:00:47.469> to<00:00:47.530> create<00:00:47.920> this<00:00:48.480> glass

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
variations of how to create this glass

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.290 
variations of how to create this glass
object<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.319> the<00:00:51.129> first<00:00:51.339> is<00:00:51.550> with<00:00:51.789> blended

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
object and the first is with blended

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.599 
object and the first is with blended
pigment<00:00:52.780> and<00:00:52.960> you'll<00:00:53.199> notice<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:53.739> color<00:00:54.069> is<00:00:54.550> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.630 
use as many colors as you'd like put a
little<00:01:56.780> bit<00:01:56.930> of<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.200> pigment<00:01:57.590> inside<00:01:58.430> the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
little bit of the pigment inside the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.169 
little bit of the pigment inside the
palette<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:05.020> you'll<00:02:06.020> be<00:02:06.140> ready<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.410> create

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
palette and you'll be ready to create

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.930 
palette and you'll be ready to create
now<00:02:08.179> with<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.869> second<00:02:09.260> one<00:02:09.610> I'm<00:02:10.610> going<00:02:10.880> to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
now with the second one I'm going to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.230 
now with the second one I'm going to
actually<00:02:11.060> take<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:11.690> one<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.490> remove<00:02:13.490> the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
actually take this one and remove the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.040 
actually take this one and remove the
hook<00:02:14.420> again<00:02:15.190> with<00:02:16.190> this<00:02:16.400> technique<00:02:16.820> I'm<00:02:17.600> going

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
hook again with this technique I'm going

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.790 
hook again with this technique I'm going
to<00:02:18.260> pour<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.740> adhesive<00:02:19.340> in<00:02:21.580> in<00:02:22.780> four

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
to pour the adhesive in in four

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.110 
to pour the adhesive in in four
different<00:02:24.800> lines

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
different lines

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.180 
different lines
trying<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.560> make<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.040> little<00:02:29.250> bit<00:02:30.170> separate

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.350 

so<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.400> see<00:02:35.720> there<00:02:36.720> are<00:02:37.970> lines<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.239> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
so you can see there are lines of the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.420 
so you can see there are lines of the
adhesive<00:02:39.750> inside<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.500> I'm<00:02:41.250> going<00:02:41.400> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
adhesive inside there and I'm going to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.449 
adhesive inside there and I'm going to
take<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.819> little<00:02:41.970> scoop<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.659> a<00:02:43.370> little<00:02:44.370> bit

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
take the little scoop and a little bit

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:52.220 
take the little scoop and a little bit
of<00:02:44.519> pigment<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:46.280> scoop<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.459> right<00:02:47.519> into<00:02:51.230> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
of pigment and scoop it right into the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:00.020 
of pigment and scoop it right into the
little<00:02:52.500> hole<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.489> object

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.780 

I'm<00:03:00.810> looking<00:03:01.470> insights<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.100> make<00:03:02.250> sure<00:03:02.459> that

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
I'm looking insights to make sure that

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.480 
I'm looking insights to make sure that
the<00:03:03.060> pigment<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:05.450> adhering<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.980> adhesive

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
the pigment is adhering to the adhesive

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.949 
the pigment is adhering to the adhesive
the<00:03:08.640> sparkle<00:03:09.030> fuse<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.360> put<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.780> there

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
the sparkle fuse that I put in there

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.240 
the sparkle fuse that I put in there
before<00:03:11.240> so<00:03:12.240> this<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.569> a<00:03:12.600> really<00:03:13.130> kind<00:03:14.130> of

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
before so this is a really kind of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.000 
before so this is a really kind of
random<00:03:14.700> process<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.959> can<00:03:16.170> get<00:03:16.800> some

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
random process and you can get some

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.470 
random process and you can get some
really<00:03:17.250> fun<00:03:17.670> designs<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:18.870> definitely

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
really fun designs it's definitely

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.340 
really fun designs it's definitely
something<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:22.200> very<00:03:22.760> spontaneous<00:03:23.760> and

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
something that is very spontaneous and

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.140 
something that is very spontaneous and
there's<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.709> little<00:03:26.130> bit<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.459> control<00:03:26.819> but<00:03:27.120> it's

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
there's a little bit of control but it's

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.300 
there's a little bit of control but it's
kind<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.600> it's<00:03:28.260> kind<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.530> fun<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.739> kind<00:03:29.069> of<00:03:29.130> get

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
kind of it's kind of fun you kind of get

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.150 
kind of it's kind of fun you kind of get
all<00:03:29.580> kinds<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:30.120> different<00:03:31.080> mixtures<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.739> color

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
all kinds of different mixtures of color

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.310 
all kinds of different mixtures of color
when<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.760> get<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.300> pigment<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:33.840> there<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.230> I'm

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
when you get the pigment in there so I'm

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.380 
when you get the pigment in there so I'm
just<00:03:34.590> using<00:03:34.769> one<00:03:34.920> for<00:03:35.430> this<00:03:35.580> dry<00:03:36.000> for<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.330> little

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
just using one for this dry for a little

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.910 
just using one for this dry for a little
bit<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.900> come<00:03:37.080> back<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.500> add<00:03:37.680> more<00:03:38.580> color

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.920 

and<00:03:42.130> so<00:03:43.030> now<00:03:43.060> we're<00:03:43.330> going<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.480> take<00:03:43.690> and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
and so now we're going to take and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.400 
and so now we're going to take and
create<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.890> blended<00:03:45.340> design<00:03:45.670> on<00:03:45.940> this<00:03:46.410> glass

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
create the blended design on this glass

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.430 
create the blended design on this glass
piece<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:49.060> I'm<00:03:49.720> going<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:49.930> take<00:03:50.110> another

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
piece and I'm going to take another

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.600 
piece and I'm going to take another
little<00:03:51.220> plastic<00:03:52.000> scoop<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:53.819> pour<00:03:54.819> the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
little plastic scoop and pour the

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.720 
little plastic scoop and pour the
pigment<00:03:57.610> right<00:03:57.849> into<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.680> hole<00:04:00.040> at<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.459> top

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
pigment right into the hole at the top

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.570 
pigment right into the hole at the top
there<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.959> this<00:04:02.770> time<00:04:02.920> I'm<00:04:03.040> going<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.250> mix<00:04:03.459> a

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
there and this time I'm going to mix a

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.190 
there and this time I'm going to mix a
couple<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.970> different<00:04:04.270> colors<00:04:04.569> so<00:04:04.600> I'm<00:04:04.989> taking

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
couple of different colors so I'm taking

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.370 
couple of different colors so I'm taking
a<00:04:05.770> little<00:04:06.459> bit<00:04:06.880> of<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:09.100> fuchsia<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:10.380> putting

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
a little bit of the fuchsia and putting

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.600 
a little bit of the fuchsia and putting
that<00:04:11.560> in<00:04:11.920> here<00:04:12.519> also<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.739> then<00:04:14.739> another<00:04:15.190> one

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
that in here also and then another one

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.020 
that in here also and then another one
so<00:04:16.030> I've<00:04:16.180> got<00:04:16.329> three<00:04:16.660> different<00:04:17.169> colors<00:04:17.500> and

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
so I've got three different colors and

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.520 
so I've got three different colors and
remember<00:04:19.030> when<00:04:19.209> you're<00:04:19.389> adding<00:04:19.750> pigment<00:04:20.380> in

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
remember when you're adding pigment in

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.640 
remember when you're adding pigment in
here<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:22.180> colors<00:04:22.450> are<00:04:22.540> going<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.750> blend<00:04:23.020> so

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
here the colors are going to blend so

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.210 
here the colors are going to blend so
keep<00:04:24.310> that<00:04:24.340> in<00:04:24.520> mind<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:25.210> would<00:04:25.930> suggest

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
keep that in mind I would suggest

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.440 
keep that in mind I would suggest
working<00:04:27.220> with<00:04:27.370> maybe<00:04:27.639> two<00:04:27.910> or<00:04:27.940> three<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.389> start

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
working with maybe two or three to start

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.060 
working with maybe two or three to start
with<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.020> you<00:04:29.080> can<00:04:29.200> always<00:04:29.380> add<00:04:29.680> in<00:04:29.919> another

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
with and you can always add in another

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.460 
with and you can always add in another
color<00:04:30.520> later<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.150> then<00:04:31.810> you're<00:04:32.320> going<00:04:32.410> to

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
color later and then you're going to

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.040 
color later and then you're going to
take<00:04:32.530> your<00:04:32.970> pigment<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.240> kind<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.630> just<00:04:34.810> shake

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
take your pigment and kind of just shake

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.659 
take your pigment and kind of just shake
it<00:04:35.080> around<00:04:37.229> so<00:04:38.229> that<00:04:38.260> it<00:04:38.680> sticks<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.490> the

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
it around so that it sticks to the

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.800 
it around so that it sticks to the
sparkle<00:04:39.880> fuse<00:04:40.240> that's<00:04:40.479> inside<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:42.570> so<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.630> did

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
sparkle fuse that's inside and so I did

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.390 
sparkle fuse that's inside and so I did
a<00:04:43.840> little<00:04:43.990> bit<00:04:44.229> and<00:04:44.410> then<00:04:44.620> I'll<00:04:44.770> add<00:04:44.950> a<00:04:45.250> little

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
a little bit and then I'll add a little

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.120 
a little bit and then I'll add a little
bit<00:04:45.580> more<00:04:45.850> in<00:04:48.630> until<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.950> inside<00:04:50.950> is

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
bit more in until the inside is

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.690 
bit more in until the inside is
completely<00:04:51.789> coated<00:04:52.110> with<00:04:53.789> the<00:04:54.789> pigment

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
completely coated with the pigment

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.950 
completely coated with the pigment
a<00:04:57.710> little<00:04:58.710> bit<00:04:58.830> more<00:05:00.680> ghosts<00:05:01.680> there<00:05:02.600> so<00:05:03.600> I

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
a little bit more ghosts there so I

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.360 
a little bit more ghosts there so I
think<00:05:04.080> I<00:05:04.290> really<00:05:04.560> like<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.920> way<00:05:04.950> it's<00:05:05.160> come

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
think I really like the way it's come

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.640 
think I really like the way it's come
out<00:05:05.400> I'm<00:05:06.390> going<00:05:06.600> to<00:05:06.690> take<00:05:06.870> this<00:05:07.140> and<00:05:07.470> let<00:05:07.620> it

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
out I'm going to take this and let it

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.130 
out I'm going to take this and let it
dry<00:05:08.010> for<00:05:08.330> it'll<00:05:09.330> be<00:05:09.420> completely<00:05:09.630> dry<00:05:09.990> in<00:05:10.020> about

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
dry for it'll be completely dry in about

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.910 
dry for it'll be completely dry in about
24<00:05:10.800> hours<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.340> you<00:05:12.210> can<00:05:12.240> also<00:05:12.590> put<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.740> cap
