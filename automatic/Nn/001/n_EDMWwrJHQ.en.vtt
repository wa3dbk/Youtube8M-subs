00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.860
 my name is pear I am 38 years old I am a 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.750
 in love with sports in nature 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.330
 in 2013 face the physical challenge more 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.130
 important part of my life being part of 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.320
 an alpine expedition of five 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 months through the himalayas 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.980
 we travel only two people with the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.199
 goal of first uploading a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.710
 mountain of more than 8000 meters and make a 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.710
 documentary film 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.120
 three years ago this challenge would have been 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.070
 unthinkable 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.530
 I had been dragging an injury 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.600
 in the knees that was increasing and of 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.610
 fact forced me to leave the practice of 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.610
 high level football with 25 years 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.230
 from there I started in the world 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.640
 of athletics and the mountains but the 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.170
 discomfort in the knee were 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.810
 increasing 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.299
 in 2009 I was diagnosed with Romanesque 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.130
 grade 4 asia on the left knee 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.950
 that is, the maximum degree of alteration 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.600
 of the cartilage and that forced me to loosen 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.049
 much both in frequency and 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.549
 intensity of sports practice 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.740
 after numerous treatments in 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.259
 very successful in 2010 I visited the doctor 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.190
 luís orozco and doctor robert soler del 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.410
 medical prt equipment of the technique 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.870
 the first treatment performed was 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.510
 through platelet-rich plasma 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.040
 also called growth factors 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.990
 improve a lot and allowed me to continue 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.500
 training but it was not a solution 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.720
 definitive 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.180
 in 2011 I had a treatment with 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.010
 stem cells an innovative process where 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.229
 the blood bank also intervenes and 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.630
 fabrics of barcelona ' 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.460
 the result was spectacular in a few 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.740
 months I started to improve the pain 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.310
 disappeared completely I was able to go back to 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.799
 train very hard 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.530
 in 2012 I prepared for the marathon of 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.080
 barcelona and I enjoyed it like never before 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.450
 a time of two hours and 43 minutes and 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.120
 ending 103 of the absolute general 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.090
 in 2013 trip to nepal to be part of 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.410
 of this mountain expedition 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.150
 we traveled hundreds of kilometers and 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.970
 we ascended thousands of meters of altitude 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.400
 positive with backpacks of 20 kilos and 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.590
 I never noticed a nuisance in the end 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.200
 we climbed because of the weather but 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.150
 after 5 months of travel 50 days in 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.069
 the manaslú and three summit attempts 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.599
 we learned that the important thing was not 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.599
 to summit but the road traveled
