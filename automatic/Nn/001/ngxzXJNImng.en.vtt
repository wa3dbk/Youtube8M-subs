you press the cap and test then the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.550 
you press the cap and test then the
ground<00:01:02.649> and<00:01:02.980> then<00:01:03.219> ejected<00:01:03.789> the<00:01:04.720> circle<00:01:05.289> and

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
ground and then ejected the circle and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.590 
ground and then ejected the circle and
then<00:01:05.950> we<00:01:05.979> need<00:01:06.430> to<00:01:06.580> check<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.000> focus<00:01:07.210> this

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
then we need to check the focus this

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.180 
then we need to check the focus this
extra<00:01:08.259> coolant<00:01:09.780> tank<00:01:10.780> situation<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:11.710> when<00:01:11.979> we

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
extra coolant tank situation and when we

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.670 
extra coolant tank situation and when we
go<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.520> little<00:01:12.729> bit<00:01:13.060> down<00:01:13.300> there<00:01:13.780> is<00:01:13.960> this<00:01:14.110> extra

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
go a little bit down there is this extra

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.820 
go a little bit down there is this extra
coolant<00:01:15.100> tank<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:17.520> tourists<00:01:18.520> if<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:19.090> look<00:01:19.830> it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
coolant tank and tourists if you look it

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.690 
coolant tank and tourists if you look it
is<00:01:21.040> very<00:01:21.490> down<00:01:22.830> there<00:01:23.830> is<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.689> text<00:01:25.689> that<00:01:26.700> that

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
is very down there is the text that that

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.030 
is very down there is the text that that
marks<00:01:29.040> marks<00:01:30.060> marks<00:01:31.229> pebble<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.439> you'll<00:01:32.799> need

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
marks marks marks pebble and you'll need

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.899 
marks marks marks pebble and you'll need
to<00:01:33.220> open<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.909> cap<00:01:34.900> you<00:01:35.350> rotate<00:01:36.100> this<00:01:36.369> cap<00:01:36.670> in

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
to open that cap you rotate this cap in

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.980 
to open that cap you rotate this cap in
this<00:01:37.060> way<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:39.100> then<00:01:39.430> there<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:40.180> this<00:01:40.390> cable

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
this way and then there is this cable

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.980 
this way and then there is this cable
and

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.670 

and<00:01:44.080> I<00:01:44.710> think<00:01:45.250> that<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:47.320> when<00:01:47.619> when<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:49.680> when

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
and I think that that when when you when

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.820 
and I think that that when when you when
you<00:01:50.860> add<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.520> quick<00:01:52.180> with<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.909> we<00:01:55.500> take<00:01:56.500> the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
you add this quick with we we take the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
you add this quick with we we take the
close<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:57.990> cool<00:01:58.990> on<00:02:00.900> okay<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.170> then<00:02:02.850> when

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
close of this cool on okay and then when

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.480 
close of this cool on okay and then when
we<00:02:04.090> check<00:02:04.450> if<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:04.990> look<00:02:05.229> into<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.770> very<00:02:06.100> down

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
we check if you look into the very down

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.109 
we check if you look into the very down
there<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.630> can<00:02:07.930> see<00:02:08.200> max<00:02:08.560> level<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.850> when

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
there you can see max level and and when

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.890 
there you can see max level and and when
when<00:02:10.479> we<00:02:10.750> meet<00:02:11.230> this<00:02:11.590> car<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:13.150> can<00:02:13.209> move<00:02:13.600> that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
when we meet this car you can move that

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.060 
when we meet this car you can move that
there<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.380> liquid<00:02:15.060> moving<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:17.320> his

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
there is liquid moving and then his

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.710 
there is liquid moving and then his
sauce<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.790> now<00:02:19.690> there<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.350> enough<00:02:21.310> this

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
sauce that now there is enough this

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.860 
sauce that now there is enough this
cooler<00:02:22.720> but<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.920> course<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.580> have<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.660> learn<00:02:25.810> to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
cooler but of course I have to learn to

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.410 
cooler but of course I have to learn to
you<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.040> hot<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.459> do<00:02:27.640> if<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.150> are<00:02:28.180> in

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
you that the hot to do if you are in

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.440 
you that the hot to do if you are in
like<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> hot<00:02:29.410> area<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.700> know<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.209> stuff

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
like a hot area and you know the stuff

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.960 
like a hot area and you know the stuff
in<00:02:31.690> your<00:02:31.840> coolant<00:02:32.410> there<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.040> not<00:02:33.340> enough<00:02:33.700> is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
in your coolant there is not enough is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.140 
in your coolant there is not enough is
coolant<00:02:34.780> liquid<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:36.040> need<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.459> add<00:02:36.640> some

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
coolant liquid you need to add some

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.250 
coolant liquid you need to add some
coolant<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:38.560> theorist<00:02:39.010> idea<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.300> open

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
coolant and theorist idea that you open

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.390 
coolant and theorist idea that you open
that<00:02:41.470> gap

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
that gap

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.900 
that gap
what<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.480> just<00:02:43.810> now<00:02:44.050> in<00:02:44.319> open<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.540> there<00:02:46.590> and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
what is just now in open and there and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.390 
what is just now in open and there and
then<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.150> need<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.690> add<00:02:50.470> there<00:02:52.260> some<00:02:53.400> coolant

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
then you need to add there some coolant

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.520 
then you need to add there some coolant
liquid<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.620> here<00:02:56.620> is<00:02:56.769> one<00:02:57.280> example<00:02:57.579> that<00:02:58.530> you

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
liquid and here is one example that you

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.480 
liquid and here is one example that you
use<00:03:00.329> that<00:03:01.329> kind<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.840> coolant

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
use that kind of coolant

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.650 
use that kind of coolant
where<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.270> this<00:03:05.580> texture<00:03:06.580> pool<00:03:06.970> on<00:03:07.180> auntie
