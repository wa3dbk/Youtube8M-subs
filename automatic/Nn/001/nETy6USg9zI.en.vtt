it's important to get I think it kids

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.929 
it's important to get I think it kids
involved<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.900> rugby<00:00:25.140> from<00:00:25.380> an<00:00:25.439> early<00:00:25.650> age<00:00:25.939> you

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
involved in rugby from an early age you

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.700 
involved in rugby from an early age you
know<00:00:27.029> Premiership<00:00:28.019> players<00:00:28.320> they<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.529> sort

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.569 
of a spy to the spire to premature
playing<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:31.890> think<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.130> important<00:00:32.489> for

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
playing so I think it's important for

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.220 
playing so I think it's important for
them<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.730> start<00:00:33.030> early<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.840> good<00:00:33.989> good

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
them to start early and it's good good

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.709 
them to start early and it's good good
