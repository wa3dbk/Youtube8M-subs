00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.950 

actually<00:00:59.789> everything<00:01:00.629> will<00:01:00.780> explode<00:01:02.570> ok<00:01:03.570> so

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.860 

ok<00:03:30.480> now<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.810> can<00:03:31.049> see<00:03:31.319> I'm<00:03:31.530> over<00:03:32.190> here<00:03:32.280> and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
ok now you can see I'm over here and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
ok now you can see I'm over here and
here<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:34.129> sign<00:03:35.129> says<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.970> made<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.860> when<00:03:37.860> I

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
here is sign says you made it and when I

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.240 
here is sign says you made it and when I
walk<00:03:38.069> on<00:03:38.099> this<00:03:38.340> one<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:39.420> will<00:03:39.599> open<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.950> over

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
walk on this one it will open and over

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.440 
walk on this one it will open and over
here<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.700> will<00:03:41.849> say<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.690> won<00:03:43.700> that's<00:03:44.700> where<00:03:45.360> it

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
here it will say you won that's where it

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.509 
here it will say you won that's where it
is<00:03:46.459> turn<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.610> off<00:03:47.790> turning<00:03:48.510> off<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:49.519> survival

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
is turn it off turning off the survival

00:03:50.519 --> 00:04:00.180 
is turn it off turning off the survival
mode<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.799> here's<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.980> design<00:03:55.940> time<00:03:56.940> it

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.790 

here<00:04:00.760> we<00:04:00.880> can<00:04:01.000> see<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.300> better<00:04:01.600> from<00:04:01.810> distance

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
here we can see it better from distance

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.320 
here we can see it better from distance
when<00:04:03.220> it<00:04:03.370> says<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:05.320> want<00:04:05.950> but<00:04:06.730> not<00:04:06.940> straight

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
when it says you want but not straight

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.490 
when it says you want but not straight
because<00:04:07.600> it<00:04:08.440> was<00:04:08.650> hard<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:10.330> here<00:04:11.320> is

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
because it was hard and here is

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.370 
because it was hard and here is
underneath<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:13.330> can<00:04:13.480> see<00:04:13.660> it's<00:04:13.780> much

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
underneath you can see it's much

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.250 
underneath you can see it's much
redstone<00:04:15.360> guess<00:04:16.360> there<00:04:16.570> are<00:04:16.690> many<00:04:16.870> pressure

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
redstone guess there are many pressure

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.560 
redstone guess there are many pressure
plates<00:04:17.730> but<00:04:18.930> almost<00:04:19.930> all<00:04:20.560> of<00:04:20.769> them<00:04:20.980> added<00:04:21.880> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
plates but almost all of them added the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.770 
plates but almost all of them added the
same<00:04:22.840> thing<00:04:23.110> on<00:04:23.290> all<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.950> pressure<00:04:24.190> plates

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
same thing on all the pressure plates

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.130 
same thing on all the pressure plates
because<00:04:25.780> in<00:04:26.170> that<00:04:27.100> all<00:04:27.450> just<00:04:28.450> took<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.690> long

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
because in that all just took a long

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.910 
because in that all just took a long
time<00:04:29.170> and<00:04:29.860> they<00:04:30.640> responded

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
time and they responded

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.120 
time and they responded
ok<00:04:33.550> now<00:04:34.480> I'm<00:04:34.570> going<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:34.930> show<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.170> what

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
ok now I'm going to show you what

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.990 
ok now I'm going to show you what
happens<00:04:36.520> if<00:04:36.700> I<00:04:36.850> fail<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.590> accidentally<00:04:38.590> walk

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
happens if I fail and accidentally walk

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.950 
happens if I fail and accidentally walk
in<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.240> wall<00:04:40.420> or<00:04:41.550> if<00:04:42.550> i<00:04:42.790> press<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.930> wrong

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
in the wall or if i press the wrong

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.940 
in the wall or if i press the wrong
pressure<00:04:44.530> plane<00:04:45.180> ok<00:04:46.180> so<00:04:46.630> now<00:04:46.810> request<00:04:47.290> mr.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
pressure plane ok so now request mr.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.700 
pressure plane ok so now request mr.
universe<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:48.640> button<00:04:49.350> will<00:04:50.350> appear<00:04:50.770> I<00:04:52.710> can

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
universe it button will appear I can

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.630 
universe it button will appear I can
start<00:04:53.950> walking<00:04:54.250> over<00:04:55.590> here<00:04:57.540> now<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.570> will<00:04:58.930> go

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
start walking over here now I will go

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.730 
start walking over here now I will go
through<00:05:00.640> this<00:05:01.000> one<00:05:02.340> here<00:05:03.340> got<00:05:03.610> click<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.740> soon

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
through this one here got click and soon

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:21.870 
through this one here got click and soon
it<00:05:06.040> will<00:05:06.370> explode

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.430 

ok<00:05:22.880> now<00:05:23.180> it's<00:05:23.390> not<00:05:23.660> everything<00:05:24.140> has<00:05:24.350> exploded

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
ok now it's not everything has exploded

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.500 
ok now it's not everything has exploded
and<00:05:27.440> yeah<00:05:27.740> you<00:05:28.460> could<00:05:28.790> see<00:05:29.000> that<00:05:29.150> it<00:05:29.210> was

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
and yeah you could see that it was

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.250 
and yeah you could see that it was
lagging<00:05:30.080> that's<00:05:30.350> because<00:05:30.820> you're<00:05:31.820> a<00:05:31.850> very

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
lagging that's because you're a very

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.180 
lagging that's because you're a very
much<00:05:33.260> redstone<00:05:33.890> and<00:05:35.500> it's<00:05:36.500> too<00:05:36.710> much<00:05:36.920> for

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
much redstone and it's too much for

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.580 
much redstone and it's too much for
Minecraft<00:05:37.790> but<00:05:38.060> this<00:05:38.690> is<00:05:38.840> how<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.050> looks<00:05:39.110> I

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
Minecraft but this is how it looks I

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.290 
Minecraft but this is how it looks I
will<00:05:40.040> include<00:05:40.310> a<00:05:40.550> download<00:05:40.880> link<00:05:40.910> in<00:05:41.210> the
