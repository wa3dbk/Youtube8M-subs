00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
the Atlantic is able to carry a larger

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.880 
the Atlantic is able to carry a larger
load<00:04:37.360> of<00:04:37.540> rescue<00:04:37.930> equipment<00:04:38.170> than<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.710> deep

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
load of rescue equipment than the deep

load of rescue equipment than the deep
class<00:04:39.160> boat<00:04:39.460> including<00:04:40.450> a<00:04:40.600> spinal<00:04:41.170> board

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:15.469 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.369 

it's<00:05:15.979> a<00:05:16.069> real<00:05:16.249> teamwork<00:05:16.959> thing<00:05:17.959> when<00:05:18.139> we<00:05:18.259> have

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:18.379 
it's a real teamwork thing when we have

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:19.779 
it's a real teamwork thing when we have
someone<00:05:18.619> with<00:05:18.769> a<00:05:18.889> spinal<00:05:19.159> injury<00:05:19.550> and<00:05:19.639> that

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
someone with a spinal injury and that

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.489 
someone with a spinal injury and that
can<00:05:19.969> be<00:05:20.059> from<00:05:20.269> someone<00:05:20.569> us<00:05:20.719> on<00:05:20.869> the<00:05:20.959> rock<00:05:21.139> so<00:05:21.409> it

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:21.499 
can be from someone us on the rock so it

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:23.199 
can be from someone us on the rock so it
could<00:05:21.649> be<00:05:21.739> someone<00:05:22.129> that's<00:05:22.339> might've<00:05:23.059> jumped

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:23.209 
could be someone that's might've jumped

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:25.570 
could be someone that's might've jumped
off<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.629> pier<00:05:23.869> but<00:05:24.469> anytime<00:05:24.739> we<00:05:24.949> suspect<00:05:25.519> that

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
off the pier but anytime we suspect that

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.339 
off the pier but anytime we suspect that
there's<00:05:25.819> some<00:05:25.999> sort<00:05:26.209> of<00:05:26.330> spinal<00:05:26.719> trauma<00:05:26.959> then

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
there's some sort of spinal trauma then

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.259 
there's some sort of spinal trauma then
we'll<00:05:27.649> always<00:05:27.800> use<00:05:28.099> a<00:05:28.249> spinal<00:05:28.669> cord<00:05:28.819> until<00:05:29.059> I

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:29.269 
we'll always use a spinal cord until I

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:32.949 
we'll always use a spinal cord until I
minimize<00:05:29.749> that<00:05:30.019> movement<00:05:30.550> if<00:05:31.550> we<00:05:31.789> can<00:05:32.059> use<00:05:32.779> the

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:32.959 
minimize that movement if we can use the

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.809 
minimize that movement if we can use the
emergency<00:05:33.409> service<00:05:33.739> to<00:05:34.009> get<00:05:34.159> their<00:05:34.399> medical

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
emergency service to get their medical

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.609 
emergency service to get their medical
services<00:05:35.269> we<00:05:35.449> will<00:05:35.599> but<00:05:35.869> sometimes<00:05:36.319> they're

00:05:36.609 --> 00:05:36.619 
services we will but sometimes they're

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:38.589 
services we will but sometimes they're
inaccessible<00:05:37.009> so<00:05:37.519> we<00:05:37.669> need<00:05:37.819> to<00:05:37.969> get<00:05:38.089> missional

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
inaccessible so we need to get missional

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.839 
inaccessible so we need to get missional
first<00:05:38.839> most<00:05:39.349> people<00:05:39.559> on<00:05:39.769> the<00:05:39.889> curb<00:05:40.069> got<00:05:40.369> a

first most people on the curb got a
