00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.230
 in this presentation we will see the difference between the various types of 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.769
 close 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.829
 today we will draw 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.889
 to michael 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.470
 with more than a thousand already in the monthly 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.449
 the cartridge is formed 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.119
 it is not for this part position 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.440
 by this decree 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.600
 so I left had both internally a sponge 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 that he has hepatitis a 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.670
 ef 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.910
 asked what they are doing 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.040
 every three months one of the new models of printers in some cases 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.700
 Let's focus on the brothers 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.900
 the location of hp 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.220
 we have a model 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.600
 21 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.520
 we have the model 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.590
 27 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.570
 we have a model 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.020
 56 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.840
 we have a model 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.120
 92 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.250
 we will have a model 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.950
 94 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.120
 we have a model 74 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.020
 we have a model 96 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.880
 if you realize 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.960
 physically written has a difference 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.190
 more internally 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.190
 consequently it is distinct 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
 we also want the older ones 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.630
 during the event 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.860
 500 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.860
 about 40 immigrants 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.220
 in the 600 series 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.310
 about 40 months 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.910
 the need for the existence of 40 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.570
 also fit 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.210
 41 yen 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.610
 two more models too 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.840
 they're used 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.640
 old printers 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.790
 which is 15 45 also fits 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.760
 40 '- corner 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.809
 the particularity of cartridge cycles 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.849
 is that he does not want to expose and permanent 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.819
 then the form of the value would fall differently 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.209
 we will see later 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.199
 come on 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.299
 such a special cartridge load 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.109
 bekele of a partition here 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.019
 of exposing the region probes 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.789
 therefore this model 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.359
 you have to be especially careful so there you have to be afraid of 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.269
 ink 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.269
 that is 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.209
 when you insert needles 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.979
 and ink 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.369
 could not put one of the five amendments 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:43.899
 Otherwise 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:46.899
 it will be empty 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:51.009
 as in the comments all the cartridges 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.269
 to recharge 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.229
 are similar 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.469
 so do not mark one for you to see the procedure 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.359
 you have several options 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.399
 type of cargo 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.689
 one of them can be bad where you will need 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.899
 of a line siren 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.589
 in 20 months 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:15.589
 with a needle 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:20.389
 the toilet paper book 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.759
 maciel 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.759
 gloves not to break hands 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.659
 an attitude and quality 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.239
 as we saw earlier 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.709
 Ricardo, I think it's a hole 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.509
 in this region 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:44.509
 how can you get at it by taking 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.159
 they had 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.159
 or just sticking exactly where it was 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.469
 I studied 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.609
 let's for example load 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.369
 this cartridge 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.029
 27 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:01.739
 It would also be good for the saints. 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:02.619
 not 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:04.969
 the club is on the grand 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:06.419
 in that head 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.659
 montillo played in demineralized water 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.659
 a madness without impurities 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.590
 placing only 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.969
 two droplets 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:24.569
 about 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.379
 the chap 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.900
 and notice that living to penetrate 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.900
 with that we hope to do a voting test 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:35.479
 if the liquid penetrates 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:36.809
 You want to see that ink 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:40.120
 will leave 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.120
 With this fire, wait for some toilet paper. 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.360
 but we are here to comment 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.909
 I'll understand 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.550
 the stations are open 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.340
 then the market will be 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.900
 facilitated in this regard 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.540
 so we first changed the toilet paper a bit 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.590
 placed in office 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.599
 about having this toilet paper 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.599
 we lost of 21 different genres 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.509
 we use the hole in the cartridge 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.069
 clinically 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:18.650
 let's put 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.009
 The paint 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:21.559
 What is the role 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:23.770
 in botucatu 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.710
 to hold 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.710
 eventually to food throughout the day 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.439
 you go 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.050
 in ceremony and also that the ink 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.620
 and observing 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.659
 if nothing comes out 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.659
 on the top of the cartoon 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.569
 Never in such an urgent team. 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.690
 we got to the point 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.180
 male fell 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.919
 We had
