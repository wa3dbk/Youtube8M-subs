00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.460 
way of filming I wanted to find the
easiest<00:01:50.220> way<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.360> film<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.750> vlog<00:01:51.930> ever<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
easiest way to a film a vlog ever and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.100 
easiest way to a film a vlog ever and
the<00:01:52.590> idea<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.979> came<00:01:53.280> up<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.270> film<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the idea I came up with was to film the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.330 
the idea I came up with was to film the
whole<00:01:55.140> thing<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.560> photobooth

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
whole thing on photobooth

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.910 
whole thing on photobooth
so<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.899> photobooth<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.530> don't<00:01:58.710> need<00:01:58.890> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so with photobooth you don't need a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.580 
so with photobooth you don't need a
tripod<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.790> don't<00:01:59.969> need<00:02:00.090> lights<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:01.380> need

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
tripod you don't need lights you need

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.069 
tripod you don't need lights you need
your<00:02:01.979> laptop<00:02:02.130> fur<00:02:03.000> bugs<00:02:03.299> open<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.960> then

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
your laptop fur bugs open and then

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.899 
your laptop fur bugs open and then
that's<00:02:04.590> basically<00:02:05.130> it

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909
