00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
different than usual because of the

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.450 
different than usual because of the
digital<00:00:03.689> speed<00:00:04.200> pane<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:05.040> don't<00:00:05.130> like<00:00:05.339> to

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
digital speed pane and I don't like to

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.430 
digital speed pane and I don't like to

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
do too much digital stuff on my channel

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.870 
do too much digital stuff on my channel
I<00:00:07.560> want<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.859> keep<00:00:08.010> my<00:00:08.189> channel<00:00:08.550> mostly

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
I want to keep my channel mostly

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.749 
I want to keep my channel mostly
traditional<00:00:09.150> art<00:00:09.809> but<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.860> was<00:00:11.130> what<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.490> made

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
traditional art but this was what I made

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.129 
traditional art but this was what I made
at<00:00:11.940> my<00:00:12.030> most<00:00:12.240> recent<00:00:12.389> livestream<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.110> I

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
at my most recent livestream and I

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.780 
at my most recent livestream and I
thought<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.380> would<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.530> cool<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.830> upload<00:00:14.490> it

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
thought it would be cool to upload it

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.960 
thought it would be cool to upload it
the<00:00:15.120> thing<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.599> though<00:00:15.809> uh<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.740> wasn't<00:00:17.640> doing<00:00:17.880> a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
the thing is though uh I wasn't doing a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.820 
the thing is though uh I wasn't doing a
screen<00:00:18.330> recording<00:00:18.869> until<00:00:19.380> after<00:00:19.680> I'd<00:00:19.800> already

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
screen recording until after I'd already

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.980 
screen recording until after I'd already
sketched<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.550> out<00:00:20.699> because<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.090> forgot<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.960> I

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
sketched it out because I forgot that I

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.230 
sketched it out because I forgot that I
should<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.619> recording<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.310> Oh

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
should be recording it Oh

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.700 
should be recording it Oh
because<00:00:24.600> I'm<00:00:24.750> using<00:00:24.900> expletive<00:00:25.500> use

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
because I'm using expletive use

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.500 
because I'm using expletive use
procaster<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.369> automatically<00:00:26.849> records<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
procaster it automatically records and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.390 
procaster it automatically records and
uploads<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> livestream<00:00:28.740> server<00:00:29.039> but

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
uploads it to the livestream server but

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.009 
uploads it to the livestream server but
I'm<00:00:29.550> using<00:00:29.730> xsplit<00:00:30.179> which<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.539> way<00:00:30.810> better

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
I'm using xsplit which I like way better

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.840 
I'm using xsplit which I like way better
because<00:00:31.230> there's<00:00:31.470> way<00:00:31.679> more<00:00:31.850> customization

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
because there's way more customization

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.240 
because there's way more customization
and<00:00:33.030> features<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.719> stuff<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
and features and stuff but you have to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.130 
and features and stuff but you have to
manually<00:00:35.700> select<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.239> start<00:00:36.510> recording<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
manually select to start recording the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.260 
manually select to start recording the
footage<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.770> didn't<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.370> until<00:00:39.059> like

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
footage and I didn't do that until like

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.060 
footage and I didn't do that until like
I<00:00:39.360> forgot<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.079> till<00:00:40.230> after<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.680> sketch

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
I forgot about it till after the sketch

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.650 
I forgot about it till after the sketch
and<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.460> was<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.700> oh<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> sketch

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and I was like oh because the sketch

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.639 
and I was like oh because the sketch
probably<00:00:42.960> would<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> most<00:00:43.379> interesting

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
probably would be the most interesting

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.369 
probably would be the most interesting
part<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.370> watch<00:00:44.600> because<00:00:45.600> normally<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.350> think

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
part to watch because normally I think

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.410 
part to watch because normally I think
line<00:00:47.190> art<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.489> kind<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.730> boring<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.059> watch<00:00:48.090> but

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
line art is kind of boring to watch but

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.450 
line art is kind of boring to watch but
sketching<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.530> colouring<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:50.010> interesting

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
sketching and colouring are interesting

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.270 
sketching and colouring are interesting
but<00:00:51.030> as<00:00:51.390> you'll<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.050> very<00:00:52.440> very<00:00:52.530> simple

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
but as you'll see I do very very simple

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.069 
but as you'll see I do very very simple
coloring<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.030> picture<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.719> there's

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
coloring on this picture and there's

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
coloring on this picture and there's
actually<00:00:55.680> no<00:00:55.890> shading<00:00:56.250> except<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
actually no shading except for in the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.150 
actually no shading except for in the
eyes<00:00:57.329> because<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> style<00:00:58.980> I

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
eyes because that's just the style I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
eyes because that's just the style I
want<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.579> go<00:00:59.730> for<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.899> kicking

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
want it to go for so it's just kicking

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
want it to go for so it's just kicking
myself<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.949> didn't<00:01:02.309> record<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.760> sketch

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
wondering okay I don't do a lot of

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.200 
wondering okay I don't do a lot of
digital<00:01:46.990> art<00:01:47.380> but<00:01:48.190> when<00:01:48.340> I<00:01:48.400> do<00:01:48.550> I<00:01:48.790> was

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
digital art but when I do I was

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.760 
digital art but when I do I was
wondering<00:01:49.600> if<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:50.050> guys<00:01:50.170> wanted<00:01:50.590> me<00:01:50.650> to

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
wondering if you guys wanted me to

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.050 
wondering if you guys wanted me to
record<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.430> because<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.640> still<00:01:51.820> want<00:01:52.000> my

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
record it because I still want my

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.030 
record it because I still want my
channel<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.420> be<00:01:52.540> mostly<00:01:53.020> traditional<00:01:53.380> art<00:01:53.890> but

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
channel to be mostly traditional art but

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.950 
channel to be mostly traditional art but
there<00:01:54.160> might<00:01:54.430> be<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.880> odd<00:01:55.150> digital<00:01:55.780> thing

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
there might be the odd digital thing

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.200 
there might be the odd digital thing
like<00:01:56.140> maybe<00:01:56.350> one<00:01:56.710> every<00:01:57.040> two<00:01:57.310> months<00:01:57.759> or<00:01:57.910> even

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
like maybe one every two months or even

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.719 
like maybe one every two months or even
less<00:01:58.390> maybe<00:01:58.660> depends<00:01:59.259> with<00:02:00.130> if<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.430> feel<00:02:00.610> like

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
less maybe depends with if I feel like

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.310 
less maybe depends with if I feel like
recording<00:02:01.210> something<00:02:01.450> or<00:02:01.720> not<00:02:01.869> but<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.170> just

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
on a shoulder thing because I just think

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.170 
on a shoulder thing because I just think
it's<00:02:20.500> boring<00:02:20.980> if<00:02:21.160> it's<00:02:21.340> just<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.820> screen

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
it's boring if it's just a screen

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.850 
it's boring if it's just a screen
recording<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.959> don't<00:02:23.140> see<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.500> artists

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
recording and you don't see the artists

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.770 
recording and you don't see the artists
hand<00:02:24.190> because<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.640> just<00:02:24.730> doesn't<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.690> just

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
hand because it just doesn't it just

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.420 
hand because it just doesn't it just
doesn't<00:02:25.870> feel<00:02:26.350> right<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.709> just<00:02:26.980> don't<00:02:27.190> like

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
doesn't feel right I just don't like

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.340 
doesn't feel right I just don't like
digital<00:02:27.910> speed<00:02:28.239> paints<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.570> much<00:02:28.870> for<00:02:29.170> that

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
digital speed paints that much for that

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.620 
digital speed paints that much for that
reason<00:02:29.800> but<00:02:30.040> these<00:02:30.310> Cintiq<00:02:30.820> videos<00:02:31.239> are

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
reason but these Cintiq videos are

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.720 
reason but these Cintiq videos are
really<00:02:32.470> good<00:02:32.709> cuz<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.040> actually<00:02:33.400> see<00:02:33.640> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
really good cuz you actually see the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.190 
really good cuz you actually see the
artist<00:02:34.060> drawing<00:02:34.269> on<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.840> feels<00:02:34.989> like

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
artist drawing on it it just feels like

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.170 
artist drawing on it it just feels like
they're<00:02:35.380> drawing<00:02:35.620> on<00:02:35.739> paper<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.850> really

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
they're drawing on paper and so I really

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.509 
they're drawing on paper and so I really
enjoy<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.720> lot<00:02:37.870> more<00:02:37.930> than<00:02:38.519> traditional

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
enjoy it a lot more than traditional

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.449 
enjoy it a lot more than traditional
speed<00:02:39.730> things<00:02:40.000> like<00:02:40.590> traditional<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.860> meant

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
speed things like traditional I meant

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.759 
speed things like traditional I meant
like<00:02:42.640> your<00:02:43.360> normal<00:02:43.570> digital<00:02:44.019> speed<00:02:44.500> paint

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
like your normal digital speed paint

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.560 
like your normal digital speed paint
that's<00:02:44.980> it's<00:02:45.190> just<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.610> screen<00:02:45.880> recording<00:02:46.330> and

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
that's it's just a screen recording and

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.660 
that's it's just a screen recording and
nothing<00:02:46.900> else<00:02:47.049> so<00:02:47.320> like<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.220> said<00:02:48.340> still

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
wouldn't do many digital paintings but

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.819 
wouldn't do many digital paintings but

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
open my shop but I'll do it on my own

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.059 
open my shop but I'll do it on my own
time<00:03:37.819> so<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:39.049> is<00:03:39.200> why<00:03:39.349> I<00:03:39.379> did<00:03:39.709> really<00:03:39.950> really

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
time so that is why I did really really

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.670 
time so that is why I did really really
simple<00:03:40.730> shading<00:03:41.329> for<00:03:41.540> this<00:03:41.690> one<00:03:41.930> is<00:03:42.170> because

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
simple shading for this one is because

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.619 
simple shading for this one is because
it<00:03:43.459> was<00:03:43.609> just<00:03:43.819> gonna<00:03:43.940> it's<00:03:44.209> gonna<00:03:44.329> be<00:03:44.480> on<00:03:44.599> a

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
it was just gonna it's gonna be on a

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.569 
it was just gonna it's gonna be on a
shirt<00:03:44.930> so<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.470> think<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.799> looked<00:03:45.980> cooler<00:03:46.190> if<00:03:46.400> the

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
shirt so I think it looked cooler if the

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.550 
shirt so I think it looked cooler if the
colors<00:03:47.030> were<00:03:47.060> blockier<00:03:47.659> but<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.319> doesn't

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
colors were blockier but that doesn't

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.500 
colors were blockier but that doesn't
mean<00:03:48.620> I'll<00:03:48.739> always<00:03:48.790> do<00:03:49.790> shirt<00:03:50.060> designs<00:03:50.359> like

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
mean I'll always do shirt designs like

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.729 
mean I'll always do shirt designs like
that<00:03:50.659> like<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:50.840> already<00:03:50.989> did<00:03:51.260> one<00:03:51.440> a<00:03:51.470> couple

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
that like I already did one a couple

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.589 
that like I already did one a couple
weeks<00:03:51.859> ago<00:03:52.129> in<00:03:52.310> my<00:03:52.400> life<00:03:52.579> Shuman<00:03:53.000> I<00:03:53.120> shaded

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
weeks ago in my life Shuman I shaded

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.050 
weeks ago in my life Shuman I shaded
that<00:03:53.750> one<00:03:54.109> and<00:03:54.609> yeah<00:03:55.609> I<00:03:55.639> just<00:03:55.760> kind<00:03:55.879> of<00:03:55.970> went

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
that one and yeah I just kind of went

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.129 
that one and yeah I just kind of went
for<00:03:56.209> it<00:03:56.269> took<00:03:56.359> my<00:03:56.450> style<00:03:56.659> for<00:03:56.870> this<00:03:56.930> one

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
for it took my style for this one

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.990 
for it took my style for this one
anyways<00:03:57.889> but<00:03:58.099> that<00:03:58.220> was<00:03:58.310> my<00:03:58.430> reasoning<00:03:58.970> for

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
anyways but that was my reasoning for

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.490 
anyways but that was my reasoning for
not<00:03:59.299> shading<00:03:59.659> is<00:03:59.750> I<00:03:59.840> thought<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.109> was<00:04:00.230> really

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
not shading is I thought it was really

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.940 
not shading is I thought it was really
good<00:04:00.739> on<00:04:01.129> a<00:04:01.159> shirt<00:04:01.430> if<00:04:01.579> I<00:04:01.700> did<00:04:01.909> it<00:04:02.000> that<00:04:02.180> way

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
good on a shirt if I did it that way

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.629 
good on a shirt if I did it that way
so<00:04:03.950> yeah<00:04:04.819> bubblegum<00:04:05.690> poofy<00:04:06.409> hair<00:04:06.440> it's<00:04:07.310> blue
