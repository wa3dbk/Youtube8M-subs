of liquid liner I'm using a pin liquid
liner<00:04:53.229> which<00:04:54.229> i<00:04:54.410> think<00:04:54.470> is<00:04:54.770> best<00:04:55.070> because<00:04:55.340> it

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
liner which i think is best because it

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.439 
liner which i think is best because it
keeps<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:57.530> amount<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.340> liquid<00:04:58.850> liner<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.150> it

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
keeps the amount of liquid liner that it

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.430 
keeps the amount of liquid liner that it
gives<00:04:59.690> you<00:04:59.870> consistent<00:05:01.780> without<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:03.229> having

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
to dip it back in and sometimes you

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.939 
to dip it back in and sometimes you
