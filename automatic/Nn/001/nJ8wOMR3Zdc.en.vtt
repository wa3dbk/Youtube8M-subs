00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
going to sketch out this shape first and

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.709 
going to sketch out this shape first and
don't<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.959> scared<00:01:31.319> start<00:01:32.130> by<00:01:32.939> lining<00:01:33.179> the

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
don't be scared start by lining the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.760 
don't be scared start by lining the
lashes<00:01:34.369> so<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.609> lash<00:01:35.789> lines<00:01:36.350> just<00:01:37.350> follow<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
lashes so the lash lines just follow the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.719 
lashes so the lash lines just follow the
natural<00:01:38.039> shape<00:01:38.609> of<00:01:39.179> your<00:01:39.240> eye<00:01:39.959> and<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:41.369> tend<00:01:41.639> to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
natural shape of your eye and I tend to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.379 
natural shape of your eye and I tend to
not<00:01:41.999> go<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.619> too<00:01:43.619> far<00:01:43.950> when<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.029> have<00:01:45.119> round

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:45.389 
not go in too far when you have round

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:47.480 
not go in too far when you have round
eyes<00:01:45.599> you<00:01:45.990> need<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.289> cut<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.469> square<00:01:46.709> off<00:01:47.219> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
eyes you need to cut a square off the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.319 
eyes you need to cut a square off the
edge<00:01:48.109> so<00:01:49.490> let's<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.729> see<00:01:50.849> how<00:01:50.969> that's<00:01:51.149> going

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
edge so let's just see how that's going

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
edge so let's just see how that's going
to<00:01:51.389> go<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.929> you<00:01:52.049> also<00:01:52.229> want<00:01:52.499> it<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.709> look

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
to go and you also want it to look

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:55.919 
identical to the other one so i trace a

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:59.480 
identical to the other one so i trace a
line<00:01:56.810> upwards<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.529> a<00:01:58.619> very<00:01:58.859> rough<00:01:59.189> line

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
line upwards it's just a very rough line

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.879 
line upwards it's just a very rough line
if<00:01:59.789> you're<00:02:00.240> scared<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.599> doing<00:02:00.929> this<00:02:01.109> do<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:01.889 
if you're scared of doing this do it

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.499 
if you're scared of doing this do it
with<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.039> lighter<00:02:02.249> color<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.359> with<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
with a lighter color so do it with a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.499 
with a lighter color so do it with a
pale<00:02:03.869> cream<00:02:04.349> or<00:02:04.590> something<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.279> that's<00:02:06.209> easy

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
pale cream or something and that's easy

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.260 
pale cream or something and that's easy
to<00:02:06.810> rub<00:02:07.020> off<00:02:07.489> I'm<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> thicken<00:02:09.000> up<00:02:09.209> that

smoky<00:02:37.069> eye<00:02:37.099> I<00:02:37.459> am<00:02:37.849> making<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:38.599> part<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:39.049> my

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
smoky eye I am making this part of my

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.130 
smoky eye I am making this part of my
eye<00:02:39.610> longer<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.569> need<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.810> do<00:02:41.900> a<00:02:41.930> lot<00:02:42.110> of

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
eye longer so I need to do a lot of

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.220 
eye longer so I need to do a lot of
fakery<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.860> by<00:02:43.790> fakery<00:02:44.299> I<00:02:44.480> just<00:02:44.720> mean<00:02:44.959> by

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
fakery and by fakery I just mean by

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.180 
fakery and by fakery I just mean by
filling<00:02:45.769> in<00:02:46.450> everything<00:02:47.450> up<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.780> line

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
filling in everything up to that line

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.309 
filling in everything up to that line
with<00:02:49.190> black<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.750> just<00:02:51.230> see<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.190> side<00:02:52.549> and

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
with black so just see that side and

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.729 
with black so just see that side and
just<00:02:54.319> bring<00:02:54.709> that<00:02:54.950> along<00:02:55.099> with<00:02:55.340> lash<00:02:55.670> line

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
just bring that along with lash line

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.599 
just bring that along with lash line
like<00:02:57.739> so<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:59.200> find<00:03:00.200> cream<00:03:00.530> liners<00:03:00.920> don't<00:03:01.190> tickle

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
like so I find cream liners don't tickle

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.339 
like so I find cream liners don't tickle
as<00:03:01.700> much<00:03:01.970> on<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.660> water<00:03:02.810> level<00:03:03.140> but<00:03:03.230> they

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
as much on the water level but they

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.440 
as much on the water level but they
still<00:03:03.590> do<00:03:03.859> tickle<00:03:04.599> so<00:03:06.430> now<00:03:07.430> we're<00:03:07.609> going<00:03:07.879> on<00:03:08.060> to

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
still do tickle so now we're going on to

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.280 
still do tickle so now we're going on to
the<00:03:08.569> waterline<00:03:10.629> try<00:03:11.629> to<00:03:11.690> keep<00:03:11.870> your<00:03:11.930> eyes<00:03:12.109> as

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
the waterline try to keep your eyes as

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.110 
the waterline try to keep your eyes as
dry<00:03:12.620> as<00:03:12.650> possible<00:03:13.010> if<00:03:13.400> they<00:03:13.489> start<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.940> well<00:03:14.090> up

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
dry as possible if they start to well up

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.860 
dry as possible if they start to well up
just<00:03:14.599> just<00:03:14.660> let<00:03:15.079> it<00:03:15.640> recede<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:17.390> they've<00:03:17.629> got<00:03:17.720> a

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
just just let it recede so they've got a

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.000 
just just let it recede so they've got a
better<00:03:18.140> chance<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:18.829> lasting<00:03:20.680> cream<00:03:21.680> liners

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
better chance of it lasting cream liners

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.180 
better chance of it lasting cream liners
are<00:03:22.099> good<00:03:22.250> for<00:03:22.430> this<00:03:22.579> and<00:03:23.530> Cole<00:03:24.530> pencils<00:03:24.950> are

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
are good for this and Cole pencils are

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.319 
are good for this and Cole pencils are
excellent<00:03:25.880> as<00:03:26.180> well<00:03:27.639> but<00:03:28.639> the<00:03:28.760> second<00:03:29.150> trick

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
excellent as well but the second trick

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.550 
excellent as well but the second trick
is<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.599> thing<00:03:29.810> that's<00:03:29.930> going<00:03:30.169> to<00:03:30.200> make<00:03:30.380> it

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
is the thing that's going to make it

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.629 
is the thing that's going to make it
last<00:03:30.769> so<00:03:31.639> pretty<00:03:32.150> much<00:03:32.239> drawn<00:03:32.780> out<00:03:33.019> my<00:03:34.010> basic

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639
