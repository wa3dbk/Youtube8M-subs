00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.240
 today we are going to see the look that has 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:12.240
 presented stella mccartney in the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.049
 New fashion week runway 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.060
 york- let's see the hairstyle and the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:26.130
 make-up brigitte bardot style let's go 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.410
 to start with the hairstyle I will spend 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.890
 the plates to leave the hair more 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.890
 smooth 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.140
 although if you want to give a touch 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.750
 you can leave your 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.440
 natural hair whether they are louis or curly 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.440
 wavy 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.340
 in his case the models carried the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.280
 straight hair so in my case I'm going to 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:57.860
 straighten hair I'll check it well 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.430
 well all the contours so that then 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:06.170
 it fits well in the queue in my case the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.500
 I have short bangs so I'm going to 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:15.470
 go directing it to the side where I'm going 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.390
 to take it in your case if you have a 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.600
 Long coat will be easier to 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.600
 to work 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.680
 I'm going to make the line aside and well 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.190
 placing the hair to make a 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.610
 queue that's going to be a bit low towards 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.610
 the neck 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.560
 I'm going to place the rubber hook and in my 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.329
 case I'll leave it like that although you can 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.329
 take a lock to cover that rubber 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.880
 and now I'm going to place with a kleenex 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.330
 so that there is not much mark of the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.020
 tweezers the hair sideways while doing 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.020
 the makeup 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.760
 You can know that makeup is very 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.760
 very natural 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.440
 so start with the base of 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.739
 makeup in this case the tone of my 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.739
 skin 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.040
 how the pictures looked the models 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.700
 They wore a very natural makeup like this 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.380
 that you can make it more natural or even 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.250
 more current if there is any area that 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.250
 discover more 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.110
 the truth that the first ones looked 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.769
 Pretty cool textures not very 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.769
 made up 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.290
 so for the case of the corrector I'm going 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.480
 to use another makeup base instead of 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.959
 use the concealer that is one more texture 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.959
 dense 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.160
 a shade lighter than the base 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.160
 makeup that has applied to me 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.700
 a little the area of the eyes and the area 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.700
 central of the face 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.060
 in the case of the skins of the models 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.560
 how it looked pretty cool what did not 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.560
 I'm going to do is nuance that skin 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.050
 I'm going to give a slight blush with a 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.240
 rouge a little rosita in the area 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.319
 the pacos are well also a little 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.319
 towards the cheekbone 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.189
 but our time if you see the images 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.189
 they wear something very very natural 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.390
 and we begin with the eyes of your case what 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.959
 what they do is an outline around the 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.430
 eye always on the outside in 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.430
 this case we make the biggest eye 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.900
 so let's make a fine line 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.900
 behind the eyelashes 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.880
 I'm going to start from the area of ​​tears 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.580
 take out a small peak 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.030
 and then we're going to work all the 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.480
 lower part always make the 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.480
 tabs 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.040
 we will make the outside 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.260
 so with the eye open not only 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.630
 I knew before the end of the eye to draw 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.570
 to me 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.170
 a line that we will join with the stroke 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.170
 higher 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.330
 if you have the eye with a fallen shape 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.720
 you can always make strokes by uploading a 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.850
 little bit up to lengthen the eye 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.850
 and make it higher 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.230
 so now the other eye the same thing we're going 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.030
 to match with the eye of the other side 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.900
 pulling outwards and joining with 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.900
 the top 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.010
 in my case I have a pretty thin eyebrow 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:51.060
 the models wore the most eyebrows 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:54.050
 thick so let's outline the 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.050
 eyebrow shape 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.930
 in my case he used a brown shadow of 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.930
 the color line 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.400
 to finish with the eyes a mask 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.400
 of tabs 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:41.560
 and for the lips a very natural tone 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.560
 with a little bit of brightness 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:46.479
 slightly to pink 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.320
 so we already removed the two pieces 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.740
 Apply lacquer so that it is well attached 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.460
 in my case the fringe that is more 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.460
 cortito 

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:09.340
 I am only what you can use to 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:13.220
 this spring summer 2014 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:16.010
 is that I'm on twitter facebook 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.930
 and if you want to see more videos about
