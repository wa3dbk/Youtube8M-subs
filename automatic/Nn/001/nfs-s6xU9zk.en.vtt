00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.170
 Hello everyone 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.750
 today we welcome spring 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.490
 preparing origami butterflies 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.980
 as colorful as what you see there 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.220
 I'll show you how to make two different ones 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.250
 types of butterflies we will see these butterflies 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.170
 with rounded tip wings that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.360
 we will spend with a show of angles of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.850
 I'll use a corner john for me you can 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.969
 also use a simple stone away 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.450
 for the paper and then instead we will realize 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.820
 also the version with pointed wings 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.280
 but let's see immediately how to prepare these 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.980
 butterflies to make butterflies 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.399
 origami needs a piece of 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.579
 my card is 100 grams which 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.890
 measure 12 x 12 cm you can change them 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.610
 dimensions as long as they start from a format 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.369
 so my card is not fas 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.590
 then the decoration then the la 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.830
 card printing must be left 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.830
 outside we ask for the first destination 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.310
 let's open fold on the other side 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:43.740
 let's open do the two diagonal folds 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:46.909
 the first restarts we reopen and we do it 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.909
 same on the other side 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:02.500
 reopen we close in half and insert 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.880
 this first edge inside and 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.270
 we close and do the same from the side 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.270
 opposite to 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.590
 we beat you at the top 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.590
 turn 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:03:00.439
 outside we go out a little in the part 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:03:00.439
 upper we crush bend the tip 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.840
 we turn and crush in half 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.019
 and here is the first butterfly we make of it 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.530
 another is going this time 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.530
 corners 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.510
 here is the second butterfly 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.489
 at this point we take the corner shop 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:04.060
 for or a stop of key angles the stone 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.060
 we give the tips then the tips of the wings 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:24.150
 and here 32 origami butterflies hope you 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.770
 everyone likes them and good spring 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.770
