00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.059
 when the cuffs are made as an assembly 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.780
 bottom of the sleeves are made 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.920
 they can only join hands 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.770
 cuff turned over face 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.310
 put on and tie the cuffs down 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:33.300
 sleeves for this purpose we have not 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.980
 I finish my studies wife allowance following line 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.140
 between the lines of the assembly 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.260
 Adel And those who believes that he has 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.819
 enough experience and he can miss 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.999
 will take it not and cuff 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:51.719
 I will say a few words in favor of this operation 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:54.359
 first with the label you fastens and start 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.640
 and end cuff that will help avoid 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.219
 typical novice couturiers 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.339
 errors in the authors 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.450
 the more lines fasten the assembly body 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.880
 it looks more even in products 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:13.729
 yes I will accept it cuff do not forget 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.729
 sometimes do pinpoints 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.159
 with metal and thinking q and yes first 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.549
 we lower 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.189
 needle and make sure that the edge 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:35.000
 slots and cuff start perfect 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:39.140
 match we start and 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.750
 finishing the line with rivets of course 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.110
 it is important that everyone else 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.780
 the lines were to the right of the line 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.630
 attaching cuffs 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.799
 as you can see I am laying a line with 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.209
 hand sleeves 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:02:03.610
 so that the assembly does not go astray 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:03.610
 true and now intrigued 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.670
 for attaching the second side of the cuff 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:24.569
 I use a decorative line 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:27.900
 resembling both groans and when the cuff 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.000
 will bring fully continue finishing 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.700
 line at the edge of the cuff 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.129
 yes that's all we can do 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:44.000
 with you was olkhovskaya faith 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:44.000
