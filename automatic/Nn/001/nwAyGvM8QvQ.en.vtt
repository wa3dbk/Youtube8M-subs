nothing<00:00:00.539> for<00:00:00.719> us<00:00:00.780> we<00:00:01.500> just<00:00:01.620> got<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.920> continue

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
nothing for us we just got to continue

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.849 
nothing for us we just got to continue
to<00:00:02.340> attack<00:00:02.760> drive<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.540> make<00:00:04.319> place<00:00:04.529> for<00:00:04.560> each

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
to attack drive and make place for each

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.710 
to attack drive and make place for each
other

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
other

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.419 
other
I<00:00:06.839> also<00:00:07.439> thought<00:00:07.709> we<00:00:07.859> got<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.069> lot<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.309> good

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
I also thought we got a lot of good

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.119 
I also thought we got a lot of good
shots<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.480> maybe<00:00:10.139> just<00:00:10.440> didn't<00:00:10.799> fall<00:00:10.980> in

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:11.129 
shots to that maybe just didn't fall in

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.420 
shots to that maybe just didn't fall in
a<00:00:11.190> second<00:00:11.490> half<00:00:11.719> she<00:00:12.719> feel<00:00:12.959> like<00:00:13.049> them<00:00:13.230> all

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
a second half she feel like them all

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.250 
a second half she feel like them all
i<00:00:15.430> mean<00:00:16.059> i<00:00:16.120> don't<00:00:16.330> i<00:00:16.510> don't<00:00:16.540> think<00:00:16.840> that<00:00:16.900> i

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260 
i mean i don't i don't think that i

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.810 
i mean i don't i don't think that i
don't<00:00:17.710> think<00:00:17.890> that<00:00:18.010> we<00:00:18.130> weren't<00:00:18.340> moving<00:00:18.730> the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
don't think that we weren't moving the

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.930 
don't think that we weren't moving the
ball<00:00:18.970> I<00:00:19.630> thought<00:00:20.140> we've<00:00:20.260> got<00:00:20.500> some<00:00:20.650> good<00:00:20.800> shots

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
ball I thought we've got some good shots

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.210 
ball I thought we've got some good shots
I<00:00:21.940> think<00:00:22.750> that<00:00:22.779> ball<00:00:23.170> movement<00:00:23.410> can<00:00:23.710> always<00:00:24.040> be

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
I think that ball movement can always be

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.930 
I think that ball movement can always be
better<00:00:24.250> in<00:00:25.150> terms<00:00:25.360> of<00:00:25.660> you<00:00:26.260> know

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
better in terms of you know

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.030 
better in terms of you know
you<00:00:28.030> know<00:00:28.150> they<00:00:28.480> moving<00:00:28.900> quickly<00:00:29.170> and<00:00:29.590> and<00:00:29.860> you

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
you know they moving quickly and and you

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.650 
you know they moving quickly and and you
can<00:00:30.190> you<00:00:30.400> can<00:00:30.550> be<00:00:30.670> a<00:00:30.700> perfectionist<00:00:31.030> in<00:00:31.420> a<00:00:31.510> lot

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
can you can be a perfectionist in a lot

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.360 
can you can be a perfectionist in a lot
different<00:00:31.960> ways<00:00:32.080> that<00:00:32.110> in<00:00:32.529> general<00:00:32.800> compared

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
different ways that in general compared

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.430 
different ways that in general compared
to<00:00:33.520> game<00:00:34.120> stats<00:00:34.450> you<00:00:34.690> know<00:00:34.840> we<00:00:34.990> were<00:00:35.110> trying<00:00:35.410> to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
to game stats you know we were trying to

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.870 
to game stats you know we were trying to
move<00:00:35.620> them<00:00:35.740> all<00:00:35.860> and<00:00:36.070> make<00:00:36.190> good<00:00:36.370> place<00:00:36.640> for

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
move them all and make good place for

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.610 
move them all and make good place for
each<00:00:36.970> other<00:00:37.150> I<00:00:37.420> just<00:00:37.930> think<00:00:38.050> they<00:00:38.200> turn<00:00:38.440> it<00:00:38.530> up

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
each other I just think they turn it up

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.220 
each other I just think they turn it up
defensively<00:00:38.800> and<00:00:39.340> we<00:00:39.490> got<00:00:40.390> to<00:00:40.510> find<00:00:40.720> different

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
defensively and we got to find different

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.540 
defensively and we got to find different
ways<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.590> be<00:00:42.010> able<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:44.010> take<00:00:45.010> that<00:00:45.190> aggression

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
ways to be able to take that aggression

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.820 
ways to be able to take that aggression
and<00:00:45.790> use<00:00:46.000> it<00:00:46.239> against<00:00:46.900> them<00:00:46.989> yeah<00:00:47.500> how<00:00:47.650> do<00:00:47.710> you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
and use it against them yeah how do you

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.400 
and use it against them yeah how do you
have<00:00:48.040> the<00:00:48.129> best<00:00:48.309> you<00:00:48.489> I<00:00:48.820> mean<00:00:49.629> for<00:00:49.960> example<00:00:49.989> if

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
have the best you I mean for example if

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.840 
have the best you I mean for example if
there's<00:00:50.620> trap<00:00:51.040> around<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.340> pick-and-roll<00:00:51.760> is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
there's trap around the pick-and-roll is

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.600 
there's trap around the pick-and-roll is
just<00:00:52.030> getting<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.270> ball<00:00:52.390> out<00:00:52.450> quick<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.080> then

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
just getting the ball out quick and then

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.920 
just getting the ball out quick and then
plan<00:00:54.610> to<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:54.910> weak<00:00:55.090> side<00:00:55.120> you<00:00:55.570> know<00:00:55.690> they're

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
plan to the weak side you know they're

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.780 
plan to the weak side you know they're
sinking<00:00:56.320> in<00:00:56.440> so<00:00:56.680> much<00:00:56.860> so<00:00:57.489> when<00:00:57.640> you're

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
sinking in so much so when you're

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.580 
sinking in so much so when you're
swinging<00:00:58.390> it<00:00:58.540> quick<00:00:58.720> to<00:00:58.840> the<00:00:58.870> other<00:00:59.020> side<00:00:59.320> you

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
swinging it quick to the other side you

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.090 
swinging it quick to the other side you
know<00:00:59.949> stuff<00:01:00.220> will<00:01:00.339> open<00:01:00.610> up<00:01:00.730> but<00:01:01.000> i<00:01:01.980> don't<00:01:02.980> i

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
know stuff will open up but i don't i

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.380 
know stuff will open up but i don't i
don't<00:01:03.129> think<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.489> we<00:01:03.670> weren't<00:01:03.879> trying<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.210> do

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
don't think that we weren't trying to do

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.899 
don't think that we weren't trying to do
that<00:01:04.629> i<00:01:04.659> just<00:01:04.780> think<00:01:05.170> that<00:01:05.379> maybe<00:01:05.680> if<00:01:06.520> we<00:01:06.670> hit<00:01:06.850> a

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
that i just think that maybe if we hit a

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.310 
that i just think that maybe if we hit a
couple<00:01:07.090> more<00:01:07.330> shots<00:01:07.570> that<00:01:08.020> would<00:01:08.110> loosen

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
couple more shots that would loosen

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.380 
couple more shots that would loosen
things<00:01:08.560> up<00:01:08.800> for<00:01:09.100> things<00:01:09.220> like<00:01:09.370> that<00:01:09.490> Jeremy<00:01:10.330> I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
things up for things like that Jeremy I

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.820 
things up for things like that Jeremy I

do every night I guess half time we
didn't<00:01:34.470> almost<00:01:34.560> seemed<00:01:34.800> like<00:01:34.830> these<00:01:35.100> two

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
didn't almost seemed like these two

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980
