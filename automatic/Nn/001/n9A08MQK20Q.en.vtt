American<00:02:38.010> version<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:39.000> he<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.540> don't

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
American version because he I don't

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.440 
American version because he I don't
remember<00:02:40.020> bulma<00:02:40.710> ever<00:02:40.950> sticking<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.820> gun<00:02:41.850> at

Goku<00:02:43.230> threatening<00:02:44.130> his<00:02:44.310> life<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.850> then

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
Goku threatening his life and then

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.120 
Goku threatening his life and then
joining<00:02:45.600> his<00:02:46.020> party<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:47.310> makes<00:02:47.820> no<00:02:48.240> sense

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
joining his party that makes no sense

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.730 
joining his party that makes no sense
he's<00:02:50.130> just<00:02:50.430> threatened<00:02:51.060> your<00:02:51.210> life<00:02:51.240> yeah<00:02:52.170> you

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740

technically<00:02:53.340> can't<00:02:53.820> get<00:02:54.570> killed<00:02:55.050> because<00:02:55.290> you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
technically can't get killed because you

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.550 
technically can't get killed because you
could<00:02:55.800> knock<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.310> gun<00:02:56.490> out<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.790> her<00:02:57.420> hand<00:02:57.900> so

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
could knock the gun out of her hand so

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.130 
could knock the gun out of her hand so
you<00:02:58.920> really<00:02:59.580> are<00:02:59.790> being<00:03:00.210> threatened<00:03:00.570> by<00:03:00.780> her

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
you really are being threatened by her

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.210 
you really are being threatened by her
but<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:03.780> doesn't<00:03:04.230> make<00:03:04.350> any<00:03:04.410> sense<00:03:04.920> and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
but just it doesn't make any sense and

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.150 
but just it doesn't make any sense and
then<00:03:05.700> another<00:03:06.090> point<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.080> want<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.350> make<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.710> so

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160
