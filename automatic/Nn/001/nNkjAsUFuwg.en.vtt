 I already have one or the other 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.030
 Films by Alfred Hitchcock reviewed and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.740
 Today I want to be the next in this 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.310
 record list it's about the movie 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.740
 the year 1954 at call murder on call 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.619
 murder in the original dial m for murder is 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.210
 from the year 1954 is about 1 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.179
 successful tennis player tony 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.590
 wendice played by ray millions of 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.420
 got out that his wife 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.610
 margit played by the magical 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.920
 grace kelly a relationship with that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.530
 american mark harry ley played by 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.879
 Robert Cummings has Tony Wendice now 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.719
 fear that I divorce his wife 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.940
 would let 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.770
 because markus testament would not 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.050
 more to him in the event of a death 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.030
 so he wants to kill her 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.379
 to get the money with it 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.190
 continue his expensive lifestyle 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.840
 can afford 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.670
 he then seeks one for the murder 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.350
 old friend from college he 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.890
 cleverly, that's what leads to murder 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.719
 commit 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.670
 the next evening this should murder of 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.250
 take place from the front to the back 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.390
 Well planned seems so far 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.729
 first time to the story 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.400
 connoisseurs know, of course, it helps very 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.990
 interested in the perfect murder and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.460
 I try this one too 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.710
 again the exciting thing about the story 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.840
 is that one of the entire plan so as 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.030
 The murder has to expire in the first 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.740
 third of the film Haarklein is explained 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.259
 you sit as a spectator so to speak 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.600
 looking forward to the screen and it all 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.159
 Stupid said the notary of everything exactly in the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.439
 Eye retains and every little mistake 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.820
 noticed immediately and the great thing is 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.590
 that one does not have the mistake 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.810
 noticed but one at the end of the film 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.210
 right aha effect has so it was 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.680
 at least for me because the film almost only 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.960
 in the living room of tony wendice 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.670
 played it also reminds a lot 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.689
 a play of which I always enter 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.189
 I'm a big fan 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.170
 the actors are really good 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.720
 especially ray millions as toni 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.790
 wireless but also grace kelly are 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.829
 that's absolutely terrific all in all 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.689
 an absolutely great film of something difficult 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.909
 then comes in gear but absolutely shine 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.979
 can not therefore a total recommendation 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.290
 just a hitchcock fans calling murder 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.649
 takes 105 minutes currently at 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.379
 nearly 55,000 ratings on imdb one 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.840
 average rating of 82 I go 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.140
 hear and award great 87 points 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.870
 on 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.520
 87 how did you find in the movie you agree 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.790
 do not post your opinion 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.290
 to 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.220
 We listen to the next movie again 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.220
 and until then, I say
