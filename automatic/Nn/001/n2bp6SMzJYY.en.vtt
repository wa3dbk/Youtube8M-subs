we<00:00:39.629> got<00:00:39.960> firewire<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.890> USB<00:00:41.129> 2.0<00:00:41.790> s<00:00:42.260> microphone

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
we got firewire to USB 2.0 s microphone

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.229 
we got firewire to USB 2.0 s microphone
headphone<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.270> four<00:00:45.770> drive<00:00:46.770> bays<00:00:47.239> then
