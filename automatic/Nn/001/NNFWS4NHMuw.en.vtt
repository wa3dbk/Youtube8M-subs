hi guys and girls I'm obsidian ant and
there's<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.929> reason<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:04.680> video<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.220> vertical

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
there's a reason this video is vertical

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.700 
there's a reason this video is vertical
so<00:00:06.720> I've<00:00:06.870> been<00:00:06.990> asked<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.350> number<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.620> times

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
so I've been asked a number of times

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.580 
so I've been asked a number of times
recently<00:00:08.160> what<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.179> resolution<00:00:09.599> looks<00:00:10.380> like

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
recently what the resolution looks like

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.470 
recently what the resolution looks like
through<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> oculus<00:00:11.219> rift<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:12.150> I'm<00:00:12.269> going<00:00:12.450> to

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
through the oculus rift and I'm going to

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.340 
through the oculus rift and I'm going to
attempt<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.840> show<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.349> here<00:00:14.750> now<00:00:15.750> what

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350

I'm<00:00:16.500> doing<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.940> actually<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> video

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
I'm doing here this is actually a video

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.980 
I'm doing here this is actually a video
recording<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.859> my<00:00:20.420> monitor<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.660> isn't<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
recording of my monitor this isn't the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.050 
recording of my monitor this isn't the
rift<00:00:22.140> itself<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.519> reason<00:00:23.760> I'm<00:00:23.880> doing

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
rift itself and the reason I'm doing

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.540 
rift itself and the reason I'm doing
that<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:25.470> highlight<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> problems<00:00:26.400> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
that is to highlight the problems and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.849 
that is to highlight the problems and
artifacts<00:00:27.180> caused<00:00:27.570> by<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> recording<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
artifacts caused by a recording a

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.009 
artifacts caused by a recording a
monitor<00:00:29.310> or<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.550> screen<00:00:29.910> what<00:00:30.660> we're<00:00:30.810> seeing

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
monitor or a screen what we're seeing

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.080 
monitor or a screen what we're seeing
here<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.500> elite<00:00:31.800> dangerous<00:00:32.070> directly<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:32.969> my

here is elite dangerous directly on my

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.620 
here is elite dangerous directly on my
monitor<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:34.140> settings<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.680> 1080p<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.540> you

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
monitor the settings at 1080p and as you

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.540 
monitor the settings at 1080p and as you
can<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.140> colors<00:00:37.559> look<00:00:37.710> washed<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:38.190> and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
can see the colors look washed out and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.220 
can see the colors look washed out and
this<00:00:38.700> number<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.059> other<00:00:39.180> artifacts<00:00:39.989> and

this number of other artifacts and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.709 
this number of other artifacts and
problems<00:00:40.730> but<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.940> point<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.570> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
problems but the point of this is to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.540 
problems but the point of this is to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
actually looks like when recorded for a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.959 
actually looks like when recorded for a
phone<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:48.530> here's<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.649> desktop<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.430> this

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
phone and here's my desktop and this

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.490 
phone and here's my desktop and this
actually<00:00:51.360> introduces<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> number<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.199> other

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
I did try using my DSLR to record but I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.399 
I did try using my DSLR to record but I
was<00:01:05.939> unable<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.150> focus<00:01:06.510> through<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> lenses

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
was unable to focus through the lenses

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.250 
was unable to focus through the lenses
on<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> rift<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:08.659> this<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.810> looking<00:01:10.020> through

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
on the rift now this is looking through

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.109 
on the rift now this is looking through
the<00:01:10.439> rift<00:01:10.619> itself<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.369> there<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> number

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the rift itself and there are a number

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.100 
the rift itself and there are a number
of<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.689> previous<00:01:13.200> issues<00:01:14.100> present<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.240> but

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
of the previous issues present here but

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.950 
of the previous issues present here but
that's<00:01:16.290> due<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.619> how<00:01:16.740> I've<00:01:16.830> captured<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.960> but

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that's due to how I've captured in but

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200 
that's due to how I've captured in but
what<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.549> quality<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
what you can see is the quality of the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.620 
what you can see is the quality of the
resolution<00:01:21.689> itself<00:01:23.119> some<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> text<00:01:24.540> is

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
resolution itself some of the text is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.570 
resolution itself some of the text is
readable<00:01:24.840> some<00:01:25.439> isn't<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.250> most<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
readable some isn't you can see most the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.390 
readable some isn't you can see most the
text<00:01:26.850> area<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.119> actually<00:01:27.299> pretty<00:01:28.259> good<00:01:28.400> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
text area is actually pretty good and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.149 
text area is actually pretty good and
this<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> station<00:01:31.159> another

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
this here is in the station another

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.800 
this here is in the station another
thing<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.579> keep<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.880> mind<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.420> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
thing to keep in mind is that this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.870 
thing to keep in mind is that this
vertical<00:01:34.140> slice<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.979> only<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.280> small<00:01:35.610> portion

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
vertical slice is only a small portion

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.700 
vertical slice is only a small portion
of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.659> until<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.049> filled<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.470> view<00:01:37.680> you

of the until I filled a view you
actually<00:01:38.189> get<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.610> inside<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> rift<00:01:40.220> my<00:01:41.220> love

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430

to hear is look around a bit you can see
the<00:01:44.970> darn<00:01:45.360> gateway<00:01:45.810> text<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.860> very<00:01:47.040> readable

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.789 

the<00:01:51.150> right<00:01:51.509> panel<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:52.020> slightly<00:01:52.290> less<00:01:52.560> so

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the right panel here slightly less so

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.219 
the right panel here slightly less so
but<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.250> make<00:01:53.970> out<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.540> saying<00:01:54.600> if

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
but you can make out what it's saying if

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.620 
but you can make out what it's saying if
you<00:01:55.409> already<00:01:55.680> know<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.939> graphics<00:01:57.330> in<00:01:57.479> their

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
you already know the graphics in their

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.260 
you already know the graphics in their
environment<00:01:58.170> itself<00:01:58.590> look<00:01:59.490> nothing<00:02:00.000> short<00:02:00.119> of

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
environment itself look nothing short of

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.719 
environment itself look nothing short of
amazing<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:01.080> you<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.770> probably<00:02:02.220> see<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
amazing but you can probably see the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.630 
amazing but you can probably see the
screen<00:02:03.240> door<00:02:03.450> effect<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:04.399> going<00:02:05.399> back<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
screen door effect here going back to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.430 
screen door effect here going back to
the<00:02:05.909> original<00:02:06.509> point<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.840> made<00:02:07.049> about<00:02:07.170> this

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the original point I made about this

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.100 
the original point I made about this
video<00:02:07.710> being<00:02:07.979> vertical<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.630> reason<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:10.050> that

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
video being vertical the reason for that

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.340 
video being vertical the reason for that
is<00:02:11.209> vertical<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> only<00:02:12.630> way<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.870> could<00:02:13.050> get

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
is vertical is the only way I could get

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.640 
is vertical is the only way I could get
my<00:02:13.410> phone<00:02:13.860> camera<00:02:14.730> lens<00:02:15.060> up<00:02:15.810> against<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.350> rift

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
my phone camera lens up against the rift

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.059 
my phone camera lens up against the rift
while<00:02:17.430> simultaneously<00:02:17.989> managing<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.200> focus

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
while simultaneously managing to focus

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.890 
while simultaneously managing to focus
it<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:20.700> what's<00:02:21.000> actually<00:02:21.180> going<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.600> inside

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
it on what's actually going on inside

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.900 
it on what's actually going on inside
the<00:02:22.050> rift

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
the rift

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.780 
the rift
so<00:02:23.910> yes<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.450> resolution<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.110> fairly<00:02:25.350> low<00:02:25.790> but

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
so yes the resolution is fairly low but

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.690 
so yes the resolution is fairly low but
it's<00:02:27.660> more<00:02:27.840> than<00:02:27.959> made<00:02:28.170> up<00:02:28.200> for<00:02:28.610> with<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
it's more than made up for with the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.190 
it's more than made up for with the
other<00:02:29.819> benefits<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> rift<00:02:30.750> gives<00:02:31.049> you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
other benefits that the rift gives you

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.360 
other benefits that the rift gives you
such<00:02:31.709> as<00:02:31.950> true<00:02:32.220> 3d<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.880> head<00:02:33.420> tracking<00:02:34.370> it

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
such as true 3d and head tracking it

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.150 
such as true 3d and head tracking it
really<00:02:35.790> can't<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.209> underestimated<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.680> sense

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
really can't be underestimated the sense

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.430 
really can't be underestimated the sense
of<00:02:38.400> spatial<00:02:39.390> awareness<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.959> get<00:02:40.170> when<00:02:40.319> you

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
of spatial awareness you get when you

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.660 
of spatial awareness you get when you
inside<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.010> rift<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:43.350> nowadays<00:02:43.799> immersion

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
inside the rift and nowadays immersion

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.840 
inside the rift and nowadays immersion
is<00:02:44.790> perhaps<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.209> bit<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.660> dirty<00:02:45.840> word<00:02:45.989> but<00:02:46.850> the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
is perhaps a bit of a dirty word but the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.240 
is perhaps a bit of a dirty word but the
truth<00:02:48.060> be<00:02:48.209> told<00:02:48.769> there's<00:02:49.769> nothing<00:02:50.010> else<00:02:50.160> that

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
truth be told there's nothing else that

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.729 
truth be told there's nothing else that
compares<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:51.120> literally<00:02:51.750> feels<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.319> you're

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
compares it literally feels like you're

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.240 
compares it literally feels like you're
in<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.940> ship<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.930> you're<00:02:55.079> sitting<00:02:56.010> inside

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
in the ship that you're sitting inside

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.340 
in the ship that you're sitting inside
the<00:02:56.549> station<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.120> you're<00:02:57.209> flying<00:02:57.630> around<00:02:57.900> in

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
the station that you're flying around in

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.479 
the station that you're flying around in
vast<00:02:58.980> depth<00:02:59.579> of<00:02:59.760> space<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.829> to<00:03:01.829> me<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.250> more

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
vast depth of space and to me that more

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.460 
vast depth of space and to me that more
than<00:03:02.640> makes<00:03:02.880> up<00:03:03.030> for<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.329> fact<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:04.170> some

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
than makes up for the fact that in some

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.370 
than makes up for the fact that in some
cases<00:03:04.890> some<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.549> text<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.120> very<00:03:06.329> hard<00:03:06.690> to

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
cases some of the text is very hard to

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.930 
cases some of the text is very hard to
read<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.829> in<00:03:08.250> other<00:03:08.370> cases<00:03:08.640> almost

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
read and in other cases almost

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.330 
read and in other cases almost
impossible<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.690> read<00:03:09.870> but<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.890> guys<00:03:11.070> will

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
impossible to read but you guys will

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.740 
impossible to read but you guys will
really<00:03:11.609> need<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:11.940> make<00:03:12.030> your<00:03:12.120> own<00:03:12.239> minds<00:03:12.600> up<00:03:12.720> to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
really need to make your own minds up to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.750 
really need to make your own minds up to
decide<00:03:13.290> whether<00:03:13.859> or<00:03:14.040> not<00:03:14.130> that's<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.430> problem

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
decide whether or not that's a problem

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.819 
decide whether or not that's a problem
for<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.780> hopefully<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.440> video<00:03:16.590> will

for you and hopefully this video will
help<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.100> decide<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.519> bit<00:03:17.930> chances<00:03:18.930> are<00:03:19.049> when

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
help you decide a bit chances are when

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.020 
help you decide a bit chances are when
the<00:03:19.350> dev<00:03:19.500> kit<00:03:19.739> 2<00:03:19.920> comes<00:03:20.190> out<00:03:20.340> things<00:03:20.760> are<00:03:20.910> going

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the dev kit 2 comes out things are going

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.479 
the dev kit 2 comes out things are going
to<00:03:21.090> look<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.299> lot<00:03:21.450> better<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.340> when<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
to look a lot better and when the

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.400 
to look a lot better and when the
consumer<00:03:24.090> version<00:03:24.450> comes<00:03:24.690> out<00:03:24.840> things<00:03:25.260> should

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
consumer version comes out things should

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.190 
consumer version comes out things should
look<00:03:25.440> very<00:03:25.590> good<00:03:26.010> indeed<00:03:26.600> time<00:03:27.600> will<00:03:27.810> tell

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
look very good indeed time will tell

look very good indeed time will tell
and<00:03:28.290> hopefully<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:29.220> final<00:03:29.730> release<00:03:29.940> isn't

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
and hopefully the final release isn't

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.710 
and hopefully the final release isn't

video as me rifting on the rift it's

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.630 
video as me rifting on the rift it's
such<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.420> great<00:03:36.810> piece<00:03:37.019> of<00:03:37.079> kit<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.709> it's<00:03:38.489> how<00:03:38.609> I

such a great piece of kit and it's how I

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.539 
such a great piece of kit and it's how I
play<00:03:39.060> elite<00:03:39.359> all<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.840> time<00:03:40.079> but<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.069> lot<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.370> you
