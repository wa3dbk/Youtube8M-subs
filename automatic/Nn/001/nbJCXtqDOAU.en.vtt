your<00:01:33.000> second<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.350> quick<00:01:35.280> animation

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
your second so this is a quick animation

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.789 
your second so this is a quick animation
and<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.180> shows<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> product<00:01:37.259> engineer<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
and it shows a product engineer see the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.039 
and it shows a product engineer see the
blood<00:01:38.009> vessels<00:01:38.040> they<00:01:38.729> open<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.390> when<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.900> give

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
blood vessels they open up when you give

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.990 
blood vessels they open up when you give
a<00:01:40.079> little<00:01:40.259> bit<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.530> gas<00:01:40.740> them<00:01:41.100> called<00:01:41.430> nitric

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
a little bit of gas them called nitric

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.719 
a little bit of gas them called nitric
oxide<00:01:42.530> nitrates<00:01:43.530> are<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.890> root<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.460> gas

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
oxide nitrates are the root of this gas

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.069 
oxide nitrates are the root of this gas
and<00:01:45.090> they're<00:01:45.180> found<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.509> beets<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and they're found in beets and that

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.810 
and they're found in beets and that
blood<00:01:46.320> vessel<00:01:46.649> dilates<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
blood vessel dilates up like that and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.270 
blood vessel dilates up like that and
lets<00:01:48.090> blood<00:01:48.390> go<00:01:48.630> surging<00:01:49.259> forward<00:01:49.560> wherever

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
lets blood go surging forward wherever

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
lets blood go surging forward wherever
it<00:01:50.520> has<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:50.970> whether<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> kidneys

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it has to go whether it's the kidneys

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.969 
it has to go whether it's the kidneys
the<00:01:52.950> brain<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.909> heart<00:01:54.170> they're<00:01:55.170> male<00:01:55.560> organs

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the brain the heart they're male organs

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.889 
the brain the heart they're male organs
female<00:01:56.700> organs<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.390> functions<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.840> same

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
female organs is so functions the same

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.780 
female organs is so functions the same
way<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.560> got<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.799> gorge<00:01:59.040> those<00:01:59.250> areas<00:01:59.670> you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
way you got in gorge those areas you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.399 
way you got in gorge those areas you
need<00:01:59.939> blood<00:02:00.119> flow<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.140> beets

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
need blood flow to do that the beets

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.350 
need blood flow to do that the beets
have<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> raw<00:02:02.009> material<00:02:02.579> for<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.759> gas<00:02:03.119> that

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
have the raw material for that gas that

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.149 
have the raw material for that gas that
you<00:02:03.509> saw<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.079> nitrates<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:04.950> there

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
you saw the nitrates that are in there

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.069 
you saw the nitrates that are in there
now<00:02:05.340> natural<00:02:06.119> sameen's<00:02:06.479> which<00:02:06.719> are<00:02:06.869> what

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
now natural sameen's which are what

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.270 
now natural sameen's which are what
happens<00:02:07.259> when<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.409> put<00:02:07.530> nitrates<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.039> meat

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
happens when you put nitrates in meat

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.859 
happens when you put nitrates in meat
that's<00:02:08.640> why<00:02:08.729> processed<00:02:09.179> meat<00:02:09.330> you're<00:02:09.450> bad<00:02:09.599> for

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
that's why processed meat you're bad for

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.330 
that's why processed meat you're bad for
you<00:02:09.989> they're<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.410> whole<00:02:10.590> different<00:02:10.920> thing<00:02:10.950> so

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
you they're a whole different thing so

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.220 
you they're a whole different thing so
you<00:02:11.610> give<00:02:11.849> your<00:02:11.879> generals<00:02:12.750> above<00:02:12.930> all<00:02:13.110> they

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
and researchers believe that the pigment

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.449 
and researchers believe that the pigment
in<00:03:30.660> these<00:03:30.780> beets<00:03:31.049> they<00:03:31.560> were<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:32.130> cut<00:03:32.280> through

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
in these beets they were to cut through

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.039 
in these beets they were to cut through
these<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.910> pigments<00:03:33.390> have<00:03:33.420> been<00:03:33.870> called

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
better signing that leads to it and we

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.120 
better signing that leads to it and we
think<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.450> helps<00:03:37.049> prevent<00:03:37.470> cancer<00:03:37.530> cells

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
think that helps prevent cancer cells

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.130 
think that helps prevent cancer cells
