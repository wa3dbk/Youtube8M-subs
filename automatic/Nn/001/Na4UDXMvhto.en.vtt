don't<00:01:37.140> agree<00:01:37.320> with<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.560> tournament

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
don't agree with the tournament

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.039 
don't agree with the tournament
structure<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.460> lot<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.180> people<00:01:39.299> are<00:01:39.509> saying<00:01:39.720> I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
structure a lot of people are saying I

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.810 
structure a lot of people are saying I
don't<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.650> why<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.829> don't<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.369> single

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
elimination brackets because that's the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.810 
elimination brackets because that's the
only<00:01:43.560> tournament<00:01:44.040> you've<00:01:44.250> won<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.579> year

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
but after pool play and let me show you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.030 
but after pool play and let me show you
guys<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.050> pools<00:02:49.290> here<00:02:49.500> really<00:02:49.680> quick<00:02:49.890> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
guys the pools here really quick the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.400 
guys the pools here really quick the
webcam<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.519> going<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.700> be<00:02:50.790> taken<00:02:51.120> out<00:02:51.410> all

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
webcam is going to be taken out all

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.170 
webcam is going to be taken out all
right<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.160> these<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.489> first<00:02:53.730> two<00:02:53.910> groups

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
right this is these the first two groups

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.300 
right this is these the first two groups
so<00:02:54.810> as<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.110> can<00:02:55.200> see<00:02:55.440> there<00:02:55.650> are<00:02:55.680> three<00:02:55.769> teams

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
so as you can see there are three teams

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.820 
so as you can see there are three teams
per<00:02:56.610> group<00:02:56.850> there<00:02:57.150> are<00:02:57.269> 12<00:02:57.569> teams<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.260> total<00:02:58.680> if

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
per group there are 12 teams in total if

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.830 
per group there are 12 teams in total if
you<00:02:59.010> do<00:02:59.190> four<00:02:59.489> groups<00:02:59.790> times<00:03:00.150> three<00:03:00.420> teams<00:03:00.660> in

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
you do four groups times three teams in

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.350 
you do four groups times three teams in
each<00:03:00.930> obviously<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.040> comes<00:03:02.250> out<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.430> 12<00:03:02.790> so

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
each obviously that comes out to 12 so

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.729 
each obviously that comes out to 12 so
the<00:03:03.600> first<00:03:03.720> group<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.260> extra<00:03:04.560> this

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
the first group you have extra this

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.039 
the first group you have extra this
epsilon<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.400> kursk<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.600> is<00:03:06.750> probably

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
epsilon and kursk on that is probably

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.490 
epsilon and kursk on that is probably
the<00:03:07.140> easiest<00:03:07.200> pool<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:09.019> all<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.170> pools<00:03:10.410> that

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the easiest pool and all the pools that

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.229 
the easiest pool and all the pools that
there<00:03:10.739> are<00:03:10.890> okay<00:03:11.220> let<00:03:11.400> me<00:03:11.459> just<00:03:11.519> show<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.790> so

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
there are okay let me just show you so

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
next in Group C Group C is I want to say

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.770 
next in Group C Group C is I want to say
Group<00:04:38.310> C<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.639> probably<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.180> hardest<00:04:39.210> pool

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
Group C is probably the hardest pool

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.379 
Group C is probably the hardest pool
overall<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.650> think<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.789> teams<00:04:42.090> are<00:04:42.270> the

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
overall I think that the teams are the

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.320 
overall I think that the teams are the
most<00:04:42.570> balanced<00:04:43.199> in<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.410> pool<00:04:43.620> TCM<00:04:44.550> top<00:04:45.150> two

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
at MLG then you have opticnation winning

the<00:05:02.070> Open<00:05:02.430> bracket<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:02.940> MLG<00:05:03.300> which<00:05:03.660> wasn't<00:05:03.900> an

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
the Open bracket and MLG which wasn't an

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.730 
the Open bracket and MLG which wasn't an
easy<00:05:04.380> feat<00:05:04.800> at<00:05:05.009> all<00:05:05.190> um<00:05:05.750> it<00:05:06.750> was<00:05:07.110> best<00:05:07.530> of

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
easy feat at all um it was best of

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.020 
easy feat at all um it was best of
threes<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.190> whole<00:05:08.340> way<00:05:08.460> through<00:05:08.699> that<00:05:08.910> would

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
threes the whole way through that would

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.730 
threes the whole way through that would
just<00:05:09.150> be<00:05:09.210> awful<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:09.870> then<00:05:10.289> you<00:05:10.380> have<00:05:10.500> phase

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
just be awful and then you have phase

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.920 
just be awful and then you have phase
they've<00:05:11.280> been<00:05:11.430> slacking<00:05:11.849> off<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.000> bit<00:05:12.270> but<00:05:12.690> they

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
they've been slacking off a bit but they

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.540 
they've been slacking off a bit but they

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
do have a new roster that I think can do

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.640 
do have a new roster that I think can do

them<00:05:20.820> in<00:05:20.970> this<00:05:21.060> game<00:05:21.330> I'm<00:05:21.599> not<00:05:21.780> even<00:05:21.840> sure

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
them in this game I'm not even sure

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.810 
them in this game I'm not even sure
who's<00:05:22.320> on<00:05:22.470> their<00:05:22.590> team<00:05:22.860> but<00:05:23.400> I'm<00:05:23.490> sure<00:05:23.639> that

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
who's on their team but I'm sure that

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.800 
who's on their team but I'm sure that
they're<00:05:23.940> pretty<00:05:24.180> good<00:05:24.389> they've<00:05:24.570> always<00:05:24.720> been

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
they're pretty good they've always been

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.300 
they're pretty good they've always been
a<00:05:24.930> pretty<00:05:25.110> good<00:05:25.320> organization<00:05:25.979> so<00:05:26.130> I<00:05:26.190> would

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
a pretty good organization so I would

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.980 
a pretty good organization so I would
imagine<00:05:26.460> they<00:05:26.759> have<00:05:26.849> a<00:05:26.910> good<00:05:27.060> team<00:05:27.240> then<00:05:27.870> you

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
imagine they have a good team then you

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.159 
imagine they have a good team then you
have<00:05:28.110> TK<00:05:28.590> obviously<00:05:29.580> top<00:05:30.180> for<00:05:30.449> North<00:05:30.810> American

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
have TK obviously top for North American

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.460 
have TK obviously top for North American
team<00:05:31.380> and<00:05:31.650> then<00:05:31.740> eg<00:05:32.190> a<00:05:32.370> top<00:05:32.880> two<00:05:33.120> are<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:34.289> best

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
team and then eg a top two are the best

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.550 
team and then eg a top two are the best
North<00:05:34.860> American<00:05:35.310> team<00:05:35.520> so<00:05:36.320> there<00:05:37.320> you<00:05:37.409> can<00:05:37.530> see

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
North American team so there you can see

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.320 
North American team so there you can see

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
the pools I want to say Group C is the

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.610 
the pools I want to say Group C is the
hardest<00:05:39.630> i<00:05:39.930> would<00:05:40.289> say<00:05:40.590> i<00:05:40.919> would<00:05:41.699> say<00:05:42.060> honestly

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
hardest i would say i would say honestly

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.560 
hardest i would say i would say honestly
group<00:05:43.620> d<00:05:43.800> and<00:05:44.099> our<00:05:44.190> pool<00:05:44.490> or<00:05:44.789> tied<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.120> then

group d and our pool or tied and then

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.740 
group d and our pool or tied and then
group<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:46.050> has<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.650> easiest<00:05:47.039> run<00:05:47.250> but<00:05:47.940> after

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
group a has the easiest run but after

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.570 
group a has the easiest run but after
pool<00:05:48.960> plays<00:05:49.169> over<00:05:49.530> there's<00:05:49.830> going<00:05:49.949> to<00:05:50.159> be<00:05:50.190> two

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
an eight-way now let me do the math here

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.089 
an eight-way now let me do the math here
four<00:05:54.870> times<00:05:54.900> two<00:05:55.440> yeah<00:05:55.710> there<00:05:55.919> is<00:05:56.010> an

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
four times two yeah there is an

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
Orlando when we played complexity in the

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.820 
Orlando when we played complexity in the
finals<00:06:30.810> that<00:06:31.020> was<00:06:31.139> another<00:06:31.380> single

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
finals that was another single

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.529 
finals that was another single
elimination<00:06:32.310> bracket<00:06:32.460> i<00:06:32.789> believe<00:06:33.180> i<00:06:33.330> think

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
elimination bracket i believe i think

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.260 
elimination bracket i believe i think
that<00:06:33.690> was<00:06:33.780> single<00:06:33.930> elimination<00:06:35.029> i'm<00:06:36.029> pretty

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
that was single elimination i'm pretty

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.969 
that was single elimination i'm pretty
sure<00:06:36.389> correct<00:06:37.229> me<00:06:37.289> if<00:06:37.380> I'm<00:06:37.529> wrong<00:06:37.590> but<00:06:37.770> I'm

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
sure correct me if I'm wrong but I'm

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:39.230 
sure correct me if I'm wrong but I'm
pretty<00:06:38.130> sure<00:06:38.310> that<00:06:38.460> was<00:06:38.550> single<00:06:38.849> elimination

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
pretty sure that was single elimination

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.780 
pretty sure that was single elimination
bracket<00:06:39.330> we<00:06:39.599> got<00:06:39.750> second<00:06:40.110> in<00:06:40.139> that<00:06:40.320> so<00:06:40.800> like

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
bracket we got second in that so like

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.180 
bracket we got second in that so like
our<00:06:41.880> placings<00:06:42.630> aren't<00:06:43.020> bad<00:06:43.380> in<00:06:43.740> single

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
our placings aren't bad in single

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.590 
our placings aren't bad in single
elimination<00:06:44.610> brackets<00:06:44.940> actually<00:06:45.300> they're

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
elimination brackets actually they're

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
actually good like our single

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.650 
actually good like our single
elimination<00:06:47.670> bracket<00:06:47.850> placings<00:06:48.510> are

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
elimination bracket placings are

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.960

actually<00:06:49.050> pretty<00:06:49.290> damn<00:06:49.590> good<00:06:49.860> if<00:06:50.160> you<00:06:50.640> look<00:06:50.790> at

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
actually pretty damn good if you look at

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.420 
actually pretty damn good if you look at
like<00:06:51.240> the<00:06:51.510> fool<00:06:51.780> like<00:06:52.140> spectrum<00:06:52.800> of<00:06:53.010> events

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
like the fool like spectrum of events

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.310 
like the fool like spectrum of events
that<00:06:53.550> have<00:06:53.640> been<00:06:53.820> single<00:06:54.060> elimination<00:06:54.750> like

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
that have been single elimination like

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.240
