for expert village this is mitch kaplan
in<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.830> segment<00:00:14.070> we'll<00:00:14.490> be<00:00:14.519> talking<00:00:14.880> about

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
in this segment we'll be talking about

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.560 
in this segment we'll be talking about
the<00:00:15.420> diatonic<00:00:15.990> scales<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.980> how<00:00:17.940> they<00:00:18.359> are

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
the diatonic scales and how they are

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.380 
the diatonic scales and how they are
connected<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.520> how<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.580> would<00:00:20.970> improvise

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
connected and how you would improvise

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.040 
connected and how you would improvise
using<00:00:22.109> them<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:23.910> first<00:00:24.300> section<00:00:25.760> that<00:00:26.760> we

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
using them the first section that we

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.250 
using them the first section that we
would<00:00:28.050> talk<00:00:28.439> about<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:29.480> we<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.750> would<00:00:30.929> take<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
would talk about is we we would take the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.350 
would talk about is we we would take the
major<00:00:31.560> scale<00:00:32.149> your<00:00:33.149> C<00:00:33.420> major<00:00:33.660> scale<00:00:33.989> again

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
major scale your C major scale again

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:48.920 
major scale your C major scale again
using<00:00:36.360> c<00:00:37.340> d<00:00:38.340> e<00:00:39.110> f<00:00:40.700> g<00:00:42.140> a<00:00:43.730> b<00:00:45.289> and<00:00:46.289> then<00:00:47.070> see<00:00:47.930> now

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
using c d e f g a b and then see now

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.010 
using c d e f g a b and then see now
what<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.770> again<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.610> take<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.390> every

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
what we do is again we take the every

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.319 
what we do is again we take the every
other<00:00:52.260> node<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.850> did<00:00:54.120> before

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
other node just like what we did before

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.279 
other node just like what we did before
we<00:00:54.840> built<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.590> chords<00:00:56.300> we<00:00:57.300> talked<00:00:57.780> about<00:00:57.930> our

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
we built the chords we talked about our

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.340 
we built the chords we talked about our
major<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.980> talked<00:00:59.219> about<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> minor<00:00:59.940> our

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
major we talked about a minor our

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
major we talked about a minor our
dominant<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.469> half<00:01:01.680> diminished<00:01:02.250> well<00:01:03.059> now

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
dominant and half diminished well now

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.899 
dominant and half diminished well now
we're<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.290> see<00:01:04.589> how<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.189> relates<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
we're going to see how that relates to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
we're going to see how that relates to
the<00:01:06.030> major<00:01:06.330> scale<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:09.000> our<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:10.260> three

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the major scale so we have our one three

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.170 
the major scale so we have our one three
five<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.909> seven<00:01:13.340> now<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:14.580> we're<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
five and seven now what we're going to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.219 
five and seven now what we're going to
do<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.720> move<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:17.330> one<00:01:18.330> step<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> time

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
do is just move up one step at a time

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.480 
do is just move up one step at a time
and<00:01:21.290> with<00:01:22.290> our<00:01:22.560> arm<00:01:22.890> keeping<00:01:23.520> our<00:01:23.700> hands<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.330> as

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
and with our arm keeping our hands at as

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.700 
and with our arm keeping our hands at as
exactly<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.670> same<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.540> keyboard<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
exactly the same on the keyboard and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.530 
exactly the same on the keyboard and
what<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.520> does<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:30.530> this<00:01:32.210> produces<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
what this does is this produces the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.490 
what this does is this produces the
diatonic<00:01:34.170> scale<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:35.430> every<00:01:35.939> other<00:01:36.090> note

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
diatonic scale going every other note

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.740 
diatonic scale going every other note
the<00:01:37.500> first<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.720> our

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the first one we we actually have our

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.889 
the first one we we actually have our
major<00:01:40.409> seven<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.579> also<00:01:41.880> called<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> one

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
major seven it's also called the one

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.100 
major seven it's also called the one
major<00:01:43.710> seven<00:01:44.310> chord<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:47.579> next<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.210> moving<00:01:48.990> up

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
major seven chord the next one moving up

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.380 
major seven chord the next one moving up
one<00:01:50.090> keeping<00:01:51.090> our<00:01:51.360> fingers<00:01:51.720> every<00:01:52.380> other<00:01:52.560> step

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
one keeping our fingers every other step

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.770 
one keeping our fingers every other step
we<00:01:54.390> would<00:01:55.020> create<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.829> minor<00:01:56.219> 7<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.570> is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
we would create the minor 7 and this is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.100 
we would create the minor 7 and this is
called<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> two<00:01:58.619> minor<00:01:58.979> 7

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.130 

it<00:02:03.040> is<00:02:03.280> comprised<00:02:03.790> of<00:02:04.210> D<00:02:04.660> F<00:02:04.990> natural<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.540> C

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
it is comprised of D F natural a and C

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.340 
it is comprised of D F natural a and C
natural<00:02:08.440> in<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.970> D<00:02:10.210> major<00:02:10.539> scale<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:11.230> would

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
natural in a D major scale you would

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.520 
natural in a D major scale you would
have<00:02:11.560> F<00:02:11.800> sharp<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.550> C<00:02:12.760> sharp<00:02:13.090> but<00:02:13.810> because<00:02:14.200> we

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
have F sharp and C sharp but because we

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.910 
have F sharp and C sharp but because we
keep<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.520> in<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.510> consistent<00:02:17.020> with<00:02:17.650> the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
keep it in in the consistent with the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.590 
keep it in in the consistent with the
major<00:02:18.190> scale<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.150> c-arm<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:21.610> created<00:02:22.390> a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
major scale of the c-arm we created a

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.490 
major scale of the c-arm we created a
minor<00:02:22.990> 7<00:02:23.620> pattern<00:02:26.010> moving<00:02:27.010> up<00:02:27.160> one<00:02:27.990> major<00:02:28.990> step

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
minor 7 pattern moving up one major step

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.690 
minor 7 pattern moving up one major step
we<00:02:30.430> now<00:02:31.120> have<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.810> minor<00:02:32.260> 7<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.220> called<00:02:33.490> the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
we now have a minor 7 this is called the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.240 
we now have a minor 7 this is called the
three<00:02:34.000> minor<00:02:34.480> 7<00:02:35.080> chord<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:36.420> what<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.570> do<00:02:37.780> is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
three minor 7 chord and what we do is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.080 
three minor 7 chord and what we do is
again<00:02:39.250> we<00:02:39.700> start<00:02:40.030> with<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.209> e<00:02:40.709> now<00:02:41.709> if<00:02:42.070> we<00:02:42.610> were

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
again we start with the e now if we were

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.690 
again we start with the e now if we were
to<00:02:43.209> have<00:02:43.420> an<00:02:43.570> E<00:02:43.810> major<00:02:44.080> scale<00:02:44.380> we<00:02:45.370> would<00:02:45.520> have

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
to have an E major scale we would have

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.080 
to have an E major scale we would have
four<00:02:46.120> sharps<00:02:46.780> f<00:02:47.370> c<00:02:48.370> g<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.630> d<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:51.250> because<00:02:51.700> this

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
four sharps f c g and d but because this

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.630 
four sharps f c g and d but because this
is<00:02:52.300> consistent<00:02:52.959> again<00:02:53.650> with<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.250> c<00:02:54.459> major

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
is consistent again with the c major

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.340 
is consistent again with the c major
scale<00:02:55.200> we<00:02:56.200> now<00:02:56.530> have<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.600> what's<00:02:58.600> known<00:02:58.840> as<00:02:59.110> the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
scale we now have on what's known as the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.940 
scale we now have on what's known as the
three<00:02:59.680> minor<00:03:00.040> seven<00:03:00.670> chord<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:02.620> a

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
three minor seven chord and it's a

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.370 
three minor seven chord and it's a
sadder<00:03:03.220> sounding<00:03:03.880> chord<00:03:04.120> again<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:05.200> is

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
sadder sounding chord again and this is

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:14.330 
sadder sounding chord again and this is
