actually going to be called Alcatraz
Island<00:00:27.960> which<00:00:28.859> obviously<00:00:29.340> everyone<00:00:30.000> cause

Alcatraz<00:00:32.820> Island<00:00:33.290> I'm<00:00:34.290> going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> assume<00:00:34.980> that

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
Alcatraz Island I'm going to assume that

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.920 
Alcatraz Island I'm going to assume that
the<00:00:35.640> reason<00:00:35.850> why<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.090> called<00:00:36.239> mob<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.719> dead

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
the reason why it's called mob the dead

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.709 
the reason why it's called mob the dead
is<00:00:37.110> either<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> storyline<00:00:38.430> or<00:00:38.719> just

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
is either for the storyline or just

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.930 
is either for the storyline or just
because<00:00:40.050> Alcatraz<00:00:40.649> might<00:00:40.920> have<00:00:41.190> copyright<00:00:41.910> I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
because Alcatraz might have copyright I

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.850 
because Alcatraz might have copyright I
don't<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.239> know<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.649> maybe

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
don't really know what that is but maybe

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.580 
don't really know what that is but maybe
it's<00:00:44.100> just<00:00:44.190> not<00:00:44.489> available<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.750> use<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> name

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it's just not available to use as a name

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.830 
it's just not available to use as a name
and<00:00:46.920> publicly<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.180> say<00:00:48.329> hey<00:00:48.570> download

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and publicly just say hey download

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.350

in the trailer but it's going to see

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.780 
in the trailer but it's going to see
it's<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.159> cool<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> see<00:01:26.759> how

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
this actually plays out in the game

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.219 
this actually plays out in the game
because<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.060> trailer<00:01:30.329> he<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.020> there

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229

made<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.149> would<00:01:46.110> assume<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:46.860> true

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
made this and I would assume that's true

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.280 
made this and I would assume that's true
because<00:01:47.399> everything<00:01:48.390> else<00:01:48.509> been<00:01:48.750> said<00:01:49.110> was

true<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.670> would<00:01:51.149> assume<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.509> there's<00:01:51.720> no

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
true so I would assume that there's no

true so I would assume that there's no
