00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The mission of the SpecV is to achieve speed on the racetrack

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Maximum power is the same as the normal GTR at 485 bhp

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but to increase mid-range torque for improved lap times there's a surprise -

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.000
High Geared Boost

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
With generous use of expensive materials like titanium and carbon

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the GTR reaches a
new level of performance

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.000
Here to confirm the speed of the SpecV 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
is a man who knows all there is to know about the R35 GTR - Keiichi Tsuchiya

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500
It's here at last

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the Japanese supercar

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's 18 million yen

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.000
So, on the right of the 
steering wheel we have

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
what's described as 80 seconds of scramble boost

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
They've really released an amazing car

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.000
The time attack begins

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.500
Is the high geared boost already on?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.000
Not yet

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.500
Perhaps because of the low temperature

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.500
after just one lap the tyres are not yet fully warmed up

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.000
It's fast!

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.500
This car just keeps evolving doesn't it?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
With the first R35 GTR

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.000
the speed basically felt like 
the machine was pushing the driver

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.500
With the 2009 model it was like car and driver were able to talk to each other

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The SpecV takes it further and says
"let me answer you a little more"

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500
[High geared boost on]
It's faaaaaast!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This could be fun

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.000
It answers you when you want oversteer

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
When the R35 GTR first came out 
it wouldn't do that at all

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.000
This is fun

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It's not scary here in the SpecV

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's very easy to drive

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Really easy to drive

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It's stable

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.500
According to Tsuchiya, the SpecV has definitely become more driver oriented

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So how is his time?

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.000
Once you get used to the behaviour of
the tyres you can really push it

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The tyres move a bit and then turn in

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.000
but once you get used to it 
you can really master it

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.500
The tyres squirm a bit 
and then the car responds

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.000
Once you just get used to that the 
lap times should come down a bit further

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.500
I'm still making some unnecessary movements

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.500
If you just drive it normally

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the tyres squirm then 
change direction and produce grip

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.500
it's a slightly unusual tyre

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
but if you just get used to it

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.500
it really changes direction nicely

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.500
It's not quite oversteer

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
but if you can drive with zero
countersteer it's very fast this car

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.500
It's a car that allows you to do that

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.000
The front of the car is really light

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.500
With the 80R corner or the last corner

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
in the last 2008 model I felt that
in those kinds of corners

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.000
the front of the car would push out 
and it felt heavy

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.500
With the SpecV it never feels heavy
in high speed corners

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
You can tell they've lightened the car

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.500
For its weight it goes through those corners really fast

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.500
It's really something!
