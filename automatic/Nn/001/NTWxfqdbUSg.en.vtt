00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.889
 Children always a very popular motive 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.580
 Of course, it's not just the guys who care about the pirates 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.009
 but meanwhile also more and more girls 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.599
 they also look at sometimes 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.259
 after one hero or another in the past 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.749
 which has made it 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.749
 to fight for a place among the old pirates 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.820
 or to pass many different adventures as a pirate 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.190
 behind the beer garden 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.330
 this old time 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
 but also has a completely different story 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.900
 they were not just in the gate 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.570
 They have 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.660
 partly worked for kings and whole governments 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.750
 have taken the risk that they will be punished as criminals 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.010
 but ultimately acted on the command of a government and and so 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.540
 maybe another world 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.380
 Harm government 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.500
 there were 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.940
 in a way, too 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.720
 Mikel 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.770
 with which various bold kills have fought 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.410
 to push each other 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.610
 or 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.039
 to prevent plans and pulling up there 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.270
 today, that's a bit different with the thought 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.580
 you will be sure 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.330
 no pirates find 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.170
 the girls say goodbye and and also run around Kreuzbein 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.860
 this is mainly because the modern crack long ago no old 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.020
 Merchant ships men fall 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 but rather luxury cruisers 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.070
 or 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.210
 really the big transport ships 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.750
 huge company 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.750
 where they can also make big prey 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.079
 and off the coast at Milan 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.239
 Sarah is the pirate life in recent years 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.739
 which is not interesting because it is fun for people 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.239
 but simply because they have no other alternative 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.989
 Of course, these pirates do not do it just when I'm just talking 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:32.909
 on 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.780
 Raid ship with Masur and grappling hook 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.710
 to come here 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.710
 Schorn modern boats speed boats 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.829
 and weapons, of course 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.219
 instead of a very normal statement or an old gun it is a 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:49.799
 give 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.650
 once the machine gun 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.759
 or another weapon 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:56.729
 which one uses much more today 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:57.640
 when 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.219
 the two weeks 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.739
 from percent 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.739
 paid for the past four days 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.249
 even if 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.569
 The pirate life is very interesting for many children 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.779
 It was just that it was just beside her 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.499
 that was the way it used to be in the past and that's how it is today 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.680
 Pirates have always been human though 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.680
 like to have celebrated big once 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.369
 but that does not mean 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.509
 that really can live on a big footing 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.749
 pirates 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:38.179
 have also been in the past on Wednesday could or months too 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:39.749
 had to fight 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.959
 by hardly having anything reasonable to eat 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.359
 because it simply did not have an opportunity 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.919
 a new merchant ship or a 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.369
 Locals attacking in the victory today 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.549
 the steady and in our communities 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:02.759
 in many museums 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:06.289
 were therefore certainly not able to make an exception 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.529
 the everyday life of pirates are called
