00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
on the sides which was kind of hard to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
do and that's on both sides that took a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.600 
do and that's on both sides that took a
little<00:01:23.520> time<00:01:23.820> um<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.590> body<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> white<00:01:26.340> body

was<00:01:31.530> painted<00:01:32.189> um<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:33.360> what<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.869> did<00:01:34.200> was<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.650> took

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
was painted um and what I did was I took

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.730 
was painted um and what I did was I took
one<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> many<00:01:36.570> many<00:01:36.840> figures<00:01:37.079> hair<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> had

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
one of the many many figures hair I had

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.289 
one of the many many figures hair I had
and<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.250> was<00:01:38.369> either<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.520> or<00:01:38.670> was<00:01:38.939> tempted<00:01:39.240> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and it was either this or was tempted to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.940 
and it was either this or was tempted to
give<00:01:39.420> her<00:01:39.509> ponytail<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.500> thought<00:01:40.740> she

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
give her ponytail but I thought she

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.550 
give her ponytail but I thought she
looked<00:01:41.130> better<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> regular<00:01:41.880> hair<00:01:42.090> I

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
looked better with the regular hair I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.020 
looked better with the regular hair I
gave<00:01:43.560> her<00:01:43.680> blue<00:01:43.860> lightning<00:01:44.189> bolt<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
gave her blue lightning bolt which I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.249 
gave her blue lightning bolt which I
didn't<00:01:45.180> really<00:01:45.299> pain<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> thought<00:01:46.079> she

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
didn't really pain but I thought she

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
didn't really pain but I thought she
looked<00:01:46.409> pretty<00:01:46.619> cool<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.100> um<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
looked pretty cool with it um but the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.359 
looked pretty cool with it um but the
