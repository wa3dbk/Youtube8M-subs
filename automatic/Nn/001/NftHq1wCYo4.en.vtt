00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
not exactly sure I don't have any

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.219 
not exactly sure I don't have any
experience<00:01:57.979> with<00:01:58.100> smuggler<00:01:58.549> planes<00:01:59.229> really

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
experience with smuggler planes really

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.139 
experience with smuggler planes really
but<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:00.799> know<00:02:00.829> I've<00:02:01.009> only<00:02:01.189> did<00:02:01.459> it<00:02:01.490> once<00:02:01.819> and<00:02:02.060> I

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
but you know I've only did it once and I

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.760 
but you know I've only did it once and I
only<00:02:02.299> did<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.569> for<00:02:02.659> like<00:02:02.869> first<00:02:03.170> two<00:02:03.319> times<00:02:03.469> but

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
only did it for like first two times but

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.969 
only did it for like first two times but
away<00:02:03.920> from<00:02:03.950> 3,000<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:05.049> 6,000<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.709> then<00:02:06.889> I

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
away from 3,000 to 6,000 and then I

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.920 
away from 3,000 to 6,000 and then I
stopped<00:02:07.219> right<00:02:07.429> there<00:02:07.459> but<00:02:07.909> I've<00:02:08.509> been<00:02:08.750> told

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
stopped right there but I've been told

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.780 
stopped right there but I've been told
that<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.260> keeps<00:02:09.410> going<00:02:09.710> up<00:02:09.950> after<00:02:10.430> that<00:02:10.610> so

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
that it keeps going up after that so

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.280 
that it keeps going up after that so
keep<00:02:10.970> on<00:02:11.120> doing<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.720> I'm<00:02:11.840> pretty<00:02:11.960> sure<00:02:12.050> it

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
keep on doing it and I'm pretty sure it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.800 
keep on doing it and I'm pretty sure it
goes<00:02:12.410> although

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
goes although

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.080 
goes although
up<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.989> thirty<00:02:13.290> or<00:02:13.530> sixty<00:02:13.739> thousand<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.580> then

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
up to thirty or sixty thousand and then

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.280 
up to thirty or sixty thousand and then
I'm<00:02:15.239> thinking<00:02:15.450> I'm<00:02:15.660> pretty<00:02:15.959> sure<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.200> will

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
I'm thinking I'm pretty sure it will

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.050 
I'm thinking I'm pretty sure it will
stop<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:16.709> interest<00:02:17.040> dashboard<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.790> come

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
stop with interest dashboard and come

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.460 
stop with interest dashboard and come
back<00:02:18.209> now<00:02:18.450> obviously<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.110> isn't<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
back now obviously this isn't the
