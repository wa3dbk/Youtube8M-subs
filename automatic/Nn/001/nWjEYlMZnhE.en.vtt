the<00:00:07.649> butterflies<00:00:08.069> now<00:00:08.910> these<00:00:09.330> butterflies

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
the butterflies now these butterflies

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.690 
the butterflies now these butterflies
are<00:00:09.750> origami<00:00:10.620> or<00:00:10.830> if<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.010> want<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.309> can<00:00:11.400> trim

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
are origami or if you want you can trim

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.890 
are origami or if you want you can trim
them<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.940> little<00:00:12.210> bit<00:00:12.330> with<00:00:12.420> scissors<00:00:12.690> but<00:00:12.870> I

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
them a little bit with scissors but I

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.539 
them a little bit with scissors but I
think<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.230> technically<00:00:13.980> doesn't<00:00:14.250> make<00:00:14.460> it

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
think that technically doesn't make it

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.490 
think that technically doesn't make it
origami<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.360> your<00:00:15.450> choice<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:16.379> they're

waiting<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.290> point<00:00:37.559> creating<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> diagonal

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
waiting to point creating a diagonal

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.610 
waiting to point creating a diagonal
open<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.960> up<00:00:40.460> fold<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.090> way<00:00:42.149> again<00:00:42.870> point

to point again if you're doing your if

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.319 
to point again if you're doing your if
you're<00:00:57.120> sewing<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.360> neatly<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.960> far<00:00:59.329> crease

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
you're sewing it neatly so far crease

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.509 
you're sewing it neatly so far crease
will<00:01:00.960> meet<00:01:01.199> exactly<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> middle<00:01:03.049> yes

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
will meet exactly in the middle yes

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.130 
will meet exactly in the middle yes
origami<00:01:05.519> need<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.729> great<00:01:06.060> way<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.450> sort<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
origami need a great way just sort of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.399 
origami need a great way just sort of
contantly<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.100> turn<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> round<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.540> great

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
contantly it now turn it round a great

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.330 
contantly it now turn it round a great
way<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:11.630> impractical<00:01:12.630> neatness<00:01:13.229> skills<00:01:13.770> which

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
way to impractical neatness skills which

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.929 
way to impractical neatness skills which
is<00:01:14.460> something<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.939> don't<00:01:15.390> actually<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:16.939> once

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
is something I don't actually have once

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.300 
is something I don't actually have once
you<00:01:18.060> open<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.450> put<00:01:19.170> your<00:01:19.320> diagonals<00:01:19.799> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you open it up put your diagonals and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.149 
you open it up put your diagonals and
your<00:01:20.460> cross<00:01:21.320> now<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.380> need<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.979> take

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
your cross now you need to just take

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.830 
your cross now you need to just take
either<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.700> side<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.270> side<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.720> no

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
either this side or that side of no

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.999 
either this side or that side of no
matter<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:26.000> bring<00:01:27.000> these<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
matter and bring these so this for the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
matter and bring these so this for the
young<00:01:29.220> forwards<00:01:29.729> off<00:01:30.079> like<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.500> see

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
young forwards off like this can you see

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:41.810 
young forwards off like this can you see
that<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:34.549> gently<00:01:35.549> fold<00:01:37.189> it<00:01:38.299> down<00:01:40.820> see

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that and then gently fold it down see

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.660 
that and then gently fold it down see
that<00:01:42.030> I'll<00:01:42.360> show<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.600> again<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:44.460> bring

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that I'll show you again so you bring

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.260 
that I'll show you again so you bring
these<00:01:44.850> two<00:01:44.909> points<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.630> bring<00:01:46.049> them<00:01:46.170> together

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.700 

now<00:01:51.270> if<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.450> was<00:01:51.689> white<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.259> side<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
now if this was white on one side and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.990 
now if this was white on one side and
nearly<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.009> other<00:01:53.189> you'd<00:01:53.460> want<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> white

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
nearly on the other you'd want the white

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.780 
nearly on the other you'd want the white
on<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> inside<00:01:54.840> right<00:01:55.110> now<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> now<00:01:58.549> I'm<00:01:59.549> going

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
on the inside right now so now I'm going

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.569 
on the inside right now so now I'm going
to<00:01:59.850> fall<00:02:00.060> down<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.659> top<00:02:00.899> one<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.399> lot<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
to fall down the top one a lot of you

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.920 
to fall down the top one a lot of you
know<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.820> straight<00:02:03.149> edge<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.719> this

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
know this straight edge and on this

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.770 
know this straight edge and on this
straight<00:02:04.259> edge<00:02:04.579> so<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> points<00:02:06.180> meet<00:02:06.420> at<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
straight edge so the points meet at the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.859 
straight edge so the points meet at the
end

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
end

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.380 
end
and<00:02:08.110> then<00:02:08.289> I'm<00:02:08.410> going<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.649> take<00:02:08.800> this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and then I'm going to take this

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.790 
and then I'm going to take this
straightedge<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.720> meet<00:02:11.019> this<00:02:11.530> straight<00:02:11.980> edge

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.360 

then<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:17.950> turn<00:02:18.190> around<00:02:19.830> before<00:02:20.830> actually<00:02:21.310> you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
then I turn around before actually you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.009 
then I turn around before actually you
can<00:02:21.459> go<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:21.700> way<00:02:21.910> now<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.810> put<00:02:22.930> about

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
can go this way now so you put about

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.720 
can go this way now so you put about
