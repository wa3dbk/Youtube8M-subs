00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.139
 what is the state otherwise of another 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.139
 world 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:23.150
 he is very calm very humble 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.550
 he has treated me very well the truth that 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.340
 and for me you are in everything special had 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.840
 all very well for the people the 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.550
 trainings go train and little 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.250
 still but it shows the quality that 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.730
 has the selection had a little bit of 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.379
 scared but I want to do as I was going I was going to 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.470
 be but the age that surprised me 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.800
 quite a lot of people that while 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.559
 very well we do not see difference and nobody 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.660
 the truth that I see a group very united in 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.269
 something that will play like other 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.010
 Sometimes the truth is that when I have doubts 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.390
 of something always asks them che 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.299
 well this one already had a good 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.879
 impressed from the first time he has 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.190
 been with him has been different this 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.500
 happens bring tranquility is that 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.240
 but it need not come to 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.520
 very well I'm very happy I can not 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.830
 be able to debut with the selection in a 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.979
 cauldron which is that it is our house in 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.850
 house you can hire already is always a 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.280
 motivation more than trying that myself 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.080
 do not do with the calm the desire 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.540
 that I always have and I'm here 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.370
 point that's in the athleti I do not think 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.550
 who wants to bet the same 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.550
 more than I bet my team to try 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.360
 be 60 important and useful within the 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.070
 selection wanting to prove my 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.980
 value for everything that has been given everything that 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.540
 what happened during these months I have a 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.400
 mind in prime left to this passive 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.400
 there are many things that can happen during 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.140
 six months and a peak that is still between 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.830
 that I started the world 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.700
 well I will try to do my job and hopefully 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.700
 what can it be there 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.290
 It was true that I was going to go 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.850
 It was good that I like how I like it 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.850
 like
