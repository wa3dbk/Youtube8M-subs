00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.619
 Hello everyone today, I want to share this 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.500
 a few of such reflections 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.330
 why not sell this car yes if 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.779
 who else did not understand the last video there and 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.960
 looked white and 60 still not for sale 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.339
 and I had to make out well and took 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.470
 as if by your will 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.930
 they did n't care anyway the menu was there 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.500
 leave at least sell how much you 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.590
 will fit but I realized that the sense is cheaper than 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:46.890
 for 23,000 how I wanted to sell no 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:50.829
 sense really here she was on sale 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.440
 about 30 days and i was honest i so 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.420
 upset that during this time there was no 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.519
 one test drive and there was not even 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.059
 one serious scam how would 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.010
 offer to purchase and had to just 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.440
 how well I looked thought that I would 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.430
 I'd rather take it I will ride it myself 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.110
 I'm happy with all of us also I'm there 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.119
 received a few comments such that 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.790
 what really spent how much 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.240
 time and money to do all that 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.759
 wanted to 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.770
 outside and now I sell 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.430
 I really think that this is a group for now 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.350
 and think the foam is not going to go a little bit and 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.540
 would like to say one such thought 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.340
 why she did not sell now in America 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.920
 and generally sale 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.270
 used cars it is strong 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.950
 dropped by the fact that if you want 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.810
 take a loan here the waterfront times 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.670
 the first is that very low interest on 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.720
 loans especially if you are good 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.840
 credit history 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.850
 you can totally take new 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.909
 1 and 9 percent, that is, less than two 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.759
 percent of the car loan is also valuable 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.630
 so fell well if you will pay 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:03.520
 cash cash is the one they fell too 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.320
 because cars from dealers in new 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.200
 who sell new cars 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.020
 they also give very good interest 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.370
 even now here are toyota they 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.330
 clean your 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.739
 so here is a 2000 model year 13 and they even 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.170
 some cars give zero 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.790
 percent and in america just for those who 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.480
 I do not know that the loan is very much 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.860
 such a mover 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.799
 as if part of the sale 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.989
 cars and people practically 90 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.310
 percent probably even 95 percent 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.870
 buy cars on credit and 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.440
 the person who expects to spend 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.819
 there are 25 30 thousand for used 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.349
 he really should take a car 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.870
 bear some down payment and take 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.629
 brand new car dealer with 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.560
 all warranties with all services 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:58.599
 because now, too, almost everything 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.950
 dealer they are trying to impose on you 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.440
 buying a new car 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.010
 offer there even life wheels 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.599
 So I like to buy a car is not given 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.909
 if i will to come to the service 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.950
 they are not guaranteed a life replacement 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.450
 rubber that is such here they eat 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.690
 how to catch you if only you 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.639
 subscribed to buy a new car 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.349
 that is, because of this, as if this is so alone 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.150
 of such reasons why this car is not 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.609
 also sold more why she did not 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.579
 I sold and the fact that I wanted more 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.849
 say it's about the easiest 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.069
 the engine is not turbocharged and and 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.590
 it turns out that people do not care 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.290
 most who buy used 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.930
 struggle they want to take 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.620
 maximum car for minimum 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.879
 amount of money and of course the difference between 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:54.220
 535 and 528 but approximately in America somewhere 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:57.040
 six thousand dollars but people just they 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.410
 as they want and therefore do not want to take 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.169
 This is the easiest, or do they want to take 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.900
 at least 528 x 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:08.079
 and that it was all-wheel drive that is 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.940
 In principle, there are two such two 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.639
 This factor is how I say that 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.160
 not enough at the gate of thought like 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.389
 the engine in this case and the second factor 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.769
 this is something that is now more profitable to buy 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.700
 new car or buy it 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.870
 authorized dealer there 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.060
 what for example to buy a used one just like that 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.220
 your couple of thoughts about this so you 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.130
 watched my video will see will see 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.780
 her in the parking lot in front of the house and not 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.820
 there were no tricks I wanted it 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.880
 say that this car is not for sale 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.920
 blowing while driving and waiting for your 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.840
 Comment your thoughts as sold 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.610
 Generally used your cars 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.010
 the places where you live would be 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.900
 I'm interested in reading all the comments 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.220
 I read and try to answer everything but 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.290
 I answer whenever possible to read all 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.280
 comments always subscribe 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.600
 Thanks for watching my videos and 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.700
 next couple of weeks and probably not 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.210
 there will be no videos because I'm leaving 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.130
 in my life at least that changes me 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.460
 Then I will probably do this video 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.230
 tell you how it would be thinking to be you 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.920
 it's also interesting to see everything before new 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.920
 meetings yet
