what a big production it was turning

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.810 
what a big production it was turning
into<00:00:59.750> which<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.170> really<00:01:01.559> awesome<00:01:01.770> thing<00:01:02.219> but

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
into which is a really awesome thing but

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.219 
into which is a really awesome thing but
at<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> same<00:01:03.180> time<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.660> was<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.049> dead

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
at the same time it was just dead

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.670 
at the same time it was just dead
becoming<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.280> more<00:01:05.549> daunting<00:01:05.820> task

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
becoming a more and more daunting task

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
becoming a more and more daunting task
we<00:01:07.680> were<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:07.920> excited<00:01:08.010> about<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:09.180> we

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
we were so excited about it but we

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.940 
we were so excited about it but we
really<00:01:09.630> wanted<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.110> getting<00:01:10.380> more<00:01:10.470> content

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
really wanted to be getting more content

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.580 
really wanted to be getting more content
out<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.729> guys<00:01:11.760> quicker<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.380> just

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
out to you guys quicker and we just

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.800 
out to you guys quicker and we just
hated<00:01:13.860> making<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.220> wait<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.760> long<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.689> we

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
hated making you wait so long I think we

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.649 
hated making you wait so long I think we
were<00:01:15.960> doing<00:01:16.290> too<00:01:16.500> much<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.040> um<00:01:17.520> i<00:01:18.270> guess<00:01:18.450> if

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
were doing too much and um i guess if

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
were doing too much and um i guess if
you<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.140> too<00:01:19.290> much<00:01:19.520> we<00:01:20.520> were<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.670> getting

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
you can do too much we were just getting

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 
you can do too much we were just getting
ahead<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> ourselves<00:01:22.020> basically<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:23.040> were

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
ahead of ourselves basically we were

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.609 
ahead of ourselves basically we were
taking<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.060> too<00:01:24.240> much<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.259> was<00:01:25.409> just

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
taking on too much and it was just

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.969 
taking on too much and it was just
turning<00:01:25.860> into<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.280> huge<00:01:26.580> thing<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
turning into this huge thing that

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.440 
turning into this huge thing that
unfortunately<00:01:28.979> none<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.250> us<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.640> had<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
unfortunately none of us really had the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.039 
unfortunately none of us really had the
time<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.560> or<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> budget<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.509> i

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
time for and or the budget for and i

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.679 
time for and or the budget for and i
think<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.380> sort<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.860> realized<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.540> you<00:01:36.540> know

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
think we sort of realized was you know

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.050 
think we sort of realized was you know
we<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.590> want<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.790> we<00:01:38.909> don't

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
we really want to do this and we don't

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.420 
we really want to do this and we don't
want<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.420> give<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.560> need<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.040> sort<00:01:41.220> of

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
want to give up we just need to sort of

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.389 
want to give up we just need to sort of
re-evaluate<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.770> took<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> learning

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
re-evaluate and we took it as a learning

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.880 
re-evaluate and we took it as a learning
experience<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:46.020> sort<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> simplified

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
experience and just sort of simplified

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.800 
experience and just sort of simplified
basically<00:01:47.549> what<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.790> were<00:01:47.880> doing<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.479> we

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
basically what we were doing and we

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.499 
basically what we were doing and we
realized<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.320> episode<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.759> i<00:01:51.090> mean

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
realized that episode one is i mean

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.940 
realized that episode one is i mean
that's<00:01:51.689> that's<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.290> web<00:01:52.439> series<00:01:52.770> that's

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
that's that's the web series that's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.139 
that's that's the web series that's
where<00:01:53.130> we're<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.579> that's<00:01:53.729> kind<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.030> what

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
where we're at and that's kind of what

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.330 
where we're at and that's kind of what
we<00:01:54.270> want<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.540> do<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:55.079> me<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.649> most<00:01:55.770> important

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
we want to do for me the most important

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.219 
we want to do for me the most important
thing<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.360> guys<00:01:57.540> laugh<00:01:57.930> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
thing is just that you guys laugh and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.539 
thing is just that you guys laugh and
that<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.500> fun<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.890> entertaining<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.520> watch

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that it's fun and entertaining to watch

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.760 
that it's fun and entertaining to watch
I<00:01:59.939> think<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.540> when<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.899> watched<00:02:01.110> episode<00:02:01.619> two

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
I think that when we watched episode two

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.280 
I think that when we watched episode two
back<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.189> sort<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> realized<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.180> um<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
back we sort of realized that um you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.109 
back we sort of realized that um you
know<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:04.860> still<00:02:05.130> funny<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.939> just

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
know it was still funny but it just

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.150 
know it was still funny but it just
didn't<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.630> same<00:02:07.049> feel<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.920> felt

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
didn't have the same feel it just felt

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.760 
didn't have the same feel it just felt
different<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:09.179> wasn't<00:02:09.569> fully<00:02:09.720> working<00:02:10.259> we

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
different it wasn't fully working we

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.410 
different it wasn't fully working we
basically<00:02:11.129> have<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.580> sort<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.790> restructured

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
basically have just sort of restructured

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.780 
basically have just sort of restructured
and<00:02:12.720> we've<00:02:12.930> simplified<00:02:13.260> things<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.860> lot<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.310> we

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and we've simplified things a lot and we

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.309 
and we've simplified things a lot and we
sort<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.060> realized<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.629> think<00:02:15.900> we<00:02:16.020> sort<00:02:16.200> of

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
sort of realized I think we sort of

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.020 
sort of realized I think we sort of
learned<00:02:16.590> through<00:02:17.190> these<00:02:17.400> past<00:02:17.640> couple<00:02:17.849> months

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
learned through these past couple months

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.420 
learned through these past couple months
of<00:02:18.420> working<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:19.050> episode<00:02:19.440> 2<00:02:19.650> an<00:02:19.770> episode<00:02:20.129> 3

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
of working on episode 2 an episode 3

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.600 
of working on episode 2 an episode 3
where<00:02:21.150> we<00:02:21.300> want<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.569> be<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:22.110> for<00:02:22.890> at<00:02:23.099> least<00:02:23.280> for

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
where we want to be and for at least for

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.330 
where we want to be and for at least for
us<00:02:23.640> what<00:02:24.060> makes<00:02:24.270> us<00:02:24.450> laugh<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.050> what<00:02:25.349> what

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
us what makes us laugh and what what

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.309 
us what makes us laugh and what what
sort<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.640> works<00:02:26.819> for<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.450> series<00:02:27.780> itself<00:02:27.930> I

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
sort of works for the series itself I

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.570 
sort of works for the series itself I
think<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> most<00:02:28.709> important<00:02:29.220> thing<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.550> that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
think the most important thing is that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.869 
think the most important thing is that
I'm<00:02:30.000> able<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.360> get<00:02:30.569> content<00:02:31.110> out<00:02:31.489> quicker<00:02:32.489> and

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
I'm able to get content out quicker and

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.750 
I'm able to get content out quicker and
on<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.930> more<00:02:34.050> regular<00:02:34.230> basis<00:02:35.129> I<00:02:35.280> think<00:02:35.489> that

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
on a more regular basis I think that

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.089 
on a more regular basis I think that
that's<00:02:36.060> sort<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:37.500> wasn't<00:02:37.830> going<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.010> be

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
that's sort of that wasn't going to be

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.890 
that's sort of that wasn't going to be
possible<00:02:38.340> with<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.000> way<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.510> were<00:02:39.629> doing

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
possible with the way that we were doing

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.350 
possible with the way that we were doing
it<00:02:40.019> before<00:02:40.170> we<00:02:40.739> have<00:02:40.920> episode<00:02:41.370> 2<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.849> episode

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
it before we have episode 2 and episode

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.830
