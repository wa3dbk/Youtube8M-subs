 Then let's take out the silver we'll peel off here when we first raise 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:29.180
 If you rub too hard at such a large number of land etc. it will disappear so it will be light 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:33.349
 It is recommended to rub lightly 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.680
 This number has become like this Panko was able to undersea 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:40.189

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.189
 Then 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.060
 Enter a number where it came out to add the music with human prepaid numbers 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.420

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:06.010

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.830
 Let's do 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:23.950
 Now this but I'm usually a 500 yen place to be 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:27.810
 It will be 30 yen, so I'll check it lightly in the individual purchase and next 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.810
 If there is no problem with the purchase 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.460
 Then I will go through the procedure now 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.730
 Because it starts 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.820
 It will take some time to download so let's wait a minute 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.650

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.450
 It's seems to open 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:55.250
 It looks like you're downloading for now, so I think I'd like to wait for a while 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.350
 Hey! I 'm sorry to have pressed the home button now. 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.910

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:04.320

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:07.800
 Yes there was a home button and something like that 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.280
 I Install a download management download of the software is complete 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.880
 Say 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:16.320

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.900
 So I would like to install Start installation a little bit 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:25.600
 I think it would be nice if it is 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:29.650
 Wii u was a dedicated software or it seems to take quite some time 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.669
 As this balloon fight was about 36 people , it is quite 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:37.260
 I was able to finish a good stall that I wrote that speed was also within one minute 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:41.310
 You can play this software from the wii u menu 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:45.900
 Do you understand this? A balloon fight has been added 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.280
 So I think I can't do it for a while and I can't show you this 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.969
 I wonder 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:57.360
 I think something good at hand and Rutteyuu a portable game machine 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:57.360
 I think something good at hand and Rutteyuu a portable game machine 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:07.070

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:21.620

 How about having fun by all means if it was 30 yen 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:58.889
 I don't think there is a loss, so the normal price is 500 yen, so it's 30 yen 3 years 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:02.939
