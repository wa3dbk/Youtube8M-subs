there was a fee involved and i couldn't
i<00:02:29.560> think<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.820> know<00:02:30.850> i<00:02:30.940> couldn't<00:02:31.270> really

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
i think you know i couldn't really

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.880 
i think you know i couldn't really
guarantee<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.230> we<00:02:32.500> could<00:02:32.710> meet<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.130> fee

this<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.459> still<00:02:36.670> can't<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:40.890> think<00:02:41.890> from

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
this is I still can't but I think from

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.490 
this is I still can't but I think from
his<00:02:42.910> representative<00:02:43.630> side<00:02:43.870> there's<00:02:44.320> always

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
his representative side there's always

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.660 
his representative side there's always
an<00:02:44.590> opportunity<00:02:44.650> because<00:02:45.160> we<00:02:45.310> lost<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.550> make

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
an opportunity because we lost to make

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.710 
an opportunity because we lost to make

pushing<00:02:50.020> for<00:02:50.140> mind<00:02:50.320> I<00:02:51.130> think<00:02:51.670> he's<00:02:51.760> got

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
pushing for mind I think he's got

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.580 
pushing for mind I think he's got
options<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.660> think<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.110> know<00:02:53.140> he's<00:02:53.440> got

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
options and I think you know he's got

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.080 
options and I think you know he's got
options<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.190> championship<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.850> think<00:02:55.000> he's

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
options in the championship I think he's

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.699 
options in the championship I think he's
got<00:02:55.209> options<00:02:55.360> in<00:02:55.660> Scotland<00:02:56.110> so<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.410> think<00:02:56.560> it's

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
got options in Scotland so I think it's

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.729 
got options in Scotland so I think it's
got<00:02:56.860> options<00:02:57.040> but<00:02:57.550> it's<00:02:57.640> um<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.810> know<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
got options but it's um you know the

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.940 
got options but it's um you know the
agent<00:03:00.100> probably<00:03:00.310> sees<00:03:00.660> leave<00:03:01.660> one<00:03:01.900> club<00:03:02.230> of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
agent probably sees leave one club of

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.420 
agent probably sees leave one club of
our<00:03:03.160> stature

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.399 
our stature
the<00:03:04.900> most<00:03:05.900> sensible<00:03:06.200> move<00:03:07.870> which<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:09.290> know

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409

the most sensible move which you know
like<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:09.709> think<00:03:10.099> that's<00:03:10.219> been<00:03:10.400> I<00:03:10.640> don't<00:03:11.209> think

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
like I think that's been I don't think

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.039 
like I think that's been I don't think
that's<00:03:11.569> really<00:03:12.310> something<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.340> gence<00:03:13.640> of

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
that's really something I gence of

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.959 
that's really something I gence of
common<00:03:15.049> sense<00:03:15.170> is<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:16.069> that<00:03:16.370> common<00:03:16.790> but

wintered<00:04:27.949> human<00:04:28.880> body<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.599> think<00:04:30.050> that's<00:04:30.199> is<00:04:30.680> it

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
wintered human body I think that's is it

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.080 
wintered human body I think that's is it
you'll<00:04:31.039> be<00:04:31.130> good<00:04:31.310> round<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.610> place<00:04:31.760> I<00:04:31.820> think

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
you'll be good round the place I think

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.290 
you'll be good round the place I think
he's<00:04:33.340> experiencing<00:04:34.340> his<00:04:34.400> personality<00:04:35.060> will

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
he's experiencing his personality will

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.460 
he's experiencing his personality will
blab<00:04:35.750> to<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.409> group<00:04:37.270> that's<00:04:38.270> as<00:04:39.020> well<00:04:39.199> as<00:04:39.320> been

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
blab to the group that's as well as been

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.820 
blab to the group that's as well as been
quite<00:04:39.979> a<00:04:40.009> powerful<00:04:40.250> centre-forward<00:04:41.830> so

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
quite a powerful centre-forward so

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.350 
quite a powerful centre-forward so
that's<00:04:43.009> that's<00:04:43.430> that's<00:04:43.789> the<00:04:44.000> reasoning

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
that's that's that's the reasoning

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.770 
that's that's that's the reasoning
behind<00:04:44.419> it<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.080> wash<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:45.620> down<00:04:45.860> Marlin<00:04:46.340> is

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
behind it and wash it down Marlin is

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.210 
behind it and wash it down Marlin is
like<00:04:47.780> I<00:04:47.900> say<00:04:48.050> he's<00:04:48.229> been<00:04:48.590> around<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.919> block<00:04:49.039> so

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
like I say he's been around the block so

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.160 
like I say he's been around the block so
I<00:04:50.310> think<00:04:50.880> if<00:04:50.970> we<00:04:51.060> just<00:04:51.090> up<00:04:51.330> front<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:51.900> honest

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
I think if we just up front and honest

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.410 
I think if we just up front and honest
with<00:04:52.320> him<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.440> he'll<00:04:53.280> decide<00:04:53.580> what<00:04:53.850> very

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
with him and he'll decide what very

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.630 
with him and he'll decide what very
future<00:04:54.810> lies<00:04:54.960> you<00:04:55.860> still<00:04:56.040> got<00:04:56.130> work<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.370> do<00:04:56.490> on

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
future lies you still got work to do on

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.430 
future lies you still got work to do on
a<00:04:56.670> Steven<00:04:57.480> Davis<00:04:57.720> replacement<00:04:58.230> now<00:04:58.290> that

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
a Steven Davis replacement now that

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.700 
a Steven Davis replacement now that
transfer<00:04:59.010> is<00:04:59.100> confirmed<00:04:59.610> then<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.880> Blackpool

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710

transfer is confirmed then to Blackpool
yeah<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.770> think<00:05:01.860> it's<00:05:02.160> an<00:05:02.550> area<00:05:02.730> that<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:02.970> think

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
yeah I think it's an area that I think

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.690 
yeah I think it's an area that I think
we<00:05:03.360> were<00:05:03.540> without<00:05:04.130> even<00:05:05.130> if<00:05:05.190> stately<00:05:05.640> steel

we were without even if stately steel
here<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:06.150> think<00:05:06.390> we<00:05:06.450> need<00:05:06.600> is<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:06.900> know<00:05:07.020> we've
