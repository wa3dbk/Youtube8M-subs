00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.040
 you can go 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.300
 yes 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.070
 come out this morning I lit this 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.240
 all sparks 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.180
 it's open 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.520
 then it is not all dry 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.350
 they all have a distribution box 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.400
 what they do as it leads to a loss 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.400
 everything exists 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:58.780
 and how are they yes 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.780
 Knowing wet 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.100
 so 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 4 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:44.960
 and if not, we should not look for this 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.240
 that is why he does not know if he does not know if it is 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.240
 then you have to avoid getting wet 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.350
 seeing it like this for the time that we have 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.330
 brought the cooking is well taken care of well 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.690
 preserved then it should not be too 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.690
 all right 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.520
 some of my skin every day because I do not 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:08.520
 it has no spots 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 all right
