00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:14.240
 It's funny when you consider that every minute 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.310
 Someone is working on Assassin's Creed IV. 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.429
 If you only have mail contact, you don't really get to know each other. 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.499
 Once you have drunk a beer together, 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.829
 know how you put someone together. 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.910
 Seven studios are working on Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag. 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.779
 There is no mutual struggle. 

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:47.840
 we work together on the same game. 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.759
 When we started forming the team, our goal was 

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:57.929
 that the game would be fun to play with a great focus on quality. 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.220
 It is very exciting to work on Assassin's Creed. Very dynamic. 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.180
 We work together a lot, and we all work very hard 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.150
 to make the game as good as possible. 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.850
 We test every day, all over the world. We have a special test studio 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.810
 and we have doubled the number of tests. 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.190
 One of the hardest things when you make a game 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.290
 is to create a credible vision. 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.920
 If that succeeds, you're in the right place. 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.920
 I am most proud that we are a big one 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.600
 have created a varied world. It really feels like you're on a journey of discovery. 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.940
 It's really incredible like all your employees 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.100
 believe in the vision and support it. The results are spectacular.
