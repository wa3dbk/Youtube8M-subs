00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
get on one you can't describe the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.080

feeling<00:03:11.310> every<00:03:12.780> every<00:03:13.780> strike<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:15.250> the

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
feeling every every strike of the of the

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.000 
feeling every every strike of the of the
ignition<00:03:16.360> plug<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.870> sort<00:03:17.079> of<00:03:17.170> sets<00:03:17.379> off<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> mini

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
ignition plug it sort of sets off a mini

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.789 
ignition plug it sort of sets off a mini
earthquake<00:03:18.579> it's<00:03:19.389> just<00:03:19.690> such<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.440> great

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
earthquake it's just such a great

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.680 
earthquake it's just such a great
experience<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.400> be<00:03:21.549> on<00:03:21.700> really<00:03:22.600> wide<00:03:24.690> looking

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
experience to be on really wide looking

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.830 
experience to be on really wide looking
bike<00:03:25.930> loads<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.650> presence<00:03:27.130> I'm<00:03:27.549> not<00:03:28.209> too<00:03:28.480> keen

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
bike loads of presence I'm not too keen

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.610 
bike loads of presence I'm not too keen
if<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:30.010> be<00:03:30.160> honest<00:03:30.519> with<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.910> that<00:03:31.260> look<00:03:32.260> that

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
if to be honest with you that look that

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.379 
if to be honest with you that look that
side<00:03:32.980> look<00:03:33.280> doesn't<00:03:33.489> really<00:03:33.760> do<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.060> for<00:03:34.090> me<00:03:34.269> I

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
side look doesn't really do it for me I

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.500 
side look doesn't really do it for me I
think<00:03:34.510> it's<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.750> bit<00:03:34.900> too<00:03:35.079> short<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:36.489> just<00:03:36.730> my

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
think it's a bit too short it's just my

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.750 
think it's a bit too short it's just my
opinion<00:03:38.049> but<00:03:38.260> when<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.280> get<00:03:39.430> onto<00:03:39.579> a

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
opinion but when you get onto a

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.069 
opinion but when you get onto a
three-quarter<00:03:40.720> look<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:43.209> really<00:03:43.480> comes<00:03:43.870> into

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
three-quarter look it really comes into

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.830 
three-quarter look it really comes into
its<00:03:44.319> own<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:45.099> really<00:03:45.430> does<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:46.000> gone<00:03:46.630> for<00:03:46.780> the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
its own it really does I gone for the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.690 
its own it really does I gone for the
two-tone<00:03:47.349> color<00:03:48.209> blue<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:49.419> white<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:50.700> I

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
two-tone color blue and white and I

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.539 
two-tone color blue and white and I
think<00:03:52.209> it's<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:53.260> best-looking<00:03:53.980> one<00:03:54.340> they've

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
think it's the best-looking one they've

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.129 
think it's the best-looking one they've
come<00:03:54.700> out<00:03:54.730> with<00:03:54.940> some<00:03:55.060> haze<00:03:55.359> colors<00:03:55.930> which

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
come out with some haze colors which

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.409 
come out with some haze colors which
look<00:03:56.349> really<00:03:56.799> cool<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.069> have<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.489> say<00:03:57.790> a<00:03:58.030> red

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
look really cool I have to say a red

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.809 
look really cool I have to say a red
haze<00:03:59.319> and<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.739> think<00:03:59.919> there's<00:04:00.099> a<00:04:00.160> another<00:04:00.579> blue

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
haze and I think there's a another blue

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.059 
haze and I think there's a another blue
haze<00:04:01.120> but<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.750> think<00:04:02.200> this<00:04:02.290> is<00:04:02.470> really<00:04:02.709> really

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
haze but I think this is really really

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.539 
haze but I think this is really really
classy<00:04:03.940> it's<00:04:04.930> good<00:04:05.079> to<00:04:05.230> ride<00:04:05.470> loads<00:04:06.069> of<00:04:06.310> talk
