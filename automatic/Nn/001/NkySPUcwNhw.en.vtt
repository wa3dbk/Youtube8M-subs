Hello YouTube.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.271
This is Praveen and I’m back with a video
showing you how to make Windows 10 Bootable

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:16.289
DVD from ISO Image file.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.179
This method involves no third party tools
to make Windows 10 Bootable DVD.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.679
But, to perform this task, you need to have
the following.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.320
The prerequisites that help to create Bootable
DVD of Windows 10 are

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.940
Windows 10 ISO Image of about 3.2GB, Media
creation Tool that is required to download

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.160
the ISO image from Microsoft, Empty DVD and
a DVD writer.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.609
If you don’t have writer, you can even use
USB flash drive to create bootable Windows

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.109
10 media.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:50.379
First things first, to get Windows10 ISO Image,
open Google and search for “Windows 10 Download”.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.379
Open the first website.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.980
You can find the direct link here in the show
notes below.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.929
Come all the way down and find the appropriate
version to get the media creation tool software.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.129
I’m here selecting 64bit version.

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.170
It’s about 18MB file.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.190
Download it.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.970
I have already downloaded the tool.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.500
To get the ISO Image of Windows 10, just open
this tool and then follow the onscreen instructions.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.430
Hope, you now have Windows 10 ISO file.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.160
Here is the final part.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.271
We’re using Windows explorer default media
burning feature to create Windows 10 Bootable

00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:23.640
DVD.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.680
To do this, move to the location where you
have ISO image saved then right click on the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.140
file.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.840
You need to have “Mount” and “Burn disc
image” options.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.890
If you are not seeing those, follow these
steps.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.520
Right click on the ISO file then select “Open
with” then “Choose default program..”.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.570
From the list, select, “Keep using Windows
Explorer”.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.020
After selecting it, you need to get the window
exactly as shown in this video showing all

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.130
the Windows 10 files.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.170
If you are performing an “Upgrade” where
no files, settings will be deleted, you can

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.950
click on “Set up” and then follow the
onscreen instructions.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.090
If you are willing to perform fresh or custom
install, you need to boot the DVD or USB flash

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.000
drive, which I have shown here in this tutorial.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.260
After selecting the default program, you will
get an extra “Removable Storage” device

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.170
with all the files as shown.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.769
Now open the location of Windows 10 ISO Image
file, right click on it then select “Burn

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.159
disc image”.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.060
You will get Windows Disc Image Burner with
simple interface.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.290
Select the drive, if you have more than one,
check the ISO file name, check “Verify disc

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.349
after burning” then finally click on “Burn”.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.709
Wait for few minutes until the drive ejects
the disc.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.560
Now you have successfully created Windows
10 Bootable DVD from ISO file.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.340
Select first booting device to DVD drive at
BIOS settings to perform the fresh Windows

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.849
10 install.

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:54.849
