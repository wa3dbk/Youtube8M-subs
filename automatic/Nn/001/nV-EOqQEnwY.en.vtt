 Putin called where to politicize the issue 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.310
 and Georgian goods promising that Russia 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.180
 will fulfill their obligations under 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.250
 their admission 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.770
 on the Russian counters at the very last 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.500
 moment of their excessive emotionality 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.930
 all things can spoil Mikhail Saakashvili 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.130
 thanks to which Georgian proper 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.270
 wine and lost 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.750
 Russian market and after October 1, 2013 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.730
 of the year 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.990
 Georgian companies got the opportunity 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.079
 renew their relationships and attempts 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.540
 return and return your products 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.540
 Russian consumers during the visit 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.159
 delegation rospotrebnadzor when as 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.440
 Once there was a process of familiarization with 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.890
 enterprises and 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.350
 sanitary norms president 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.940
 Georgia Saakashvili 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:37.940
 made a statement which is the first 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:40.500
 queue insulted the Georgian themselves 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.080
 businessmen probably from Georgian 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.910
 people because firstly so 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:51.260
 they say that nobody is visiting themselves 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:55.229
 did not lead how the president spoke and 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.960
 I think it was intended to 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.570
 just disrupt there is a process but in 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.340
 letter addressed to Gennady Onishchenko 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.520
 Georgian Wine Exporters Association 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.960
 called the statements of saakashvili 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.380
 political terrorism it was 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:15.330
 open letter where can be 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.330
 tough but in frank form 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.070
 all people whom 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.360
 concerned his statements also in his 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.340
 through voiced attitude 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.400
 the president is that this is political 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.540
 terror and terrorist it too i think 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.760
 very gentle people saying that 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.420
 themselves have experienced oppression just this 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.170
 scary machine that operated 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.060
 unhindered for nine years 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.950
 However, according to Moscow experts 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.020
 consumer market prospects 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.410
 Georgian wine in the Russian market is not 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.080
 so iridescent to and for 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.800
 them the market has opened and it will take a lot 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.040
 work and hold because our market 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.840
 often 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:14.410
 close in general is busy it is filled 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:17.630
 pretty quality wine and dancing and and 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.750
 spain italy so it is a little bit 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.130
 a different situation than that which was 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.650
 zero years so i think that im 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.830
 will have to re-conquer the market this is not 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.310
 it will be so easy, however, Georgia hopes 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.730
 convince Russians that Georgian wine 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.160
 worth thing sam years how people answered 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.870
 pizza Georgian wine and 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.420
 it is desirable that as soon as possible people 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.150
 again returned to this drink 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:56.049
 no political motivation there 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.940
 have Russian experts not noticed 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.030
 more 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:05.250
 some 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:11.690
 Kuku main games the more corrupt 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.690
 for thinking there also did not have and 100
