00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.500 

well<00:00:01.399> now<00:00:02.399> today<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.790> can<00:00:03.149> see<00:00:03.179> that<00:00:03.419> I've

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
well now today you can see that I've

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.039 
well now today you can see that I've
started<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.490> restore<00:00:05.490> this<00:00:05.640> TV<00:00:06.000> set<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.870> see

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
started to restore this TV set you see

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.330 
started to restore this TV set you see
I've<00:00:07.140> replaced<00:00:07.410> some<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.710> capacitors

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
I've replaced some of the capacitors

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.560 
I've replaced some of the capacitors
although<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.670> probably<00:00:08.910> should<00:00:09.179> put<00:00:09.300> some<00:00:09.420> heat

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
although I probably should put some heat

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.629 
although I probably should put some heat
shrink<00:00:09.840> tubing<00:00:09.870> over<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.469> one<00:00:10.769> here<00:00:11.010> this

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
shrink tubing over this one here this

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.870 
shrink tubing over this one here this
one<00:00:11.700> was<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> point<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.780> 2<00:00:16.130> micro<00:00:17.130> farad<00:00:17.279> i'm<00:00:17.490> not

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
one was a point to 2 micro farad i'm not

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.120 
one was a point to 2 micro farad i'm not
sure<00:00:18.270> i'm<00:00:18.390> sure<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> 400<00:00:19.859> volt

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
sure i'm sure this is a 400 volt

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.150 
sure i'm sure this is a 400 volt
capacitor<00:00:20.939> why<00:00:21.449> put<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.930> point<00:00:22.199> 25<00:00:22.800> because

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
capacitor why put in a point 25 because

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.550 
capacitor why put in a point 25 because
that's<00:00:23.310> all<00:00:23.430> i<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.699> my<00:00:23.970> stash<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:27.560> another

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
that's all i have my stash so another

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.849 
that's all i have my stash so another
point<00:00:29.010> 22<00:00:29.220> over<00:00:29.730> here<00:00:30.240> now<00:00:30.449> i<00:00:30.630> think<00:00:31.289> i<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.500> use

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
point 22 over here now i think i can use

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.920 
point 22 over here now i think i can use
the<00:00:32.070> point<00:00:32.309> two<00:00:32.489> fives<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.360> don't<00:00:33.630> see<00:00:33.870> you

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the point two fives I don't see you

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.670 
the point two fives I don't see you
that's<00:00:34.680> really<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.250> not<00:00:35.640> much<00:00:35.790> far<00:00:36.149> off<00:00:36.680> from

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
that's really that not much far off from

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.100 
that's really that not much far off from
the<00:00:37.920> point<00:00:38.100> 22<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.879> don't<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.280> I<00:00:42.110> think

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the point 22 I don't know that I think

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.680 
the point 22 I don't know that I think
these<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.290> usually<00:00:43.879> positive<00:00:44.879> negative<00:00:45.270> ten

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
these are usually positive negative ten

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.000 
these are usually positive negative ten
percent<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:47.719> but<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.809> doesn't<00:00:49.079> say<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.680> there

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
percent so but it doesn't say on there

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.750 
percent so but it doesn't say on there
usually<00:00:50.250> these<00:00:50.879> two<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.870> I'm<00:00:52.039> I've<00:00:53.039> placed<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
usually these two but I'm I've placed a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.160 
usually these two but I'm I've placed a
lot<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.180> these<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.510> usually<00:00:54.899> within<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
lot of these as usually within a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
lot of these as usually within a
negative<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.410> positive<00:00:58.440> ten<00:00:59.039> percent<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.940> I

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
negative or positive ten percent so I

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.819 
negative or positive ten percent so I
don't<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> make<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
don't think it's really going to make a

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.240 
don't think it's really going to make a
big<00:01:02.250> difference<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.739> if<00:01:04.739> somebody<00:01:05.159> out

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
big difference but if if somebody out

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.520 
big difference but if if somebody out
there<00:01:05.369> knows<00:01:05.450> that<00:01:06.450> that's<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:07.110> possibility

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
there knows that that's a possibility

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.820 
there knows that that's a possibility
then<00:01:07.890> let<00:01:08.610> me<00:01:08.729> know<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.000> we'll<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.900> order

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
then let me know and we'll have to order

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
then let me know and we'll have to order
their<00:01:11.490> correct<00:01:11.790> ones<00:01:12.090> um<00:01:12.450> yes<00:01:13.790> these<00:01:14.790> are

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
their correct ones um yes these are

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460 
their correct ones um yes these are
going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.210> easy<00:01:15.540> someone's<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.290> these

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
going to be easy someone's because these

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.170 
going to be easy someone's because these
all<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.740> their<00:01:17.100> values<00:01:17.520> stamped<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.090> them

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
all have their values stamped on them

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.590 
all have their values stamped on them
where<00:01:19.020> these<00:01:19.290> don't<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.240> got<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.390> figure

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
where these don't and you got to figure

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.280 
where these don't and you got to figure
out<00:01:21.720> how<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.990> read<00:01:22.170> these<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.619> resistor<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
out how to read these like resistor and

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.929 
out how to read these like resistor and
I<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> chart<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.430> how<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> read

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
I have to get the chart on how to read

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.520 
I have to get the chart on how to read
these<00:01:27.119> are<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.659> different<00:01:27.900> than<00:01:28.229> how<00:01:28.470> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
these are a little different than how to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.560 
these are a little different than how to
read<00:01:28.770> resistors<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> principles<00:01:30.240> pretty

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
read resistors but the principles pretty

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350 
read resistors but the principles pretty
much<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.930> same<00:01:31.140> i<00:01:31.380> guess<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> i'm<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> go

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
much the same i guess so i'm going to go

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
much the same i guess so i'm going to go
ahead<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.600> replace<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.409> next<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.189> got<00:01:35.460> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
ahead and replace that one next I got to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.429 
ahead and replace that one next I got to
figure<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.939> value<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.990> that

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
figure out the value of that one is that

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.980 
figure out the value of that one is that
one<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.299> are<00:01:42.390> some<00:01:42.479> other<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> black

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
one and there are some other the black

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.249 
one and there are some other the black
beauty<00:01:43.470> or<00:01:44.750> bumblebee<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:45.930> whatever<00:01:46.140> they

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
beauty or bumblebee or whatever they

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.889 
beauty or bumblebee or whatever they
call<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:49.520> capacitors<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:51.479> another<00:01:51.780> one

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
call them capacitors get another one

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.550 
call them capacitors get another one
down<00:01:52.049> here<00:01:52.680> he<00:01:53.009> needs<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.340> get<00:01:53.430> replaced<00:01:54.560> that

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
down here he needs to get replaced that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.149 
down here he needs to get replaced that
one<00:01:56.960> that's<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.110> point<00:01:58.350> 33<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.710> don't<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.040> any

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
one that's a point 33 I don't have any

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.850 
one that's a point 33 I don't have any
point<00:01:59.399> three<00:01:59.759> three<00:02:00.290> capacitors<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.439> my<00:02:01.590> stash

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
point three three capacitors in my stash

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.660 
point three three capacitors in my stash
so<00:02:06.409> maybe<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.560> don't<00:02:07.799> even<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.160> point<00:02:08.429> three

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so maybe I don't even have a point three

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.350 
so maybe I don't even have a point three
nine

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.770 

so<00:02:13.360> maybe<00:02:14.110> not<00:02:14.560> even<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:15.010> point<00:02:15.670> 0<00:02:15.850> for<00:02:16.270> maybe<00:02:16.690> a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
so maybe not even a point 0 for maybe a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.650 
so maybe not even a point 0 for maybe a
point<00:02:17.050> 0<00:02:17.140> for<00:02:17.410> 7<00:02:17.710> might<00:02:17.890> substitute<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:18.730> i'll

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
point 0 for 7 might substitute but i'll

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
wrong and then i just got to take this

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.760 
wrong and then i just got to take this
all<00:02:30.910> apart<00:02:31.060> again<00:02:31.330> just<00:02:31.780> don't<00:02:32.500> want<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.680> have

was<00:02:36.370> really<00:02:36.880> really<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.180> tough<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.630> make<00:02:38.310> but

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
was really really a tough to make but

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.130 
was really really a tough to make but
now<00:02:39.490> i<00:02:39.520> SAT<00:02:40.210> and<00:02:40.240> held<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.570> iron<00:02:40.780> on<00:02:40.840> her<00:02:40.990> for

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
now i SAT and held the iron on her for

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.730 
now i SAT and held the iron on her for
quite<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.320> while<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:42.480> got<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.540> good<00:02:43.720> hot<00:02:43.960> put<00:02:44.710> a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
quite a while and got a good hot put a

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.180 
quite a while and got a good hot put a
lot<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.220> solder<00:02:45.610> on<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:46.710> seems<00:02:47.710> to<00:02:47.830> be<00:02:47.920> on<00:02:48.040> there

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
lot of solder on it seems to be on there

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.500 
lot of solder on it seems to be on there
pretty<00:02:48.280> sturdy<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.850> should<00:02:49.090> probably<00:02:49.180> put<00:02:49.450> some

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
pretty sturdy I should probably put some

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.900 
pretty sturdy I should probably put some
paint<00:02:49.690> tubing<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.640> I'm<00:02:51.700> gonna<00:02:51.790> go

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
paint tubing on that so I'm gonna go

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.660 
paint tubing on that so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.180> just<00:02:52.420> keep<00:02:52.600> replacing<00:02:52.840> capacitors

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
ahead and just keep replacing capacitors

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.510 
ahead and just keep replacing capacitors
and<00:02:54.670> i'll<00:02:55.390> just<00:02:55.600> keep<00:02:55.780> uploading<00:02:56.020> videos<00:02:56.560> as<00:02:57.220> i

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
and i'll just keep uploading videos as i

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
other or the one on the top really looks

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.980 
other or the one on the top really looks

here<00:03:32.170> looks<00:03:32.350> really<00:03:32.590> clean<00:03:32.770> too<00:03:33.070> so<00:03:33.550> but<00:03:34.170> this

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
here looks really clean too so but this

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.840 
here looks really clean too so but this
looks<00:03:35.470> like<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:35.800> has<00:03:35.950> all<00:03:36.130> gotten<00:03:36.460> hot<00:03:36.640> and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
looks like this has all gotten hot and

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.650 
looks like this has all gotten hot and
that's<00:03:36.970> right<00:03:37.180> around<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.450> high<00:03:37.600> voltage

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
transformer here this is our looks like

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
transformer here this is our looks like
to<00:03:44.500> be<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.700> power<00:03:45.700> transformer<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:48.250> could

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
to be a power transformer this could

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.210 
to be a power transformer this could
even<00:03:48.580> be<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.790> filter<00:03:49.120> choke<00:03:49.390> I<00:03:49.950> bet<00:03:50.950> you<00:03:51.040> that's

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
even be a filter choke I bet you that's

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.520 
even be a filter choke I bet you that's
the<00:03:51.310> audio<00:03:51.520> transform<00:03:52.030> their<00:03:52.350> one<00:03:53.350> of<00:03:53.440> these

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
the audio transform their one of these

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.260 
the audio transform their one of these
could<00:03:53.680> be<00:03:53.800> a<00:03:53.830> choke<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.520> not<00:03:54.670> sure<00:03:54.850> which<00:03:55.030> one

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
could be a choke and not sure which one

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.240 
could be a choke and not sure which one
know<00:03:55.420> this<00:03:55.630> looks<00:03:55.840> too<00:03:56.290> big<00:03:56.320> or<00:03:56.890> this<00:03:56.950> one

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
know this looks too big or this one

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.470 
know this looks too big or this one
looks<00:03:57.400> too<00:03:57.520> small<00:03:57.550> to<00:03:57.790> be<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:57.910> power<00:03:58.090> transfer

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
looks too small to be a power transfer

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.020 
looks too small to be a power transfer
made<00:03:58.690> this<00:03:58.840> is<00:03:59.020> the<00:03:59.080> power<00:03:59.230> transformer<00:04:00.030> yeah

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
made this is the power transformer yeah

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.760 
made this is the power transformer yeah
cuz<00:04:01.209> looks<00:04:01.360> like<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.900> wires<00:04:02.080> are<00:04:02.260> going<00:04:02.650> off

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
cuz looks like the wires are going off

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.640 
cuz looks like the wires are going off
into<00:04:02.920> there<00:04:03.240> so<00:04:04.240> that<00:04:04.270> might<00:04:04.510> be<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.660> joke<00:04:05.440> of

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
into there so that might be a joke of

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.510 
into there so that might be a joke of
some<00:04:05.830> sort<00:04:06.130> but<00:04:06.910> I<00:04:07.180> could<00:04:07.480> be<00:04:07.510> wrong<00:04:08.310> big<00:04:09.310> power

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
some sort but I could be wrong big power

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.460 
some sort but I could be wrong big power
resistors<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.300> hate<00:04:10.510> these<00:04:10.660> sand<00:04:10.930> resistors<00:04:11.380> I

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
resistors I hate these sand resistors I

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.050 
resistors I hate these sand resistors I
hear<00:04:11.680> that<00:04:11.830> they're<00:04:11.980> just<00:04:12.010> notorious<00:04:12.820> for

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
hear that they're just notorious for

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.660 
hear that they're just notorious for
failure<00:04:13.420> so<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.230> need<00:04:14.650> us<00:04:14.770> you<00:04:14.920> can<00:04:15.070> go<00:04:15.250> on<00:04:15.340> ebay

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
failure so I need us you can go on ebay

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.969 
failure so I need us you can go on ebay
or<00:04:15.790> someplace<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.239> get<00:04:16.359> some<00:04:16.570> big-ass

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
or someplace and get some big-ass

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.560 
or someplace and get some big-ass
persisters<00:04:17.979> and<00:04:18.160> put<00:04:18.280> in<00:04:18.400> here

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
persisters and put in here

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.760 
persisters and put in here
there's<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.630> little<00:04:21.870> DP<00:04:22.110> capacitor<00:04:22.650> right

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
there's a little DP capacitor right

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.710 
there's a little DP capacitor right
there<00:04:23.010> that's<00:04:23.760> going<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.030> get<00:04:24.180> replaced<00:04:24.480> it's

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
there that's going to get replaced it's

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.720 
there that's going to get replaced it's
not<00:04:24.840> enough<00:04:25.050> lead<00:04:25.650> left<00:04:25.860> on<00:04:26.010> in<00:04:26.280> order<00:04:26.520> for<00:04:26.670> me

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
not enough lead left on in order for me

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.880 
not enough lead left on in order for me
to<00:04:26.760> solder<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:27.420> i'll<00:04:27.510> just<00:04:27.570> have<00:04:27.840> to

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
to solder it so i'll just have to

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.710 
to solder it so i'll just have to
replace<00:04:28.890> that<00:04:28.950> so<00:04:29.400> this<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.420> where<00:04:30.570> we're<00:04:30.690> at

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
replace that so this is where we're at

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.540 
replace that so this is where we're at
for<00:04:31.050> right<00:04:31.200> now<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:31.740> i'll<00:04:32.100> just<00:04:32.430> keep

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
for right now and i'll just keep

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.990 
for right now and i'll just keep
uploading<00:04:32.820> videos<00:04:33.330> as<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:34.650> progressed<00:04:35.580> through

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
uploading videos as I progressed through

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.970 
uploading videos as I progressed through
and<00:04:36.120> getting<00:04:36.270> this<00:04:36.420> TV<00:04:36.750> set<00:04:36.960> restored<00:04:37.380> thanks

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
and getting this TV set restored thanks

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.550 
and getting this TV set restored thanks
for<00:04:38.250> watching
