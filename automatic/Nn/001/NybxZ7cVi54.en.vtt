00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Well, he's the one who gave us everything. 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.400
 tu welcome this new 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.109
 video today teach you how to do 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.620
 a screenshot his software on 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.450
 windows 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.950
 first of all for my subscribers who 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.370
 would watch this video I'm sorry 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.350
 between the gap between each video at 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.029
 level of time but the problem is 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.260
 that I really have no trouble finding 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.609
 the time I will not lie to you but 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.570
 it's not necessarily coming back from high school 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.130
 their desire to make a video 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.689
 so here I am not a weekend and in 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.340
 over does a week on two at my 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.540
 mother was going to my father's house given 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.820
 that I have my father I do not necessarily have the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.860
 material to make videos but I 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.149
 do not do it and so here I was 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.640
 just to apologize for that I'm going 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.160
 try to be a little more regular but 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.510
 well here I am doing my not better but 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.820
 here I try in any case to do 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.430
 good at the raise to make a catch 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.440
 of screen easily so on windows and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.680
 especially without software you typed 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.300
 capture the menu bar start a low 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.850
 to the left 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.600
 then you're going screenshot 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.500
 me it's in english do not know why 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.290
 it's shipping 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 legault it's like that so you double 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.200
 click on it and here you can 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.530
 so either do a screenshot of the screen 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.970
 whole here so by clicking directly 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.189
 or if for example you can do 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.070
 free form so I think you 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.970
 can do stuff like that here's up 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.880
 and you have a there is worse like that no 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.510
 and also you can do I do not know 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.420
 if you actually see a catch 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.290
 rectangular so just you 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.750
 slide on the sides I hope you 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.280
 see in any case this window 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.670
 So here you see that everything is 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.990
 Quick enough to take in hand by 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.180
 example could do full screen too 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.170
 and that's it you take it then for 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.690
 the reject you do files 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:01.050
 saved under and you put by 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.619
 example on your desk and wait I 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.000
 I made a mistake 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.380
 so here we will do for example to a 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.560
 rectangular thing like that we will do 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.039
 file save under we will put it 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.039
 on the desk 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.780
 uh yes so that's actually I was already 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.459
 because I think it was my bottom 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.250
 well in fact and yeah you see 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.860
 that I have the window that I have 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.020
 recorded and so that was very 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.459
 very simple to be rather a little 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.500
 little more complicated you know if you 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.060
 want to know how to do things with 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.470
 wanted me to inquire for example 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.470
 bottom did not hurt in the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.849
 comments and well i will not quote 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.349
 simply watched not I tell you 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.560
 thank you for watching the video and hi 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.560
