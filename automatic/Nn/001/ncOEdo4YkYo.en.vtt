direct<00:01:50.700> energy<00:01:51.350> weaponry<00:01:52.350> class<00:01:52.829> now<00:01:53.189> we've

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
direct energy weaponry class now we've

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.590 
direct energy weaponry class now we've
talked<00:01:53.670> about<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.939> before<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.479> previous

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
talked about it before in previous

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.940 
talked about it before in previous
videos<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.259> those<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.500> guys<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.799> been

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
videos for those you guys have been

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.709 
videos for those you guys have been
keeping<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.430> all<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.820> my<00:01:56.969> advanced<00:01:57.299> warfare

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
keeping up all of my advanced warfare

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.899 
keeping up all of my advanced warfare
videos<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.439> we've<00:01:59.159> talked<00:01:59.460> about<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.880> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
videos and we've talked about in the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.160 
videos and we've talked about in the
past<00:02:00.090> Heather<00:02:00.360> may<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> laser

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
past Heather may be so like the laser

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.740 
past Heather may be so like the laser
weapons<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.939> basically<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
weapons and that is basically the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.289 
weapons and that is basically the
directed<00:02:04.259> energy<00:02:04.530> weapon<00:02:05.280> dream<00:02:05.460> we've<00:02:06.119> been

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
directed energy weapon dream we've been

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.419 
directed energy weapon dream we've been
hearing<00:02:06.659> about<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.049> 3d<00:02:07.439> printer<00:02:07.920> rifle<00:02:08.310> which

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
hearing about the 3d printer rifle which

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.430 
hearing about the 3d printer rifle which
prints<00:02:08.789> ammo<00:02:09.090> as<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.629> go<00:02:09.780> along<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.349> you

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
prints ammo as you go along and if you

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.600 
prints ammo as you go along and if you
go<00:02:10.560> back<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.800> watch<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.550> game<00:02:11.580> play<00:02:11.970> from<00:02:12.150> yes

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
go back and watch the game play from yes

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.160 
go back and watch the game play from yes
they<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:13.150> can<00:02:13.300> actually<00:02:13.420> see<00:02:13.600> one<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.110> those

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
they you can actually see one of those

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.200 
they you can actually see one of those
weapons<00:02:14.410> in<00:02:14.680> action<00:02:15.010> where<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.520> ammos<00:02:15.970> being

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
made for you as you move and we also saw

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.220 
made for you as you move and we also saw
like<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> direct<00:02:21.580> energy<00:02:21.850> laser<00:02:22.480> rifle<00:02:23.050> within

the gameplay yesterday as well which is
awesome<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.630> today<00:02:26.080> we<00:02:26.530> get<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.950> see<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.340> em1

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
awesome and today we get to see the em1

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.600 
awesome and today we get to see the em1
quantum<00:02:28.750> weapon<00:02:29.080> in<00:02:29.260> action<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:30.340> this<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.580> a

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
quantum weapon in action and this is a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.490 
quantum weapon in action and this is a
part<00:02:30.910> as<00:02:31.120> I've<00:02:31.240> said<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.690> direct<00:02:32.200> energy

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
part as I've said as a direct energy

part as I've said as a direct energy
weaponry<00:02:33.220> class<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.940> these<00:02:34.150> weapons<00:02:34.480> will<00:02:34.540> be

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
weaponry class and these weapons will be

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.000 
weaponry class and these weapons will be
available<00:02:34.900> across<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.530> board<00:02:35.740> in<00:02:35.860> both

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
available across the board in both

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.400 
available across the board in both
single-player<00:02:36.400> multiplayer<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.300> co-op

single-player multiplayer and co-op

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.540 
single-player multiplayer and co-op
we're<00:02:38.410> not<00:02:38.530> sure<00:02:38.680> what<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.980> co-op<00:02:39.190> mode<00:02:39.370> will

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
we're not sure what the co-op mode will

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.920 
we're not sure what the co-op mode will
be<00:02:39.670> yet<00:02:39.880> but<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.090> will<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.240> available<00:02:40.420> within

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
be yet but it will be available within

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.070 
be yet but it will be available within
that<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.800> em1<00:02:42.300> quantum<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.480> special

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
that and the em1 quantum is a special

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.010 
that and the em1 quantum is a special
weapon<00:02:44.560> indeed<00:02:45.130> because<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.360> don't<00:02:46.750> actually

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
weapon indeed because you don't actually

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.920 
weapon indeed because you don't actually
ever<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.370> reload<00:02:48.820> these<00:02:49.330> weapons<00:02:49.720> sound

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
ever have to reload these weapons sound

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.840 
ever have to reload these weapons sound
very<00:02:50.260> very<00:02:50.530> unique<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.010> very<00:02:51.100> interesting

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
very very unique and very interesting

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.699 
very very unique and very interesting
indeed<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.540> sounded<00:02:52.810> like<00:02:52.989> they've<00:02:53.350> got<00:02:53.530> great

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
indeed it sounded like they've got great

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.280 
indeed it sounded like they've got great
perks<00:02:54.130> but<00:02:54.310> also<00:02:54.520> big<00:02:54.970> downsides<00:02:55.570> as<00:02:55.810> well<00:02:56.050> so

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
perks but also big downsides as well so

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.440 
perks but also big downsides as well so
typically<00:02:57.100> within<00:02:57.370> games<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.940> often<00:02:58.300> get

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
typically within games you often get

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.540 
typically within games you often get
something<00:02:58.780> like<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.930> minigun<00:02:59.470> which<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.430> can

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
something like a minigun which you can

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.340 
something like a minigun which you can
actually<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:00.850> unload<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> ton<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:01.959> ammo

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
actually just unload a ton of ammo

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.199 
actually just unload a ton of ammo
however<00:03:02.800> it<00:03:03.070> can<00:03:03.250> sometimes<00:03:03.459> overheat<00:03:04.090> and

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
however it can sometimes overheat and

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.220 
however it can sometimes overheat and
when<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.420> overheats<00:03:04.780> you've<00:03:04.930> gotta<00:03:05.050> wait<00:03:05.200> a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
when it overheats you've gotta wait a

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.170 
when it overheats you've gotta wait a
ton<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.620> time<00:03:05.920> before<00:03:06.130> it<00:03:06.370> decreases<00:03:06.850> in<00:03:07.000> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
ton of time before it decreases in and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.970 
ton of time before it decreases in and
decreases<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.200> then<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.470> can<00:03:08.620> start<00:03:08.800> using

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
decreases and then you can start using

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.320 
decreases and then you can start using
it<00:03:09.220> again<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.489> that's<00:03:09.640> similar<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.060> how<00:03:10.300> the

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
it again and that's similar to how the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.260 
it again and that's similar to how the
em1<00:03:10.930> quantum<00:03:11.920> weapon<00:03:12.400> weapon<00:03:12.940> is<00:03:13.030> going<00:03:13.209> to

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
em1 quantum weapon weapon is going to

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.320 
em1 quantum weapon weapon is going to
use<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:13.780> it's<00:03:14.110> battery-powered<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.910> never

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
use so it's battery-powered you never

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.810 
use so it's battery-powered you never
have<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.930> reload<00:03:17.410> but<00:03:17.890> if<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.190> constantly

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
have to reload but if you constantly

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.660 
have to reload but if you constantly
shoot<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.450> shoot<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.290> regularly<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.310> weapon

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
shoot and shoot to regularly the weapon

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.130 
shoot and shoot to regularly the weapon
will<00:03:21.820> overheat<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.510> then<00:03:22.660> you've<00:03:22.780> gotta<00:03:22.930> wait

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
will overheat and then you've gotta wait

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.560 
will overheat and then you've gotta wait
a<00:03:23.440> ton<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:24.040> time<00:03:24.280> for<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.700> cool<00:03:24.970> down<00:03:25.030> before

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
a ton of time for it to cool down before

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.990 
a ton of time for it to cool down before
it<00:03:25.810> can<00:03:25.959> be<00:03:26.049> used<00:03:26.350> again<00:03:26.769> we<00:03:27.489> see<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.640> little<00:03:27.880> bit

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000

jewel rotor in the air being destroyed

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.780 
jewel rotor in the air being destroyed
and<00:03:40.570> a<00:03:40.900> very<00:03:41.080> unique<00:03:41.470> site<00:03:42.010> for<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.400> weapon

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
and a very unique site for this weapon

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.630 
and a very unique site for this weapon
as<00:03:42.880> well<00:03:43.090> as<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.780> was<00:03:43.900> being<00:03:44.080> used<00:03:44.170> in<00:03:44.830> action

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
as well as it was being used in action

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.030 
as well as it was being used in action
and<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.060> looks<00:03:46.209> very<00:03:46.450> cool<00:03:46.690> indeed<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.320> this<00:03:47.890> is

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
and it looks very cool indeed so this is

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.310 
and it looks very cool indeed so this is
going<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.280> be<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.400> big<00:03:48.850> balancing<00:03:49.420> act<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.870> it

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
going to be a big balancing act and it

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.620 
going to be a big balancing act and it
could<00:03:50.709> be<00:03:50.739> interesting<00:03:51.100> because<00:03:51.730> if<00:03:52.060> you

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
could be interesting because if you

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.870 
could be interesting because if you
never<00:03:52.870> have<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.320> reload<00:03:53.709> you<00:03:54.340> could<00:03:54.519> be<00:03:54.610> very

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
never have to reload you could be very

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.910 
never have to reload you could be very
very<00:03:55.120> careful<00:03:55.420> as<00:03:55.750> if<00:03:55.930> you're<00:03:56.080> going<00:03:56.410> in<00:03:56.650> and

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
very careful as if you're going in and

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.320 
very careful as if you're going in and
out<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.070> action<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:57.730> not<00:03:57.880> in<00:03:57.970> action

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
out of action and not in action

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.630 
out of action and not in action
constantly<00:03:59.019> you<00:03:59.739> don't<00:03:59.950> ever<00:04:00.130> have<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.610> worry

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
constantly you don't ever have to worry

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.820 
constantly you don't ever have to worry
about<00:04:00.970> reloading<00:04:01.510> with<00:04:01.750> this<00:04:01.870> weapon<00:04:02.049> but<00:04:02.530> and

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
about reloading with this weapon but and

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.680 
about reloading with this weapon but and
you<00:04:03.700> won't<00:04:03.880> be<00:04:03.940> able<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.120> take<00:04:04.239> on<00:04:04.390> too<00:04:04.570> many

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
you won't be able to take on too many

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.570 
you won't be able to take on too many
people<00:04:05.049> because<00:04:05.500> you're<00:04:05.769> going<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.040> be<00:04:06.130> forced

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
people because you're going to be forced

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.340 
people because you're going to be forced
to<00:04:06.910> stop<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.450> weapon<00:04:07.750> from<00:04:07.870> shooting

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
to stop the weapon from shooting

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.930 
to stop the weapon from shooting
otherwise<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:08.980> will<00:04:09.100> overheat<00:04:09.549> and<00:04:09.730> if<00:04:09.820> it

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
otherwise it will overheat and if it

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.550 
otherwise it will overheat and if it
does<00:04:10.180> overheat<00:04:10.630> you're<00:04:11.049> going<00:04:11.260> to<00:04:11.320> be<00:04:11.410> waiting

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
does overheat you're going to be waiting

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.250 
does overheat you're going to be waiting
a<00:04:11.950> lot<00:04:12.400> more<00:04:12.730> time<00:04:13.030> than<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.420> single<00:04:13.690> reload

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
a lot more time than a single reload

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.500 
a lot more time than a single reload
would<00:04:14.470> take<00:04:14.680> for<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.430> weapon<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:16.000> cool<00:04:16.299> down

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
would take for the weapon to cool down

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.310 
would take for the weapon to cool down
so<00:04:17.500> that<00:04:17.530> it's<00:04:17.799> in<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.190> usable<00:04:18.549> state<00:04:19.329> and<00:04:19.630> so

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
so that it's in a usable state and so

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.320 
so that it's in a usable state and so
this<00:04:20.470> is<00:04:20.620> all<00:04:20.770> the<00:04:20.859> information<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.549> we<00:04:22.210> have
