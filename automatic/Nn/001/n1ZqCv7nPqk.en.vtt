00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.010 
you can then go on to the next memory
card<00:01:45.310> when<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:45.970> one<00:01:46.180> is<00:01:46.299> full<00:01:46.509> is<00:01:46.689> simply

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
card when that one is full is simply

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.200 
card when that one is full is simply
reinserted<00:01:47.770> into<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:48.009> pocket<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.729> cover<00:01:49.030> it
