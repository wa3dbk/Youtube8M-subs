00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
you can make a bat smarter just all you

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.019 
you can make a bat smarter just all you
have<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:20.939> seems<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.369> too<00:00:23.369> high

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
have to do seems like too high

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.000 
have to do seems like too high
oh<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.480> seems<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.080> work<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.740> if<00:00:25.769> they're

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
oh it seems to work see if they're

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.240 
oh it seems to work see if they're
hanging<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.080> can<00:00:28.230> make<00:00:28.410> them<00:00:28.590> invisible

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.610 

yes<00:00:32.250> that's<00:00:32.640> awesome

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
diamond block are goofing around with

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.430 
diamond block are goofing around with
Tia<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:45.270> weed<00:00:45.539> sorry<00:00:45.930> about<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.379> the

background<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.219> goofing<00:00:47.370> around<00:00:47.550> with

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
background but I was goofing around with

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.510 
background but I was goofing around with
the<00:00:47.940> beacons<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.600> heads<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.200> stuff<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.649> we

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the beacons and heads and stuff so we

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.520 
the beacons and heads and stuff so we
get<00:00:50.700> rid<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> lag<00:00:52.760> but<00:00:53.760> yeah<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.539> seems<00:00:55.350> like

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
get rid of lag but yeah so seems like

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.869 
get rid of lag but yeah so seems like
really<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.340> do<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.730> just

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
really all you have to do is just

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.229 
really all you have to do is just
because<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> did<00:00:57.809> was<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.910> had

this<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:01.260> how<00:01:01.710> low<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:03.229> some<00:01:04.229> bats<00:01:04.979> spawned

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
this like how low and some bats spawned

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.300 
this like how low and some bats spawned
in<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.970> they<00:01:06.119> go<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:08.210> yeah<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.140> sure<00:01:11.010> if

I'm<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.850> tutorial<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.659> pretty<00:01:13.020> sure

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
I'm going to do tutorial I'm pretty sure

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.600 
I'm going to do tutorial I'm pretty sure
it's<00:01:13.380> pretty<00:01:13.590> basic<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:14.100> look<00:01:14.250> at<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> hood

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
it's pretty basic see look at the hood

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.440 
it's pretty basic see look at the hood
like<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.740> did<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:17.040> spawn<00:01:17.340> these<00:01:17.460> batson<00:01:18.000> so

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
like and I did not spawn these batson so

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.120 
like and I did not spawn these batson so
yeah<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.720> I'll<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.170> make<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.409> I'll<00:01:22.920> just

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
yeah here I'll just make one I'll just

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.469 
yeah here I'll just make one I'll just
make<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> small<00:01:23.670> room<00:01:23.939> real<00:01:24.119> quick<00:01:26.240> pretty<00:01:27.240> sure

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
make a small room real quick pretty sure

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.830 
make a small room real quick pretty sure
you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.810> make<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:29.060> big<00:01:30.060> as<00:01:31.549> you<00:01:32.549> want<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.479> I'm

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you can make as big as you want it I'm

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:45.080 
you can make as big as you want it I'm
guessing<00:01:35.450> but<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.369> yes<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.670> will<00:01:44.700> make<00:01:44.939> one

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
guessing but so yes you will make one

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:54.620 
guessing but so yes you will make one
and<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.360> how<00:01:45.390> fast<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.899> bad<00:01:46.079> spawns

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.190 

this<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.780> just<00:01:56.020> my<00:01:56.170> test<00:01:56.409> world<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:57.280> have

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
this is just my test world that I have

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.249 
this is just my test world that I have
testing<00:02:00.030> our<00:02:01.030> tests<00:02:01.299> like<00:02:01.479> winter<00:02:01.780> red<00:02:01.960> stones

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
testing our tests like winter red stones

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.139 
testing our tests like winter red stones
I<00:02:02.590> was<00:02:02.770> goofing<00:02:02.979> around<00:02:03.220> with<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.729> cobble

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
I was goofing around with the cobble

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:19.530 
I was goofing around with the cobble
generator<00:02:04.180> one<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:16.709> I'm<00:02:17.709> not<00:02:18.220> sure<00:02:18.459> like<00:02:18.730> I'm

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
generator one that I'm not sure like I'm

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.150 
generator one that I'm not sure like I'm
just<00:02:19.780> doing<00:02:20.050> too<00:02:20.260> high<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.890> because

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
just doing too high just just because

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.070 
just doing too high just just because
it's<00:02:24.550> easy<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.940> walk<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.330> her<00:02:25.480> but<00:02:25.690> I'm<00:02:25.870> pretty

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
it's easy to walk on her but I'm pretty

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.900 
it's easy to walk on her but I'm pretty
sure<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.410> could<00:02:26.530> probably<00:02:26.830> end<00:02:27.190> somehow<00:02:27.580> make

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
sure you could probably end somehow make

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:36.479 
sure you could probably end somehow make
it<00:02:27.940> one<00:02:28.269> high<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:30.060> who<00:02:31.060> know<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:36.280> let's

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
it one high but who know here let's

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.150 
it one high but who know here let's
light<00:02:36.730> up<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:37.120> area<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.250> was<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.810> see

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
light up this area so I was like I see

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.050 
light up this area so I was like I see
yeah<00:02:42.660> some<00:02:43.660> either<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.980> think<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.400> just<00:02:45.549> hit<00:02:45.670> one

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:57.650 

but<00:02:49.060> yeah<00:02:49.269> so<00:02:52.709> okay<00:02:53.709> let's<00:02:54.370> make<00:02:54.549> a<00:02:54.610> roof<00:02:56.519> and

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
but yeah so okay let's make a roof and

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.039 
but yeah so okay let's make a roof and
let's<00:02:58.660> see<00:02:59.049> how<00:02:59.410> long<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.739> takes<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:01.750> some

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
let's see how long it takes for some

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.140 
let's see how long it takes for some
vets<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.739> spawn<00:03:05.280> make<00:03:06.280> sure<00:03:06.489> leave<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.760> place

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
vets to spawn make sure leave a place

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.849 
vets to spawn make sure leave a place
for<00:03:07.329> me<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.540> get<00:03:07.780> out<00:03:07.870> there<00:03:08.079> we<00:03:08.140> go<00:03:09.510> alright

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
for me to get out there we go alright

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:17.360 
for me to get out there we go alright
it's<00:03:11.970> 5:00<00:03:12.970> here<00:03:13.329> ah<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:14.290> was<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.500> fail<00:03:14.799> idea

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.949
