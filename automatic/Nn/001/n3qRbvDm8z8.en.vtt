 chain3 the television more environment 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.760
 good night to all the people who 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.230
 allows us back of his bedroom and up 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.450
 Your bed 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.730
 If so, because right now they are lying down 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.420
 and saying that they are going to prepare these 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 beautiful women today my mom 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.630
 and me 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.690
 talk about that because I do not care part 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.190
 of those clear then do not go over here 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.190
 because they are hurting my place 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.460
 we are well very ready to put a lot 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.840
 attention the program is very easy 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.520
 let's prepare the selection know if 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.290
 you're so you can not lose and 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.880
 well I'll start by doing you're in 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.070
 pareditas good the doll of the cake 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.620
 of Apple 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.780
 we go sometimes we have many left 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.149
 bits of what is the paste of the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.199
 buttonhole salt very well then it is already a 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.199
 lack of seconds 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.860
 because remember that these are the 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.229
 layers where they will infect are worth everything 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.880
 which is butter and flours very 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.170
 remember that the puff pastry is 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.540
 one of the big mistakes of the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.030
 bakery and the bakery remember that 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.420
 you who suddenly forgot 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.710
 put butter in the dough 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.600
 then with realizes 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.070
 but butter itself and survive 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.930
 things but he was much more 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.850
 smart enough about ohio for all 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.409
 life and where he began to interpret 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.350
 to intercalate little by little the was 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.350
 Aventando was happening to him and when it came out 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:47.340
 this mass was discovered there are a thousand sheets left 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:50.110
 well here I do the same on the flour 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.210
 to put the butter mom okey 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.710
 would be enough to skip what I'm going to 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.119
 make the filling that is very easy 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.229
 we can only do with any fruit 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.229
 not just with pear 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.170
 if you have guava if you have the banana 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.520
 because he's not quite right right I 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.900
 love the smell of butter 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.900
 I love we are going to put our 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.240
 exactly 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.450
 that is, it gives a taste like 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.230
 hazelnuts these are we going to grope 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.230
 little 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.340
 to skip associate are jumping my 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.920
 fairs are and we cut in circles 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.739
 the piece is more or less between bruno has 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.610
 stayed small and my mom is already 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.209
 cutting your circles 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.209
 third 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.319
 because surely many housewives 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.799
 I 'm going to put pear nectar on 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.799
 verdure honey 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.950
 and I'm going to put in this moment pod of 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.100
 vanilla and vanilla bean seems 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.740
 that one is saying no to as a 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.020
 vanilla man exactly pear and 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.250
 pods is the city that perfumes the world 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.660
 mole will not bother you that much not 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.390
 to know how you did it 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.540
 so many people throw it then if 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.490
 you make the three folds come back 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.130
 until it fits perfectly 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.830
 well and well you could pepillo if they have 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.120
 out there the camera see how I'm taking out 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:54.450
 all these little perfumes that make 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:00.740
 of vanilla what is there go all 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.740
 my friends and my mom is doing 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.350
 trying to buy 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.810
 absolutely nothing happens 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.470
 I use the pear barlett because it is the most 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.960
 hard is the most the firmest but also 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.940
 we have others such as the dairy stele 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.410
 when there is not the wide one that is also 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.570
 very good but I always prefer the 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.730
 bar of the mature bar and by 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:37.210
 supposed to be firm and practical and dover 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:38.980
 of the participle are not exactly the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.419
 boat that good very good question if not 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.610
 I have the scabbard coming because suddenly 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.350
 It may be a little expensive I want 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.950
 say they can use the one they have in 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.940
 house a trickle nothing more 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.340
 I'm going to put species going to put 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.080
 cardamom I also have a partner and how much 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.729
 I am clear that I want I have clear 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.050
 they were claiming a little bit because of 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.120
 suddenly it is very strong for many cinnamon 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.240
 for many people cinnamon we do not like 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.860
 a lot and ginger is a little bit ok I'm going to 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.229
 mix everything and here there is not something a 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.320
 until the liquid evaporates 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:10.320
 it is very important to have a mixture like 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.510
 the one that we have here and that is not using 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.450
 and it's starting to hit that we're on 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.460
 our resistol we use 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:23.000
 which is lightly beaten 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.960
 and will fill in a portion that is 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.550
 know that we are eating for flavor 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.509
 waiting pie because nothing more than 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:35.289
 suddenly they put to giunta what is not 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.289
 nothing bullied 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.979
 teacher man and actor because I'm 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.810
 trying to amend my life I think it's 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.880
 too late but I'm going to want to 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.510
 that does not tell you anything I want them 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.150
 say that 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.860
 I empanadas and refrigerated 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.140
 each pie was made a small 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.960
 cut that cut allows the 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.940
 steam and me to not go wetting others 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.700
 then very important court spaces 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:13.890
 cuts let them reflect for 20 minutes 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:15.900
 of production and then they have seen 6 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.300

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.250
 more I invite you to subscribe to the channel 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.440
