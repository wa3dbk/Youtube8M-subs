00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
too old to be reused and needed to be

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.279 
too old to be reused and needed to be
rebuilt<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:51.180> scratch<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.930> basically

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
rebuilt from scratch and basically

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.840

mastered<00:01:04.710> Sakurai<00:01:05.220> saying<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.700> few<00:01:05.729> weeks<00:01:06.060> ago

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
mastered Sakurai saying a few weeks ago

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.359 
mastered Sakurai saying a few weeks ago
that<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> reason<00:01:06.900> was<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:08.010> 3ds

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that the reason was because the 3ds

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.940 
that the reason was because the 3ds
could<00:01:08.670> not<00:01:08.790> handle<00:01:09.119> two<00:01:10.080> characters<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:10.770> now

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
could not handle two characters but now

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
could not handle two characters but now
he's<00:01:11.220> contradicting<00:01:11.580> when<00:01:12.150> he<00:01:12.240> simply<00:01:12.659> he's

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
he's contradicting when he simply he's

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.140 
he's contradicting when he simply he's
saying<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.740> will<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.729> good

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
saying so will this is really a good

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.090 
saying so will this is really a good
reason<00:01:15.540> why<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.720> RSA<00:01:16.140> cook<00:01:16.380> could<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.770> coming

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
reason why the RSA cook could be coming

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.370 
reason why the RSA cook could be coming
but<00:01:17.189> don't<00:01:17.460> worry<00:01:17.640> guys<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.570> didn't<00:01:19.290> make

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
but don't worry guys I just didn't make

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
but don't worry guys I just didn't make
the<00:01:19.439> video<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.009> simple<00:01:20.400> reason<00:01:20.880> what<00:01:21.210> we

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the video for that simple reason what we

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
the video for that simple reason what we
have<00:01:21.570> here<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.350> an<00:01:22.680> extreme<00:01:23.280> proof

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
have here is here is an extreme proof

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.600 
have here is here is an extreme proof
that<00:01:24.450> dlc<00:01:24.869> could<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.530> coming<00:01:25.890> basically<00:01:26.490> if

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that dlc could be coming basically if

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.580

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
i'm assuming female is Popo so if they

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.210 
i'm assuming female is Popo so if they
were<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.869> game<00:02:07.049> why<00:02:07.530> would<00:02:07.710> they<00:02:07.829> sound

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
were in the game why would they sound

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.650 
were in the game why would they sound
while<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.729> sound<00:02:09.060> could<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.360> there

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
while that sound could be there

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.390 
while that sound could be there
obviously<00:02:10.289> there's<00:02:10.500> always<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> chance<00:02:11.099> that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
obviously there's always a chance that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.490 
obviously there's always a chance that
develop<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.120> they<00:02:12.360> my<00:02:12.750> dad<00:02:12.930> basically<00:02:13.319> is

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
develop that they my dad basically is

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.940 
develop that they my dad basically is
always

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
always

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.559 
always
chance<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.640> could<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.879> be<00:02:14.970> correct<00:02:15.390> you

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
chance that it could just be correct you

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.930 
chance that it could just be correct you
I'm<00:02:16.050> saying<00:02:16.349> but<00:02:16.950> at<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.099> same<00:02:17.310> time<00:02:17.489> monster

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
I'm saying but at the same time monster

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.809 
I'm saying but at the same time monster
could<00:02:18.120> signify<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:20.069> this<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> ice

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
could signify that that this is the ice

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.390 
could signify that that this is the ice
