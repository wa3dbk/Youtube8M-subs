00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.670
 Do the people that I need well 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.919
 come to another video and in that chaos 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.880
 absolute being the last of the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.559
 season 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 you can see that the players are falling 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.299
 of price absurdly but now until I 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.490
 I'm showing our team from the way. 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.619
 of fortune fame glory and everything else 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.170
 You can see that I sold all the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.269
 players managed to total 179 000 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.960
 dogs and players were sold some 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.029
 days before the released date are of the team 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.640
 in the season then make a profit 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.829
 until some reasonable profit on them 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.620
 if I 'm not mistaken we'll start this new 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.530
 this new sequence of the series with 136 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.370
 millions and now we have gone to 179 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.770
 millions 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.079
 only that any objective of this video I 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.489
 I want to show you how you 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.000
 they can profit in the midst of this crisis 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.370
 absurd 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.610
 so that I'm not even going to start showing 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.129
 now on the screen i was able to buy several 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.800
 consumable items and some good 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.960
 very cheap players so you can see 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.760
 I bought information via 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.680
 the best and training rules are 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.520
 all those who start with four 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.390
 quarterbacks with the exception of room 312 4 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.159
 312 is not a highly sought-after formation 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.290
 only formation with three defenders that the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.939
 good is the 3 5 2 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.920
 So you can see that I bought between 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.409
 200 and 500 million 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.530
 lots of cool information items 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.200
 I also bought some 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.200
 that are not uncommon in the series to which 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.850
 the gamberini and the campanharo I got 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.570
 buy them the average of up to us 500 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.009
 millions 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.270
 and I also managed to buy several 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.060
 cones for about 600 650 coins 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.700
 so it 's just a very good method to do 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.680
 three because you can see that I spent one 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.899
 little more than 15 thousand with it 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.630
 buying players and it's a very 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.509
 safe because these cisco gamberini 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.880
 in these campaigns if for some reason the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.340
 world can not sell them the price 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.409
 of selling now is basically what I 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.659
 I bought it, I did not even connect. 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.489
 I 'll show you now I bought it for 700 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.430
 millions do not know I'm not wrong with 23 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.930
 contracts in training 4 12 12 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.440
 is a player that surely people 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.000
 can 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.790
 keep in the club if we are 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.670
 ride one and have a new team in training 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.160
 4 12 12 that's what I want people to do 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.400
 will have an excellent player to buy 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.510
 But whatever shape I'm going to show 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.770
 now in a second now 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.120
 you can see that we made a profit from 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.940
 how many know about 10,000 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.860
 coins so far I have not even sold 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.170
 all players have some players 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.820
 that are to sell but enjoy the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.070
 profit was very interesting every 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.650
 information items sold for more than 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.200
 a thousand coins the colonels on average sold 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.430
 a thousand dogs and the Ghanaian campanhar 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.760
 sold more or less depending on the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.590
 level in their training 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.390
 to find players that the board 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.380
 best time to buy these players 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.060
 for exchange purposes is on Wednesday in the 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.030
 Wednesdays on the days they are being 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.310
 released the times of the week in exact 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.500
 moment like this one does not release the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.630
 six o'clock in the afternoon in England 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.840
 means that your two hours of 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.959
 Late afternoon of brasilia in brazil is from 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.760
 A time in Brazil is in Guatemala. 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.700
 then two o'clock in the 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.680
 Brasilia is the hour that the pecs release. 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.660
 That we have these hours do not want 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.580
 say that people have been looking for 100's of 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.739
 Several countries absurdly 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.350
 Try to catch these players reports 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.230
 then in that zone at that exact time that I 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.300
 I found these players or yesterday in 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.190
 Wednesday was what I found now 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.380
 I also noticed that the number of pecs 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.850
 open the market a little 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.800
 is falling so much because people 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.900
 realized that this first team of the 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.190
 season is not coming too expensive 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.840
 so I think people are 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.390
 holding a little pecs for the 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.060
 next season teams 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.730
 For those who still have some doubt of how 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.610
 I try to find these items . 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.280
 information, I basically go there 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.650
 search for training scheme puts the price 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.890
 maximum who does not know and tries to buy 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.169
 if it reaches 300 400 dogs as in 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.900
 peak time is everyone opening pec 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.870
 I buy if it is not the peak hour until 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.550
 about a 500 with his try 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.210
 buy something I will not even try 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.930
 purchase 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.789
 and if you have information here at na 451 is a 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.819
 more or less training is not as 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.539
 then searched for the 450 things to 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.740
 purchase 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.310
 Let's see if we can buy 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.470
 350 that will already be exceptional 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.560
 Ready, it's over there, you can see it live. 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.990
 now that I 'm recording while I 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.210
 I'm showing this I 'm recording is 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.949
 with the audio I was taking advantage of 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.539
 show clicks are recorded 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.270
 So I just bought this train on 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.910
 training 4 5 1 and I'm already going here 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.979
 immediately enter my list of 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.560
 observation until it was good that he gave to 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.060
 take an example live until the 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.860
 players that I was watching have ended 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.919
 getting a little bit so I did not buy 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.930
 then here is Scheme 4 5 1 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.940
 will push to advance if by chance 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.750
 he decided to move forward 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.389
 come on, let's be there, I always 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.370
 I read this they more or less for a thousand dogs 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.380
 and the first one that I do not even like his 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.389
 first bid I'll try 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.150
 I put it 1,500 I always advise 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.979
 leave an hour because what happens is 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.500
 You can only play the last ones. 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.479
 seconds are information items as 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.630
 people look at those who are missing a 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.789
 minute then based on that you have is 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.560
 how many more times do you try 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.259
 putting back more players 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.330
 chances you have me on my web then 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.860
 apps or by my cell phone I stayed 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.710
 put these players practically 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.180
 today 9 th Thursday all day 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.740
 each time you spent an hour would take a 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.380
 look to put to sell again 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.440
 and as I showed several sold they missed 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.919
 very few miss seeing one two three 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.080
 four five six seven eight nine ten 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.570
 missing ten items to sell that 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.580
 I'll probably surrender to around 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.009
 of 10 thousand dogs then it almost reaches the 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.780
 200 million mark is a good profit. 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.900
 interesting considering that we 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.610
 1,179,000 begin with run is already 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.870
 making a mathematical account that well 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:28.139
 fast 179 to 853 so far we 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:31.229
 We win 9100 coins and have even chances of 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.300
 approximately 20,000 dogs then 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.310
 I hope these tips have been helpful 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.919
 I won the next pec that they are 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.050
 I open a team and show them to 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.100
 you how I set this team's being 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.550
 few coins 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.920
 and in a very safe way and we will 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.930
 whether speaking here or responding to a 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.120
 very important question that they asked me 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.520
 It's when it's time to buy your team. 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.320
 I already said that in the alert video. 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.900
 but I'll repeat, I think it's good you 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.850
 create an excel spreadsheet or 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.070
 football sad the futile that 's what 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.020
 If you prefer and I want to talk 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.180
 set up the team with the players 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.160
 look at the price they are now and stay 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.770
 what would be an affordable price if 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.500
 for example we took suppose the 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.230
 I can handle 60 million for example 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.820
 when it reaches the band of 1 50 45 thousand 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.770
 copies maybe it's time to buy 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.090
 probably will not download much more 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.280
 than that because he is a good player 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.980
 and so far no report has left 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.890
 and probably will not even leave because 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.750
 who accompanies calling from barclays knows 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.040
 that he did not play very well this 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.170
 season 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.210
 it's basically this I hope you 

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.010
 I 've been tanned so far. 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:41.010
 shame of my reaction to the wind 

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.450
 donovan because if the owner was not like this 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.000
 Imagine if we throw a Christian 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.470
 ronaldo or messi 99 I think I will not 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.960
 nor can such a shame that I will 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.700
 to pass is basically so a tip 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.350
 very quick exchange for you too 

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.320
 do not stay on the ultimate fifa 11 

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.270
 Did you find this tip useful? 

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.990
