I'm<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> start<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> series<00:01:37.320> I'll

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
I'm going to start with the series I'll

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.580 
I'm going to start with the series I'll
run<00:01:38.159> through<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.520> these<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.229> then<00:01:40.229> I'll<00:01:40.409> move

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
run through all these and then I'll move

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.530 
run through all these and then I'll move

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
to split move through all these and then

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.690 
to split move through all these and then
I'll<00:01:42.750> end<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.350> two<00:01:43.560> parallel<00:01:44.070> move<00:01:44.490> through

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I'll end in two parallel move through

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
I'll move to parallel which I'm very

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:49.830 
I'll move to parallel which I'm very
much<00:04:09.769> digging<00:04:10.159> these<00:04:10.400> days

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840

is all the tonal possibilities of this
guitar<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:11.440> yeah<00:05:12.440> I'm<00:05:12.740> really<00:05:12.919> digging<00:05:13.280> it

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
guitar and yeah I'm really digging it

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.539 
guitar and yeah I'm really digging it
and<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.639> hope<00:05:13.819> you<00:05:14.060> enjoyed<00:05:14.360> it
