hey<00:00:04.750> everyone<00:00:05.260> just<00:00:05.800> biasing<00:00:06.700> a<00:00:06.850> Rangemaster

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
hey everyone just biasing a Rangemaster

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.930 
hey everyone just biasing a Rangemaster
I<00:00:07.990> thought<00:00:08.200> this<00:00:08.560> might<00:00:08.800> be<00:00:08.860> interesting<00:00:09.820> if

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
I thought this might be interesting if

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.330 
I thought this might be interesting if
you're<00:00:10.180> doing<00:00:10.870> the<00:00:11.080> same<00:00:11.260> thing<00:00:11.620> basically

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
you're doing the same thing basically

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.830 
you're doing the same thing basically
you've<00:00:12.730> got<00:00:12.820> the<00:00:12.910> two<00:00:13.090> resistors<00:00:13.540> that<00:00:13.600> go

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
you've got the two resistors that go

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.400 
you've got the two resistors that go
into<00:00:14.110> the<00:00:14.260> into<00:00:15.160> the<00:00:15.310> base<00:00:16.240> of<00:00:16.539> the<00:00:16.660> transistor

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
into the into the base of the transistor

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.120 
into the into the base of the transistor
and<00:00:18.070> they<00:00:18.340> bias<00:00:18.670> the<00:00:19.000> transistor<00:00:19.150> and<00:00:20.130> you

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
and they bias the transistor and you

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.859 
and they bias the transistor and you
need<00:00:21.279> to<00:00:21.369> bias<00:00:21.609> it<00:00:21.820> properly<00:00:22.210> for<00:00:22.390> it<00:00:22.509> to<00:00:22.660> sound

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
need to bias it properly for it to sound

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.390 
need to bias it properly for it to sound
any<00:00:23.560> good<00:00:24.179> the<00:00:25.619> potentiometer<00:00:26.619> here<00:00:26.769> this<00:00:27.189> one

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
any good the potentiometer here this one

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.620 
any good the potentiometer here this one
is<00:00:27.550> a<00:00:27.669> 100k<00:00:28.539> and<00:00:29.759> I've<00:00:30.759> got<00:00:30.999> sockets<00:00:31.449> for

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
is a 100k and I've got sockets for

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.960 
is a 100k and I've got sockets for
whether<00:00:31.839> whether<00:00:32.410> resistor<00:00:32.920> is<00:00:33.040> for<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.310> 470

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
whether whether resistor is for the 470

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.240 
whether whether resistor is for the 470
K<00:00:34.230> resistor<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.380> I'm<00:00:35.440> actually<00:00:35.590> lowered<00:00:36.129> that

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
K resistor and I'm actually lowered that

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.500 
K resistor and I'm actually lowered that
to<00:00:37.920> 300<00:00:38.920> approximately<00:00:39.789> I<00:00:39.820> think<00:00:39.940> I've<00:00:40.300> found

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
to 300 approximately I think I've found

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.170 
to 300 approximately I think I've found
the<00:00:40.750> best<00:00:40.960> sort<00:00:41.350> of<00:00:41.410> sound<00:00:41.680> with<00:00:42.340> that<00:00:42.489> at<00:00:42.670> 300

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
the best sort of sound with that at 300

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.840 
the best sort of sound with that at 300
if<00:00:43.660> you've<00:00:43.840> got<00:00:44.019> a<00:00:44.050> 500<00:00:44.829> K<00:00:45.010> part<00:00:45.519> while<00:00:45.699> you're

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
if you've got a 500 K part while you're

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.790 
if you've got a 500 K part while you're
ordering<00:00:46.149> your<00:00:46.300> stuff<00:00:46.480> I<00:00:46.629> just<00:00:46.870> say<00:00:46.989> get<00:00:47.680> it

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
ordering your stuff I just say get it

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.490 
ordering your stuff I just say get it
500<00:00:48.340> K<00:00:48.460> pot<00:00:48.699> and<00:00:48.940> replace<00:00:49.539> that<00:00:49.570> with<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.960> 500<00:00:50.289> K

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
500 K pot and replace that with a 500 K

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.410 
500 K pot and replace that with a 500 K
PI<00:00:50.710> or<00:00:51.090> plug<00:00:52.090> a<00:00:52.120> 500<00:00:52.750> K<00:00:52.870> pot<00:00:53.140> into<00:00:54.089> the<00:00:55.089> three

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
PI or plug a 500 K pot into the three

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.790 
PI or plug a 500 K pot into the three
spots<00:00:56.079> so<00:00:57.149> you'll<00:00:58.149> have<00:00:58.269> the<00:00:58.449> three<00:00:58.780> legs<00:00:59.620> of

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
spots so you'll have the three legs of

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.569 
spots so you'll have the three legs of
the<00:00:59.980> potentiometer<00:01:00.489> one<00:01:00.969> on<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:01.780> left<00:01:02.579> one

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
the potentiometer one on the left one

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.070 
the potentiometer one on the left one
attached<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.330> base<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.750> then<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:04.960> other

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
attached to the base and then the other

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.480 
attached to the base and then the other
one<00:01:05.230> on<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.440> right<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.920> then<00:01:06.220> you<00:01:06.280> can<00:01:06.400> just

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
one on the right and then you can just

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.910 
one on the right and then you can just
use<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.790> one<00:01:06.820> 500<00:01:07.210> K<00:01:07.540> pot<00:01:07.780> -<00:01:07.990> I'm<00:01:08.170> bias<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.770> that

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
use the one 500 K pot - I'm bias it that

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.280 
use the one 500 K pot - I'm bias it that
way<00:01:09.070> it'll<00:01:09.490> just<00:01:09.670> show<00:01:09.729> you<00:01:09.880> how<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.090> biases<00:01:10.720> in

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
way it'll just show you how it biases in

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.749 
way it'll just show you how it biases in
this<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:12.280> way<00:01:12.430> I've<00:01:12.640> got<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:12.909> set<00:01:13.119> up<00:01:14.759> this

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
this the way I've got it set up this

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.630 
this the way I've got it set up this
might<00:01:16.000> be<00:01:16.150> a<00:01:16.180> bit<00:01:16.299> tricky<00:01:16.780> because<00:01:16.840> um<00:01:17.640> well

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
might be a bit tricky because um well

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.120 
might be a bit tricky because um well
the<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.570> amps<00:01:20.079> are<00:01:20.140> going<00:01:20.259> to<00:01:20.320> be<00:01:20.380> pretty<00:01:20.829> loud

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
the the amps are going to be pretty loud

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.639 
the the amps are going to be pretty loud
I<00:01:21.600> reckon<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.689> effect<00:01:22.960> sounds<00:01:23.200> better<00:01:23.409> than

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
I reckon the effect sounds better than

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.289 
I reckon the effect sounds better than
the<00:01:23.799> booster<00:01:24.399> that<00:01:24.549> fall<00:01:24.790> that's<00:01:25.000> why<00:01:25.149> it's

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
the booster that fall that's why it's

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.460 
the booster that fall that's why it's
going<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.450> be<00:01:25.540> difficult<00:01:25.720> for<00:01:26.020> me<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.200> show<00:01:26.409> you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
going to be difficult for me to show you

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.020 
going to be difficult for me to show you
this<00:01:26.649> because<00:01:26.890> it's<00:01:27.009> gonna<00:01:27.189> the<00:01:27.610> volume<00:01:27.939> is

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
this because it's gonna the volume is

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.580 
this because it's gonna the volume is
going<00:01:28.149> to<00:01:28.210> increase<00:01:28.270> or<00:01:28.750> decrease<00:01:28.869> as<00:01:29.290> I<00:01:29.380> turn

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
going to increase or decrease as I turn

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.330 
going to increase or decrease as I turn
the<00:01:30.189> BIOS<00:01:31.079> by<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.140> just<00:01:32.469> before<00:01:32.560> I<00:01:32.770> bias<00:01:33.070> and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
the BIOS by a just before I bias and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.270 
the BIOS by a just before I bias and
that<00:01:33.460> whistling<00:01:33.969> noise<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.860> positive

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
that whistling noise it's a positive

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.190 
that whistling noise it's a positive
ground<00:01:36.759> effect<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:37.360> I<00:01:37.390> can't<00:01:37.689> actually<00:01:37.810> plug

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
ground effect so I can't actually plug

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.520 
ground effect so I can't actually plug
the<00:01:38.490> filter<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:39.700> usually

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the filter that I usually

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.280 
the filter that I usually
into<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.090> mop<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.420> Tyler<00:01:42.750> sure<00:01:42.930> what's<00:01:43.140> going

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
into a mop and Tyler sure what's going

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.570 
into a mop and Tyler sure what's going
to<00:01:43.320> happen<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.220> I'm<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.340> going

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
to happen if I do that so I'm just going

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.160 
to happen if I do that so I'm just going
to<00:01:44.610> leave<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.909> off<00:01:45.030> that's<00:01:45.690> why<00:01:45.869> there's<00:01:46.080> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
to leave it off that's why there's that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.600 
to leave it off that's why there's that
whistling<00:01:46.500> noise<00:01:46.650> but<00:01:46.950> what<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:47.430> actually

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
whistling noise but what I actually

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.420 
whistling noise but what I actually
going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.940> box<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.330> I'm<00:01:48.510> going<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> use<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
going to box it up I'm going to use a

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.749 
going to box it up I'm going to use a
mad<00:01:50.430> Ben<00:01:50.729> I'm<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.900> use<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.130> road-rage<00:01:53.130> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
mad Ben I'm going to use a road-rage to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.060 
mad Ben I'm going to use a road-rage to
to<00:01:54.479> use<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> negative<00:01:55.380> output<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.040> I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
to use the negative output on that so I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.499 
to use the negative output on that so I
could<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.340> plug<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.880> my<00:01:57.360> other

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
could just plug it in with my other

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.690 
could just plug it in with my other
pedals<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.080> I'm<00:01:58.470> thinking<00:01:58.740> about<00:01:58.800> I<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.369> I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
pedals and I'm thinking about I think I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.050 
pedals and I'm thinking about I think I
probably<00:01:59.850> put<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.300> in<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:01.340> 1590<00:02:02.340> B<00:02:02.550> so<00:02:02.820> I've<00:02:02.880> got

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
probably put it in a 1590 B so I've got

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.520 
probably put it in a 1590 B so I've got
a<00:02:03.090> bit<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.299> extra<00:02:03.600> room<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.049> I'm<00:02:04.259> also

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
a bit of extra room and I'm also

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.649 
a bit of extra room and I'm also
considering<00:02:05.040> after<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.430> leaving<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.880> bio

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
considering after you leaving that bio

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.469 
considering after you leaving that bio
spot<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.320> maybe<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.399> don't<00:02:09.060> know<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.179> mean

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
spot on maybe but I don't know I mean

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.449 
spot on maybe but I don't know I mean
really<00:02:10.200> once<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:10.500> said<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.979> suppose<00:02:11.250> it's

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
really once you said it I suppose it's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.880 
really once you said it I suppose it's
pretty<00:02:11.640> much<00:02:11.790> sit<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.150> forget<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.500> yeah<00:02:13.500> it's

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
pretty much sit and forget but yeah it's

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.970 
pretty much sit and forget but yeah it's
what<00:02:14.010> those<00:02:14.250> details<00:02:14.519> out<00:02:14.880> later<00:02:15.090> on

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
what those details out later on

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:25.539 
what those details out later on
hopefully<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.310> camera<00:02:17.519> is<00:02:17.670> not<00:02:17.790> clipping

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.110 

that's<00:02:26.549> pretty<00:02:26.790> loud<00:02:27.030> too<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.459> Boosters

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
that's pretty loud too it's the Boosters

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.539 
that's pretty loud too it's the Boosters
cranked<00:02:30.510> up<00:02:33.829> so<00:02:34.829> if<00:02:35.159> we<00:02:35.370> turn<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.180> BIOS<00:02:37.549> you

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
cranked up so if we turn the BIOS you

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.479 
cranked up so if we turn the BIOS you
hear<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.760> volume<00:02:38.939> actually<00:02:39.239> go<00:02:39.480> down<00:02:43.489> until

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
hear the volume actually go down until

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.179 
hear the volume actually go down until
it<00:02:44.609> switches<00:02:44.849> off<00:02:45.439> when<00:02:46.439> switch<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.859> off<00:02:47.010> it's

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
it switches off when switch is off it's

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:48.679 
it switches off when switch is off it's
not<00:02:47.310> getting<00:02:47.609> enough<00:02:47.819> voltage<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.659> base

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
not getting enough voltage to the base

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.300 
not getting enough voltage to the base
of<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.200> transistor<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.069> you've<00:02:50.219> obviously

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
of the transistor so you've obviously

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.149 
of the transistor so you've obviously
gone<00:02:50.669> too<00:02:50.939> far<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:52.019> find<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.680> find<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.069> pretty

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
gone too far I find I find it pretty

00:02:53.159 --> 00:03:00.339 
gone too far I find I find it pretty
much<00:02:53.370> gets<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.849> higher<00:02:54.299> level<00:02:54.659> that<00:02:54.840> stops

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.860 

that<00:03:01.349> last<00:03:01.709> sort<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.329> third<00:03:03.329> of<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.659> turn

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
that last sort of third of the turn

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.599 
that last sort of third of the turn
really<00:03:04.230> doesn't<00:03:04.500> do<00:03:04.590> much<00:03:04.620> make<00:03:05.430> much

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
really doesn't do much make much

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:12.530 
really doesn't do much make much
difference<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:08.280> starts<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.699> go<00:03:08.819> down<00:03:09.030> there<00:03:11.540> so

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
difference it starts to go down there so

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.990 
difference it starts to go down there so
I<00:03:12.569> found<00:03:12.989> pretty<00:03:13.199> almost<00:03:13.409> up<00:03:13.769> full<00:03:14.099> exam<00:03:14.519> on

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
I found pretty almost up full exam on

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.369 
I found pretty almost up full exam on
the<00:03:15.799> on<00:03:16.939> the<00:03:17.939> potentiometers<00:03:18.930> sounds<00:03:19.319> the

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
the on the potentiometers sounds the

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:29.080 
the on the potentiometers sounds the
best

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.750 

that's<00:03:30.090> just<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.570> treble<00:03:30.930> mud<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.920> mad

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
that's just the treble mud that mad

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.430 
that's just the treble mud that mad
Bates<00:03:33.030> got<00:03:33.150> on<00:03:33.360> his<00:03:33.450> project<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:34.110> here<00:03:34.290> I'm

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
Bates got on his project is here I'm

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.010 
Bates got on his project is here I'm
building<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.190> sell<00:03:35.600> actually<00:03:36.600> sounds<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.930> bit

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
building to sell actually sounds a bit

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.280 
building to sell actually sounds a bit
thin<00:03:37.320> without<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.520> without<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.570> maunder<00:03:40.110> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
thin without the without the maunder the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:04:05.830 
thin without the without the maunder the
baseline

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.790 

and<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.470> clips<00:04:06.710> more<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.850> more<00:04:08.290> input<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.590> put

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
and it clips more the more input you put

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.180 
and it clips more the more input you put
into<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:10.070> like<00:04:10.370> if<00:04:10.520> I<00:04:10.610> just<00:04:10.760> play<00:04:10.970> single

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.590 

moment<00:04:16.190> really<00:04:16.370> here<00:04:16.610> the<00:04:16.730> clipping<00:04:17.090> if<00:04:17.510> I

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
moment really here the clipping if I

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.560 
moment really here the clipping if I
play<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.840> chord<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:21.410> can<00:04:21.560> start<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:22.010> here<00:04:22.190> clip

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
play a chord you can start the here clip

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.020 
play a chord you can start the here clip
so<00:04:23.570> I'll<00:04:23.630> probably<00:04:23.750> do<00:04:23.990> a<00:04:24.070> sound<00:04:25.070> demo<00:04:25.730> of<00:04:25.880> it

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
so I'll probably do a sound demo of it

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.820 
so I'll probably do a sound demo of it
later<00:04:26.330> on<00:04:26.450> but<00:04:26.600> that's<00:04:27.200> pretty<00:04:27.500> much<00:04:27.620> the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
later on but that's pretty much the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.500 
later on but that's pretty much the
build<00:04:28.010> rapport<00:04:28.430> it's<00:04:29.060> probably<00:04:29.360> more

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
build rapport it's probably more

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.880 
build rapport it's probably more
interesting<00:04:30.050> than<00:04:30.200> just<00:04:30.230> looking<00:04:30.650> on<00:04:30.800> the

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
interesting than just looking on the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.660 
interesting than just looking on the

B and you know that does this this does
that<00:04:36.890> I<00:04:37.310> thought<00:04:37.730> this<00:04:37.850> might<00:04:38.090> be<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.300> bit<00:04:38.420> more

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
that I thought this might be a bit more

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.540 
that I thought this might be a bit more
interesting<00:04:38.920> thanks<00:04:39.920> for<00:04:40.040> watching<00:04:40.370> and
