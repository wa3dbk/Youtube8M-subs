 firstly because cinnamon we will 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.360

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.860
 Cost of such delicious dishes for women 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.110

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.690
 very active and in home cosmetics 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.970
 what kind of acting force 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.010
 cinnamon cinnamon a huge amount 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.170
 trace elements and special vitamins 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.570
 such minerals that are very difficult 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.490
 find and replace something like that 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.230
 in such content in such a bouquet 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.030
 buy cinnamon sticks 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.679
 if you are korean use a little something 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.010
 buy in very small quantities 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.769
 because it's just a tree bark 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.079
 cinnamon absorbs moisture very quickly and from 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.909
 that its properties are lost to store 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.599
 cinnamon should be in a dry jar with tight 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.560
 closed 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.069
 how can we cinnamon stick 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.129
 use apparently 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.969
 you just need to grind it 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.890
 break off here like a little piece and 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.530
 she can be in the mortar of a magnificent Indian woman 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.540
 do have such stone mortar or 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.749
 she put a pebble on a pebble 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.030
 fast feathers little INDICATES very easy Well 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.959
 You can also grind on a coffee grinder 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.569
 if you have good quality 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.420
 coffee grinder is very easy to do well 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.629
 if you are big or lazy 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.719
 busy woman buy yourself already cinnamon 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.030
 with sachets as spices we cook 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.540
 mastic we are so we need 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.299
 to take 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.060
 a ripe banana if it is already such 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:10.319
 see a little bit such 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.499
 too ripe too soft somewhere 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.629
 about three to four centimeters we do 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:17.670
 from banana 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.069
 mashed potatoes she is not very many vitamins 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.310
 trace elements that nourish the skin 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.560
 nourish the skin make the skin very soft and 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.900
 also by the way the banana is wonderful 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.579
 soft but with a crab call me that 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.829
 gamash that is it is the softest 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:40.499
 peeling we make this sour cream and 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:41.189
 we connect in our anal with cinnamon which 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.469
 from milled 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:46.950
 but if you take on teaspoonful 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:50.189
 judge it somewhere on the bottom of the hill and 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.349
 about one quarter of cinnamon so 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:55.049
 as it increases blood circulation 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.450
 she is quite active in spices 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.810
 and if you take it a little more for 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.299
 Face it, you can not just krasnitsy 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.639
 joke i mean you have to be careful and 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.469
 careful do not take cinnamon much i want 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:11.010
 one more to remember that we are sure 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:14.519
 doing a test on here here on the brush 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.350
 either on the elbow and wait about 15 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.290
 minutes if we have 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.750
 active redness or itching 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.180
 then cinnamon is better by the way 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.050
 skin is better to quietly accustom to it 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.849
 little 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.789
 fotochku and so you did this 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.650
 tournament and now we will add a little bit 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.139
 you can find lemon juice 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.909
 ask not to help me need to squeeze 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.289

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:43.289
 teaspoon finger a little bit and here 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.449
 here is my improvement case 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.639
 the fact that for oily skin in summer hot 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.879
 period of time it can be placed 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.139
 for example kefir I added because 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.569
 we returned ourselves 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.909
 from indies after the Christmas holidays 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.190
 and we had a cold and it was 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:01.620
 The first mask I made at home 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.710
 homeland and I added there is not kefir 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.060

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.819
 such thick should be 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.599

 for décolleté but most 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:53.789
 interesting if this mask is applied to 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.830

 smoothed out and face just smiles 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.990
 so often we will make this mask such 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.599
