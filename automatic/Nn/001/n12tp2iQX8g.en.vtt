140 millimeter lens that's a 10x zoom
which<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:51.180> unusual<00:00:51.410> for<00:00:52.410> an

which is very unusual for an
interchangeable<00:00:53.309> lens<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.449> provides<00:00:54.809> an

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
interchangeable lens and it provides an

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.130 
interchangeable lens and it provides an

effective field of view of a 28 to 200
millimeter<00:00:58.590> lens<00:00:59.090> what's<00:01:00.090> special<00:01:00.390> about

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
millimeter lens what's special about

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.319 
millimeter lens what's special about
this<00:01:00.930> lens<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:02.430> allows<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.820> camera

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
this lens is that it allows the camera

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.230 
this lens is that it allows the camera
to<00:01:03.680> continuously<00:01:04.680> autofocus<00:01:05.519> when<00:01:05.909> shooting

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
to continuously autofocus when shooting

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600 
to continuously autofocus when shooting
video<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> primary<00:01:08.280> difference

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
video and that is the primary difference

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
video and that is the primary difference
between<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.540> camera<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.470> what

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
between what this camera can do and what

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.370 
between what this camera can do and what
the<00:01:11.040> video<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> typical<00:01:12.210> digital<00:01:12.540> SLR<00:01:13.170> can

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the video on a typical digital SLR can

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800 
the video on a typical digital SLR can
do<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.310> video<00:01:14.549> quality<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.150> good<00:01:15.570> as

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
do and the video quality is very good as

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.170 
do and the video quality is very good as
is<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> sound<00:01:16.799> quality<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.549> has<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:18.000> nice

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
is the sound quality it has very nice

built-in microphone

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.109 
built-in microphone
unfortunately<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> placement<00:01:20.700> tends<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.030> be

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
unfortunately the placement tends to be

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.609 
unfortunately the placement tends to be
a<00:01:21.150> little<00:01:21.330> more<00:01:21.509> susceptible<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.170> wind<00:01:22.380> noise

a little more susceptible to wind noise

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.530 
a little more susceptible to wind noise
than<00:01:22.920> I'd<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.490> there<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.180> three<00:01:24.390> levels

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
than I'd like but there are three levels

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
very good it's fast the autofocus system

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.120 
very good it's fast the autofocus system
seems<00:01:50.970> particularly<00:01:51.479> fast<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.619> g1<00:01:52.920> it's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
seems particularly fast like the g1 it's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.620
