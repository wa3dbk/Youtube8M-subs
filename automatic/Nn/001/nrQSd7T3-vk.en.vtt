reason<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> blob<00:00:53.789> fish<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.300> survive<00:00:54.600> at

reason that a blob fish can survive at

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.560 
reason that a blob fish can survive at
such<00:00:55.050> depths<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.649> by<00:00:56.160> forgoing<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.850> gas<00:00:57.270> butter

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
such depths is by forgoing a gas butter

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.200 
such depths is by forgoing a gas butter
but<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.010> relative<00:00:59.370> lack<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.579> muscle<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
but for the relative lack of muscle is

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.420 
but for the relative lack of muscle is
not<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.420> disadvantage<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.890> primarily

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
not a disadvantage as it primarily

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.579 
not a disadvantage as it primarily
swallows<00:01:02.910> edible<00:01:03.390> matter<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.780> floats<00:01:04.110> by<00:01:04.409> in
