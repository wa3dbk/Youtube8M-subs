00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.520
 head coach of the team Rostov me fights 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.280
 bozhovich please 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.460
 my drug comments on the match and its 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.460
 the results 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.200
 but illumination will take Cyrano well 33 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:22.140
 minutes 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:26.680
 honest expected it would be easier but somehow 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.460
 subtle intercept saints they have a game 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.880
 went better than us we just three 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.430
 very good moments that without taking 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.180
 draw a little 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.050
 but it did not work we can be lucky 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.120
 say second half 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.310
 from the game to learn scored the second goal pass and 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.240
 I think a little bit sharp 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.190
 follow 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.090
 started playing better wins 30 could 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.210
 be and 33 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.320
 but I think business will be summer anyway 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.130
 thanks please your questions 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.130
 concerning the match 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.440
 usually when the command is from 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.440
 it happens 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:20.960
 as if why 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.200
 we broke the program there midfield 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.080
 lost one perseverance and in general 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:33.090
 someone knows and how people look at us 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.660
 number sport there plays without glasses and they 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.450
 think this is a bad team is it at all 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.420
 very good team if you look at 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.410
 and river players it boldly lift 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.610
 who have already played shoigu russia and who 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:53.940
 watched them play with Kuban saw there 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.780
 that they are 2 there in general section Kuban so 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.560
 that thinks that no one thought what would happen 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.090
 easy and so about what will be here 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.970
 descent from the hand just the first time we have 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.020
 it did not work out completely sieve and they us 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.700
 correlated second half ok 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:21.989
 made some adjustments my best 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:24.950
 video business and I think that cyrus thanks 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.950
 please what is the question 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.150
 meters but squash demand is hard to play 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.489
 with commands from the bottom of the difficult 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.300
 betray face yes here it is thousands I'll run 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.820
 set 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.400
 for dinner what is for the team 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.980
 further did not lose the quality of his fight 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.270
 start with these teams really respect all 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.950
 still non- hang life 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.140
 hard flowers on this question because in 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.420
 last year we also saw nutricula 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.050
 at home then 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:03:00.390
 lost must wait i gotta 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:04.350
 say that today we play again 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.880
 new composition layal right person 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.630
 province man who does not speak 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.090
 in Russian 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:14.600
 and some of our players do not speak 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:17.120
 in Portuguese so today the prices 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.010
 very big risk 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.120
 thank god i think he can handle it 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.560
 well played bashi he is not at all easy 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.280
 will clean today and 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.990
 and in their defense because it is impossible 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.150
 pro no communication but these are players and 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:41.580
 who bought which from which 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:44.040
 good quality is only very difficult 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:51.380
 difficult to put in base 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:58.400
 well during the underwear championship 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:04:04.600
 I have a question and I think that the version of the deck 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.600
 will be portuguese yes please 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:13.310
 what is he protecting 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.440
 yes without 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:22.630
 everything is clear thanks I think that the decline 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:27.260
 maybe but he underestimates 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:33.050
 good opponents because he is very 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:35.870
 great playing and when i'm very good 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.290
 thinks and in one this may be me 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.120
 it's easy to figure it out completely and I still 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.120
 just want to emphasize that the Russian 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.740
 championship is very convenient to come 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.260
 come stars of world football and 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.580
 face the problem here so 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.710
 they will probably need a little bit of him 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:07.120
 more hold on more run to 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:07.120
 better thanks for commenting 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.970
 started what 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:18.680
 I can because we are young 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:23.620
 central defender of sulu for whom 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:27.410
 bartosh means practically 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:34.070
 the correctness is such an opportunity to give her 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:37.730
 we did it because I think that already 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.790
 long salads playing here and 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.940
 there may be time he has a memory in the middle 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.070
 so that some find for themselves some 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:52.750
 each other as will some other 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.750
 motivation thanks minded were all
