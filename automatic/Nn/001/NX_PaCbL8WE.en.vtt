well today I plan on doing some

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.840 
well today I plan on doing some
compression<00:00:03.389> tests<00:00:04.069> but<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.100> brought<00:00:05.700> all<00:00:05.730> my

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
compression tests but I brought all my

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.810 
compression tests but I brought all my
stuff<00:00:06.000> over<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.839> greenhouses<00:00:07.319> because<00:00:08.010> we

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
stuff over to the greenhouses because we

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.669

it's December 27th two days after

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.990 
it's December 27th two days after
Christmas<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:23.010> am<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.340> short<00:00:23.640> sleeve

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
shirt my my formylation shirt here

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
shirt my my formylation shirt here
American<00:00:28.439> classic<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.460> got<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
American classic I like I got it that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.280 
American classic I like I got it that
got<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.050> when<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> went<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.679> vacation<00:00:32.390> but<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:34.140> is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
got it when I went on vacation but it is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.319 
got it when I went on vacation but it is
literally<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> low<00:00:35.250> 70s<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> think<00:00:36.239> we

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
literally in the low 70s here I think we

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.389 
literally in the low 70s here I think we
might<00:00:36.510> even<00:00:36.690> set<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> record<00:00:37.320> high<00:00:37.649> for<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
might even set a record high for the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.690 
might even set a record high for the
year<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.730> when<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.870> happened<00:00:43.700> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
year and so when that happened the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.330 
year and so when that happened the
garage<00:00:45.120> floor<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.840> everything<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.649> was

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
garage floor and everything in it was

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.160 
garage floor and everything in it was
still<00:00:47.670> cold<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> temperature<00:00:48.629> rose<00:00:48.870> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
still cold as the temperature rose and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.840 
still cold as the temperature rose and
now<00:00:49.200> everything<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:49.950> covered<00:00:50.820> with

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
now everything is just covered with

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.209 
now everything is just covered with
water<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.510> that's<00:00:55.110> why<00:00:55.320> my<00:00:55.530> fluorescent

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
water and that's why my fluorescent

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.580 
water and that's why my fluorescent
light<00:00:56.610> bulbs<00:00:57.000> wouldn't<00:00:57.510> start<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.350> garage

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
light bulbs wouldn't start in the garage

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.250 
light bulbs wouldn't start in the garage
so<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> didn't<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.640> any<00:00:59.820> light<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.930> brought

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
so I didn't have any light so I brought

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.959 
so I didn't have any light so I brought
him<00:01:01.410> over<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.070> greenhouse<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
him over here to the greenhouse and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
him over here to the greenhouse and
we're<00:01:03.930> getting<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.320> gonna<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.680> our

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
we're getting just gonna do our

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.050 
we're getting just gonna do our
compression<00:01:05.309> tests<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.150> hope<00:01:07.140> my<00:01:07.320> battery

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
compression tests here I hope my battery

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.810 
compression tests here I hope my battery
chargers<00:01:09.060> slashed<00:01:09.770> jumpers<00:01:10.770> okay<00:01:11.250> because<00:01:11.670> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
chargers slashed jumpers okay because it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.499 
chargers slashed jumpers okay because it
was<00:01:11.939> soaked<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.390> water<00:01:12.479> too<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:14.490> well<00:01:14.700> we'll

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
was soaked with water too so well we'll

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.840 
was soaked with water too so well we'll
see<00:01:15.689> what<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:16.229> happens<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.040> hopefully

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
see what what happens here and hopefully

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.390 
see what what happens here and hopefully
everything's<00:01:18.299> all<00:01:18.509> right<00:01:18.830> but<00:01:19.830> that's<00:01:20.159> why

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
everything's all right but that's why

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.719 
everything's all right but that's why
I'm<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.700> greenhouses<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.630> now

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
I'm in the greenhouses right now

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.280 
I'm in the greenhouses right now
well<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> warm<00:01:24.090> weather<00:01:24.299> sure<00:01:24.689> feels<00:01:24.960> nice

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
well the warm weather sure feels nice

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.859 
well the warm weather sure feels nice
but<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.610> when<00:01:26.759> winter<00:01:26.909> moves<00:01:27.270> back<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
but then when winter moves back in it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.530 
but then when winter moves back in it
brings<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.290> cold<00:01:28.530> front<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.000> got<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
brings a cold front with it and I got a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.920 
brings a cold front with it and I got a
tornado<00:01:30.930> watch<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.530> effect<00:01:31.650> currently<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
tornado watch in effect currently and

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.149 
tornado watch in effect currently and
we're<00:01:33.930> supposed<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.350> get<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:34.860> high

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
we're supposed to get some really high

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.830 
we're supposed to get some really high
winds<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.909> cold<00:01:36.180> front<00:01:36.450> pushes<00:01:36.810> through

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
winds as this cold front pushes through

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.940 
winds as this cold front pushes through
if<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.750> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.170> hear<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.530> there's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
if you can if you can hear it there's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.429 
if you can if you can hear it there's
rain<00:01:41.520> falling<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.450> plastic<00:01:42.960> roof<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.350> this

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
rain falling on the plastic roof of this

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.550 
rain falling on the plastic roof of this
greenhouse

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
greenhouse

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.969 
greenhouse
and<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:45.369> can<00:01:45.549> get<00:01:45.729> very<00:01:45.790> loud<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:47.500> currently

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
and it can get very loud but currently

it's raining very lightly and even then

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.740 
it's raining very lightly and even then

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
it sounds kind of loud but we'll do what

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.359 
it sounds kind of loud but we'll do what
we<00:01:52.990> can<00:01:53.200> do<00:01:53.320> in<00:01:53.470> here<00:01:53.680> we're<00:01:53.920> still<00:01:54.130> nice<00:01:54.340> and

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
we can do in here we're still nice and

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.210 
we can do in here we're still nice and
dry<00:01:54.729> as<00:01:54.789> long<00:01:55.090> as<00:01:55.270> power<00:01:55.479> stays<00:01:55.869> on<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:57.039> then

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
dry as long as power stays on and then

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.859 
dry as long as power stays on and then
again<00:01:57.549> if<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.850> went<00:01:58.000> out<00:01:58.180> our<00:01:58.390> backup

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
again if it went out our backup

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.660 
again if it went out our backup
generator<00:01:59.380> in<00:01:59.619> there<00:01:59.829> would<00:02:00.039> kick<00:02:00.280> in<00:02:00.490> and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
generator in there would kick in and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.529 
generator in there would kick in and
handle<00:02:01.060> everything<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.729> think<00:02:04.090> my<00:02:04.240> battery

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
handle everything but I think my battery

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.240 
handle everything but I think my battery
charger<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:04.990> working<00:02:05.350> all<00:02:05.470> right<00:02:05.500> I've<00:02:05.830> tested

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
charger is working all right I've tested

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.219 
charger is working all right I've tested
it<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.580> got<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.299> slide<00:02:07.509> here<00:02:07.689> to<00:02:07.810> make<00:02:07.990> sure<00:02:08.170> I

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
it I got the slide here to make sure I

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.740 
it I got the slide here to make sure I
got<00:02:08.470> power<00:02:08.709> being<00:02:09.099> supplied<00:02:09.580> while<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.330> cranked

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
got power being supplied while I cranked

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.339 
got power being supplied while I cranked
these<00:02:10.959> engines<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.739> do<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> compression<00:02:12.550> test

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
these engines to do the compression test

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.080 
these engines to do the compression test
I'm<00:02:14.349> gonna<00:02:14.470> let<00:02:14.709> them<00:02:14.769> warm<00:02:15.010> up<00:02:15.190> first<00:02:15.489> so

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
I'm gonna let them warm up first so

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.850 
I'm gonna let them warm up first so
we're<00:02:16.239> gonna<00:02:16.330> start<00:02:16.720> them<00:02:16.900> up<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:17.200> be<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.470> 70

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
we're gonna start them up and be in 70

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.620 
we're gonna start them up and be in 70
degrees<00:02:18.160> they<00:02:18.340> should<00:02:18.549> fire<00:02:18.760> up<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.030> lot<00:02:19.209> easier

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
degrees they should fire up a lot easier

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.289 
degrees they should fire up a lot easier
than<00:02:19.840> they<00:02:20.049> did<00:02:20.110> when<00:02:20.410> they<00:02:20.470> were<00:02:20.620> cold<00:02:21.299> so

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
than they did when they were cold so

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.380 
than they did when they were cold so
let's<00:02:22.780> see<00:02:23.560> let's<00:02:23.769> engage<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.850> charge<00:02:25.150> you're

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
let's see let's engage the charge you're

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.960 
let's see let's engage the charge you're
here<00:02:26.280> let's<00:02:27.280> do<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.790> 12<00:02:28.060> volts<00:02:29.819> coolants<00:02:30.819> and

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
here let's do it 12 volts coolants and

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.030 
here let's do it 12 volts coolants and
12<00:02:31.299> volts<00:02:31.690> for<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.080> one<00:02:32.319> because<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.709> doesn't

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
12 volts for this one because it doesn't

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.900 
12 volts for this one because it doesn't
pull<00:02:33.220> much<00:02:35.040> let's<00:02:36.040> give<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.370> three<00:02:36.580> prongs

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
pull much let's give it three prongs

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:51.350 
pull much let's give it three prongs
like<00:02:37.360> they<00:02:38.110> say

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.360 

shoot<00:02:52.360> it's<00:02:52.810> probably<00:02:53.230> got<00:02:53.350> condensation<00:02:54.220> in

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
shoot it's probably got condensation in

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.030 
shoot it's probably got condensation in
it<00:02:55.080> probably<00:02:56.080> gonna<00:02:56.380> take<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.590> little<00:02:56.800> bit<00:02:56.980> of

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
it probably gonna take a little bit of

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.410 
it probably gonna take a little bit of
honey

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
now I'm gonna take the spark plugs off

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.300 
now I'm gonna take the spark plugs off
and<00:04:19.510> then<00:04:20.510> hook<00:04:20.900> up<00:04:21.079> my<00:04:21.199> compression<00:04:21.620> tester

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
and then hook up my compression tester

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.740 
and then hook up my compression tester
and<00:04:22.520> that's<00:04:22.850> when<00:04:23.060> we'll<00:04:23.210> reason<00:04:23.570> in<00:04:23.660> the

and that's when we'll reason in the
video<00:04:24.400> well<00:04:25.400> I<00:04:25.430> decided<00:04:25.790> to<00:04:26.210> go<00:04:26.389> ahead<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.840> do

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
video well I decided to go ahead and do

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.110 
video well I decided to go ahead and do
it<00:04:27.139> anyway

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
it anyway

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.670 
it anyway
even<00:04:29.120> though<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.360> rains<00:04:29.600> pouring<00:04:30.110> down<00:04:30.410> like

even though the rains pouring down like

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.300 
even though the rains pouring down like
crazy

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
crazy

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.610 
crazy
pretty<00:04:33.310> loud

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.560 

I<00:04:36.680> decided<00:04:37.550> we'd<00:04:37.820> go<00:04:38.030> ahead<00:04:38.300> and

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.480 

there's<00:04:41.840> not<00:04:42.050> really<00:04:42.230> much<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.800> hear<00:04:43.010> but<00:04:43.250> just

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
there's not really much to hear but just

00:04:43.490 --> 00:05:03.720 
there's not really much to hear but just
stuck<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.940> watch

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:29.460 

zero<00:05:04.180> thermocompression

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.070 

pretty<00:05:30.010> good

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
pretty good

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.510 
pretty good
would<00:05:32.319> be

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.450 

70<00:05:36.520> psi<00:05:37.240> right<00:05:37.630> there<00:05:38.200> alright<00:05:38.830> let's<00:05:39.070> release

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
70 psi right there alright let's release

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.549 
70 psi right there alright let's release
it

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:41.559 
it

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:45.450 
it
do<00:05:41.769> it<00:05:41.919> one<00:05:42.099> more<00:05:42.129> time

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:06:00.999

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.689 

okay<00:06:05.639> there's<00:06:06.569> the<00:06:06.749> Briggs<00:06:07.020> index<00:06:07.699> 6.75

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
okay there's the Briggs index 6.75

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.189 
okay there's the Briggs index 6.75

at<00:06:10.409> 70<00:06:11.069> psi

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
at 70 psi

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.830 
at 70 psi
hold<00:06:13.889> back

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.690 

well<00:06:17.290> I'll<00:06:17.560> come<00:06:17.770> back<00:06:17.919> in<00:06:18.160> a<00:06:18.220> minute<00:06:18.370> we'll

well I'll come back in a minute we'll

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.820 
well I'll come back in a minute we'll
see<00:06:18.880> how<00:06:18.970> much<00:06:19.150> you<00:06:19.270> strong

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
see how much you strong

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.730 
see how much you strong
okay<00:06:21.310> it's<00:06:21.550> been<00:06:21.699> about<00:06:21.759> a<00:06:22.060> minute<00:06:22.509> and<00:06:22.930> it's

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
okay it's been about a minute and it's

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.909 
okay it's been about a minute and it's
dropped<00:06:24.129> about<00:06:24.370> five<00:06:24.909> psi

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
dropped about five psi

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.970 
dropped about five psi
so<00:06:27.219> it's<00:06:27.460> folding<00:06:27.939> pretty<00:06:28.270> good

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.450 

right<00:06:31.670> that's<00:06:32.030> the<00:06:32.240> compression<00:06:32.870> test<00:06:33.460> seems

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
right that's the compression test seems

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.710 
right that's the compression test seems
to<00:06:34.580> already<00:06:34.790> got<00:06:35.270> Andrade<00:06:35.630> 70<00:06:36.170> psi
