safety<00:01:18.270> first<00:01:18.630> part<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.350> i<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
safety first part and i think the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.670 
safety first part and i think the
warrior<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.939> gonna<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.540> gonna<00:01:21.780> dominate<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.340 
warrior is gonna is gonna dominate the
safety<00:01:23.070> first<00:01:23.369> not<00:01:24.270> gonna<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.600> an<00:01:24.689> easy<00:01:24.810> fight

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
safety first not gonna be an easy fight

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.679 
safety first not gonna be an easy fight
but<00:01:25.860> i<00:01:25.890> think<00:01:26.220> Manny's<00:01:26.580> gonna<00:01:26.759> find<00:01:27.210> him<00:01:27.479> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
but i think Manny's gonna find him and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.109 
but i think Manny's gonna find him and
beat<00:01:27.930> him<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> last<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.520> whole<00:01:29.729> 12

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.840 
I think it's possible the Manning will
knock<00:01:35.729> him<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.119> uh<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.430> but<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.670> goes
