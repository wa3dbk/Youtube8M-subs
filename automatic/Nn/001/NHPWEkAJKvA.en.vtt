00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
me before you start blending you want to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.779 
me before you start blending you want to
add<00:00:48.840> 1<00:00:49.140> cup<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.410> water<00:00:49.710> per<00:00:50.010> 2<00:00:50.250> pound<00:00:50.550> bag<00:00:50.760> of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
carrots at least that's what works for

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.490 
carrots at least that's what works for
me<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.969> find<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
me and if you find that it's not to the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
me and if you find that it's not to the
consistency<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.309> want<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.760> nice<00:00:57.000> creamy

consistency that you want a nice creamy
consistency<00:00:57.590> then<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.680> could<00:00:58.829> slowly<00:00:59.070> add

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
consistency then you could slowly add

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.720 
consistency then you could slowly add
more<00:00:59.760> water<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.590> key<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.010> add<00:01:02.250> too

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
more water and the key is not to add too

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
more water and the key is not to add too

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
much water all at once just to slowly do

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.630 
much water all at once just to slowly do
it<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.159> want<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> end<00:01:05.549> up

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
