00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
because it's actually automatically set

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.660 
because it's actually automatically set
to<00:01:24.600> be<00:01:24.750> small<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.470> proper<00:01:25.830> image<00:01:26.100> size<00:01:26.400> would

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
to be small the proper image size would

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.570 
to be small the proper image size would
be<00:01:26.700> anywhere<00:01:27.180> from<00:01:27.240> 160<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.290> 180<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.159> I'll<00:01:29.340> just

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
be anywhere from 160 to 180 so I'll just

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.060

do<00:01:29.759> 180<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.710> will

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
do 180 for this one and then I will

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.490 
do 180 for this one and then I will
press<00:01:32.310> resize<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.360> it'll<00:01:33.750> fit<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.290> don't

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
press resize and it'll fit you don't

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
press resize and it'll fit you don't
want<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.070> go<00:01:35.400> over<00:01:35.640> too<00:01:35.939> much<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.540> if

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
want it to go over too much because if

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.620 
want it to go over too much because if
you<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:37.020> let's<00:01:37.530> say<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:37.979> instance<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.970> 20<00:01:39.390> out

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
you do let's say for instance to 20 out

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.990 
you do let's say for instance to 20 out
of<00:01:39.689> 220<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.890> will<00:01:41.009> see<00:01:41.189> it'll<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.640> actually

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
of 220 you will see it'll be actually

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.670 
of 220 you will see it'll be actually
cut<00:01:42.270> off<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> don't<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.409> you
