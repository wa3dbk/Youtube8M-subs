now I'm going to roll this the advantage

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.670 
now I'm going to roll this the advantage
of<00:01:20.880> making<00:01:21.180> spring<00:01:21.600> roll<00:01:21.780> sheets<00:01:22.020> by<00:01:22.290> rolling

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
of making spring roll sheets by rolling

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.469 
of making spring roll sheets by rolling
is<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.160> make<00:01:23.340> square<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.149> can<00:01:24.300> make

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
is you can make square you can make

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.930 
is you can make square you can make
round<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.350> make<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.399> thinner<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.790> can

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
round you can make it thinner you can

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.969 
round you can make it thinner you can
make<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.240> thicker<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.500> better<00:01:28.710> one

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
make it thicker but with the better one

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.550 
make it thicker but with the better one
you<00:01:29.160> have<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.000> adjust<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.410> have

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
won't get any gift so our spring rolls

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:59.800 
won't get any gift so our spring rolls
are<00:03:48.849> ready<00:03:48.910> they<00:03:49.359> are<00:03:49.389> ready<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.720> be<00:03:49.930> fried
