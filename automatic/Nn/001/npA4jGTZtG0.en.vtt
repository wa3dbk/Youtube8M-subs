ok finished taking them all out and you
can<00:03:49.980> see<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.400> more<00:03:50.700> full<00:03:51.000> than<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.329> was<00:03:51.510> if<00:03:52.319> I

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
can see is more full than it was if I

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.740 
can see is more full than it was if I
can<00:03:52.799> even<00:03:52.950> separate<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.640> even<00:03:53.910> more<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.180> did<00:03:54.540> not

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
can even separate it even more I did not

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.069 
can even separate it even more I did not
um<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.560> only<00:03:56.459> separated<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.209> two<00:03:57.239> strands<00:03:57.750> I

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
um I only separated the two strands I

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.850 
um I only separated the two strands I
just<00:03:58.739> took<00:03:59.450> one<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.480> them<00:04:00.780> separate<00:04:01.440> addition

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
just took one of them separate addition

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.640 
just took one of them separate addition
trips<00:04:02.220> transmitted<00:04:02.849> spring<00:04:03.450> back<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.590> I

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
trips transmitted spring back and I

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.130 
trips transmitted spring back and I
thought<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:04.890> did<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:06.090> could<00:04:06.750> have<00:04:06.840> stretched

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
thought I did I could have stretched

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.619 
thought I did I could have stretched
them<00:04:07.349> out<00:04:07.500> let's<00:04:08.069> move<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.489> mouse<00:04:08.640> or<00:04:09.269> I<00:04:09.299> could

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
them out let's move the mouse or I could

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.930 
them out let's move the mouse or I could
even<00:04:09.870> separated<00:04:10.560> them<00:04:10.769> even<00:04:11.069> further<00:04:11.310> it

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
even separated them even further it

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.000 
even separated them even further it
would<00:04:12.030> be<00:04:12.150> even<00:04:12.299> more<00:04:12.420> poofier<00:04:12.989> but<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.620> want<00:04:13.950> to

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
would be even more poofier but I want to

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.370 
would be even more poofier but I want to
little<00:04:14.190> bit<00:04:14.310> more<00:04:14.459> wearing<00:04:14.970> time<00:04:15.840> in<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.200> so<00:04:16.350> i

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
little bit more wearing time in it so i

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.449 
little bit more wearing time in it so i
left<00:04:16.709> them<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:17.070> way<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.840> don't<00:04:19.709> have<00:04:20.190> all

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
left them that way and I don't have all

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.890 
left them that way and I don't have all
of<00:04:20.489> them<00:04:20.760> i'll<00:04:20.850> probably<00:04:21.060> have<00:04:21.269> seven<00:04:21.630> have<00:04:21.780> it

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
that's fine as long as it doesn't look

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.350 
that's fine as long as it doesn't look
too<00:04:30.180> crazy<00:04:30.810> this<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:31.620> how<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.919> back<00:04:32.190> look<00:04:32.490> and

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
too crazy this is how the back look and

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.029 
too crazy this is how the back look and
like<00:04:33.510> i<00:04:33.630> said<00:04:33.690> that's<00:04:34.110> not<00:04:34.289> important<00:04:34.860> that

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
like i said that's not important that

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.140 
like i said that's not important that
you<00:04:35.370> twist<00:04:35.700> them<00:04:36.620> in<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:38.370> way<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.910> want

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
you twist them in a way that you want

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.050 
you twist them in a way that you want
them<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.389> lay<00:04:39.690> because<00:04:40.260> if<00:04:40.650> they're<00:04:41.099> not<00:04:41.370> it

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
them to lay because if they're not it

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.150

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
should have retwist but um long as I

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.790
