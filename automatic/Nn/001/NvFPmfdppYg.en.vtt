00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409 
embracing but to me the vocals are just

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.619 
embracing but to me the vocals are just
such<00:06:21.529> a<00:06:21.560> central<00:06:21.979> part<00:06:22.069> of<00:06:22.460> this<00:06:23.000> album<00:06:23.270> I<00:06:23.509> know

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:25.149 
such a central part of this album I know
a<00:06:23.659> lot<00:06:23.870> of<00:06:23.900> Opeth<00:06:24.379> fans<00:06:24.680> may<00:06:24.919> have<00:06:25.009> already

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
a lot of Opeth fans may have already

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.610 
a lot of Opeth fans may have already
decided<00:06:25.819> how<00:06:25.940> they<00:06:26.089> feel<00:06:26.449> on<00:06:26.659> this<00:06:27.110> album<00:06:27.319> and

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
decided how they feel on this album and

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.540 
decided how they feel on this album and
that's<00:06:28.009> fine

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
that's fine

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.209 
that's fine
but<00:06:28.969> if<00:06:29.150> you've<00:06:29.360> never<00:06:29.389> been<00:06:29.960> in<00:06:30.020> Opeth<00:06:30.589> fan<00:06:30.949> I

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:31.219 
but if you've never been in Opeth fan I

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:32.680 
but if you've never been in Opeth fan I
would<00:06:31.669> at<00:06:31.759> least<00:06:31.789> try<00:06:32.120> this<00:06:32.270> thing<00:06:32.539> out

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
would at least try this thing out

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.079 
would at least try this thing out
because<00:06:33.050> they<00:06:33.199> are<00:06:33.229> trying<00:06:34.130> something

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:35.089 
because they are trying something

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:37.810 
because they are trying something
different<00:06:35.270> on<00:06:35.899> this<00:06:36.409> LP<00:06:36.649> if<00:06:37.069> you've<00:06:37.520> been

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
different on this LP if you've been

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.850 
different on this LP if you've been
turned<00:06:37.970> off<00:06:38.120> by<00:06:38.420> albums<00:06:38.840> like<00:06:39.110> Blackwater

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
turned off by albums like Blackwater

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.830 
turned off by albums like Blackwater
park<00:06:40.490> or<00:06:40.760> something<00:06:41.000> like<00:06:41.090> that<00:06:41.150> in<00:06:41.480> the<00:06:41.570> past

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
park or something like that in the past

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.080 
park or something like that in the past
then<00:06:42.230> this<00:06:42.710> is<00:06:42.860> definitely<00:06:43.250> worth<00:06:43.550> trying

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
then this is definitely worth trying

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.610 
then this is definitely worth trying
because<00:06:44.480> it<00:06:44.900> is<00:06:45.050> a<00:06:45.080> different<00:06:45.440> flavor

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
because it is a different flavor

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.020
