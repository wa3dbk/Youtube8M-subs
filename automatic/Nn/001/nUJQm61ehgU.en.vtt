enough<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.989> looks<00:00:46.260> decent<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.579> odds<00:00:47.789> were

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
enough and it looks decent the odds were

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.240 
enough and it looks decent the odds were
pretty<00:00:48.090> hard<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.500> i<00:00:49.559> still<00:00:49.860> think<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
pretty hard to do but i still think it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.709 
pretty hard to do but i still think it
