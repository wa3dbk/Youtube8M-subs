the field which is a lot of mana and a
lot<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.540> life<00:02:47.750> drains<00:02:48.079> is<00:02:48.440> at<00:02:48.650> seven<00:02:49.069> but<00:02:49.190> it's

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
lot of life drains is at seven but it's

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.920 
lot of life drains is at seven but it's
just<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.609> handful<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.120> spells<00:02:50.420> gives<00:02:50.660> me<00:02:50.780> or

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
seven

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.440 
seven
yeah<00:02:52.350> okay<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.370> your<00:02:53.940> numbers<00:02:54.240> are<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> little

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
yeah okay so your numbers are a little

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.150 
yeah okay so your numbers are a little
skewed<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.870> have<00:02:54.990> to<00:02:55.080> go<00:02:55.200> down<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.470> 3/4<00:02:55.980> seek

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
skewed you have to go down to 3/4 seek

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.559 
skewed you have to go down to 3/4 seek
it<00:02:56.280> looks<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.580> assume<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.000> was<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.330> because

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
it looks I assume this was just because

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.600 
it looks I assume this was just because
it<00:02:58.110> wasn't<00:02:58.319> all<00:02:58.530> my<00:02:58.650> castable<00:02:59.130> all<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.400> time

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
it wasn't all my castable all the time

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.059 
it wasn't all my castable all the time
or<00:02:59.850> yeah<00:03:00.270> so<00:03:00.810> we<00:03:00.959> only<00:03:01.110> have<00:03:01.290> nine<00:03:01.500> two<00:03:01.830> amount

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
or yeah so we only have nine two amount

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.449 
or yeah so we only have nine two amount

of plays which is enough to usually get
there<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.730> don't<00:03:05.970> want<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.150> depend<00:03:06.270> on<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.630> super

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
there I don't want to depend on a super

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.680 
there I don't want to depend on a super
heavily<00:03:07.489> we<00:03:08.489> have<00:03:08.610> key<00:03:08.790> rooms<00:03:08.970> for<00:03:09.209> later<00:03:09.420> but

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
heavily we have key rooms for later but

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.570 
heavily we have key rooms for later but
actually<00:03:10.200> drawing<00:03:10.470> too<00:03:10.709> far<00:03:10.980> six<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.400> just

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
actually drawing too far six is just

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.400 
actually drawing too far six is just
really<00:03:11.850> bad<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.569> second<00:03:12.870> floor<00:03:13.050> seek<00:03:13.260> is

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
really bad like the second floor seek is

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.110 
really bad like the second floor seek is
worse<00:03:13.590> than<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.830> land<00:03:14.040> because<00:03:14.730> you're

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
worse than the land because you're

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.790 
worse than the land because you're
missing<00:03:15.209> land<00:03:15.600> drop<00:03:15.810> too<00:03:15.959> far<00:03:16.170> seek<00:03:16.410> which<00:03:16.680> is

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
missing land drop too far seek which is

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.199 
missing land drop too far seek which is
like<00:03:16.980> he's<00:03:17.190> running<00:03:17.370> three<00:03:17.640> men<00:03:17.790> instead<00:03:18.060> of

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
like he's running three men instead of

playing to the reason for that is

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.500 
playing to the reason for that is
drawing<00:03:34.200> for<00:03:34.500> drawing<00:03:34.800> cards<00:03:35.100> is<00:03:35.220> nice

drawing for drawing cards is nice

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.890 
drawing for drawing cards is nice
spending<00:03:36.510> early<00:03:36.870> game<00:03:37.050> time<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:38.120> life<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.540> not

revelation for the whole deck and you

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.670 
revelation for the whole deck and you
can<00:04:35.630> still<00:04:35.870> just<00:04:36.020> beat<00:04:36.140> them<00:04:36.260> at<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.410> crystal

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
can still just beat them at the crystal

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.170 
can still just beat them at the crystal
gravity<00:04:36.980> yeah<00:04:37.460> one<00:04:37.640> of<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:37.790> synergies<00:04:38.120> I

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
gravity yeah one of the synergies I

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.670 
gravity yeah one of the synergies I
really<00:04:38.390> like<00:04:38.570> in<00:04:38.780> all<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.200> these<00:04:39.320> kinds<00:04:39.620> of

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
really like in all of these kinds of

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.410 
really like in all of these kinds of
shells<00:04:39.950> is<00:04:40.130> just<00:04:40.310> like<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.910> mutilate<00:04:41.300> which

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
shells is just like the mutilate which

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.520 
shells is just like the mutilate which
is<00:04:41.540> like<00:04:41.690> you're<00:04:41.810> really<00:04:42.050> good<00:04:42.200> sweeper<00:04:42.470> in

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
is like you're really good sweeper in

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.990 
is like you're really good sweeper in
the<00:04:42.620> format<00:04:42.920> and<00:04:43.130> Keeneland's<00:04:43.580> just<00:04:43.760> as<00:04:43.850> like

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
the format and Keeneland's just as like

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.940 
the format and Keeneland's just as like
in<00:04:44.150> general<00:04:44.330> combine<00:04:45.200> very<00:04:45.590> well<00:04:45.800> together

in general combine very well together

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.160 
in general combine very well together
practice<00:04:46.580> has<00:04:46.730> less<00:04:47.180> resistant<00:04:47.570> you<00:04:47.780> can<00:04:47.840> like

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
practice has less resistant you can like

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.620 
practice has less resistant you can like
mutilate<00:04:48.650> everything<00:04:49.130> then<00:04:49.520> hit<00:04:50.150> your<00:04:50.180> hit

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
mutilate everything then hit your hit
