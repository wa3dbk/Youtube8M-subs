00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.160
 Today I will review this to 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.160
 how lego so cool head where he came up 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.469
 I also speak it myself and do not pay 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.350
 attention to the fact that I have different blocks 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.539
 colors since i don't have that 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.609
 enough either so i 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.970
 I do here in this way as you can see 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.970
 here 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.099
 where almost nothing yes but if not 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.529
 you know the right moves 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:37.890
 camera and exactly cut to i can 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:40.530
 fully minutes if so here so yes 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.730
 so we are strong and here and so here 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.590
 so it looks all around 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.520
 cool again do not they do not pay for 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.280
 extraneous sounds 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.930
 and see what you need first 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.760
 make kings them if you want to write 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.550
 Be sure to comment and put 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.800
 likes if 10 likes I will 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.140
 lay out how to make such a race only 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.239
 youtube so well, let's take the first day 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.600
 the first thing to do is take here 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.610
 for this little thing and howl india here we are 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.100
 pulled and we 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.060
 Now open a text and here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.360
 we have such a stick 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.430
 again, we have nowhere to her we are not here 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.100
 nothing will come here here either 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.580
 so here too here is a dead end here just 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 quite simply 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.100
 so it remains marvelous to stand i only here 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:36.140
 here moisture and so you can see 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:38.280
 paste and gelin push harder 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.100
 so we opened one compartment 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.740
 epam choice here such here such 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.479
 Circuits so not only practically 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.250
 nowhere to put here for example here is not 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.000
 put let's close so here 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.530
 there is a compartment 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.509
 here it is this thing moves but 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.049
 look nothing happens yes if we 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.659
 move it 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.009
 since we have not inserted this 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.369
 detalka if we put it 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.850
 when our switch will be in such 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.799
 here's the situation, then we have nothing 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.440
 it turns out we should leave it here and 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.780
 we have 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.000
 this mechanism will be blocked completely 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.900
 so you need to set and give a bright 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.860
 when we are in such a position as reserve 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.250
 not convenient to insert so we insert and 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.700
 We move as we opened the shop to give 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.190
 we close it so here in this compartment here 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.580
 such a little thing is this 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.230
 you can put here so if not to become too 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.690
 here it is clearly visible by the way here 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.230
 it remains and here in this compartment 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.450
 let's increase so here and let's 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.500
 we put these here as short 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:53.020
 without this wand so we have to 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:59.360
 put this thing insert so chicken 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:01.570
 here we put in and give and but now 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.990
 will our recognize here so here 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.390
 steel and pulls whether we fell out here 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.750
 can you say precious metal 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.140
 for anything you can later and of course 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.940
