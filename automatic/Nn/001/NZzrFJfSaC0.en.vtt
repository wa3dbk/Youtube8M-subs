00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
the Octagon against a giant when you

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.500 
the Octagon against a giant when you
look<00:04:03.549> at<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.850> giant<00:04:04.269> David<00:04:04.690> has<00:04:04.900> no<00:04:05.230> chance

but<00:04:07.510> what<00:04:07.660> David<00:04:07.989> did<00:04:08.110> have<00:04:08.350> is<00:04:08.590> humility

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
but what David did have is humility

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.120 
but what David did have is humility
which<00:04:09.519> caused<00:04:09.819> him<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.739> radically<00:04:11.739> rely<00:04:12.100> on

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
which caused him to radically rely on

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.759 
which caused him to radically rely on
God<00:04:12.580> what<00:04:13.180> David<00:04:13.569> had<00:04:13.750> was<00:04:14.049> faithfulness

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
God what David had was faithfulness

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:15.990 
God what David had was faithfulness
because<00:04:14.860> he<00:04:15.069> was<00:04:15.190> faithful<00:04:15.430> in<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.730> small

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
because he was faithful in the small

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.789 
because he was faithful in the small
things<00:04:16.299> he<00:04:16.660> was<00:04:16.810> prepared<00:04:17.260> for<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.560> big

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
things he was prepared for this big

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.599 
things he was prepared for this big
thing<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.660> ultimately<00:04:19.979> David<00:04:20.979> knew<00:04:21.190> God's

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
thing and ultimately David knew God's

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.730 
thing and ultimately David knew God's
faithfulness<00:04:22.389> and<00:04:22.720> so<00:04:23.260> we<00:04:23.410> know<00:04:23.560> how<00:04:23.680> the

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740
