get<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> repressive<00:00:37.530> new<00:00:37.710> wave<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.489> was

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
get a repressive new wave because it was

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.920

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
successful album but it is part of the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:53.680 
successful album but it is part of the
hardest<00:00:42.329> album<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.660> find<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.079> vinyl

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
since it just has a white sleeve and I

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.929 
since it just has a white sleeve and I
didn't<00:05:28.009> actually<00:05:28.159> know<00:05:28.430> what<00:05:28.550> it<00:05:28.639> was<00:05:28.789> at

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.369 
didn't actually know what it was at
first<00:05:28.969> until<00:05:29.449> I<00:05:29.539> solved<00:05:29.810> a<00:05:29.870> little<00:05:30.080> label<00:05:30.199> at

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
first until I solved a little label at

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:40.939 
there's no insert or anything but I

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:42.249 
there's no insert or anything but I
thought<00:05:41.150> was<00:05:41.300> a<00:05:41.330> pretty<00:05:41.509> cool<00:05:41.840> interesting

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
thought was a pretty cool interesting

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:43.929 
thought was a pretty cool interesting
piece<00:05:42.500> I<00:05:42.830> saw<00:05:43.189> a<00:05:43.250> picture<00:05:43.460> of<00:05:43.580> this<00:05:43.729> online

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:43.939 
piece I saw a picture of this online

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:45.490 
piece I saw a picture of this online
once<00:05:44.389> before<00:05:44.599> I<00:05:44.810> think<00:05:45.110> they<00:05:45.229> were<00:05:45.319> just

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
once before I think they were just

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.010 
once before I think they were just
handed<00:05:45.800> out<00:05:45.860> to<00:05:46.150> record<00:05:47.150> stores<00:05:47.509> or<00:05:47.750> radio

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
handed out to record stores or radio

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.779 
handed out to record stores or radio
stations<00:05:48.439> to<00:05:48.590> promote<00:05:48.889> the<00:05:49.039> album<00:05:49.069> so<00:05:49.759> I

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
stations to promote the album so I

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:50.679 
stations to promote the album so I
thought<00:05:50.000> was<00:05:50.120> a<00:05:50.150> really<00:05:50.330> interesting<00:05:50.479> thing

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:50.689 
thought was a really interesting thing

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.360 
thought was a really interesting thing
to<00:05:50.900> add<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.050> my<00:05:51.199> collection<00:05:51.229> and<00:05:51.919> I<00:05:52.159> really

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
to add to my collection and I really

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.980 
to add to my collection and I really
like<00:05:52.490> Joyce<00:05:52.729> Manor<00:05:53.060> and<00:05:53.389> like<00:05:53.689> I<00:05:53.779> said<00:05:53.840> I

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
like Joyce Manor and like I said I

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.360

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
didn't have a copy of this yet so I

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:06.349
