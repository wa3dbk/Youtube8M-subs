 hello love people today but managed 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.000
 I bring you a used up video 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.679
 because you are interested in it 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.280
 what I have everything in my life 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.379
 need 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.690
 the whole thing is now from a month what 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.490
 I have used up from dm and all 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.400
 many other brands and I thought so 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.019
 just that's what interests you 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.510
 I show you and I have you 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.960
 brought a wonderful beautiful 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.910
 blue or turquoise color or baby blue 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.350
 Financial expenses aqua blue 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.320
 just write in the comments 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.210
 made of dm and it is still 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 Great I got her 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.760
 actually I stole it from me and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.070
 it is still quite and that was quite 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.050
 cheap and in the bag I have all 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.550
 I bring you a lot of great stuff in there 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.309
 Of course we would like to introduce you 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.520
 the lid of a plate and glass 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.469
 Although I am a hobby collector of the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.699
 So do not glass from the glasses 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.859
 but to go away 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.420
 because you can with the lids something completely 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.430
 I will show you that special 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.900
 Now, and I have mine here 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.799
 I already have that glass too 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.350
 used up 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.600
 There was orange juice in it and that is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.780
 unfortunately so residues in the lids 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.390
 a bit of tennessee inside though 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.340
 unappetizing but I thought hey there 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.100
 Can you combine something that you can 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.100
 Use if you do not have it all 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.350
 home and there you just stay creative 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.990
 and do something and you just take it 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.600
 this glass and put this on this 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.250
 on the lid and then hey that 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.259
 all so and then you have such a 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.780
 Coasters you all surely know 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.700
 and you can even do that here 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.740
 because there is a lid in there 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.200
 Made of cardboard is a great thing thought 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.570
 I can all imitate you 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.360
 today I brought something else and 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.189
 Although a tetrapack take that is the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.619
 wrong horse why did she pack 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.049
 yes here is exactly the tetra pak the hab 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.329
 I also used it already empty and 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.330
 I always wonder how that will stay 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.180
 all in there the white stuff and how 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.680
 is that that nothing comes in we come 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.430
 But look to the security if there 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.440
 something else in it 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.769
 I see there's something else in there 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.420
 Just drink it fast if you like it 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.010
 I thought it was great for me right now 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.019
 have you drunk out and now 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.430
 then used up for the video 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.560
 Write it in the comments and 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.590
 thumbs up is definitely one 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.780
 very great milk with 1.5 percent fat 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.870

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.340
 I already have breasts and yes is too 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.959
 I also recommend the hand 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.940

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.940

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.190
 used condoms that is totally great 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.900
 especially if you are in bed at night 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.430
 only recommended and especially the color 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.310
 that is very nice that changes 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.850
 the colors from purple to red and then too 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.650

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.260

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.010
 not seen yet there is new 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.959
 to recommend 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.579
 then I have something in the bag and 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.829
 you will not believe it 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:19.340

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.799
 Happy and a battery exactly the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.420
 I bought at dm and the sets 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.639
 Unfortunately used up but she has totally 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.549
 long held for the batteries I 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:32.600
 needed for something completely 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.099
 great something vibrates with the one 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.030
 remote control so for one 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.030
 remote Control 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.150
 yes exactly and this unfortunately empty because I 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.269
 who used it too often and was on everyone 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.769
 very expensive are the normal ones 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.250
 twice recommended in any case to 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.730
 to have 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:54.100
 Here's something else in it and one of them 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.510
 banana medi that should not be there 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.950
 Here we have something else and that is 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.020
 Christa has been like that all the time 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.110
 great the bag and we have 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.820
 here's another aluminum foil yes you 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.150
 think now definitely turn something with him 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.520
 Come on 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.800
 but yes that is used up because 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.070
 I always have a lot of salmon and that 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.410
 is still left and I have the 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.640
 yes I do not want to throw away I pack 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.780
 then always great with such a 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.040
 aluminum foil 1 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.799
 and I could do that normally now 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.870
 throw away but I thought hey me 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.620
 I'm not that I'm gonna fuck you for what 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.510
 use 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.000
 and that's when I came up with the idea 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.190
 take this coaster here and that 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.480
 just like that on the tin foil cities 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.940
 and the tin foil makes it that way 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.930
 totally great and we can really 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.210
 for Christmas Eve or something like that and use 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.150

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.510

 and that's just the one here 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.729
