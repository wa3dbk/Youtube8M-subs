an<00:00:56.160> actual<00:00:56.690> goal<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> variance<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
an actual goal with a variance the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.520 
an actual goal with a variance the
operators<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.180> annotate<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.629> problem<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
operators can annotate a problem and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
operators can annotate a problem and
then<00:01:01.920> supervisors<00:01:02.640> are<00:01:02.820> encouraged<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.449> sign

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780

off each hour this is one of the charts
on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.260> boards<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.920> shows<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.369> flow<00:01:11.580> of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
on the boards and it shows the flow of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.450 
on the boards and it shows the flow of
material<00:01:11.909> through<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> work<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

work<00:01:14.729> cell<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.630> see<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.990> display<00:01:16.259> board

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
work cell you can see the display board

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.100 
work cell you can see the display board
here<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.130> kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.580> speedometer<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
here is kind of a speedometer that the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
here is kind of a speedometer that the
operator<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.250> their<00:01:20.640> actual

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
operator can see their actual

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.539 
operator can see their actual
performance<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:22.350> their<00:01:22.500> target<00:01:22.950> performance

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
performance to their target performance

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.270 
performance to their target performance
in<00:01:23.759> real<00:01:24.390> time<00:01:24.750> these<00:01:25.560> were<00:01:25.770> typically<00:01:26.250> used

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
in real time these were typically used

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.899 
in real time these were typically used
in<00:01:27.030> their<00:01:27.270> high-volume<00:01:27.840> work<00:01:28.619> cells

another example of a visual management

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.149 
another example of a visual management
system<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.090> TPM<00:01:36.750> board<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.530> use<00:01:37.829> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
system is the TPM board that they use to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.499 
system is the TPM board that they use to
track<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.640> maintenance<00:01:39.149> of<00:01:39.360> their

track the maintenance of their
heat-treat<00:01:40.140> you'll<00:01:40.710> notice<00:01:41.039> they<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
heat-treat you'll notice they have a

checklist that are filled out by the
operator<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.390> an<00:01:48.539> example<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.500> visual

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
operator this is an example of visual

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.770 
operator this is an example of visual
management<00:01:50.220> system<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:51.179> use<00:01:51.210> for

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
management system that they use for

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.789 
management system that they use for

their daily production schedule each
work<00:01:56.100> cell<00:01:56.399> had<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.939> standardized<00:01:57.569> work

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
work cell had the standardized work

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.950 
work cell had the standardized work
posted<00:01:58.679> in<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.920> very<00:01:59.130> visual<00:01:59.640> manner<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
posted in a very visual manner so the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.169 
posted in a very visual manner so the
operator<00:02:01.439> knew<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> key<00:02:02.130> aspects<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.909> job

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
operator knew the key aspects of the job

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.100 
operator knew the key aspects of the job
in<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:05.159> receiving<00:02:05.789> area<00:02:06.149> they've<00:02:06.539> marked<00:02:06.869> off

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
in the receiving area they've marked off

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.130 
in the receiving area they've marked off
an<00:02:07.470> area<00:02:07.709> for<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> problem<00:02:08.580> inventory<00:02:09.569> so

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
an area for the problem inventory so

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.860 
an area for the problem inventory so
