00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
cheekbone and the chin and very often in

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.569 
cheekbone and the chin and very often in
caricatures<00:01:36.600> you'll<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> face<00:01:38.220> is

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
caricatures you'll see that the face is

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.390 
caricatures you'll see that the face is
usually<00:01:39.420> elongated<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.799> give<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> more

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the ear and the noses are usually very

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.960 
the ear and the noses are usually very
simple<00:01:51.630> lines<00:01:52.189> it<00:01:53.189> could<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> matter

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
simple lines it could just be a matter

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.300 
simple lines it could just be a matter
of<00:01:54.149> three<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:54.899> lines<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.680> could<00:01:55.860> define

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
of three little lines that could define

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.289 
of three little lines that could define
the<00:01:56.549> nose<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:58.280> some<00:01:59.280> little<00:01:59.579> semi<00:01:59.820> circles
