00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
on track I don't think it's any secret

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.650

that America is now 16 trillion dollars
in<00:00:21.900> debt<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.500> believe<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> heard<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> news

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
in debt I believe I heard on the news

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.429 
in debt I believe I heard on the news
that<00:00:24.740> that's<00:00:25.740> probably<00:00:26.250> about<00:00:27.439> 62,000

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
that that's probably about 62,000

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.510 
that that's probably about 62,000
dollars<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.070> debt<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:29.699> each<00:00:30.320> American<00:00:31.520> so

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
dollars of debt for each American so

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.370 
dollars of debt for each American so
that's<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.880> take<00:00:33.030> us<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.270> while<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.809> pay

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
that's going to take us a while to pay

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.490 
that's going to take us a while to pay
that<00:00:34.590> off<00:00:34.800> from<00:00:35.340> year<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> year<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.230> that

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that off from year to year and then that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.920 
that off from year to year and then that
doesn't<00:00:37.800> include<00:00:37.890> any<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> amount<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
doesn't include any of the amount of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.619 
doesn't include any of the amount of
interest<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.770> owe<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.430> money<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
interest that we owe on that money I

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.350 
interest that we owe on that money I
think<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> average<00:00:43.500> income<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.879> America<00:00:45.239> was

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
think the average income and America was

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.690 
think the average income and America was
about<00:00:45.600> fifty<00:00:45.989> thousand<00:00:46.469> dollars<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.039> it's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
about fifty thousand dollars so it's

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.130 
about fifty thousand dollars so it's
going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> take<00:00:48.149> quite<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> while<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
going to take quite a while to get that

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.799 
going to take quite a while to get that
paid<00:00:49.379> off<00:00:49.410> how<00:00:50.399> our<00:00:50.730> Capitol<00:00:51.660> Hill

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
paid off how our Capitol Hill

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.650 
paid off how our Capitol Hill
legislators<00:00:52.699> allowed<00:00:53.699> our<00:00:53.940> country<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.480> get

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
legislators allowed our country to get

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.220 
legislators allowed our country to get
so<00:00:54.930> far<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.410> debt<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.370> unborn<00:00:57.360> children

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
so far in debt that unborn children

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.060 
so far in debt that unborn children
today<00:00:59.210> will<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.539> pay<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.930> off<00:01:01.140> once<00:01:01.859> they

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
today will have to pay it off once they

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.149 
today will have to pay it off once they
are<00:01:02.100> conceived<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.120> born<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> future<00:01:04.159> is

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
are conceived and born in the future is

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.240 
are conceived and born in the future is
beyond<00:01:05.700> me<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:07.890> need<00:01:08.010> some

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
beyond me I think we really need some

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.320 
beyond me I think we really need some
reform<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.909> Capitol<00:01:09.420> Hill<00:01:10.850> they're<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:11.880> not

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
reform on Capitol Hill they're just not

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.080 
reform on Capitol Hill they're just not
getting<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> job<00:01:12.990> done<00:01:13.020> up<00:01:13.439> there<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:14.520> it

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
getting the job done up there it it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.300 
getting the job done up there it it
seems<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.140> are<00:01:16.409> sitting<00:01:17.040> around

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
seems like they just are sitting around

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.130 
seems like they just are sitting around
twiddling<00:01:17.640> their<00:01:18.030> thumbs<00:01:18.090> maybe<00:01:18.780> passing

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
twiddling their thumbs maybe passing

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.240 
twiddling their thumbs maybe passing
flag<00:01:19.770> day<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.270> know<00:01:21.530> champagne<00:01:22.530> week<00:01:22.950> or

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
flag day or you know champagne week or

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.240 
flag day or you know champagne week or
whatever<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.900> we're<00:01:25.470> sitting<00:01:25.799> there<00:01:25.950> paying

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
whatever and we're sitting there paying

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.280 
whatever and we're sitting there paying
their<00:01:26.490> salaries<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.990> know<00:01:28.110> their

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
their salaries and you know their

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380 
their salaries and you know their
pensions<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.979> we're<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:29.939> getting<00:01:30.150> any

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
pensions and we're just not getting any

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
pensions and we're just not getting any
bang<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> buck<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.799> think<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.400> got<00:01:32.430> to

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
bang for the buck so I think we got to

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.520 
bang for the buck so I think we got to
really<00:01:32.909> look<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
really look at now that we have the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.999 
really look at now that we have the
internet<00:01:34.920> online<00:01:36.049> you<00:01:37.049> know<00:01:37.170> our<00:01:37.560> country<00:01:37.950> is

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
internet online you know our country is

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.710 
internet online you know our country is
vastly<00:01:38.430> different<00:01:38.579> from<00:01:38.970> what<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.240> was<00:01:39.329> back

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
vastly different from what it was back

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.850 
vastly different from what it was back
in<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> 1700s<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:42.409> maybe<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.560> should<00:01:43.740> be

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
in the 1700s so maybe we should be

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.880 
in the 1700s so maybe we should be
looking<00:01:43.979> at<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.399> know<00:01:44.520> forming<00:01:45.000> our<00:01:45.119> own

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
looking at you know forming our own

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.520 
looking at you know forming our own
policies<00:01:46.970> online<00:01:47.970> do<00:01:48.840> away<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.110> some<00:01:49.439> of

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
policies online do away with some of

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.620 
policies online do away with some of
those<00:01:49.619> legislators<00:01:50.430> because<00:01:50.579> they<00:01:50.850> they

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
those legislators because they they

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080 
those legislators because they they
really<00:01:51.990> aren't<00:01:52.170> worth<00:01:52.380> their<00:01:52.649> their<00:01:53.250> salary<00:01:54.000> I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
really aren't worth their their salary I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.219 
really aren't worth their their salary I
don't<00:01:54.149> believe<00:01:55.430> another<00:01:56.430> thing<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.229> also

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
don't believe another thing I also

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.569 
don't believe another thing I also
believe<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.100> probably<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.520> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
believe and this is probably going to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.859 
believe and this is probably going to
make<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.020> American<00:02:01.020> Civil<00:02:01.200> Liberties<00:02:01.350> Union

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
make the American Civil Liberties Union

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.039 
make the American Civil Liberties Union
upset<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.890> also<00:02:05.040> believe<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.869> do

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
upset but I also believe that if you do

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.070 
upset but I also believe that if you do
not<00:02:07.200> pay<00:02:07.530> any<00:02:07.860> federal<00:02:08.310> income

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
not pay any federal income

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.920

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
elections now I I think and there was a

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.580 
elections now I I think and there was a
time<00:02:17.390> when<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.630> was<00:02:17.870> probably<00:02:18.170> part<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.440> that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
time when I was probably part of that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.620 
time when I was probably part of that
forty<00:02:18.890> seven<00:02:19.130> percent<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.610> don't<00:02:19.790> hold<00:02:20.360> any

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
animosity towards people that are in

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.670 
animosity towards people that are in
that<00:02:22.550> forty<00:02:23.030> seven<00:02:23.300> percent<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:24.140> really<00:02:24.410> the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
that forty seven percent it's really the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.010 
that forty seven percent it's really the
government<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.820> made<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.330> rule<00:02:26.540> up<00:02:26.810> that

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.880 
well I think that's wrong we should all
be<00:02:31.730> paying<00:02:32.300> probably<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:33.140> know<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.290> flat<00:02:33.620> tax

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
that's fair say ten percent that way

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.820 
that's fair say ten percent that way
everybody<00:02:38.330> would<00:02:38.720> be<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.900> stakeholder<00:02:39.650> and

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
everybody would be a stakeholder and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.740
