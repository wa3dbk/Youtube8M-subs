 say that is a thesis that one because 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.610
 Four different cheeses used 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.860
 for this dish not always the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.960

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.570

 even in companies of the strong 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.629
 maybe you have a taste in your own taste 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.390
 lasagne glare prefers freshness 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.240
 parsley salt pepper and something 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.610
 olive oil and if you are interested 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.860
 how to prepare this dish 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.360
 then just stay with it I start 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.570
 already ran to the same part 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:26.740
 cut and had the little here 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.530
 forge and grated ingredients here the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.440
 parsley in such small pieces always 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.049
 petra sissy here our 1 and 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.580
 I have small thin slices of garlic 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.960
 relatively finely chopped and because 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.770
 parmesan I have planed and 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.850
 the cross as well as our main actor 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.360
 are I in 23 millimeter-thin 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.650
 cut slices and do it now 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.979
 We continue with our reportage to you 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.920
 instead enzos got lasagne for the 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.430
 let vegetables go and go with it 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.700
 our war red sauce two cups 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.209
 ricotta 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.170
 put the exact ingredient list on 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.370
 gram exactly in the description now 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.370
 the three come alone 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:33.370
 Now the parsley comes in as 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.370
 what ingredient comes to be the garlic 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:45.440
 now we know with salt and 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:50.690
 pepper now a little bit 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:54.739
 olive oil and last but not least something with 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.180
 date normal good hit in and that 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.180
 is now thoroughly spoiled 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.220
 Such a thing would be the perfect one now 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:14.329
 I find consistency as flows 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.680
 bit but has also stood then 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.660
 Get ready and then we can 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.730
 redeveloped with the layering dallas 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.620
 keep going 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.000
 put some olive oil in the casserole dish and 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.530
 I understand that now with the brush 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.290
 on the distribute 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.329
 when we get something from the 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.700
 Spread the breadcrumbs a bit and 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.959
 shake the shape back and forth a bit 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.959
 as it is distributed in the cinema 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.569
 then it looks like the time with a 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:57.810
 coat zucchini 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:02.220
 now a situation that is the play 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:09.450
 Down we distribute our sauce there 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:14.690
 on top of it what the last time 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.690
 even the lasagna bleeding evenly 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:21.590
 and now cheese goes with mozzarella 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:39.560
 something parmesan cheese and from the war comes 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:48.770
 also a little something on it 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:51.120
 it will be a little salt a bit pepper 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:57.990
 and on it goes with the next situation 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:03.300
 zucchini now that his leaves what 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:10.919
 to be our sauce on it I would 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:21.319
 evenly distributed, it still goes 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:21.319
 cheese that was parmesan cheese could 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.349
 and a few slices of the verdict 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:45.080
 there we make it a noodling on it 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:50.840
 I reiterate the now distribute the 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:55.190
 legal too little so the last location 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:59.620
 it would have to do with computers 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.620
 which of course believes the whole quite 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:08.680
 so well the cracks branched off 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.400
 running 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:16.870
 Preheat oven of course forgotten 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.870
 now comes the legal cheese on it 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.170
 pretty evenly totally sick 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:35.250
 So the mozzarella must own it 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:42.810
 spread then there is plenty of cheese 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:48.030
 on it again what of the parallel 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:51.030
 more semmelbrösel better said it does 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:58.560
 a nice crust to complete it 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:07:01.460
 a little olive oil and now it comes 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.320
 in the oven at 180 degrees 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.780
 I think for half an hour 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:11.610
 and if it's strategic, I'll show you 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:13.620
 the result so ours are done 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:17.280
 let go after about one 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:19.970
 three quarters of an hour he was 160 170 degrees 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.370
 the ovens are really great 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.870
 different in heating power me 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.300
 I forgot to mention 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.789
 we have to do some water in there like that 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.760
 a quarter to half a liter and now 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:34.590
 Let it cool down and then let it cool 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.400
 also cut back better 14 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.130
 minutes 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.979
 so our vegetable lasagne look like me 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.080
 so that can be seen 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:45.840
 wonderful and now I wish you 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.950
 Good luck cooking and cooking 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:53.270
 of course good appetite 

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.270
 bye until next time
