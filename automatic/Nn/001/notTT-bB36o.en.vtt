00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.320
 good to all I'm older and good today 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.009
 I bring you a tutorial in which he explained 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.019
 how to solve the rubik cube with the 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.030
 beginner method which is the most 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.410
 simple for those who want to learn and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.250
 Well, I leave that background to you in the background 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.510
 that is from a friend valdo and has a 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.550
 channel that would put description are 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.400
 all remy or the copy that the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.770
 copyright does not have 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:34.840
 well let's disarm the cuvillo is 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.840
 oiled that goes well 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.760
 Well let's say you are already deforming 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.570
 rubin and good I always like to start 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.579
 me in the face white machine 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.820
 want as physics has drawing and 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.420
 always serves as a guide and good first 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.320
 step would be to make a cross worth a cross 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.090
 in which the colors of 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.490
 every decade 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.039
 with the middle of the other is white 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.710
 blue because this the blue medium and here 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:19.250
 it would be white red white white orange 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.079
 because this means points and this white 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.270
 green because half green and this white 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.920
 red because it gave me error 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.290
 and good 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.259
 we look for any part of the middle of the 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.159
 first face for example is white and 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.730
 green and it's white and green would go fair 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.670
 here 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.660
 then to place that piece look 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.640
 of the first face and to come down with that the 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.830
 first face, I think a little 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.050
 use logic simply starting 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.630
 of the first face the next thing would be if 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.240
 we have the algorithms that had to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.330
 learn but well let's put the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.370
 green and white right here is worth then 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.020
 we would stay 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.020
 we turn is like this 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.039
 Y 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.360
 to upload it is here 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.660
 we turn 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.370
 and we already have problems that we already have 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.180
 as a straight line one part to the other 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.260
 cross and good now we look for one for the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.500
 red white-red the search is to answer 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:32.350
 here we need to place white red 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.510
 here so what we would do would be and 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.720
 this one has to go here we would lower it 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.720
 here 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.230
 we rotate we turn and from here up the 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.960
 angina do not worry if you observe 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.590
 then here we would do to place this 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.590
 there 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.960
 and the rise to the middle has moved to 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.820
 do this step but I sure won it and already 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.810
 we have 123 we are missing the last one or I say 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.710
 I have made the matter of plastic to 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:18.190
 practice it because using logic 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:23.580
 as it really throws up but we have 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.580
 to take it out of place 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.780
 in fact already 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:50.450
 now it would touch the original that a 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.010
 poquillo more complicated and good we look for 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.210
 a corner is in this case it would be the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.540
 white and green 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.530
 I'm going to look for work 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.530
 white and green 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:13.440
 the anti green red red green green pink 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.440
 we look for green white and green red 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.810
 up then first all 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.810
 we work here 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:38.470
 and top right you can do the 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:43.510
 steps and it 's here we could like that and 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.120
 the friends would already be placed and now 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:50.310
 let's see a method like lace 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.310
 low ease done this 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.400
 as I keep saying this is a matter of 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.330
 use the logic let's go with another 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:08.700
 corner and blue red and blue I'm going to put 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.700
 another music is another nation that is already 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:19.140
 we look for red and white blue where they would go 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.140
 here red blue and white 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:32.729
 and this would be like that 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:32.729
 well and it would be delivered 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:49.510
 erden cancer that would be death the voice 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:52.150
 and we were the glasses, husband, that's what 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.070
 I say to get that face, maybe 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.170
 I tried seem silly 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.840
 many, many times and has also 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:07.740
 counted because neither are removed 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:10.740
 now white and here we can be the 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.740
 lever 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.150
 You can watch the video to see the steps 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.420
 and well we have the last half of 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:35.380
 talk we have down here then the 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:39.820
 we place just below this one 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:41.980
 and we rotate in separate would be here the 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:46.350
 we change the line 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:52.470
 and now you have done me 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:54.690
 you are here because if we move they are not 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:07:01.950
 want any understand me then 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:04.950
 would be here the program here we had and 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:11.910
 we would only have the same patient 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:17.540
 would be the typical lace as well as would be the 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:20.750
 another and the tiramisu are similar 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:24.690
 then we also have the first face 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:28.680
 and with the means of taxes for the 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:32.060
 next step would be the complete medium 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.060
 in the middle google 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.750
 I do it in the second part I put 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.750
 here a lot of above 

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:43.610
 a link that went to the next video like this 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.290
 I suppose several parts in four parts 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.120
 it's fine and good we continue with the 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:52.210
 next part the second only makes 

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.210
 click and we pass the favorites and they do
