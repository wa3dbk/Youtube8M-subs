mean<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.220> good<00:01:08.400> mechanic<00:01:08.580> generally<00:01:09.299> doesn't

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
mean a good mechanic generally doesn't

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.270 
mean a good mechanic generally doesn't
even<00:01:09.780> need<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> little<00:01:10.290> sizes<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.830> don't<00:01:11.070> think

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
even need a little sizes I don't think

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.810 
even need a little sizes I don't think
I'm<00:01:12.090> not<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> good<00:01:12.570> mechanic<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.799> every<00:01:14.400> socket

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
I'm not a good mechanic so every socket

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.999 
I'm not a good mechanic so every socket
you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:14.909> imagine<00:01:15.299> also<00:01:16.200> has<00:01:16.439> little<00:01:16.740> baby

sue a year period you need every single
one<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.840> these<00:01:49.020> tools<00:01:49.290> you're<00:01:49.799> probably<00:01:50.040> not

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
one of these tools you're probably not

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.969 
one of these tools you're probably not
gonna<00:01:50.640> get<00:01:50.939> gone<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.590> know<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:52.860> take

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
gonna get gone so you know don't take

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.350 
gonna get gone so you know don't take
advantage<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.490> stuff<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:53.970> definitely

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
advantage of that stuff but definitely

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.420 
advantage of that stuff but definitely
has<00:01:54.450> some<00:01:54.630> extra<00:01:55.049> design

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
has some extra design

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.180 
has some extra design
foregrip<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:56.780> also<00:01:56.930> has<00:01:57.230> like<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.950> proto

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
foregrip and it also has like the proto

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.910 
foregrip and it also has like the proto
style<00:01:58.580> grip<00:01:58.970> up<00:01:59.150> here<00:01:59.420> and<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.440> think<00:02:00.740> they<00:02:00.860> were

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
style grip up here and I think they were

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.620 
style grip up here and I think they were
holding<00:02:01.130> like<00:02:01.310> an<00:02:01.430> engine<00:02:01.820> just<00:02:01.970> out<00:02:02.150> for<00:02:02.300> one

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
holding like an engine just out for one

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.560 
holding like an engine just out for one
bit<00:02:03.440> or<00:02:03.710> one<00:02:04.130> wrench<00:02:04.550> which<00:02:04.760> is<00:02:04.910> pretty<00:02:05.060> cool<00:02:05.300> I

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
bit or one wrench which is pretty cool I

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.940 
bit or one wrench which is pretty cool I
