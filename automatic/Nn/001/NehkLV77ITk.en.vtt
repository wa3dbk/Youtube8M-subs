00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
 Let's say you're walking down the street 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.280
 and someone like this asks you: 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.960
 "Fast - 4792 is it 3? 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.530
 It `s urgent! Tell me quickly! " 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.760
 But you already know a little trick for divisibility of 3. 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.670
 You will just collect the numbers of the number 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.810
 and if the sum is divided by 3, 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.590
 so the number itself is divided into 3. 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.200
 Let's see: 4 + 7 + 9 + 2 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.680
 11 plus 9 is 20, plus 2, makes 22. 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.530
 22 is not divisible by 3. 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.920
 You can even collect the digits of this: 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.360
 2 + 2 is 4. This is obviously not divisible by 3. 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.180
 That is, the given number is not divisible by 3. 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.750
 Almost without thinking about answering the question! 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.970
 But then you keep going 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.730
 and somebody asks: "Quick, quick!" 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.810
 does it share 3? " 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.710
 You apply the same tactic. 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.500
 How much is 3 + 8 + 6 + 8 + 0 + 2? 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.850
 3 plus 8 is 11, plus 6 is 17, 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.350
 plus 8 is 25, plus 2 is 27. 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.780
 Well, 27 is divided into 3. 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.610
 We can also get the figures at 27. 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.390
 2 + 7 = 9. Deliver on 3. 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.620
 Therefore, the given number is divided by 3. 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.340
 Here's your reason for pride. 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.230
 Without much trouble, you managed to help two strangers! 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.360
 He told them if their numbers were divided into 3. 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.100
 And it's very fast! 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.510
 But they have doubts ... 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.630
 You do not know WHY this rule works. 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.640
 You just know it. 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.600
 But to think about why he works every time. 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.410
 To do this, let's take a random number. 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.390
 But that could be done for any number. 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.910
 But I do not want to be hollow, 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.290
 just to see that it's pretty clear what's going on here. 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.920
 The number we will use is 498. 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.440
 In this situation, I can literally use every number. 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.450
 And to see why this little trick works, 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.020
 we just have to convert 498. 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.350
 4 is in place of the hundreds, so 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.740
 we can write it as 4 times 100. 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.110
 Or 4 in 100 is equal to 4 in (1 + 99). 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.530
 This is the quadruple. 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.910
 400, which is equal to 4 times 100, 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.220
 which is the same as 4 in (1 + 99). 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.940
 And the small number here is to present this 100 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.190
 like '1 plus something divided by 3'. 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.130
 99 is divided into 3. 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.050
 If I had more figures here, it could be 999, 9999 - 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.630
 they are all divided into 3. 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.670
 And this explains why the same method can be applied to the divisibility of 9, 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.690
 because they are also divided into 9. 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.990
 So that's what the quadruple stands for hundreds. 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.270
 This is 9 instead of 90. 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.250
 Or 9 times 10 or 9 in (1 + 9). 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.780
 Finally, this is 8. It is in place of the units. 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.320
 8 times 1 or just write '+ 8'. 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.800
 Now we can uncover brackets. 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.560
 This is 4 by 1, plus 4 by 99. 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.160
 That is, 4 plus (4 in 99). 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.670
 Let me write it this way. I will write... 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.160
 Actually, I write it first so '4 plus (4 in 99)'. 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.960
 We do the same here. 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.290
 It's the same as plus 9 - 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:25.820
 to do this in cyclamen - plus 9, plus 9 in 9. 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.080
 And finally we have this 8 here. 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.440
 And now I can rearrange all this. 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.610
 These statements here: 4 at 99 and 9 at 9, 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.140
 I can write them here - 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.190
 4 by 99 - I write it with a slightly different designation - 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.040
 plus 9 times 9, these are these two expressions. 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:54.010
 And then we have 4 plus 9 plus 8. 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.990
 So, can we tell if this is divided into 3? 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.880
 These expressions, the first two expressions are definitely divided into 3. 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.010
 This is divided into 3, as 99 is divided into 3, 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.640
 whatever we already have here. 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.050
 There is no need to look here. 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.870
 This is divided into 3, so if we multiply it, 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.340
 it will continue to divide to 3. 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.550
 This is divided into 3, so if we multiply it, 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.410
 the result will also be divided into 3. 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.300
 If you collect two expressions that are divided into 3, 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.060
 the result will also be divided into 3, 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.290
 so all this will be divided into 3. 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.820
 And if you have more digits here, you can do the same thing. 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.810
 Instead of 1 plus 99, you will have 1 plus 999, 1 plus 9999, and so on. 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.480
 So the only thing you have to worry about, 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.990
 is this part here. 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.770
 You have to ask yourself what we need, 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.440
 to make the whole of 3. 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.440
 This part is divided into 3, 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.050
 then in order for the whole divisible to 3, 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.780
 this should also be divided into 3. 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.790
 But what is it here? 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.550
 These are just our initial figures. 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.420
 498, 4 and 9 and 8. 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.340
 We just have to make sure, 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.220
 that their sum is divisible at 3.
