welcome back to the building tips even
the<00:00:11.309> cow<00:00:11.490> wants<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.030> watch<00:00:12.210> today<00:00:12.570> today<00:00:13.230> we're

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
the cow wants to watch today today we're

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.080 
the cow wants to watch today today we're
going<00:00:13.470> over<00:00:13.559> some<00:00:13.800> pathways<00:00:14.010> a<00:00:14.250> long<00:00:14.639> time<00:00:14.910> ago

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
going over some pathways a long time ago

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.609 
going over some pathways a long time ago
I<00:00:15.120> did<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.389> building<00:00:15.660> tips<00:00:15.840> on<00:00:15.990> pathways<00:00:16.439> but

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
I did a building tips on pathways but

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.019 
I did a building tips on pathways but
we're<00:00:16.770> gonna<00:00:16.890> revisit<00:00:17.189> it<00:00:17.490> today<00:00:17.700> because<00:00:17.849> I

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
we're gonna revisit it today because I

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.269 
we're gonna revisit it today because I
have<00:00:18.210> become<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.509> much<00:00:18.779> better<00:00:18.960> builder<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.529> so

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
have become a much better builder and so

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.890 
have become a much better builder and so
we're<00:00:20.400> just<00:00:20.430> gonna<00:00:20.640> go<00:00:20.820> ahead<00:00:20.939> here<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.360> make

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
we're just gonna go ahead here and make

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.389 
we're just gonna go ahead here and make
some<00:00:21.930> even<00:00:22.410> better<00:00:22.619> pathways<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.310> you

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:23.399 
some even better pathways so if you

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:24.830 
some even better pathways so if you
enjoyed<00:00:23.669> today's<00:00:23.880> episode<00:00:23.939> please<00:00:24.270> leave<00:00:24.720> a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
going here we go we're gonna start with

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.620 
going here we go we're gonna start with
a<00:00:32.279> stone<00:00:32.489> pathway<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.940> tried<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.239> cover<00:00:33.360> three

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
a stone pathway I tried to cover three

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.030 
a stone pathway I tried to cover three
different<00:00:33.870> themes<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.140> got<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:34.500> two<00:00:34.800> three

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
different themes we got one two three

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.000 
different themes we got one two three
four<00:00:35.460> five<00:00:35.940> six<00:00:36.359> seven<00:00:36.929> eight<00:00:37.140> nine<00:00:37.170> ten

four five six seven eight nine ten

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.549 
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven<00:00:38.730> when<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.059> go<00:00:39.269> three<00:00:39.809> blocks<00:00:40.079> out<00:00:40.289> and

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
eleven when I go three blocks out and

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.369 
eleven when I go three blocks out and
one<00:00:40.859> two<00:00:41.160> three<00:00:41.190> four<00:00:42.030> five<00:00:42.329> six<00:00:42.690> seven<00:00:43.019> eight

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
one two three four five six seven eight

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.439 
one two three four five six seven eight
nine<00:00:43.440> ten<00:00:44.160> eleven<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> pattern<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.329> this

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
nine ten eleven now the pattern for this

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.349 
nine ten eleven now the pattern for this
is<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:46.199> to<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.550> very<00:00:47.550> simple<00:00:47.940> stone

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
is going to be a very simple stone

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.060 
is going to be a very simple stone
walkway<00:00:48.780> actually<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.739> complex

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
walkway actually it's it's more complex

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.130 
walkway actually it's it's more complex
than<00:00:50.219> um<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:51.179> of<00:00:51.269> my<00:00:51.300> stone<00:00:51.600> walkways<00:00:51.960> have

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
than um some of my stone walkways have

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.959 
than um some of my stone walkways have
been<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.710> my<00:00:52.800> dogs<00:00:53.010> bark<00:00:53.339> and<00:00:53.429> that's<00:00:53.579> really

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
been not my dogs bark and that's really

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.009 
been not my dogs bark and that's really
annoying<00:00:54.149> because<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.600> weren't<00:00:54.719> barking

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
annoying because they weren't barking

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:55.880 
annoying because they weren't barking
like<00:00:55.140> ten<00:00:55.289> seconds<00:00:55.530> ago

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
like ten seconds ago

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.200 
like ten seconds ago
but<00:00:56.280> anyways<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.609> just<00:00:56.640> gonna<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> stone

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
but anyways it's just gonna be a stone

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.279 
but anyways it's just gonna be a stone
pathway<00:00:57.629> we're<00:00:57.749> gonna<00:00:57.839> use<00:00:58.019> three<00:00:58.230> different

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
pathway we're gonna use three different

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.989 
pathway we're gonna use three different
types<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.769> stone<00:00:58.920> brick<00:00:59.159> we<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.429> stone<00:00:59.760> brick

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999 
types of stone brick we have stone brick

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.639 
types of stone brick we have stone brick
mossy<00:01:00.659> stone<00:01:00.839> brick<00:01:01.019> and<00:01:01.199> cracked<00:01:01.440> stone

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
mossy stone brick and cracked stone

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.809 
mossy stone brick and cracked stone
brick<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.010> we're<00:01:02.100> gonna<00:01:02.190> use<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.640> kind

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:02.819 
brick and we're gonna use that to kind

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:05.420 
brick and we're gonna use that to kind
of<00:01:02.969> differentiate<00:01:03.629> our<00:01:04.409> things<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.280> that's

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
of differentiate our things so that's

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.070 
of differentiate our things so that's
what<00:01:05.610> we're<00:01:05.700> gonna<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.570> little<00:01:06.780> square

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
what we're gonna have one little square

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.200 
what we're gonna have one little square
right<00:01:07.110> there<00:01:07.259> then<00:01:07.950> we're<00:01:08.040> gonna<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.759> row

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
right there then we're gonna have a row

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.350 
right there then we're gonna have a row
of<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.630> kind<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.899> normal

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
of just kind of normal

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.520 
of just kind of normal
normal<00:01:12.360> blocks<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.439> we're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
normal blocks like that and then we're

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.990 
normal blocks like that and then we're
gonna<00:01:13.619> start<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.040> pattern<00:01:14.369> all<00:01:14.549> over<00:01:14.909> again

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
gonna start that pattern all over again

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.429 
gonna start that pattern all over again
and<00:01:15.329> we're<00:01:15.540> gonna<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.930> for<00:01:16.140> as<00:01:16.229> long<00:01:16.380> as

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
and we're gonna do that for as long as

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.080 
and we're gonna do that for as long as
we<00:01:16.649> need<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> pathway<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.280> go<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.939> I'm<00:01:18.000> gonna

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
we need the pathway to go so I'm gonna

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.399 
we need the pathway to go so I'm gonna
do<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.299> off<00:01:18.390> camera<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.869> show<00:01:19.079> you<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
do that off camera and show you what it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.139 
do that off camera and show you what it
looks<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.740> what<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.490> end<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
looks like what you end up with is a

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.730 
looks like what you end up with is a
nice<00:01:21.450> looking<00:01:21.750> pathway<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.710> course

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
nice looking pathway like this of course

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.440 
nice looking pathway like this of course
you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.159> make<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> as<00:01:23.549> long<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.210> need<00:01:24.360> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
you can make it as long as you need it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.690 
you can make it as long as you need it
to<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:25.469> there<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.799> go<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.369> something

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
to be but there you go just something

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.340 
to be but there you go just something
nice<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> simple<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.600> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
nice and simple like that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.139 
nice and simple like that
the<00:01:28.619> second<00:01:29.159> design<00:01:29.399> here<00:01:29.640> incorporates<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
the second design here incorporates a

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.459 
the second design here incorporates a
lot<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.329> wood<00:01:30.600> because<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.020> wanted<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.290> little

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
lot of wood because I wanted a little

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.289 
lot of wood because I wanted a little
bit<00:01:31.560> contrast<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.039> that<00:01:32.070> stone<00:01:32.369> pathway<00:01:32.850> so

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
bit contrast to that stone pathway so

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.639 
bit contrast to that stone pathway so
we're<00:01:33.539> gonna<00:01:33.659> start<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.140> hole<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
we're gonna start with a hole here and

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.440 
we're gonna start with a hole here and
this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.920> five<00:01:35.219> blocks<00:01:35.640> wide<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.360> gonna

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this is five blocks wide and it's gonna

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
this is five blocks wide and it's gonna
be<00:01:36.719> as<00:01:36.810> long<00:01:37.020> obviously<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.829> need<00:01:37.979> your

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
be as long obviously as you need your

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.889 
be as long obviously as you need your
pathway<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.180> our<00:01:39.240> pattern<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
pathway to be but our pattern here is

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.319 
pathway to be but our pattern here is
simply<00:01:40.140> going<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.939> we're<00:01:41.939> gonna<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.210> some

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
simply going to be we're gonna have some

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.999 
simply going to be we're gonna have some
oak<00:01:42.479> wood<00:01:42.689> there<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.500> oak<00:01:43.649> wood<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> don't

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
oak wood there is that oak wood I don't

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.410 
oak wood there is that oak wood I don't
even<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.189> oak<00:01:44.430> well<00:01:44.640> yeah<00:01:44.759> then<00:01:44.969> we<00:01:45.060> got<00:01:45.180> dark

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
even know oak well yeah then we got dark

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.789 
even know oak well yeah then we got dark
wood<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> middle<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.469> then<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.680> have

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
wood down the middle and then we have

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
wood down the middle and then we have
our<00:01:46.890> normal<00:01:47.100> oak<00:01:47.310> wood<00:01:47.460> here<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.969> the<00:01:48.329> sides

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
our normal oak wood here on the sides

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.569 
our normal oak wood here on the sides
we're<00:01:48.750> gonna<00:01:48.840> start<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.289> log<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.159> every

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
we're gonna start with a log and every

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.310 
we're gonna start with a log and every
other<00:01:50.700> block<00:01:51.000> we're<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.509> place<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.990> dark

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
other block we're going to place a dark

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.289 
other block we're going to place a dark
oak<00:01:52.500> wood<00:01:52.530> log<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.850> this

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
oak wood log just like this

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.139 
oak wood log just like this
oopsies<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.729> between<00:01:57.030> each

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
oopsies like that and in between each

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.459 
oopsies like that and in between each
one<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.390> those<00:01:57.479> we're<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> place<00:01:58.200> oak

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
one of those we're going to place oak

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.010 
one of those we're going to place oak
stairs<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.909> that's<00:02:00.450> gonna<00:02:00.659> go<00:02:00.810> all

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
stairs like this and that's gonna go all

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.179 
stairs like this and that's gonna go all
the<00:02:01.049> way<00:02:01.200> down<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> entire<00:02:01.679> thing<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:01.979> then

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the way down the entire thing and then

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.090 
the way down the entire thing and then
every<00:02:02.490> other<00:02:02.609> log<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.149> are<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.570> place<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
every other log you are going to place a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.700 
every other log you are going to place a
stone<00:02:05.100> fence<00:02:05.369> with<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.329> torch<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.840> top<00:02:07.049> so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
stone fence with a torch on top so

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.080 
stone fence with a torch on top so
you're<00:02:08.070> just<00:02:08.130> gonna<00:02:08.250> continue<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.880> down

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you're just gonna continue that down

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.850 
you're just gonna continue that down
there<00:02:09.330> until<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.990> completed<00:02:10.380> pathway

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
there until you have a completed pathway

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.130 
there until you have a completed pathway
our<00:02:11.070> final<00:02:11.670> pathway<00:02:11.910> design<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.690> today<00:02:12.960> is

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
our final pathway design for today is

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.180 
our final pathway design for today is
going<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.440> use<00:02:13.680> sandstone<00:02:14.370> again<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.700> was<00:02:14.910> just

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
going to use sandstone again I was just

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.650 
going to use sandstone again I was just
to<00:02:15.370> get<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.670> variation<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.570> different

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
to get a variation of different

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.060 
to get a variation of different
materials<00:02:17.320> here<00:02:17.470> know<00:02:17.590> what<00:02:17.710> we're<00:02:17.800> gonna<00:02:17.890> do

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
materials here know what we're gonna do

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.470 
materials here know what we're gonna do
is<00:02:18.190> we're<00:02:18.280> gonna<00:02:18.340> have<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.550> hole<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:19.030> four

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
is we're gonna have a hole that is four

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.120 
is we're gonna have a hole that is four
wide<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.960> of<00:02:20.290> course<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.620> length<00:02:20.770> again<00:02:21.010> is

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
wide and of course the length again is

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.980 
wide and of course the length again is
determined<00:02:21.580> by<00:02:21.730> however<00:02:22.390> long<00:02:22.570> you<00:02:22.720> need<00:02:22.840> your

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
determined by however long you need your

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.050 
determined by however long you need your
pathway<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.350> be<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.830> center<00:02:24.160> two<00:02:24.460> lanes

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
pathway to be but the center two lanes

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.030 
pathway to be but the center two lanes
are<00:02:25.270> gonna<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.570> sandstone<00:02:26.110> blocks<00:02:26.440> every

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
are gonna be sandstone blocks every

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.170 
are gonna be sandstone blocks every
other<00:02:27.130> block<00:02:27.430> we're<00:02:27.640> going<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:27.940> place

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
other block we're going to place

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.090 
other block we're going to place
sandstone<00:02:29.020> stairs<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:29.650> we<00:02:29.770> have<00:02:29.890> something

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
sandstone stairs so we have something

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.690 
sandstone stairs so we have something
like<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.430> going<00:02:30.490> on<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:32.260> like<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:33.460> each

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
like this going on just like so in each

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.220 
like this going on just like so in each
of<00:02:33.730> those<00:02:33.940> spaces<00:02:34.240> we're<00:02:34.510> going<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.780> place<00:02:34.990> a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
of those spaces we're going to place a

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.260 
of those spaces we're going to place a
redstone<00:02:35.560> lamp<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.640> register<00:02:37.060> lamp

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
redstone lamp and the register lamp

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.430 
redstone lamp and the register lamp
should<00:02:37.420> be<00:02:37.570> down<00:02:37.720> at<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.900> level<00:02:38.080> of<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
should be down at the level of the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.890 
should be down at the level of the
stairs<00:02:38.740> or<00:02:39.700> below<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.270> stairs<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:40.690> we<00:02:40.780> should

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
stairs or below the stairs so we should

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.240 
stairs or below the stairs so we should
have<00:02:40.990> something<00:02:41.200> going<00:02:41.320> on<00:02:41.440> like<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.860> I'll

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
have something going on like that I'll

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.380 
have something going on like that I'll
go<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.430> get<00:02:42.580> over<00:02:42.760> here<00:02:42.880> just<00:02:43.000> see<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.210> see

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
go to get over here just see you see

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.250 
go to get over here just see you see
like<00:02:43.960> that<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.560> like<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:46.050> then<00:02:47.050> we're<00:02:47.170> gonna

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
like that and like that then we're gonna

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.020 
like that and like that then we're gonna
do<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.500> throw<00:02:47.710> water<00:02:47.950> into<00:02:48.460> each<00:02:48.580> one<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.820> those

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
do is throw water into each one of those

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.730 
do is throw water into each one of those
little<00:02:49.330> spaces<00:02:49.660> right<00:02:49.900> there<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.260> lot<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.500> times

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
little spaces right there a lot of times

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.990 
little spaces right there a lot of times
when<00:02:50.920> building<00:02:51.190> with<00:02:51.280> sandstone<00:02:51.580> is<00:02:51.790> kind<00:02:51.970> of

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
when building with sandstone is kind of

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.310 
when building with sandstone is kind of
an<00:02:52.120> oasis<00:02:52.510> theme<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.930> that's<00:02:53.080> what<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.230> was

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
an oasis theme so that's what I was

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.960 
an oasis theme so that's what I was
going<00:02:53.500> for<00:02:53.560> here<00:02:53.860> was<00:02:54.520> something<00:02:54.670> like<00:02:54.850> that

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
going for here was something like that

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.310 
going for here was something like that
now<00:02:55.120> behind<00:02:55.390> each<00:02:55.600> stair<00:02:55.870> we're<00:02:55.990> gonna<00:02:56.080> place

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
now behind each stair we're gonna place

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.850 
now behind each stair we're gonna place
a<00:02:56.350> bush<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:57.280> like<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.840> was<00:02:58.960> nope<00:02:59.620> nope

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
a bush just like that that was nope nope

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.130 
a bush just like that that was nope nope
right<00:03:00.190> there<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.580> between<00:03:01.390> each<00:03:01.600> bush<00:03:01.960> we're

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
right there and between each bush we're

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.960 
right there and between each bush we're
going<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.380> place<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.740> half<00:03:02.920> slab<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.400> sandstone

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
going to place a half slab of sandstone

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.730 
going to place a half slab of sandstone
now<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.630> pattern<00:03:05.050> is<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.260> course<00:03:05.470> going<00:03:05.650> to

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
now that pattern is of course going to

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.200 
now that pattern is of course going to
continue<00:03:05.830> all<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.400> way<00:03:06.490> down<00:03:06.700> as<00:03:06.850> well<00:03:07.030> I

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
continue all the way down as well I

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.400 
continue all the way down as well I
would<00:03:07.540> assume<00:03:07.630> if<00:03:07.930> you're<00:03:07.960> building<00:03:08.350> this

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
would assume if you're building this

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.780 
would assume if you're building this
pathway<00:03:08.650> you're<00:03:08.980> probably<00:03:09.280> in<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.550> desert

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
pathway you're probably in a desert

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.280 
pathway you're probably in a desert
which<00:03:10.030> means<00:03:10.240> these<00:03:10.360> blocks<00:03:10.690> here<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.080> grass

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
which means these blocks here the grass

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.410 
which means these blocks here the grass
blocks<00:03:11.590> would<00:03:11.800> probably<00:03:12.220> be<00:03:12.340> sand<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:13.120> we<00:03:13.240> look

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
blocks would probably be sand so we look

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.700 
blocks would probably be sand so we look
at<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.540> little<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.840> little<00:03:13.930> bit<00:03:14.140> better<00:03:14.320> but<00:03:14.560> um

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
at a little a little bit better but um

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.810 
at a little a little bit better but um
you're<00:03:14.890> gonna<00:03:14.980> continue<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.370> pattern<00:03:15.790> down

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
you're gonna continue that pattern down

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.240 
you're gonna continue that pattern down
and<00:03:16.300> you'll<00:03:16.870> end<00:03:17.050> up<00:03:17.230> with<00:03:17.290> something<00:03:17.710> looking

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
and you'll end up with something looking

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.850 
and you'll end up with something looking
beautiful<00:03:18.520> like<00:03:19.420> this<00:03:19.720> also<00:03:20.080> all<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.620> these

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
beautiful like this also all of these

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.310 
beautiful like this also all of these
look<00:03:21.400> quite<00:03:22.030> nice<00:03:22.239> in<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.989> middle<00:03:23.170> of<00:03:23.230> the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
look quite nice in the middle of the

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.080 
look quite nice in the middle of the
night<00:03:23.470> as<00:03:23.650> well<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.489> can<00:03:24.760> use<00:03:24.820> them

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
night as well so you can use them

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.940 
night as well so you can use them
anywhere<00:03:25.150> they're<00:03:25.570> all<00:03:25.690> well<00:03:25.900> lit<00:03:26.140> but<00:03:26.470> those

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
anywhere they're all well lit but those

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.410 
anywhere they're all well lit but those
are<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.130> couple<00:03:27.160> pathway<00:03:27.670> designs<00:03:27.970> hopefully

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
are a couple pathway designs hopefully

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.820 
are a couple pathway designs hopefully
one<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.630> them<00:03:28.780> will<00:03:28.840> match<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.410> theme<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.709> your

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
one of them will match the theme of your

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.070 
one of them will match the theme of your
