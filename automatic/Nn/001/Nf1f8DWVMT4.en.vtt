razzle cakes and the silver Razzles on
how<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.730> set<00:00:09.000> them<00:00:09.059> up<00:00:09.210> in<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.389> rack<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:11.240> figured

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
how to set them up in a rack I figured

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.629 
how to set them up in a rack I figured
I'd<00:00:12.330> just<00:00:12.509> do<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.920> do<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> video<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:14.309> how<00:00:14.610> to

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I'd just do a do a video on how to

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.210 
I'd just do a do a video on how to
install<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:16.080> EMH<00:00:16.410> if<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:16.710> want<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.920> shoot<00:00:17.100> the

install the EMH if you want to shoot the
entire<00:00:17.250> cake<00:00:17.880> instead<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.390> breaking<00:00:18.660> them<00:00:18.779> all

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
entire cake instead of breaking them all

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:19.400 
entire cake instead of breaking them all
apart

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410

apart
I<00:00:19.439> don't<00:00:20.070> install<00:00:20.369> an<00:00:20.520> e<00:00:20.640> match<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.060> them

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
I don't install an e match in them

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.740 
I don't install an e match in them
safely<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.900> then<00:00:22.080> shoot<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.680> where<00:00:23.449> we<00:00:24.449> and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
safely and then shoot it to where we and

safely and then shoot it to where we and
at<00:00:25.439> any<00:00:25.619> point<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.640> replace<00:00:27.029> an<00:00:27.240> e

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
at any point here you can replace an e

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.529 
at any point here you can replace an e
match<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.320> big<00:00:29.179> gray<00:00:30.179> fast

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
match with just that big gray fast

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.959 
match with just that big gray fast
bisque<00:00:30.900> oh<00:00:31.279> you<00:00:32.279> know<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> same

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
bisque oh you know and it's the same

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.690 
bisque oh you know and it's the same
effect<00:00:33.149> here<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> same<00:00:34.309> not<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> same

effect here it's the same not the same

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.610 
effect here it's the same not the same
but<00:00:35.910> close<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.899> same<00:00:37.110> effect<00:00:37.469> you're

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
but close to the same effect you're

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.930 
but close to the same effect you're
looking<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.520> we're<00:00:38.610> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:38.850> is

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
looking at what we're going to do is

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.479 
looking at what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> find<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> fuse<00:00:40.280> we'll<00:00:41.280> just

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
we're going to find the fuse we'll just

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.889 
we're going to find the fuse we'll just
cut<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.000> real<00:00:42.450> small<00:00:42.780> square<00:00:44.660> really<00:00:45.660> lightly

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
cut a real small square really lightly

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.850 
cut a real small square really lightly
out<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> paper<00:00:48.140> lightly<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.680> don't

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
out of the paper lightly so we don't

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860 
out of the paper lightly so we don't
hurt<00:00:50.129> anything<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.760> don't<00:00:50.850> cut<00:00:51.120> any<00:00:51.300> fuse<00:00:51.660> or

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
hurt anything we don't cut any fuse or

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.130 
hurt anything we don't cut any fuse or
any<00:00:52.050> into<00:00:52.500> any<00:00:52.649> tubes<00:00:57.230> was<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.289> razor<00:00:58.620> knife

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
any into any tubes was a razor knife

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.360 
any into any tubes was a razor knife
we're<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.440> pop<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.680> paper<00:01:02.129> off

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
we're just going to pop that paper off

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.140 
we're just going to pop that paper off
in<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:05.810> here<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.080> see<00:01:07.790> we've<00:01:08.790> got<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
in here here you can see we've got the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.240 
in here here you can see we've got the
fuse<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.720> looks<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.830> where<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.100> goes

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
fuse it looks like this is where it goes

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.330 
fuse it looks like this is where it goes
in<00:01:12.170> but<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.320> we're<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> go<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.920> we'll<00:01:14.130> see

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
in but as we're going to go on we'll see

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.649 
in but as we're going to go on we'll see
that<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.610> doesn't<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.479> goes<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that it doesn't go in here it goes a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.210 
that it doesn't go in here it goes a
little<00:01:15.810> farther<00:01:16.110> down<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.580> that

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.170 

you'll<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.369> you're<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.759> able<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> see

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
you'll be you're going to be able to see

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.490 
you'll be you're going to be able to see
that<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> fuse<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.080> down<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
that the fuse is going to go down just a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.140 
that the fuse is going to go down just a
little<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.740> farther<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.000> little

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
little bit farther this is just a little

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.109 
little bit farther this is just a little
another<00:01:27.540> little<00:01:27.840> layer<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.140> cardboard<00:01:29.119> very

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
another little layer of cardboard very

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.090 
another little layer of cardboard very
carefully<00:01:30.780> cut<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:33.650> without<00:01:34.650> cutting<00:01:34.920> into

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
carefully cut that without cutting into

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.440 
carefully cut that without cutting into
the<00:01:35.280> fuse<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.700> anything<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:37.200> see

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
the fuse or anything and you can see

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.450 
the fuse or anything and you can see
that<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.630> fuse<00:01:40.220> in<00:01:41.509> fact<00:01:43.189> comes<00:01:44.189> down<00:01:44.369> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that the fuse in fact comes down to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.179 
that the fuse in fact comes down to
right<00:01:44.640> here<00:01:44.689> okay<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:47.390> how<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.600> works<00:01:48.840> is

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
right here okay so how this works is

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.560 
right here okay so how this works is
when<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.369> fuse<00:01:50.640> lights<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.390> send

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
when this fuse lights it's going to send

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.749 
when this fuse lights it's going to send
this<00:01:51.780> tube<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.259> when<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:52.979> tube<00:01:53.220> goes<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
this tube up when this tube goes up the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.899 
this tube up when this tube goes up the
fire<00:01:54.060> from<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.600> tube<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:55.079> up<00:01:55.700> he's<00:01:56.700> going

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
fire from this tube going up he's going

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.640 
fire from this tube going up he's going
to<00:01:56.969> light<00:01:57.290> this<00:01:58.290> next<00:01:58.649> few

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.230 

which<00:02:02.650> you're<00:02:03.460> not<00:02:03.490> going<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.760> be<00:02:03.850> able<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:04.060> see

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
which you're not going to be able to see

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.430 
which you're not going to be able to see
it<00:02:04.330> right<00:02:04.360> now<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:05.710> either<00:02:07.080> it's<00:02:08.080> probably

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
it right now it's either it's probably

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.320 
it right now it's either it's probably
right<00:02:08.560> here<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:09.399> goes<00:02:09.580> straight<00:02:09.729> from<00:02:10.030> here<00:02:10.240> to

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
right here it goes straight from here to

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.780 
right here it goes straight from here to
here<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.260> fire<00:02:11.440> from<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:11.800> tube<00:02:12.100> once

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
here so the fire from this tube once

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.160 
here so the fire from this tube once
this<00:02:12.940> fuse<00:02:13.240> goes<00:02:13.390> up<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.660> going<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.870> light<00:02:13.990> this

brass piece the importance of solid

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.960 
brass piece the importance of solid
brass<00:02:37.900> would<00:02:38.200> be<00:02:38.320> that<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:39.459> doesn't<00:02:39.489> create

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
brass would be that it doesn't create

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.509 
brass would be that it doesn't create
any<00:02:40.060> sparks<00:02:40.900> whereas<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.739> piece<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.100> metal<00:02:42.280> or

to hit this with a hammer it would go

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.020 
to hit this with a hammer it would go

all you can so if you were to drop the
cake<00:03:31.739> or<00:03:31.890> something<00:03:32.100> like<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.430> doesn't

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
cake or something like that it doesn't

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.460 
cake or something like that it doesn't
set<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:32.970> off<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:34.500> we<00:03:34.620> just<00:03:34.770> place<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.010> shroud

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
set it off so we just place the shroud

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.020 
set it off so we just place the shroud
into<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.560> cake<00:03:37.830> just<00:03:38.100> like<00:03:38.819> this<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.790> then<00:03:41.910> we

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
into the cake just like this and then we

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.660 
into the cake just like this and then we
would<00:03:42.180> take<00:03:42.360> some<00:03:42.420> tape<00:03:42.840> which<00:03:43.650> for<00:03:44.489> right<00:03:44.640> now

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
would take some tape which for right now

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.580 
would take some tape which for right now
we'll<00:03:45.030> just<00:03:45.060> use<00:03:45.330> this<00:03:45.510> clear<00:03:46.140> packing<00:03:46.560> tape

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
we'll just use this clear packing tape

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.340 
we'll just use this clear packing tape
because<00:03:47.580> that's<00:03:47.760> what<00:03:47.880> I've<00:03:48.000> got<00:03:48.150> handy<00:03:51.350> it's

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
because that's what I've got handy it's

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.590 
because that's what I've got handy it's
always<00:03:52.560> better<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.860> use<00:03:52.980> up<00:03:53.250> like<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.730> maybe<00:03:54.030> you

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
always better to use up like a maybe you

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.090 
always better to use up like a maybe you
know<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.720> duct<00:03:55.019> tape<00:03:55.260> er<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.440> different<00:03:55.860> kind<00:03:56.040> of

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
know a duct tape er a different kind of

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.580 
know a duct tape er a different kind of
packing<00:03:56.459> tape<00:03:57.080> we're<00:03:58.080> just<00:03:58.230> going<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.380> place

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
packing tape we're just going to place

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.460 
packing tape we're just going to place
that<00:03:58.620> right<00:03:58.950> over<00:03:59.220> this<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:01.019> one<00:04:01.230> I'm<00:04:01.319> not

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
that right over this this one I'm not

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.500 
that right over this this one I'm not
really<00:04:01.530> too<00:04:01.980> worried<00:04:02.280> about<00:04:02.340> because<00:04:02.850> I'm

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
really too worried about because I'm

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.789 
really too worried about because I'm
only<00:04:03.630> taking<00:04:04.019> right<00:04:04.170> around<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.440> corner<00:04:04.709> to

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
only taking right around the corner to

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:11.289 
only taking right around the corner to
to<00:04:05.250> light<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.799> take<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.040> into<00:04:08.400> there<00:04:09.650> and

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
to light it so take that into there and

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:18.349 
to light it so take that into there and
then<00:04:14.780> for<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> little<00:04:16.019> better<00:04:16.169> security<00:04:17.359> we're

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
then for a little better security we're

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.760 
then for a little better security we're
going<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.539> tape<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.810> match<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:21.209> wire<00:04:21.770> right

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
going to tape the match the wire right

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.340 
going to tape the match the wire right
to<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.010> cake<00:04:23.300> so<00:04:24.300> if<00:04:24.419> you<00:04:24.539> were<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.840> trip<00:04:25.080> over

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
to the cake so if you were to trip over

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.250

ignition on a cake

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.100 
ignition on a cake
with<00:05:25.410> a<00:05:25.440> cheap<00:05:25.710> little<00:05:25.920> system<00:05:26.280> like<00:05:26.400> this

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
with a cheap little system like this

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.230 
with a cheap little system like this
basically<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:28.230> would<00:05:28.380> use<00:05:28.560> this<00:05:28.970> if<00:05:29.970> you<00:05:30.060> want

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
basically you would use this if you want

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.130 
basically you would use this if you want
to<00:05:30.330> do<00:05:30.450> a<00:05:30.480> professional-looking

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
to do a professional-looking

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.710 
to do a professional-looking
one-point-four<00:05:31.980> show<00:05:32.360> this<00:05:33.360> is<00:05:33.540> how<00:05:33.570> you

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
one-point-four show this is how you

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.390 
one-point-four show this is how you
would<00:05:33.870> do<00:05:34.020> it<00:05:34.140> if<00:05:34.290> you<00:05:34.650> had<00:05:34.830> access<00:05:35.040> to<00:05:35.280> e

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
would do it if you had access to e

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.580 
would do it if you had access to e
matches<00:05:35.970> you<00:05:36.930> would<00:05:37.050> do<00:05:37.170> it<00:05:37.260> like<00:05:37.380> this

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
matches you would do it like this

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.650 
matches you would do it like this
because<00:05:38.070> you<00:05:38.160> get<00:05:38.340> instant<00:05:39.210> ignition<00:05:39.300> the

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
because you get instant ignition the

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.100 
because you get instant ignition the
second<00:05:40.020> you<00:05:40.080> push<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:41.010> Q<00:05:41.990> instead<00:05:42.990> of

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
second you push the the Q instead of

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.900 
second you push the the Q instead of
waiting<00:05:43.290> for<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.530> fuse<00:05:43.800> to<00:05:43.920> burn<00:05:44.070> you<00:05:44.700> get

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
waiting for the fuse to burn you get

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.450 
waiting for the fuse to burn you get
ignition<00:05:45.560> immediately<00:05:46.560> and<00:05:47.040> I'll<00:05:47.160> show<00:05:47.370> you

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
ignition immediately and I'll show you

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.090 
ignition immediately and I'll show you
that<00:05:47.580> in<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.730> next<00:05:47.790> video
