phone<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.340> pretty<00:00:11.700> much<00:00:11.880> made<00:00:12.120> out<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
phone is pretty much made out of the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.539 
phone is pretty much made out of the
same<00:00:12.570> basic<00:00:12.809> materials<00:00:13.080> as<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> Galaxy<00:00:14.160> s6

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
same basic materials as the Galaxy s6

same basic materials as the Galaxy s6
and<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.880> galaxy<00:00:14.940> s6<00:00:15.660> edge<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.260> I'm<00:00:16.350> not<00:00:16.470> going

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and the galaxy s6 edge so I'm not going

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680 
and the galaxy s6 edge so I'm not going
to<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> same<00:00:17.130> stress<00:00:17.520> test<00:00:17.820> as<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.240> did<00:00:18.510> on

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
to do the same stress test as I did on

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.330 
to do the same stress test as I did on
those<00:00:18.990> phones<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.650> can<00:00:19.830> watch<00:00:19.980> those<00:00:20.250> videos

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
if you want to see how it handles flame

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.540 
if you want to see how it handles flame
or<00:00:22.439> scratches<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> front<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.400> back

in<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.660> video<00:00:24.960> I'm<00:00:25.050> just<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> see<00:00:25.619> how

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
in this video I'm just going to see how

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.429 
in this video I'm just going to see how
scratch-resistant<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.570> camera<00:00:27.990> lens<00:00:28.230> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
scratch-resistant the camera lens is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.620 
scratch-resistant the camera lens is
with<00:00:28.859> my<00:00:29.039> razor<00:00:29.279> blade<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> do

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
with my razor blade and I'm going to do

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.299 
with my razor blade and I'm going to do
a<00:00:30.660> pin<00:00:30.900> test<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.320> well<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:32.189> I'm

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
a pin test as well so as you can see I'm

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.620 
a pin test as well so as you can see I'm
taking<00:00:32.430> my<00:00:32.640> razor<00:00:32.880> blade<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.210> sliding<00:00:33.540> it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
taking my razor blade and sliding it

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.180 
taking my razor blade and sliding it
along<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> glass<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.469> bunch<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.920> different

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
along the glass a bunch of different

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.280 
along the glass a bunch of different
angles<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> lens<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.210> actually<00:00:36.989> held<00:00:37.170> up

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
angles on the lens and actually held up

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.410 
angles on the lens and actually held up
pretty<00:00:37.559> darn<00:00:37.770> well<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.430> camera<00:00:38.940> lens<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
pretty darn well the camera lens is

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.030 
pretty darn well the camera lens is
probably<00:00:39.960> made<00:00:40.050> out<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.350> same<00:00:40.620> tempered

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
probably made out of that same tempered

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.680 
probably made out of that same tempered
glass<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.610> back<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> front<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.510> made

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
glass at the back and the front is made

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.060 
glass at the back and the front is made
out<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.290> pretty<00:00:43.440> resistant<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
out of so it's pretty resistant to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.160 
out of so it's pretty resistant to
scratches<00:00:44.489> which<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.760> very<00:00:45.000> nice<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:46.079> I'm

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
scratches which is very nice so I'm

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.360 
scratches which is very nice so I'm
going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.530> bin<00:00:46.680> test<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> couple

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
going to do this bin test in a couple

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.830 
going to do this bin test in a couple
different<00:00:47.610> ways<00:00:47.670> first<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.360> which<00:00:48.570> I'm<00:00:48.750> going

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
different ways first of which I'm going

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.479 
different ways first of which I'm going
to<00:00:48.899> take<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.230> hands<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.739> kind<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.039> distribute

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to take my hands and kind of distribute

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.520 
to take my hands and kind of distribute
the<00:00:50.610> weight<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> bend<00:00:51.449> along<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> frame

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the weight of the bend along the frame

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.229 
the weight of the bend along the frame
of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.800> phone<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.280> well<00:00:53.489> as<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> screen<00:00:54.090> in

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
of the phone as well as the screen in

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.150 
of the phone as well as the screen in
the<00:00:54.329> back<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.559> me<00:00:55.680> press<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the back so you can see me press on the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.680 
the back so you can see me press on the
screen<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.579> phone<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.570> actually

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
screen of the phone here and it actually

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.689 
screen of the phone here and it actually
survives<00:00:58.170> pretty<00:00:58.469> well<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.920> handles<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
survives pretty well it handles the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
survives pretty well it handles the
pressure<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.149> my<00:01:00.270> hands<00:01:00.480> pretty<00:01:00.660> well<00:01:00.960> I'm

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
pressure of my hands pretty well I'm

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.689 
pressure of my hands pretty well I'm
going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.620> flip<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.890> around<00:01:02.010> still<00:01:02.399> keeping

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
going to flip it around still keeping

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.399 
going to flip it around still keeping
the<00:01:02.850> pressure<00:01:03.390> along<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.840> frame<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the pressure along the frame of the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.080 
the pressure along the frame of the
screen<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.280> how<00:01:05.489> much<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> can

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
screen just to see how much that can

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.120 
screen just to see how much that can
handle<00:01:06.270> still<00:01:07.229> pretty<00:01:07.439> straight<00:01:07.710> screens

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
handle still pretty straight screens

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.320 
handle still pretty straight screens
just<00:01:08.220> fine<00:01:08.610> everything's<00:01:09.090> still<00:01:09.270> working

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
just fine everything's still working

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.480 
just fine everything's still working
really<00:01:09.750> well<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.740> now<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> take<00:01:11.310> my

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
really well so now I'm going to take my

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.700 
really well so now I'm going to take my
hands<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.030> press<00:01:12.299> more<00:01:12.630> along<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.110> center<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
hands and press more along the center of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.830 
hands and press more along the center of
the<00:01:13.860> screen<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.060> put<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.659> pressure

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the screen to you know put some pressure

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
the screen to you know put some pressure
on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> guts<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> phone<00:01:17.100> looks<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
on the guts of the phone looks like the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.190 
on the guts of the phone looks like the
guts<00:01:17.909> allow<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.420> bit<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.689> flex<00:01:18.960> but

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
guts allow for a little bit of flex but

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.929 
guts allow for a little bit of flex but
the<00:01:19.320> frame<00:01:19.590> definitely<00:01:20.100> stays<00:01:20.340> rigid<00:01:20.580> along

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the frame definitely stays rigid along

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.580 
the frame definitely stays rigid along
the<00:01:21.060> side<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> phone<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:22.320> gonna<00:01:22.470> try

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the side of the phone I'm gonna try

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.350 
the side of the phone I'm gonna try
twisting<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> little<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.670> my<00:01:24.119> hands

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
twisting it a little bit in my hands

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.179
