 of chickens and give them something very familiar if 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.070

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.780
 share and claws good claws 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.390

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.520
 Miami in this way is something very, very, very 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.890
 original mostly because they are chickens 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.900
 Organic and organic ovens 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.280
 very traditional coal and I think that 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.600
 this closes the flavors what is it that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.920
 You are looking for people of all 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.010
 important for all our people in 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.540
 home that this chicken if you can 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.250
 do at home and have the recipe now 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.080
 same on screen to make a note of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.060
 those ingredients and the chicken is left 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.140
 as good as the one who will prepare juan 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.940
 Today I am going to share it 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.040
 celebrating the Hispanic heritage that today 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.659
 we are transported to Peru tell me about 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.909
 chicken sir john good the chicken is a 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.159
 basically small chicken because the 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.680
 chicken teques extend boy two pounds and 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.330
 medium for it to have its properties 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.500
 right there is the oven what are we 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.840
 seeing on the screen are the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.660
 stunning ovens characterizing 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.039
 chickens left john's restaurant 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.140
 they talk a little bit about the species that 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.910
 characterize this this recipe I think 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.700
 which is very traditional without many low 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.390
 a lot low that although it's the ginger 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.130
 correct ginger with salt pepper 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.890
 cumin opinion dre coca cola one touch 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.420
 mustard and lots of energy among others 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.740
 much much much much love now that makes 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.179
 the things so that he really has the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.739
 the taste and good for nothing and that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.360
 accompanies with a highway army 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.600
 how much time baked 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.360
 in my oven they are 45 minutes but at home 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.590
 basically it can be an hour we're going to 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.720
 while cooking dinner so we will 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.310
 prepare that of unclear forklift 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.250
 yes and when we talk about pepper 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.840
 forklift is a meal more than anything 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.520
 from the street I do not know how it is 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.400
 a lot on the street is that people retire 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.160
 His is a typical Peruvian because it gives him the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.540
 street flavor very great recoil 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.040
 that's what we wanted to do in this 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.290
 case very well tell me then to 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.610
 prepare the good chili pepper 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.830
 fundamental onion if you have to 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.350
 Put the onion in a container 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.110
 put the Chinese onion that we 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.060
 we say but several today you enter calyon 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.350
 when we talk about chili that they received 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.880
 many people may think that we are 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.260
 talking about one and specifically but 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.690
 we are talking about the sauce is scratching 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.459
 from the sas ok very well perfect we continue 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.050
 burning that is the yellow pepper but 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.330
 this is already a paste that is processed 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.239
 very well you owe nothing takes off the pepas 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.700
 and liquefies point that oil salt very well 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.650
 there it is we put spicy and with a 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.390
 minced has to be think that to me 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.549
 I love spicy but you could do 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.960
 with the seed convention and everything that 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.910
 you want as long as you have 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.530
 spicy so you know that 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.360
 when I eat ceviche in the restaurant 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.070
 from the lord here I think the ceviche 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.500
 more spicy that you prepare is mine 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.060
 every time I know that you are demanding 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.250
 what is it and then you have to cast something 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.320
 exactly do it exactly 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.520
 then combine with me a 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.950
 little bit of there not much that the 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.230
 Peruvians the long I do not know how like as 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.020
 the flavor enhance the peanuts in a 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.570
 experience exactly that visit to taste 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.450
 ok there it is and a little pepper that does not 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.910
 may lack perfect black pepper or 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.820
 an amount of flavor all this is 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.290
 pour is mixed very well very well 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.480
 there is accompanied with him can tillage 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.700
 perfect one hour in the oven true one 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.560
 hour in my hat are 45 minutes but 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.180
 the conventional regular one hour and 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.100
 we of course already have one that 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.260
 was cooking for an hour that already 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.360
 it's practically ready, I'll go 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.200
 looking to accompany him because I do not 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.829
 you accompany then it is here and wow 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.540
 is the resistance vapor that comes out of the 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.269
 oven is impressive 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.770
 there it is, then it will be that here 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.770
 we have a little knife so that 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.080
 Of course you cut me a bit because I 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.280
 I see that it is and it looks very good but you do not 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.830
 I think it tastes good until I do not 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.900
 try I think that to show then 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.700
 you have to try of course yes and with 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.340
 that so the truth is that I am a 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.229
 little excited because there is 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.229
 very much flavor and in this case now 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.910
 is that I personally love and 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.370
 especially with the chicken as I said 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.470
 share chicken a jug of better 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.090
 definitely clear way and look at what 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.889
 well it is cooked that practically the 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.080
 listeners with a little scissors is not super 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.630
 soft super tender and then I will give you 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.430
 account and the smell of chicken comes out 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.930
