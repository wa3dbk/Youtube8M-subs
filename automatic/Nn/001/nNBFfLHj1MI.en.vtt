today<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:14.769> question<00:00:15.190> is<00:00:15.370> what<00:00:16.000> is<00:00:16.119> a<00:00:16.150> pitch

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449 
today the question is what is a pitch

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.480 
today the question is what is a pitch
raise<00:00:16.810> you<00:00:17.590> may<00:00:17.740> have<00:00:17.860> heard<00:00:18.039> this<00:00:18.190> term

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
raise you may have heard this term

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.849 
raise you may have heard this term
bandied<00:00:19.360> about<00:00:19.449> and<00:00:19.840> wonder<00:00:20.170> what<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.680> heck

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
bandied about and wonder what the heck

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.730 
bandied about and wonder what the heck
is<00:00:21.010> that<00:00:21.060> well<00:00:22.060> it's<00:00:22.390> nothing<00:00:22.600> to<00:00:22.840> be<00:00:22.990> scared

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
is that well it's nothing to be scared

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.050 
is that well it's nothing to be scared
of<00:00:23.980> but<00:00:24.279> it's<00:00:24.400> something<00:00:24.520> you<00:00:24.640> should<00:00:24.730> be

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
of but it's something you should be

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.210 
of but it's something you should be
aware<00:00:25.330> of<00:00:25.410> perhaps<00:00:26.410> you<00:00:26.619> have<00:00:26.740> a<00:00:26.800> piano<00:00:26.980> you

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
aware of perhaps you have a piano you

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.640 
aware of perhaps you have a piano you
haven't<00:00:27.460> tuned<00:00:27.640> in<00:00:27.820> years<00:00:28.449> or<00:00:28.660> your<00:00:29.109> body<00:00:29.320> used

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
haven't tuned in years or your body used

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.259 
haven't tuned in years or your body used
piano<00:00:30.039> and<00:00:30.340> you<00:00:30.400> figure<00:00:30.670> oh<00:00:30.820> let's<00:00:31.060> just<00:00:31.090> get

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
piano and you figure oh let's just get

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.270 
piano and you figure oh let's just get
it<00:00:31.420> tuned<00:00:31.630> up<00:00:31.810> and<00:00:32.050> sounds<00:00:32.349> pretty<00:00:32.680> good<00:00:32.920> and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
it tuned up and sounds pretty good and

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.430 
it tuned up and sounds pretty good and
the<00:00:33.699> tuner<00:00:33.940> comes<00:00:34.120> there<00:00:34.300> goes<00:00:34.420> oh<00:00:34.719> this<00:00:35.170> piano

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
the tuner comes there goes oh this piano

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.399 
the tuner comes there goes oh this piano
needs<00:00:35.559> a<00:00:35.710> pitch<00:00:35.949> raise<00:00:36.249> and<00:00:36.699> you<00:00:37.089> go<00:00:37.210> what<00:00:37.870> it

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
needs a pitch raise and you go what it

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:39.779 
needs a pitch raise and you go what it
sounds<00:00:38.829> pretty<00:00:39.039> good<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.370> me

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
sounds pretty good to me

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.139 
sounds pretty good to me
what<00:00:40.239> does<00:00:40.389> that<00:00:40.420> mean<00:00:41.019> exactly<00:00:41.670> well<00:00:42.670> there

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
what does that mean exactly well there

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.239 
what does that mean exactly well there
was<00:00:43.299> a<00:00:43.329> time<00:00:43.690> if<00:00:43.989> you<00:00:44.019> go<00:00:44.170> back<00:00:44.379> hundreds<00:00:45.129> of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.249 
was a time if you go back hundreds of

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:47.009 
was a time if you go back hundreds of
years<00:00:45.489> before<00:00:45.789> there<00:00:46.239> was<00:00:46.359> established

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
years before there was established

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.039 
years before there was established
pitches<00:00:47.499> that<00:00:48.069> is<00:00:48.249> to<00:00:48.399> say<00:00:48.639> an<00:00:48.940> a<00:00:49.569> on<00:00:49.780> one

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
pitches that is to say an a on one

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.930 
pitches that is to say an a on one
instrument<00:00:50.409> might<00:00:50.709> not<00:00:50.889> be<00:00:51.039> the<00:00:51.249> same<00:00:51.489> as<00:00:51.639> an<00:00:51.760> a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
instrument might not be the same as an a

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.849 
instrument might not be the same as an a
and<00:00:52.120> another<00:00:52.329> instrument<00:00:52.719> pitches<00:00:53.469> varied

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
and another instrument pitches varied

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.369 
and another instrument pitches varied
quite<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.159> bit<00:00:54.429> over<00:00:55.359> time<00:00:55.389> pitch<00:00:56.229> is

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
quite a bit over time pitch is

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.549 
quite a bit over time pitch is
stabilized<00:00:57.159> and<00:00:57.609> a<00:00:58.030> become<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.719> standard<00:00:59.289> pitch

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
stabilized and a become a standard pitch

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.289 
stabilized and a become a standard pitch
a<00:00:59.819> 440<00:01:00.929> which<00:01:01.929> sounds<00:01:02.260> like<00:01:02.379> that

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
a 440 which sounds like that

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.550 
a 440 which sounds like that
440<00:01:04.299> what<00:01:04.479> does<00:01:04.570> that<00:01:04.720> number<00:01:04.989> represent<00:01:05.469> it

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
440 what does that number represent it

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.800 
440 what does that number represent it
represents<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:06.219> number<00:01:06.460> of<00:01:06.789> vibrations<00:01:07.000> per

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
represents the number of vibrations per

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.800 
represents the number of vibrations per
second<00:01:08.259> and<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:09.009> fact<00:01:09.700> it's<00:01:09.909> all<00:01:10.030> mathematics

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
second and in fact it's all mathematics

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.230 
second and in fact it's all mathematics
every<00:01:11.500> time<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:11.799> double<00:01:11.979> your<00:01:12.189> vibrations<00:01:12.820> if

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
every time you double your vibrations if

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.160 
every time you double your vibrations if
you<00:01:13.390> go<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.539> 880

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
you go to 880

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.649 
you go to 880
you<00:01:14.890> get<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:15.130> same<00:01:15.340> note<00:01:15.700> an<00:01:15.939> octave<00:01:16.390> higher

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
you get the same note an octave higher

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.950 
you get the same note an octave higher
they're<00:01:17.409> just<00:01:17.770> how<00:01:18.039> many<00:01:18.219> times<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:19.119> object

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
they're just how many times the object

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.440 
they're just how many times the object
the<00:01:20.079> string<00:01:20.350> is<00:01:20.469> moving<00:01:20.829> back<00:01:21.039> and<00:01:21.219> forth<00:01:21.520> so

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
the string is moving back and forth so

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.719 
the string is moving back and forth so
that<00:01:22.719> is<00:01:23.079> a<00:01:23.109> standard<00:01:23.590> pitch<00:01:23.829> now<00:01:24.130> why<00:01:24.340> is<00:01:24.399> it<00:01:24.670> a

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
that is a standard pitch now why is it a

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.450 
that is a standard pitch now why is it a
concern<00:01:25.119> if<00:01:25.420> your<00:01:25.630> piano<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.229> not<00:01:26.619> up<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.189> pitch

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
concern if your piano is not up to pitch

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.389 
concern if your piano is not up to pitch
why<00:01:28.240> if<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.570> needs<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.840> pitch<00:01:29.079> raise<00:01:29.439> there<00:01:30.219> are

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
why if it needs a pitch raise there are

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.169 
why if it needs a pitch raise there are
several<00:01:30.939> reasons<00:01:31.630> why<00:01:31.719> this<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.170> vital<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.820> is

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
several reasons why this is vital one is

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.200 
several reasons why this is vital one is
if<00:01:34.990> your<00:01:35.380> piano<00:01:35.649> is<00:01:35.859> under<00:01:36.189> pitch<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.789> you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
if your piano is under pitch and you

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.489 
if your piano is under pitch and you
said<00:01:37.420> well<00:01:37.659> I<00:01:37.689> don't<00:01:37.869> care<00:01:38.079> if<00:01:38.170> it's<00:01:38.289> under

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:38.499 
said well I don't care if it's under

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:40.230 
said well I don't care if it's under
pitch<00:01:38.710> but<00:01:39.249> then<00:01:39.399> you<00:01:39.490> have<00:01:39.670> somebody<00:01:39.880> comes

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
pitch but then you have somebody comes

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.149 
pitch but then you have somebody comes
maybe<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.570> friend<00:01:40.960> plays<00:01:41.170> violin<00:01:41.679> or<00:01:41.859> clarinet

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
maybe a friend plays violin or clarinet

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.649 
maybe a friend plays violin or clarinet
they<00:01:42.340> come<00:01:42.490> over<00:01:42.700> oh<00:01:42.820> let's<00:01:43.149> play<00:01:43.329> something

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
they come over oh let's play something

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.450 
they come over oh let's play something
together<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.259> you<00:01:44.560> try<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:44.829> play<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.399> you

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
together and you try to play and you

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.709 
together and you try to play and you
realize<00:01:45.700> you're<00:01:45.850> playing<00:01:46.090> in<00:01:46.240> two<00:01:46.390> different

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
realize you're playing in two different

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.399 
realize you're playing in two different
keys<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:47.289> it<00:01:48.159> won't<00:01:48.460> work<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:49.630> perhaps<00:01:50.229> even

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
keys and it won't work but perhaps even

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.260 
keys and it won't work but perhaps even
a<00:01:50.560> more<00:01:50.770> fundamental<00:01:51.520> reason<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:51.939> you<00:01:52.060> need

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
a more fundamental reason that you need

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.910 
a more fundamental reason that you need
to<00:01:52.420> have<00:01:52.539> your<00:01:52.630> piano<00:01:52.929> up<00:01:53.109> to<00:01:53.229> pitch<00:01:53.499> is

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
to have your piano up to pitch is

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.919 
to have your piano up to pitch is
because<00:01:54.249> pianos<00:01:54.609> are<00:01:54.729> made<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.299> sound<00:01:55.600> their

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
because pianos are made to sound their

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.959 
because pianos are made to sound their
best<00:01:55.960> when<00:01:56.679> they're<00:01:56.770> tuned<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.609> the<00:01:57.729> pitch

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
best when they're tuned to the pitch

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.609 
best when they're tuned to the pitch
that<00:01:58.299> they<00:01:58.420> were<00:01:58.479> manufactured<00:01:59.109> to<00:01:59.439> produce

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
that they were manufactured to produce

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.039 
that they were manufactured to produce
so<00:02:00.490> here<00:02:00.729> if<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:00.999> have<00:02:01.119> a<00:02:01.179> piano<00:02:01.420> for<00:02:01.659> example

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
so here if you have a piano for example

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.599 
so here if you have a piano for example
that<00:02:02.170> it's<00:02:02.289> dropped<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.859> pitched<00:02:03.130> let's<00:02:03.460> say

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
that it's dropped and pitched let's say

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.359 
that it's dropped and pitched let's say
an<00:02:03.819> entire<00:02:04.329> half-step<00:02:05.079> oftentimes<00:02:06.039> it's<00:02:06.310> just

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
an entire half-step oftentimes it's just

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.419 
an entire half-step oftentimes it's just
a<00:02:06.579> semitone<00:02:06.999> so<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:07.990> doesn't<00:02:08.289> sound<00:02:08.500> it's

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
a semitone so it doesn't sound it's

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.580 
a semitone so it doesn't sound it's
actually<00:02:09.789> between<00:02:10.090> two<00:02:10.539> notes<00:02:10.840> but<00:02:11.409> you're

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
actually between two notes but you're

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.229 
actually between two notes but you're
supposed<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.920> have<00:02:12.129> a<00:02:12.159> piece<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:13.000> sounds

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
supposed to have a piece that sounds

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.250 
supposed to have a piece that sounds
like<00:02:13.299> this

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.990 

and<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.349> sounds<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:20.549> well<00:02:21.549> that's<00:02:21.849> a

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
and it sounds like this well that's a

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.130 
and it sounds like this well that's a
problem<00:02:22.209> we<00:02:22.510> for<00:02:22.659> playing<00:02:22.870> with<00:02:22.959> other

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
problem we for playing with other

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.559 
problem we for playing with other
musicians<00:02:23.349> but<00:02:24.159> more<00:02:24.489> than<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.540> whole

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
musicians but more than that the whole

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.190 
musicians but more than that the whole
piano<00:02:25.989> will<00:02:26.260> have<00:02:26.379> a<00:02:26.409> dull<00:02:26.920> quality<00:02:27.700> now<00:02:28.569> what

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
piano will have a dull quality now what

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.479 
piano will have a dull quality now what
does<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.379> take<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.680> hick<00:02:29.799> it<00:02:29.920> up<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.159> pitch<00:02:30.340> it

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
does it take the hick it up to pitch it

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.890 
does it take the hick it up to pitch it
figure<00:02:30.670> well<00:02:30.819> you're<00:02:30.970> tuning<00:02:31.269> it<00:02:31.390> up<00:02:31.480> anyway

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
figure well you're tuning it up anyway

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.630 
figure well you're tuning it up anyway
just<00:02:32.230> tune<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.650> up<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.799> pitch<00:02:32.920> with<00:02:33.310> no<00:02:33.430> big

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
just tune it up to pitch with no big

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.110 
just tune it up to pitch with no big
deal

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
deal

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.880 
deal
well<00:02:34.420> there<00:02:34.659> are<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> number<00:02:35.109> of<00:02:35.290> issues<00:02:35.500> here

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
well there are a number of issues here

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.059 
well there are a number of issues here
number<00:02:36.099> one<00:02:36.400> there<00:02:37.269> are<00:02:37.420> about<00:02:37.569> 20<00:02:38.079> tons<00:02:38.560> of

number one there are about 20 tons of

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.460 
number one there are about 20 tons of
string<00:02:39.430> tension<00:02:39.730> if<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.239> collectively<00:02:40.750> stick

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
string tension if you collectively stick

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.619 
string tension if you collectively stick
all<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> strings<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.180> tension<00:02:43.540> that

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
all of the strings and the tension that

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.460 
all of the strings and the tension that
exerts<00:02:44.019> on<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.519> plate<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.599> if<00:02:46.959> it's<00:02:47.200> all

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
exerts on the plate and so if it's all

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.589 
exerts on the plate and so if it's all
under<00:02:47.950> pitch<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.549> tune<00:02:48.790> all<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.299> them<00:02:49.450> up

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
under pitch and you tune all of them up

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.629 
under pitch and you tune all of them up
suddenly<00:02:50.290> everything<00:02:50.950> it's<00:02:51.069> flexed

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
suddenly everything it's flexed

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.580 
suddenly everything it's flexed
tremendously<00:02:52.239> you're<00:02:52.450> adding<00:02:52.900> thousands<00:02:53.470> of

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
tremendously you're adding thousands of

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.369 
tremendously you're adding thousands of
pounds<00:02:53.849> potentially<00:02:54.849> of<00:02:55.109> additional<00:02:56.109> tension

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
pounds potentially of additional tension

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.399 
pounds potentially of additional tension
so<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.370> bridge<00:02:57.669> the<00:02:57.970> soundboard<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:59.019> entire

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
so the bridge the soundboard the entire

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.059 
so the bridge the soundboard the entire
piano<00:02:59.859> is<00:03:00.250> suddenly<00:03:00.849> being<00:03:01.769> flexed<00:03:02.769> in<00:03:02.889> ways

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
piano is suddenly being flexed in ways

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
that it hasn't in years and it could

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.550 
that it hasn't in years and it could
cause<00:03:05.919> problems<00:03:06.299> worse<00:03:07.299> than<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.689> unless<00:03:08.500> a

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
cause problems worse than that unless a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.899 
cause problems worse than that unless a
tuner<00:03:08.950> really<00:03:09.430> knows<00:03:09.579> what<00:03:09.760> they're<00:03:09.879> doing

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
tuner really knows what they're doing

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.179 
tuner really knows what they're doing
you<00:03:10.359> could<00:03:10.450> start<00:03:10.689> breaking<00:03:11.169> strings<00:03:11.530> it's

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
you could start breaking strings it's

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.619 
you could start breaking strings it's
important<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.849> have<00:03:12.909> a<00:03:12.970> technician<00:03:13.389> who

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
important to have a technician who

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.690 
important to have a technician who
understands<00:03:14.500> how<00:03:14.919> to<00:03:14.980> do<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.250> pitch<00:03:15.489> raise

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
understands how to do a pitch raise

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.689 
understands how to do a pitch raise
properly<00:03:16.560> one<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.769> things<00:03:17.950> they<00:03:18.099> do<00:03:18.159> is<00:03:18.549> to

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
properly one of the things they do is to

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.960 
properly one of the things they do is to
lubricate<00:03:19.000> all<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:20.290> points<00:03:20.769> of<00:03:20.919> friction<00:03:21.280> so

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
lubricate all the points of friction so

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.300 
lubricate all the points of friction so

that if that piano hasn't been to than
five<00:03:24.519> or<00:03:24.729> ten<00:03:24.879> years<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.870> they<00:03:26.349> could<00:03:26.560> be

to the bridges and you're just tuning it
up<00:03:34.090> could<00:03:34.449> snap<00:03:34.900> strings<00:03:35.409> so<00:03:35.919> it's<00:03:36.099> a<00:03:36.190> careful

up could snap strings so it's a careful

up could snap strings so it's a careful

they<00:03:44.319> generally<00:03:44.889> do<00:03:45.069> a<00:03:45.099> tuner<00:03:45.459> will<00:03:45.549> come<00:03:45.729> in

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
they generally do a tuner will come in

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.210 
they generally do a tuner will come in
and<00:03:46.060> just<00:03:46.090> do<00:03:46.329> a<00:03:46.359> rough<00:03:46.780> tuning<00:03:47.290> first<00:03:47.799> and

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
and just do a rough tuning first and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.520 
and just do a rough tuning first and
then<00:03:48.609> a<00:03:48.639> second<00:03:49.150> fine<00:03:49.419> tuning<00:03:49.870> right<00:03:50.049> after

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
then a second fine tuning right after

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.099 
then a second fine tuning right after
but<00:03:51.099> even<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.639> fine<00:03:51.940> tuning<00:03:52.239> won't<00:03:52.870> hold

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
but even that fine tuning won't hold

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.189 
but even that fine tuning won't hold
very<00:03:53.409> long<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.549> so<00:03:54.669> it<00:03:54.940> usually<00:03:55.449> once<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.930> piano

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
very long and so it usually once a piano

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.289 
very long and so it usually once a piano
gets<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.709> far<00:03:56.979> off<00:03:57.099> pitch<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.760> can<00:03:57.909> expect

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
gets that far off pitch you can expect

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.729 
gets that far off pitch you can expect
to<00:03:58.389> have<00:03:58.449> to<00:03:58.569> tune<00:03:58.720> your<00:03:58.840> piano<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.139> number<00:03:59.650> of

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
to have to tune your piano a number of

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.979 
to have to tune your piano a number of
times<00:04:00.010> over<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.340> next<00:04:00.400> year<00:04:00.939> or<00:04:01.060> two<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.840> get

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
times over the next year or two to get

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.069 
times over the next year or two to get
it<00:04:02.079> to<00:04:02.199> stabilize<00:04:02.530> again<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:04.239> danger<00:04:04.840> is

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
it to stabilize again and the danger is

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.229 
it to stabilize again and the danger is
if<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:06.010> piano<00:04:06.310> has<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.629> substantial

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
if the piano has the the substantial

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.699 
if the piano has the the substantial
workings<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.449> be<00:04:10.540> able<00:04:10.629> to<00:04:10.840> withstand<00:04:11.049> this

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
workings to be able to withstand this

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.789 
workings to be able to withstand this
kind<00:04:11.769> of<00:04:12.370> stress<00:04:13.030> so<00:04:13.870> that's<00:04:14.349> in<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.769> nutshell

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
kind of stress so that's in a nutshell

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.800 
kind of stress so that's in a nutshell
what<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.430> pitch<00:04:15.729> raise<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.539> should<00:04:16.720> be

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
what a pitch raise is you should be

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.539 
what a pitch raise is you should be
aware<00:04:17.049> of<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.320> now<00:04:17.349> how<00:04:17.590> could<00:04:17.799> you<00:04:17.889> know<00:04:18.070> if

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
aware of it now how could you know if

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.860 
aware of it now how could you know if
you're<00:04:18.699> going<00:04:18.849> out<00:04:19.030> shopping<00:04:19.269> for<00:04:19.509> a<00:04:19.659> piano

does this piano need a pitch raise you

check the pitch of the piano a lot of

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.540 
check the pitch of the piano a lot of
times<00:04:44.139> it<00:04:44.349> won't<00:04:44.440> be<00:04:44.620> completely<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:45.520> a

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
times it won't be completely to a

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.730 
times it won't be completely to a
different<00:04:45.970> note<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.720> might<00:04:46.960> just<00:04:47.199> be<00:04:47.289> between

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
different note it might just be between

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.400 
different note it might just be between
two<00:04:48.190> notes<00:04:48.460> which<00:04:48.970> still<00:04:49.389> entails<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.020> same

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
two notes which still entails the same

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.040 
two notes which still entails the same
process<00:04:51.039> I<00:04:51.130> just<00:04:51.490> described<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.750> that's<00:04:52.900> it

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
process I just described so that's it

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.020 
process I just described so that's it
for<00:04:53.199> today<00:04:53.470> what<00:04:54.130> is<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.250> pitch<00:04:54.490> raise<00:04:54.729> if<00:04:54.970> you

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
for today what is a pitch raise if you

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.460
