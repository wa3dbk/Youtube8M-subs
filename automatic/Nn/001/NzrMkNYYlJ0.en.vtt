00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.430 

says<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.550> game<00:01:37.550> actually<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:38.570> self<00:01:38.990> I<00:01:39.200> might

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
says the game actually just self I might

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.590 
says the game actually just self I might
speed<00:01:39.860> up<00:01:39.890> wat<00:01:40.370> you<00:01:40.400> can't<00:01:41.180> tell<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.390> huge

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
speed up wat you can't tell a huge

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.500

difference<00:01:41.780> but<00:01:42.910> there's<00:01:43.910> actually<00:01:44.000> some

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
difference but there's actually some

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.620 
difference but there's actually some
adjustment<00:01:45.110> between<00:01:48.940> it's<00:01:49.940> actually<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:50.480> much

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
adjustment between it's actually so much

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.230 
adjustment between it's actually so much
time<00:01:51.260> adjustment<00:01:51.920> some<00:01:52.310> places<00:01:52.580> where<00:01:52.910> the

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
time adjustment some places where the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.160 
time adjustment some places where the
volume<00:01:53.420> just<00:01:53.870> quickly<00:01:54.380> dies<00:01:54.650> out<00:01:56.020> like<00:01:57.020> right

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
volume just quickly dies out like right

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.080
