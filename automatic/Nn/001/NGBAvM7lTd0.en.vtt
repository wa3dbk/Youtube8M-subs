00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.080
 I have to undergo an intervention 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.500
 surgical I was addressed a 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.779
 surgeon by my doctor 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.369
 I will have overtaking 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.189
 relatively large fees 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.630
 some of which will remain my 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.090
 charge and in no way did I 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.369
 anticipate his blows nor have 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.160
 really guarantee that the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.540
 the care that I was going to receive would be 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.950
 the best possible 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.660
 I do not want to make a quote for a 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.680
 dental prosthesis the quote is enough 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.960
 elevated it will stay me a part 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.129
 important to pay yes I noticed that 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.300
 the price of a medicine could vary 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.160
 from one pharmacy to another 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.469
 do not I have tools to know which 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.940
 is the least expensive so when I'm 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.989
 and when I need medicine I 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.899
 go in the first woman to sit 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.609
 found at no point he was an actor of 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.780
 my care path I have no time 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.829
 to do all the dentists' offices 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.829
 to compare prices 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.680
 finally the finding is clear enough 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.060
 the French are more and more difficult 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.220
 to navigate the health system 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.720
 is more and more areas where the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.640
 overtaking is possible there is 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.710
 more and more overruns there are 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.170
 more and more remains to charge so 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.930
 Santeclair was born from this observation we 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.670
 help consumers to have a role 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.200
 more active in the face of these overruns and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.479
 facing health professionals 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.610
 we created three major types of 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.350
 services a first service and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.180
 quote analysis the people we 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.830
 send an estimate and inform them about 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.140
 the price is what is expensive cheap 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.060
 a network service we provide 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.160
 addresses of health professionals 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.780
 partners in which consumers 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.700
 can go but where do they get 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.950
 preferential rates for commitments 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.110
 on quality finally we have some 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.399
 services on the internet that help them 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.399
 to navigate the health system 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.140

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.070
 I can suggest that you perform the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.800
 care at one of our surgeons 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.790
 dentists partners the economy would 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.790
 from 750 euros 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.820
 a network of health professionals in 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.170
 what is the mechanism is enough 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.040
 simple as we have several 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.860
 millions of customers 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.420
 we get great rates 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.730
 when negotiating with 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.010
 health professionals but also 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.050
 quality standards and services for 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.880
 our customers then the quality it is 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.550
 actually has three levels at 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.020
 time of the tender in the 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.910
 key professional health contracts 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.470
 sign the second level this is at the 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.330
 selection of professionals in the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.310
 network and the third level that is 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.690
 more importantly they control that 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.700
 we will do for the duration of 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.700
 life of the partnership control that will aim 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.160
 to verify that the commitments 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.140
 for example are respected 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.790
 in lace the health professionals 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.770
 agrees to work according to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.300
 recommendations the repositories of the 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.610
 high authority of health which is the organ 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.350
 supreme in terms of quality of care 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.880
 of health in France and makes 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.770
 recommendations of the standards 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.080
 will focus on treatments 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.780
 Orthodontics Hygiene Safety 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.350
 materials and devitalization in 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.209
 optical 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.480
 team 1 will ask the 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.570
 health professionals to justify that 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.910
 the product sold and the product that 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.239
 was charged what can 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.489
 pass 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.110
 there may be an error there can 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.180
 to have a fraudulent maneuver 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.920
 health professional in all cases 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.820
 the first thing we will do 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.100
 we are going to ask the 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.660
 professionals often repair it 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.019
 translated by a refund to the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.690
 customer 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.790
 and then depending on the nature of 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.500
 the mistake be there is going to be a simple 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.090
 formal notice not to start again and 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.040
 then we will actually controlled that 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.590
 it does not happen again or we'll 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.239
 exclude the professional from 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.400
 health 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.950
 so in the optical domain we get 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.709
 40% off the greens for 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.540
 compared to the same equipment and 15% on 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.420
 the frames in the field of 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.670
 audioprostheses we get 45% of 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.590
 reduction in the dental field this is 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.079
 15% discount on rates 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.680
 means practiced on surgery 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.650
 refractive 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.299
 it's about 45% off 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.060
 near the same amount as in the field 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.860
 hearing aids and then finally in the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.460
 field of dieticians it is about 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.870
 15% discount 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.240
 I felt clear in 2007 we went 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.270
 interested in the potential of the internet 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.530
 including the ability to issue 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.060
 information and allow 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.170
 system users care to do 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.640
 arbitrations 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.950
 the first of these applications 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.840
 developed on the web has self 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.430
 medication 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.370
 an implication that note the 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.320
 non-prescription drugs based 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.850
 their effectiveness of their tolerance and 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.480
 which indicate the price the average price of 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.880
 sale on the market more recently we 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.440
 have adapted to the smartphone format what 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.700
 allows as we are here now 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.930
 today in a pharmacy of 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.810
 choose your medicine based on your 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.630
 note without symptoms and check the

 selling price since self-medication 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.570
 Santeclair has made several 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.810
 other web applications 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.570
 the no smoking challenge that helps 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.730
 relearn how to live without your bare hand 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.400
 very clear which is an application 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:27.500
 dedicated to learning good 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.210
 more food hygiene habits 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.010
 recently an application that allows for 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.400
