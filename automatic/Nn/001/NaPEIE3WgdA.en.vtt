00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello here is one for giger me 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.179
 I'm currently in Frankfurt on the samsung 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.540
 Event in the gallery quite nice 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:18.029
 this is the samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.730
 mini presented the specs were to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.779
 Yesterday I loved already 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.140
 finally the possibility with that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.750
 also looks at itself directly 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.400
 my first impression it is probably quite 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.349
 I have to say nice phone 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.189
 do not think so now I have to completely 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.800
 honestly I'm a bit 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.100
 pity that samsung from a flagship 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.860
 now to the person smaller litter 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.899
 as such, the team has done so 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.629
 but definitely for the time being 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.489
 interesting just for people like that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.160
 look for the device in the middle segment 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.469
 It's definitely not a high-end device like that 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.020
 that is now the samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.989
 but here everything is so a bit 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.590
 more knowledge slimmed down so the specs 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.159
 are not quite as good as they are now 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.590
 of galaxy s3 knows here is a 1 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.610
 gigahertz dualcore processor in it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.020
 I do not really want that either 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.540
 whole sex is again enumerate because 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.960
 they are all in the article 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.070
 in it 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.479
 In any case, this is just the white one 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.200
 version that I just to hand the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.290
 There are also whole in pebble blue 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.780
 that's just like the galaxy s3 too 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.710
 otherwise in the same color issues 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.350
 design here 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.790
 Of course, the whole looks very similar 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.240
 as well as stupid if not because 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.460
 then you could call yourself that 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.259
 otherwise yes you just like them anymore 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.530
 can expect from the device up here 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.400
 headphone jack down here is the usb 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.570
 entrance 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.510
 if I might make the sharp 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.400
 who could be wonderful here on the 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.710
 side a rocker switch for the 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.570
 volume on the other side of the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.060
 power button and yes something to the devices 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.690
 It can be pretty straightforward to say it 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.070
 is just a lot of plastic again 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.720
 but I did know about it yesterday 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.810
 of course, that's how it is 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.220
 The device is in use every day and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.450
 if you pull the knife pocket and 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.800
 subfield is also nice somehow 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.200
 if that does not break right and 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.390
 is broken because of that is high quality 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.400
 Plastic here makes sense in any case 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.800
 which I personally like pretty much 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.950
 on the device is direct from home 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.650
 android 4.1 installed i try it 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:39.780
 Unfortunately, everything is included in the menu here 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:41.730
 a little out of focus here so 4.1.1 not 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.420
 wrote everything is just 412 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.100
 come out of google but so much 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.730
 more current than this is really 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.070
 Not 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.840
 I have to say I like it personally 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.890
 the white version of the device 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.930
 a little bit better just looks 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.420
 a little more noble from this blue plastic 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.770
 has a little bit that works 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.190
 just a little bit 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.960
 first of all, the white must have nothing 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.890
 rather, fingerprints and thats me 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.180
 it just does not look quite that way 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.690
 high quality as just the white 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.240
 version 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.470
 otherwise hardware button down here i 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.150
 I'm not such a big friend anymore 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.730
 ours I use the galaxy nexus 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.100
 but will probably be the one or the other 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.300
 others are happy anyway 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.060
 which of course also good on the device 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.560
 Is that easy with one 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.900
 Hand can serve something at the four inches 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.300
 display is so this only three times 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.520
 Hand had that then an 8 inches 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.600
 display has that will partly still 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.100
 a bit awkward with a 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.050
 hand to use is absolutely no 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.950
 So problem for people with something 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.850
 Smaller hands recommended 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.560
 as far as I know is the non-binding 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:47.970
 Price is currently 399 euros 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.710
 then quite a lot of money but like that 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.570
 most of the equipment is the case 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.540
 will be the after a short time then too 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.950
 much less cost otherwise here 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.520
 from the side that is a bit 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.870
 thicker than the original three 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.860
 I think just under 10 mm thick and 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.930
 a difference is definitely 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.010
 behind the design what out of place 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.570
 technical reasons little different 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.220
 here is the lightning and 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.550
 down and the speaker on the 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.530
 otherwise, in any case, the 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.970
 Semite gets you in the shop 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.400
 should look if you are looking 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.230
 after the new year upper middle class 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:27.290
 device and I 'm still looking at it 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.850
 a little bit the invite here 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.640
 I've never been here before 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.380
 flagship store in frankfurt maybe 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:39.070
 you can take pictures with the girls themselves 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:42.790
 also engine and wish you one more 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.790
 the evening until soon
