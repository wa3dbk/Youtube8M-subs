00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.380 
start doing that chain stitch and it's
actually<00:00:05.160> really<00:00:05.310> simple<00:00:05.759> once<00:00:05.940> you<00:00:06.089> start

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
I'm going to do I'm just going to catch

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.350 
I'm going to do I'm just going to catch
a<00:00:13.080> little<00:00:13.230> piece<00:00:13.700> just<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> back<00:00:15.120> side

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
a little piece just on the back side

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.210 
a little piece just on the back side
don't<00:00:15.809> put<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.410> through<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> front<00:00:16.859> side<00:00:17.039> like

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
don't put it through the front side like

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.160 
don't put it through the front side like
this<00:00:17.460> just<00:00:17.699> catch<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> back<00:00:18.900> side

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170

this just catch it on the back side
where<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.500> comes<00:00:19.650> right<00:00:20.039> out<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.180> edge

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
where it comes right out on the edge

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.310 
where it comes right out on the edge
okay<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.660> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.019> pull<00:00:25.289> it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to give another loop so it doesn't come

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.459 
to give another loop so it doesn't come
out<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.340> all<00:00:56.520> okay<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.390> now<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> nice

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
to make another loop right next to it

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.609 
to make another loop right next to it
just<00:01:04.860> grab<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> tiny<00:01:05.880> bit<00:01:06.320> then<00:01:07.320> we're<00:01:07.439> going<00:01:07.560> to

have this in this piece and we're going
to<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> chain<00:01:12.570> stitch<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.170> these<00:01:13.439> two

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to make a chain stitch with these two

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.670 
to make a chain stitch with these two
pieces<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> loop<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
pieces we have the loop here and the the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920 
pieces we have the loop here and the the
piece<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.369> needle<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.810> kind

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
piece with the needle here we just kind

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.359 
piece with the needle here we just kind
of<00:01:18.960> forget<00:01:19.229> about<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.560> needle<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> minute

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
of forget about the needle for a minute

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.929 
of forget about the needle for a minute
and<00:01:20.750> what<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.619> put<00:01:22.860> our<00:01:23.070> finger<00:01:23.610> our

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
and what we do is we put our finger our

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.390 
and what we do is we put our finger our
forefinger<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.200> our<00:01:25.350> thumb<00:01:25.560> through<00:01:26.130> this

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
forefinger and our thumb through this

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.100

you're going to forget about the loop

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.330 
you're going to forget about the loop
and<00:01:41.610> let<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.250> your

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.230 
down there you go and when I'm pulling
it<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.320> pull<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.710> straight<00:01:52.829> out

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
it like this you pull it straight out

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.670 
it like this you pull it straight out
there<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:54.960> do<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.200> over<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
there you go and you just do it over and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.429 
there you go and you just do it over and
over<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.450> called<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.750> chain<00:01:58.049> stitch

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
over and this is called a chain stitch

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.819 
over and this is called a chain stitch
in<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.829> 5<00:01:59.149> if<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.299> wanted<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.899> could<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.590> whole

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
in a 5 if I wanted to I could this whole

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.679 
in a 5 if I wanted to I could this whole
thing<00:02:02.100> would<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.340> come<00:02:02.670> apart<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.360> pulled

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
thing would just come apart if I pulled

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.380 
thing would just come apart if I pulled
this<00:02:03.960> needle<00:02:04.380> away<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.610> let<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.939> loop<00:02:06.180> just

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
this needle away and let this loop just

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.749 
this needle away and let this loop just
slide<00:02:07.020> through<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.979> would<00:02:08.129> go<00:02:08.250> back<00:02:08.520> and

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
slide through here it would go back and

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.760 
slide through here it would go back and
to<00:02:09.420> nothing<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.899> would<00:02:09.959> all<00:02:10.140> come<00:02:10.379> apart

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
to nothing it would all come apart

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.840 
to nothing it would all come apart
that's<00:02:11.160> why<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.430> called<00:02:11.610> chain<00:02:12.000> stitch

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
that's why it's called chain stitch

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.670 
that's why it's called chain stitch
but<00:02:13.540> I'm<00:02:13.720> just<00:02:13.870> going<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.110> keep<00:02:14.320> going<00:02:16.680> keep

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
but I'm just going to keep going keep

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.930 
but I'm just going to keep going keep
grabbing<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.370> go<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:21.700> just

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
grabbing it here we go and this just

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.470 
grabbing it here we go and this just
makes<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.210> really<00:02:22.750> big<00:02:22.990> thick<00:02:23.980> piece<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.520> thread

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
makes a really big thick piece of thread

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.650 
makes a really big thick piece of thread
it's<00:02:26.470> almost<00:02:26.770> just<00:02:27.010> like<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.550> elastic<00:02:28.270> but
