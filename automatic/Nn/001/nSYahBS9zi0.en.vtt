00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.950
 China 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.520
 hitchhiking and now we are in hong kong teams 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.599

 flying home and recording this video x 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:33.560
 truth well so that you know what 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:36.860
 the adventure was very successful 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.140
 many interesting adventures recorded 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.040
 many videos are now ready twenty 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.690
 eight episodes 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.880

 many videos are already uploaded and ready for 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.220
 publications they will go out three times in 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.900
 a week before us and in fact we have well 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.570
 Here I personally have pretty 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.870
 mixed now I feel because with 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.300
 one side, I'm sad because it's 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.390
 ended and on the other I am very happy 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.619
 what it was because literally 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.310
 seemingly quite recently we only 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.140
 planned this journey and even 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.380
 just made the decision it did not 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.549
 exercise but then 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.549
 the circumstances are so we 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.860
 let's go and I thought how would it be at all 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.259
 how do we go on china too 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.480
 unknown country we have nothing there 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.950
 we know 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.289
 there was no somewhat exciting 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.930
 plan it all in deed 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.700
 it turned out that China is really very 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.070
 cool i was very friendly 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.200
 I am an incredibly interesting country and we 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.000
 we feel something in a month was enough for us 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.310
 just to literally 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.220
 to touch 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.159
 fingertips up to this marvelous 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.180
 country 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.910
 chat a little 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.330
 some i inhabit to china very 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.390
 impressed us greatly and we hope that 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.430
 we will be able to repeat this adventure 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.500
 but in a larger volume i.e. more 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.729
