00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:13.730
 in this next video and does not signal a simple and fast way 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.929
 should raining any exercise on your blue hen's skin without the need to 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.359
 use formulas 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.220
 which could join the government 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 instead of using formulas we will use a table 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.679
 how to do this table 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.649
 how is it being one of the smallest 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.440
 as an example of pa 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.780
 an allocation of representatives of the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.980
 while on the underside of the key representing August 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.350
 I do here 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.610
 in line with the little worlds 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.350
 a brigadeiro 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.180

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.740
 miami heat 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.130
 compass deflection 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.390
 on the solo album 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.760
 Similarly 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.500
 the gap of the flags goals 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.510
 nigeria 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.510
 I'm a marionete 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 we gave it all 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.680
 this day 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.680
 David Luiz 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.160
 next step 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.159
 the cbn 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.509
 17ºc in seven away matches 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.840
 the reading in the table 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 therefore in the opposite direction cotton 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.020
 our lands 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.020
 double of his work 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.110
 on the left side of the table 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.510
 the calculation of Berlin correction 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.579
 on the right side 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.579
 Another order 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.190
 billion on the right side 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.800
 on the last day of December 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.880
 on the outside 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.829
 in the system 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.050
 under the table top 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.050
 like the collection of pis and cofins 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.409
 it's a little saying 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.710
 following the signs other members 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.129
 In September 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.759
 he perceives 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.789
 less is more 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:21.469
 as I said after this table with considering the pipoqueiro exercise 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.509
 passed a good request 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.509
 with much less probability of errors than restoring a little 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.569
 supposing the voting exercise 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.769
 25 degrees inclination with the lieutenant 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.889
 5 degrees in the country of resource misuse 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.109
 in the curriculum two weeks 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.109
 the list of the main imported products 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.779
 the lowest value in history 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.569
 no broker 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.569
 a goal from forlán times a estimated time 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:51.939
 let's take 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.169
 It's the same thing I do. 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.429
 Fernandes 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.869
 small suri doctor compass drift 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:01.419
 the same value 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:02.599
 destiny 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.199
 from martin olsen 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:07.180
 then by exercises per month 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.389
 a 45 degree attorney's office 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.389
 a true 55 degree 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.659
 for a real 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.959
 45 degrees 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.959
 mugabe 55 degrees 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:25.149
 then 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:29.879
 the exercise asks for the popular values ​​here in our table is 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.809
 work 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.869
 I will do this 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.589
 Let's start with example. 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:40.319
 the new world mt 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.079
 We will have to find Iran. 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.179
 look to the right 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:46.729
 or to the left 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.629
 two wagons 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.229
 the director strikes 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.659
 not only has a bus door 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.879
 Bruno the other side of him 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.919
 on the left side 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.079
 yesterday two authors 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.919
 these two games will get some joy 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.119
 then on the left with your right shadow 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:10.459
 try to guess everything indicates the sense of being comprehensive 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.279
 to circular 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.999
 this one here 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:17.599
 beside him 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:18.809
 the minister 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:23.740
 then from left to right today that has sign of more so the club 

00:04:23.739 --> 00:04:26.739
 Russian plus two games to find a name 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:29.270
 57 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.650
 but 25 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.749
 80 real 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:33.569

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.240
 I do not have two goals on the right side 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.669
 I have two loves on the left side 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.550
 how do I do 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.380
 from the left I'm going to get his value 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.090
 yes it's for us 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.340
 bridget jones left and right luis that I am 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.360
 more than ten days 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.490
 70 real 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.490
 the same way I can find the classes 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.930
 I do not use 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.469
 the body 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.389
 without lose 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.740
 to the right 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.629
 measured by bush 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.629
 I think we can win a show to try sexier 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.300
 it is understood by some course 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.659
 35 degrees 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.289
 of class the course 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.729
 now what she called to give 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.729
 I melted 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.029
 at least that's what he wants 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:35.749
 precatory 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:38.479
 when to train 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.300
 inside somewhere 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.300
 in this case 55 degrees 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:47.419
 lia 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.650
 I'm going to surrender 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.740
 in this case 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.749
 45 degrees 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:55.779
 a cruel 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.779
 my accident 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.639
 there is some 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.129
 or celebrated with the psdb 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:08.009
 is negative 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.410
 the difference between 45 and 55 of 10 degrees 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.939
 - and should lose 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.989
 the drink will always be the same value of the bonus for performance but with signal 

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:22.279
 negative 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:24.389
 in this carnival 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.930
 but he 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.759
 another way to find in the light in the table 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.309
 those detained lime 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:34.309
 in this case the term of one year the beginning of a poem 

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:40.819
 he denied 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:41.839
 the whisper 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.559
 what was paid 

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:46.360
 the price of wheat abitrigo 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.300
 You try to make civil 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.419
 so I'll have a maximum 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.509
 I want to find a space 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.349
 destined for here were 14 in the parana brazilian 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:00.059
 if you do not work 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:02.270
 it's the scene of the accident 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.270
 let's consider 10 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.960
 85 '- 10 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.639
 75 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.119
 Carlos 

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:15.119
 the brazilian 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.680
 I just did not make a red-black goal 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.029
 I have the boy 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:23.800
 I find the aid 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.750
 he lived 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.900
 they the bottom-up system tie here 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.270
 I'll catch up with the idea that their mother 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:36.849
 plus ten real 

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:40.779
 watch the video next to him 

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:44.059
 I have to do some exercise of its role 

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:46.379
 sure on test day 

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:50.619
 the site will have much less probability of analysis if you study trying to decorate 

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:51.919
 form 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.919
 good studies 

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.119
 and until the next good
