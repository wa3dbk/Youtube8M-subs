00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
with the death knight we thought the

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.890 
with the death knight we thought the
story<00:01:45.850> kind<00:01:46.120> of<00:01:46.180> made<00:01:46.330> sense<00:01:46.540> that<00:01:46.750> you're

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
story kind of made sense that you're

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.950

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
for some kind of killer finisher we do

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.270 
for some kind of killer finisher we do
want<00:03:38.109> to<00:03:38.170> use<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.319> lot<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:38.560> stabs<00:03:38.859> and<00:03:39.099> pissed

want to use a lot of stabs and pissed
weapons<00:03:39.670> these<00:03:40.090> aren't<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.420> only<00:03:40.540> weapons

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
weapons these aren't the only weapons

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.690 
weapons these aren't the only weapons
they're<00:03:41.139> going<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.319> use<00:03:41.349> but<00:03:41.980> we<00:03:42.430> thought

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
they're going to use but we thought

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.330 
they're going to use but we thought
they're<00:03:43.329> very<00:03:43.480> signature<00:03:43.780> for<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.650> monk<00:03:44.829> we

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
they're very signature for the monk we

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.619 
they're very signature for the monk we
think<00:03:45.579> this<00:03:45.730> will<00:03:45.819> allow<00:03:46.000> us<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.209> put<00:03:46.449> a<00:03:46.480> lot

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
think this will allow us to put a lot

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.030 
think this will allow us to put a lot
more<00:03:46.780> fist<00:03:47.019> weapons<00:03:47.379> in<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.590> game<00:03:47.620> they're

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
more fist weapons in the game they're

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.680 
more fist weapons in the game they're
really<00:03:48.250> cool<00:03:48.489> they<00:03:49.060> don't<00:03:49.239> quite<00:03:49.419> have<00:03:49.629> enough

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
really cool they don't quite have enough

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.759 
really cool they don't quite have enough
users<00:03:50.079> yet<00:03:50.440> so<00:03:50.739> expect<00:03:51.069> to<00:03:51.099> see<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.280> lot<00:03:51.430> more

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.380 

they<00:03:57.769> can<00:03:57.950> also<00:03:58.069> use<00:03:58.340> on<00:03:58.579> one<00:03:58.760> handed<00:03:59.060> axes

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
they can also use on one handed axes

of<00:04:34.280> capitalize<00:04:34.820> on<00:04:34.870> what<00:04:35.870> we<00:04:36.020> already<00:04:36.169> know

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
of capitalize on what we already know

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.680 
of capitalize on what we already know
works<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:37.099> but<00:04:38.000> just<00:04:38.120> try<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.240> mix<00:04:38.419> it<00:04:38.539> up<00:04:38.599> a

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
works and but just try to mix it up a

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.270 
works and but just try to mix it up a
little<00:04:38.720> bit<00:04:41.139> so<00:04:42.139> they<00:04:42.500> have<00:04:42.680> it's<00:04:43.039> an<00:04:43.130> energy

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
little bit so they have it's an energy

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.770 
little bit so they have it's an energy
like<00:04:43.610> resource<00:04:44.030> and<00:04:44.240> that<00:04:44.330> it<00:04:44.419> slowly

like resource and that it slowly

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.320 
like resource and that it slowly
regenerates<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:46.580> use<00:04:46.729> this<00:04:46.910> primarily

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
regenerates and you use this primarily

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.270 
regenerates and you use this primarily
