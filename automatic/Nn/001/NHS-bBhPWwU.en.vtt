00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
kind of curve down all but one I saw had

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.140 
kind of curve down all but one I saw had
sort<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.409> light<00:01:34.710> light<00:01:35.340> kind<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.790> painting

sort of light light kind of painting

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.660 
sort of light light kind of painting
where<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.780> orange<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.140> exposed<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.829> saw<00:01:38.430> one

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
where more orange is exposed I saw one

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.140 
where more orange is exposed I saw one
that<00:01:38.700> had<00:01:38.970> perfectly<00:01:39.509> painted<00:01:39.710> brown<00:01:40.710> hoops

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
that had perfectly painted brown hoops

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.789 
that had perfectly painted brown hoops
but<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.600> figure<00:01:42.899> had<00:01:43.079> more<00:01:43.290> cons<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.740> pros

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
but that figure had more cons and pros

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.319 
but that figure had more cons and pros
over<00:01:44.130> all<00:01:44.369> which<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.670> why<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> didn't<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.210> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
over all which is why I didn't get it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.700 
over all which is why I didn't get it
but<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:45.750> did<00:01:45.899> have<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> good<00:01:46.290> jump<00:01:46.530> suit

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
but that one did have a good jump suit

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.580 
but that one did have a good jump suit
some<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.399> excess<00:01:47.939> orange<00:01:48.390> paint<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.409> one's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
pretty good though I mean aside from

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.539 
pretty good though I mean aside from
those<00:01:51.540> little<00:01:51.840> brown<00:01:52.079> hoops<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.130> thigh

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
thing his outfit for the most part looks

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.280 
thing his outfit for the most part looks
really<00:01:55.560> good<00:01:56.479> almost<00:01:57.479> every<00:01:57.899> single<00:01:58.049> one<00:01:58.259> I

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
really good almost every single one I

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.340 
really good almost every single one I
saw<00:01:58.560> had<00:01:58.829> his<00:01:59.070> sort<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.460> black<00:02:00.049> toenail<00:02:01.049> claws

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
saw had his sort of black toenail claws

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.170 
saw had his sort of black toenail claws
kind<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.740> bleed<00:02:01.950> over<00:02:02.130> past<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> edge<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
kind of bleed over past the edge of the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.429 
kind of bleed over past the edge of the
nail<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.600> something<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.960> could<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.140> do

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
nail so something I could really do

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.219 
nail so something I could really do
about<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:05.360> all<00:02:06.360> them<00:02:06.719> had<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> really<00:02:07.140> really

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
about that all them had a really really

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.320 
about that all them had a really really
good<00:02:07.500> tail<00:02:07.860> paint<00:02:08.280> though<00:02:08.459> all<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:09.119> them<00:02:09.209> had

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
good tail paint though all of them had

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.699 
good tail paint though all of them had
the<00:02:09.479> stripes<00:02:09.780> painted<00:02:09.959> really<00:02:10.349> really<00:02:10.560> well

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
the stripes painted really really well

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.530 
the stripes painted really really well
now<00:02:11.400> while<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.610> may<00:02:11.790> have<00:02:11.910> some<00:02:12.090> knit<00:02:12.239> picks<00:02:12.390> for

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
now while I may have some knit picks for

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.820 
now while I may have some knit picks for
the<00:02:12.629> paint<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.110> how<00:02:13.260> that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the paint like how that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.260 
the paint like how that
on<00:02:13.890> panel<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.490> fully<00:02:14.670> painted<00:02:14.910> there's<00:02:15.210> a

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
on panel is it fully painted there's a

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.150 
on panel is it fully painted there's a
big<00:02:15.420> glob<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.930> orange<00:02:16.320> on<00:02:16.500> there<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
big glob of orange on there the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.040 
big glob of orange on there the
sculpting<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.210> little<00:02:18.420> body<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.840> really

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
sculpting on this little body is really

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.540 
sculpting on this little body is really
really<00:02:19.290> good<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.710> can<00:02:19.740> see<00:02:20.040> all<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.400> little

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
really good you can see all the little

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.180 
really good you can see all the little
detail<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.030> gun<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:22.350> think<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.800> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
detail on the gun and I think the the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.800 
detail on the gun and I think the the
sculpting<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.610> went<00:02:23.850> into<00:02:23.970> his<00:02:24.210> like<00:02:24.420> front

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
sculpting that went into his like front

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.480 
sculpting that went into his like front
outfit<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.470> all<00:02:25.560> little<00:02:25.860> straps<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.430> go

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
outfit and all little straps that go

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.400 
outfit and all little straps that go
across<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.270> think<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:27.990> looks<00:02:28.140> really<00:02:28.290> really

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
across it I think it looks really really

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.870 
across it I think it looks really really
good

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
good

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.010 
good
now<00:02:29.880> my<00:02:30.030> biggest<00:02:30.210> nitpick<00:02:30.570> about<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.900> of

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
now my biggest nitpick about this of

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.660 
now my biggest nitpick about this of
course<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.710> it's<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.980> bobble<00:02:32.280> head<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.640> I

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
course is that it's a bobble head and I

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.580 
course is that it's a bobble head and I
hate<00:02:33.210> bobble<00:02:33.510> heads<00:02:33.660> not<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.260> because<00:02:34.500> I

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
hate bobble heads not just because I

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.950 
hate bobble heads not just because I
think<00:02:34.650> they're<00:02:34.890> silly<00:02:35.240> but<00:02:36.240> also<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.600> can't

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
think they're silly but also you can't

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.190 
think they're silly but also you can't
turn<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.380> head<00:02:37.740> like<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.430> other

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
turn the head like you can on other

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.080 
turn the head like you can on other
regular<00:02:40.200> Funko<00:02:40.500> pop<00:02:40.710> figures<00:02:41.100> sometimes<00:02:41.940> just

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
regular Funko pop figures sometimes just

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.400 
regular Funko pop figures sometimes just
turning<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.390> head<00:02:42.600> makes<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.110> figure<00:02:43.320> more

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
turning a head makes a figure more

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.110 
turning a head makes a figure more
dynamic<00:02:43.860> if<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.160> gun<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.400> kind<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.790> pointed

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
dynamic if it's gun is kind of pointed

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.790 
dynamic if it's gun is kind of pointed
in<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.420> direction<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.840> looking<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.770> know

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
in the direction it's looking you know

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.640 
in the direction it's looking you know
like<00:02:47.460> this<00:02:47.790> versus<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.780> like<00:02:49.320> having<00:02:49.560> that

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
like this versus that I like having that

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.830 
like this versus that I like having that
control<00:02:49.980> over<00:02:50.010> figure<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.700> also<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.720> can

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
control over figure and also you can

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.120 
control over figure and also you can
kind<00:02:52.020> of<00:02:52.050> see<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.320> his<00:02:52.410> heads<00:02:52.650> tilt<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.070> little

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
kind of see that his heads tilt a little

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.199 
kind of see that his heads tilt a little
more<00:02:53.400> downward<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:54.590> mean<00:02:55.590> ideally<00:02:56.209> there

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
more downward I mean ideally there

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.280 
more downward I mean ideally there
wouldn't<00:02:57.450> be<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.630> much<00:02:57.780> room<00:02:57.959> in<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.140> back

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
wouldn't be this much room in the back

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.630 
wouldn't be this much room in the back
and<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.800> wouldn't<00:02:58.950> be<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.160> close<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.550> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
and it wouldn't be this close in the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.810 
and it wouldn't be this close in the
front<00:02:59.910> it'd<00:03:00.510> be<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.680> know<00:03:01.770> more<00:03:02.010> like<00:03:02.160> this<00:03:02.400> so

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
front it'd be you know more like this so

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.150 
front it'd be you know more like this so
that<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.410> mean<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.650> camera<00:03:04.800> kind<00:03:05.100> of

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
that I mean I have the camera kind of

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.040 
that I mean I have the camera kind of
tilted<00:03:05.459> down<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> little<00:03:05.850> bit<00:03:05.970> but<00:03:06.390> I'd<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:06.870> if

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
tilted down a little bit but I'd like if

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.940 
tilted down a little bit but I'd like if
his<00:03:07.170> head<00:03:07.320> was<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.470> little<00:03:07.500> more<00:03:07.740> upright

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
his head was a little more upright

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.980 
his head was a little more upright
instead<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.400> tilting<00:03:08.640> down<00:03:08.970> however<00:03:09.660> he's<00:03:09.959> a

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
instead of tilting down however he's a

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.900 
instead of tilting down however he's a
badass<00:03:10.230> character<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.950> tilting<00:03:11.790> his<00:03:11.850> head

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
badass character so tilting his head

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.490 
badass character so tilting his head
down<00:03:12.240> does<00:03:12.510> make<00:03:12.690> him<00:03:12.810> look<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.110> little<00:03:13.260> more

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
down does make him look a little more

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.010 
down does make him look a little more
badass<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.910> threatening<00:03:15.240> so<00:03:15.450> that's<00:03:15.630> kind<00:03:15.930> of

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
badass and threatening so that's kind of

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.199 
badass and threatening so that's kind of
cool<00:03:16.080> but<00:03:16.550> sometimes<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:17.910> know<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.030> get

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
cool but sometimes you know you get

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.420 
cool but sometimes you know you get
figures<00:03:18.690> heads<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.080> are<00:03:19.200> like<00:03:19.430> totally

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
figures heads that are like totally

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.520 
figures heads that are like totally
crooked<00:03:20.610> or<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:21.030> off<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.510> side<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.959> I

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
crooked or like off to the side and I

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.810 
crooked or like off to the side and I
think<00:03:22.590> having<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.040> bobble<00:03:23.430> head<00:03:23.550> spring

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
think having that bobble head spring

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.720 
think having that bobble head spring
just<00:03:24.060> really<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.480> such<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.690> negative<00:03:25.440> factor<00:03:25.730> to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
just really is such a negative factor to

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.530 
just really is such a negative factor to
like<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.090> perfect<00:03:27.690> sculpt<00:03:28.350> pose<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.950> head<00:03:29.160> I

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
like the perfect sculpt pose of a head I

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.790 
like the perfect sculpt pose of a head I
can't<00:03:30.540> stand<00:03:30.780> bald<00:03:30.989> heads<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.410> hope<00:03:31.590> one

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
can't stand bald heads and I hope one

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.130 
can't stand bald heads and I hope one
day<00:03:31.920> Funko<00:03:32.340> can<00:03:32.519> just<00:03:32.670> stop<00:03:32.970> putting<00:03:33.720> Springs

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
day Funko can just stop putting Springs

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.800
