prepare julienned vegetables here and

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.300 
prepare julienned vegetables here and
basically<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.330> French<00:00:18.720> terminology<00:00:19.410> and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
basically it's a French terminology and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.960 
basically it's a French terminology and
it's<00:00:20.460> just<00:00:20.670> very<00:00:21.359> thin<00:00:21.660> matchstick<00:00:22.230> buttons

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970

cut it all evenly as you can see I took

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.010 
cut it all evenly as you can see I took
one<00:00:34.649> side<00:00:34.950> away<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.760> carrot<00:00:36.180> give<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
one side away from the carrot give it a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.889 
one side away from the carrot give it a
flat<00:00:37.260> base<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.010> then<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:38.940> cut<00:00:39.149> another<00:00:39.629> side

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
flat base and then we cut another side

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.160 
flat base and then we cut another side
away<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.460> then<00:00:41.480> just<00:00:42.480> cut<00:00:42.690> away<00:00:42.809> even<00:00:43.410> strips

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.250 
away and then just cut away even strips
and<00:00:47.059> then<00:00:48.059> cut<00:00:48.120> them<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> same<00:00:48.989> thickness

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and then cut them the same thickness

00:00:49.260 --> 00:01:02.779 
and then cut them the same thickness
again<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:00.629> I'm<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.789> moving

we're just going to Nick it away trying
to<00:01:22.470> keep<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> florets<00:01:23.130> all<00:01:23.310> roughly<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> same

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
to keep the florets all roughly the same

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.850 
to keep the florets all roughly the same
size<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.720> they<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:24.930> cook<00:01:25.110> evenly<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:28.710> good

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
size so they all cook evenly the good

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.719 
size so they all cook evenly the good
thing<00:01:29.040> about<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.810> head<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.930> broccoli<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.729> all

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
thing about a head of broccoli is all

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.160 
thing about a head of broccoli is all
around<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> outside<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.659> florets<00:01:34.049> are

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
around the outside the florets are

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.660 
around the outside the florets are
always<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> same<00:01:34.829> size<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.220> then<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
always the same size but then you get to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.649 
always the same size but then you get to
the<00:01:35.759> middle<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.180> start<00:01:36.420> getting<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the middle and they start getting a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
the middle and they start getting a
little<00:01:36.900> bit<00:01:36.990> smaller<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.340> what<00:01:38.460> I'm<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.610> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
little bit smaller so what I'm going to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.069 
little bit smaller so what I'm going to
do<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.360> try<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.630> keep<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> same

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
do for that to try and keep it the same

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.530 
do for that to try and keep it the same
size<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.530> cut<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> top<00:01:40.979> off<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.549> then

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
size just cut the top off there and then

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.080 
size just cut the top off there and then
you<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.259> cut<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.649> half<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.700> rip<00:01:44.909> it

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you just cut it in half and just rip it

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.370 
you just cut it in half and just rip it
so<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.689> keep<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.960> natural<00:01:46.200> shape

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
to overcook at later stage the peas are

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.280 
to overcook at later stage the peas are
not<00:03:47.060> going<00:03:47.210> to<00:03:47.270> give<00:03:47.390> anything<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.750> overcook

not going to give anything to overcook
at<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.470> later<00:03:48.650> stage<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:49.250> broccoli<00:03:49.760> I'm<00:03:50.120> doing

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
at a later stage the broccoli I'm doing

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.910 
at a later stage the broccoli I'm doing
towards<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.780> end<00:03:50.930> there's<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.320> possibility<00:03:51.710> of

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
towards the end there's a possibility of

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.740 
towards the end there's a possibility of
little<00:03:52.310> pieces<00:03:52.460> of<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.760> florets<00:03:53.150> falling<00:03:53.630> off

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
little pieces of the florets falling off

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.360 
little pieces of the florets falling off
into<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.110> water<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:54.770> will<00:03:54.920> discolor

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
into the water and that will discolor

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.400 
into the water and that will discolor
the<00:03:55.460> water<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:56.120> add<00:03:56.540> flavor<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.230> water

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
the water and add flavor to the water

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.690 
the water and add flavor to the water
which<00:03:57.620> is<00:03:57.740> something<00:03:57.920> we<00:03:58.130> don't<00:03:58.250> really<00:03:58.520> want

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
which is something we don't really want

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.490 
which is something we don't really want
to<00:03:58.730> do<00:03:58.910> if<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.420> broccoli<00:03:59.750> itself<00:04:00.110> starts

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
to do if the broccoli itself starts

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.870 
to do if the broccoli itself starts
breaking<00:04:00.860> apart<00:04:00.980> then<00:04:01.310> you're<00:04:01.460> overcooking

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
breaking apart then you're overcooking

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.300 
breaking apart then you're overcooking
it<00:04:02.060> this<00:04:02.270> is<00:04:02.420> absolutely<00:04:02.960> perfect<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:04.040> stalks

going to be nice and crunchy the florets

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.680 
going to be nice and crunchy the florets
itself<00:04:08.270> will<00:04:08.420> be<00:04:08.540> nice<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.320> tender<00:04:10.690> straight

I learnt when I was a young lad was all
vegetables<00:05:14.030> above<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.450> ground<00:05:14.630> go<00:05:14.840> into

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
vegetables above the ground go into

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.110 
vegetables above the ground go into
boiling<00:05:15.500> salted<00:05:15.830> water<00:05:15.890> and<00:05:16.340> all<00:05:16.610> vegetables

below<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.510> ground<00:05:17.720> ie<00:05:17.990> carrots<00:05:18.500> go<00:05:18.890> into<00:05:19.220> cold

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
below the ground ie carrots go into cold

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.430 
below the ground ie carrots go into cold
water<00:05:19.820> bring<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.420> boil<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:20.780> then

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
water bring it to the boil and then

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.050 
water bring it to the boil and then
refresh<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.950> same<00:05:22.130> way<00:05:22.310> so<00:05:22.700> we've<00:05:22.820> got<00:05:22.970> our

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
refresh the same way so we've got our

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.270 
refresh the same way so we've got our
vegetables<00:05:23.540> here<00:05:23.660> ready<00:05:23.930> to<00:05:24.080> reheat<00:05:24.410> or<00:05:24.590> we

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
vegetables here ready to reheat or we

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.230 
vegetables here ready to reheat or we
can<00:05:25.400> keep<00:05:25.550> them<00:05:25.670> in<00:05:25.730> an<00:05:25.850> airtight<00:05:26.000> container

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
can keep them in an airtight container

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.450 
can keep them in an airtight container
in<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:26.810> fridge<00:05:27.080> for<00:05:27.140> no<00:05:27.410> more<00:05:27.590> than<00:05:27.740> 24<00:05:28.160> hours

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
in the fridge for no more than 24 hours

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.180 
in the fridge for no more than 24 hours
but<00:05:29.090> gonna<00:05:29.450> reheat<00:05:30.140> them<00:05:30.350> in<00:05:30.560> something<00:05:31.130> what

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
but gonna reheat them in something what

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.080 
but gonna reheat them in something what
we<00:05:31.310> call<00:05:31.460> an<00:05:31.580> emulsion<00:05:31.850> it's<00:05:32.180> 50%<00:05:32.600> water

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
we call an emulsion it's 50% water

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.920 
we call an emulsion it's 50% water
50<00:05:34.750> percent<00:05:35.080> water<00:05:36.210> so<00:05:37.210> we're<00:05:37.420> going<00:05:37.540> away<00:05:37.660> for

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
50 percent water so we're going away for

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:47.120 
50 percent water so we're going away for
the<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:39.310> water<00:05:39.550> and<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:40.210> pasta<00:05:40.480> to<00:05:40.630> emulsify

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.010 

maybe<00:05:48.130> I<00:05:48.190> that's<00:05:48.370> all<00:05:48.520> nicely<00:05:49.210> mixed<00:05:49.390> in<00:05:49.750> and

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
maybe I that's all nicely mixed in and

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.230 
maybe I that's all nicely mixed in and

the broccoli just let that reheat for a

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.880 
the broccoli just let that reheat for a
couple<00:06:06.040> of<00:06:06.100> minutes<00:06:07.080> so<00:06:08.080> we're<00:06:08.200> going<00:06:08.290> to<00:06:08.350> save

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
couple of minutes so we're going to save
