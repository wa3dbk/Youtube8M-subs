with the glaze so what I did use first
off<00:00:32.320> is<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.680> extreme<00:00:35.199> you<00:00:36.199> can<00:00:36.350> see<00:00:36.500> that<00:00:38.350> but

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
off is the extreme you can see that but

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.540 
off is the extreme you can see that but
yeah<00:00:40.309> that's<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.670> extreme<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:41.449> build<00:00:42.109> 2k<00:00:42.550> came

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
yeah that's the extreme I build 2k came

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.130 
yeah that's the extreme I build 2k came
over<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:43.940> with<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.449> primer<00:00:45.079> first<00:00:50.019> we<00:00:51.019> went

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
over it with the primer first we went

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.049 
over it with the primer first we went
over<00:00:51.469> with<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:52.809> develop<00:00:53.809> our<00:00:54.489> Nighthawk<00:00:55.489> b92

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
over with the develop our Nighthawk b92

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.200 
over with the develop our Nighthawk b92
P<00:00:56.390> with<00:00:56.929> the<00:00:57.019> Honda<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:58.370> there's<00:00:58.609> a<00:00:58.699> few

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
P with the Honda and there's a few

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.790 
P with the Honda and there's a few
different<00:00:59.269> ones<00:00:59.600> so<00:00:59.780> as<00:01:00.019> long<00:01:00.140> as<00:01:00.289> you<00:01:00.410> give

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
different ones so as long as you give

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.889 
different ones so as long as you give
them<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.070> I<00:01:01.519> think<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:02.120> eleventh<00:01:02.510> digit<00:01:02.809> of

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
them the I think the eleventh digit of

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.540 
them the I think the eleventh digit of
the<00:01:02.929> VIN<00:01:03.019> they'll<00:01:03.859> get<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.220> right<00:01:04.340> one

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
the VIN they'll get you the right one

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.270 
the VIN they'll get you the right one
because<00:01:05.390> there's<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.110> few<00:01:06.350> different<00:01:06.680> 92<00:01:07.040> piece

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
because there's a few different 92 piece

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880 
because there's a few different 92 piece
so<00:01:08.180> make<00:01:08.480> sure<00:01:08.510> if<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.870> do<00:01:08.990> have<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.200> be<00:01:09.350> 92<00:01:09.710> P

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
so make sure if you do have a be 92 P

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.480 
so make sure if you do have a be 92 P
paint<00:01:10.280> code<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:11.030> check<00:01:11.210> on<00:01:11.360> that<00:01:12.490> and

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
paint code that you check on that and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.590 
paint code that you check on that and
then<00:01:13.700> finally<00:01:14.320> after<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.620> base<00:01:15.770> coat<00:01:16.450> we<00:01:17.450> did

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
then finally after the base coat we did
