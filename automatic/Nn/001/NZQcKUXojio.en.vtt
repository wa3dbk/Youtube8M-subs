00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.870 
going to see that he does plant the bomb
abhi<00:04:20.930> and

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
abhi and

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.050 
abhi and
I<00:04:21.940> only<00:04:22.240> have<00:04:22.420> like<00:04:22.950> by<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:23.980> time<00:04:24.160> I've<00:04:24.700> slide

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
I only have like by the time I've slide

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.060 
I only have like by the time I've slide
a<00:04:25.090> hand<00:04:25.180> on<00:04:25.480> so<00:04:25.750> this<00:04:25.930> is<00:04:26.110> kind<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.470> sketchy<00:04:26.740> I'm

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
a hand on so this is kind of sketchy I'm

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.980 
a hand on so this is kind of sketchy I'm
trying<00:04:27.550> to<00:04:27.640> work<00:04:27.760> my<00:04:27.940> way<00:04:27.970> up<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.420> street<00:04:28.660> I

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
trying to work my way up the street I

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.380 
trying to work my way up the street I
check<00:04:29.710> behind<00:04:30.040> this<00:04:30.250> wall<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.880> he's<00:04:31.210> not

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
check behind this wall and he's not

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.160 
check behind this wall and he's not
there<00:04:31.660> so<00:04:32.700> my<00:04:33.700> last<00:04:33.850> guess<00:04:34.150> is<00:04:34.360> easy<00:04:34.720> their<00:04:34.930> top

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
there so my last guess is easy their top

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.440 
there so my last guess is easy their top
deck<00:04:35.470> or<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:36.220> my<00:04:36.340> left<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:36.820> I<00:04:36.940> throw<00:04:37.150> it's<00:04:37.270> done

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
deck or to my left and I throw it's done

that<00:05:31.840> was<00:05:32.350> really<00:05:32.410> unfortunate<00:05:33.250> but<00:05:33.750> right

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
that was really unfortunate but right

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.540 
that was really unfortunate but right
here<00:05:34.930> I<00:05:34.990> almost<00:05:35.320> died<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:35.860> it<00:05:35.980> was<00:05:36.040> 100

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
here I almost died and it was 100

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.920 
here I almost died and it was 100
percent<00:05:36.880> my<00:05:37.000> fault<00:05:37.240> i<00:05:37.330> went<00:05:37.510> to<00:05:37.600> a<00:05:37.630> really

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
percent my fault i went to a really

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.070 
percent my fault i went to a really
obvious<00:05:38.230> spot<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:39.130> i<00:05:39.940> could<00:05:40.390> not<00:05:40.420> even<00:05:40.660> see

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
obvious spot and i could not even see

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.560 
obvious spot and i could not even see
him<00:05:41.200> but<00:05:41.410> he<00:05:41.470> got<00:05:41.740> shots<00:05:42.070> into<00:05:42.310> my<00:05:42.460> dome<00:05:42.730> so<00:05:43.540> I

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
him but he got shots into my dome so I

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.700 
him but he got shots into my dome so I
dipped<00:05:44.020> and<00:05:44.640> I<00:05:45.640> think<00:05:46.540> it's<00:05:46.660> still<00:05:46.780> a<00:05:46.930> 3v3<00:05:47.410> at

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
dipped and I think it's still a 3v3 at

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.250 
dipped and I think it's still a 3v3 at
this<00:05:47.890> point<00:05:48.190> and<00:05:48.400> finally<00:05:49.270> tim<00:05:49.630> i<00:05:49.930> think<00:05:50.140> is

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
this point and finally tim i think is

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.990 
this point and finally tim i think is
timmy<00:05:50.500> tim<00:05:50.860> just<00:05:51.010> picked<00:05:51.220> up<00:05:51.340> one<00:05:51.550> kill<00:05:51.790> there

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
timmy tim just picked up one kill there

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.590 
timmy tim just picked up one kill there
and<00:05:52.210> then<00:05:52.870> I<00:05:53.790> think<00:05:54.790> he<00:05:55.000> picked<00:05:55.180> up<00:05:55.330> another

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
and then I think he picked up another

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.220 
and then I think he picked up another
right<00:05:55.810> here<00:05:57.480> but<00:05:58.480> I<00:05:58.510> figured<00:05:58.840> this<00:05:58.960> kid<00:05:59.140> was

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010
