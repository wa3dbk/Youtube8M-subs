00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:48.299 
chord getting two beats okay and it kind

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:52.039 
chord getting two beats okay and it kind
of<00:00:48.330> has<00:00:48.479> a<00:00:48.510> swing<00:00:49.049> feel<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.519> bad<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.049> do

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.049 
of has a swing feel so it's do bad to do

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.079

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
so the second half of an eighth note

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.259 
so the second half of an eighth note
pair<00:00:54.689> gets<00:00:55.260> less<00:00:55.589> time<00:00:56.070> right<00:00:56.400> and<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.000> gives

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
pair gets less time right and it gives

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.689 
pair gets less time right and it gives
us<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.600> swing<00:00:58.260> feel<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.159> it<00:00:59.339> kind<00:00:59.549> of<00:00:59.580> goes
