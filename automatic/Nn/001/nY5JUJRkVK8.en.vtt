00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.210
 welcome solano productivity program 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.210
 today we have a program designed so that you can see it as a family 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.080
 because we want to introduce them into the world of educational robotics for that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.610
 we are going to visit at home that has jose unique book in the neighborhood monte 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.730
 chicken coop is a robotics workshop for boys a place where they learn 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.290
 electromechanical elements and also above all things to work in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.280
 team 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.280
 tell us how you started with everything in front of March 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.150
 well it was something if france do not have wanting existence of robotics 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.350
 I was always passionate about the mechanisms the kings college put together things 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.720
 I've always had that activity 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.250
 but I had the opportunity to do a course a few years in the holy school 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.580
 and from there start working with all kinds 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.000
 the principle was mainly a live game a curiosity blunt the vice 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.980
 as sometimes it is said but little by little he has been working with the guys 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.109
 I've noticed that the child has checked what he said 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:23.670
 Books are listed 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.520
 the one that educational TV robotics really is a matter percent that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.720
 I should be 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.130
 very good basics 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.920
 in public schools in all schools 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.350
 for the properties and characteristics that the famous and expires 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.830
 What is it about social robotics? 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.920
 lucky lavigne alanis the power to use 1 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.480
 a joke 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.940
 built specially for those purposes 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.850
 where young kids have the opportunity to work in mechanics 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.040
 i in the southern part of the nation 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.820
 combining these two tasks tigers wants to put together the mechanism of a robot and 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.930
 then sit down at the computer 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.570
 and give life to move 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.219
 yes there in that combination of tasks the boy in works 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.829
 you have great benefits in what you do 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.889
 national won his training 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.889
 because as it points to 15 years experts in robotics 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.449
 but in him 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:24.720
 with the fact of working in electronic mechanics between physical actions 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.990
 the project mostly work as a team including dewalt many facets 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.250
 that make this 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.150
 the boy makes him say 'to sack' his person loyalty of his creativity 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.499
 increasing your capacity 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.360
 we would live from sharing 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.400
 its capacity what is needed on unforeseen problems 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:45.359
 because if they present in the classroom 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.169
 problems that real problems are used to create 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.099
 finally we can see a madness 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.429
 i 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:55.709
 the similarity of what we are building with pieces the rocket 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.490
 with a real life we ​​work in a well 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.669
 van der sar 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.839
 moving already you and going up are the trial 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:06.719
 but we can not only simulate here 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.439
 with the pieces 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.680
 jejejeje jara 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.069
 arm them five young 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.229
 as to this topic the educational robotics disease in the country 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.829
 good and good and limited to the few how many luckily but each 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.319
 more incidents a few private schools 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.680
 the world in Buenos Aires both capital and provinces cadiz 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.029
 with more and more schools 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:34.760
 and colleges are very coveted 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.599
 country that are not private or public equines robotics school 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.499
 they are really very few 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:44.249
 profile but it's still a very expensive material 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:49.929
 While you can live to reduce costs, it is a very big effort, not all 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:51.989
 schools have the means to do it 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.339
 can be achieved internally as with Argentina 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.389
 the regionalists current creation will be done 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.980
 Alfaro to join pieces or software providers to finish Alvaro 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:04.720
 exit 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.410
 of educational robotics completely nation in the face of disasters 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.659
 percent and the the idea is that and looking for engines 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.010
 he for example in Buenos Aires was conceived a Chinese manufacturer 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.659
 to the engine and that would be suitable for the work that we are doing 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.240
 look for pieces of the meccano type or something like that make gears and look 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.240
 the sd huesca electronic part of the microcontroller 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.229
 in such a way that it tries to assemble everything and do it all 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.969
 with very low cost 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:36.960
 Isabel 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.960
 iberia delta is accessed that the pennant boys 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.860
 by sharing learn a little about robotics and roads the possibility of 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.590
 build your own voice 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.400
 if the guys here work with material that I have in the classroom 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.520
 beijing 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.750
 sometimes city we have the possibility to build something what those can 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.650
 carry off 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.870
 the order is very difficult 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.870
 achieve this milestone against getting the appropriate material 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.720
 i like the pp has played mainly boys of 13 and 7 years of age in 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.639
 ahead 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.720
 we can not build a robot with children your age 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.809
 then we have to see it very difficult that has been built that 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.539
 is that the buyer 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.960
 guti educational robotics we can not use anything else 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.449
 but that allows you to access this subject and those attitude of option 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.099
 choose to assemble assembling organisms 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.010
 and doing a first very basic and elementary program 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.010
 but giving life to his creations 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.270
 ing these clubs 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.779
 and motivates a lot 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.199
 the boy that if they manage to get hooked they begin to work a little 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.139
 they begin to share a little more 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.819
 what we are talking about is working as a team 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.599
 i make the one of a gil class of home automation 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.599
 this is more than fun and entertainment 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.319
 the world operating entertainment 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.130
 and one of the things that I do is work in that camera 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.400
 was such the importance that we give to recycling and some things because 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.970
 example to not be something we have to do work with it or with batteries 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.430
 the possible silver versus recover 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.430
 clear him as 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.180
 almost everything we have here works piles then edil popular the ideal of 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.150
 g 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.319
 all the ways are rechargeable 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.129
 what are many crises 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.439
 many many naive rechargeable batteries I have not achieved 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.400
 nor in the amount of rechargeable batteries that I need 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.600
 but percent of the guys I've commissioned them to 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.270
 all the batteries that have to throw 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.770
 they throw us in the trash 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.199
 on the one hand because the pirelli 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.129
 those who were born the section personally attack 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:50.839
 but many times a battery remains in a package of measures in the neighboring city 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.809
 of one that is still critical 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:56.059
 then that pillar pile we need attack no more 

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:58.240
 then we avoid 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.080
 and to continue to pollute 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.800
 the idea is this time to angels to show a little about the convention 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.300
 let's see 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.689
 they paralyzed 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.669
 with dominican republic good the one of this connection 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:17.399
 this a communication weapons sergeant of the lecturers 

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:19.559
 the reader 

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:23.019
 it's a program the evening told that we can not download from internet 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:26.550
 days ago the program in this case the first goal 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.550
 that also its free program that can be downloaded from the internet 

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:35.110
 In order to demonstrate how these patients coexist, the group controls more simple 

00:07:35.109 --> 00:07:37.699
 with these educational thefts 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:40.740
 remember that managing a robbery recorded three thousand kilometers 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.710
 distance 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.689
 the leader of aidesep move on to command 

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:47.270
 the management of the computer 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.499
 in this case the sentence of the epic adventure of saint Sunday 

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:56.099
 the one that he passes me access control seven floors of his 

00:07:56.099 --> 00:08:01.789
 computer is useless after the inter is going to have access to my computer you 

00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:03.550
 fies dominican republic 

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.229
 in this way the libero programs and the control of the 

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:09.249
 computer 

00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:12.249
 civil we can pd operate a robot 

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:14.379
 to the instance that allows us
