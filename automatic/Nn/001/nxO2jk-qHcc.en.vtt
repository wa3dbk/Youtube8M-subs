00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.940
 i 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.059
 actually, actually, guys do not know 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.970
 fight 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.279
 I speak but if I did not fight that 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.169
 fight do not fight 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.270
 frank not what happens that actually 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.890
 you told me difficult woods of mere 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.390
 clearly in reality who should 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.220
 explain it to you are the ones that explain 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.110
 other things every day that 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.879
 normally or they are not true or they are 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.820
 government criticism but in reality 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.370
 the federal reserve was presented to last 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.239
 time of day friday not as a Jewish friend 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.140
 as friends but as indirectly 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.149
 interested in the court of Griesa 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.879
 they also presented banks or they 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.699
 They also presented good and with 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.340
 words for pain that I just art and 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.829
 ten textual paragraphs of which he said 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.989
 commando such things textual paragraphs 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.210
 of what the federal reserve says to 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.490
 judge griesa that what I was saying 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.060
 without being the federal reserve the Argentina 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.920
 in very good faith adopted the law of new 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.020
 york because because then imagine yourself in 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.290
 Argentina of the year 2005 that had 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.600
 defaulted the debt in 2001 with the 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.590
 congress 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.900
 If you did it with legislation 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.600
 Argentina did not go absolutely anyone 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.340
 to the exchange if doing it with legislation 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.020
 of new york and being the new bank 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.140
 industrial york yo in the first stage 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.700
 came in 66 percent if badly 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.590
 I remember and in the second stage 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.630
 we completed 93 percent was 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.580
 clear and we also went against two because 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.370
 the team passes the biggest and you say the myth 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.660
 bonds with this law that control all 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.240
 the control organisms to order and in 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.550
 usa does with law with laws of them and 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.010
 with banks of them and then comes a 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.860
 person 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.840
 a judge in this case who presents the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.300
 7 percent of those who did not want 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.090
 enter any of the two swaps and 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.790
 They want those who pay all 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.180
 together the whole all together and now 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.250
 and embargo the 93 percent who accepted 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.290
 a here not only accepted one 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.700
 important removes that was the removal of 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.350
 most important debt in all 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.470
 restructuring the world's debt 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.240
 but also he agreed that to collect 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.420
 in installments because obviously there is debt 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.160
 which expires in year 33 38 as it said 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.110
 Valencian the other day that really is 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.750
 an inequity 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.490
 I did not say anything and we always 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.370
 they speak to Argentines about security 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.360
 I now ask the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.030
 authorities 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.460
 fundamentally judicial of the camera 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.990
 of appeals new york and all which 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.670
 is the legal security that a country gives 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.220
 that one is going to do things according 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.440
 to their laws and then there is 7% that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.420
 harms 93 percent of the food 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.450
 which are also forks in the great 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.670
 majority also of foreign origin not 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.230
 of origin this Argentinean because the debt 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.640
 that we have debt securities 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.800
 that are in Argentine power are in 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.750
 power of the state not in debt of others 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.670
 Argentineans because as they always say that 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.920
 We will not pay for the purchase of new pesos 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.260
 with 80 these debts of the year 94 that 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.450
 issued in the year this debt thing that I 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.209
 I forgot to say in there when alone 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.860
 we continued the cheap dollar was debt 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.410
 that was issued to have only the cheap 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.849
 the year 94 and we have to pay now and 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.250
 what is happening also in the world 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.989
 with other realities from mortgages 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.420
 of financial derivatives and I think 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.340
 that there is a big bet of the funds 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.849
 vultures fundamentally with 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.170
 insurers and with banks and with these 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.239
 famous derivatives of markets not 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.180
 regulated which are insurance by 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.190
 sovereign debt default are safe 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.519
 that one can do it because he has 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.760
 hired or without hiring the insurance what 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.549
 they do as a sort of auction between 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.450
 banks and forks good a true 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.870
 technical casino economy and there's the 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.870
 deal
