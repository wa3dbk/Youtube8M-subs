on<00:00:52.469> cargo<00:00:52.920> your<00:00:53.579> primary<00:00:54.090> gun<00:00:54.719> should<00:00:55.020> always

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
on cargo your primary gun should always

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.680 
on cargo your primary gun should always
be<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> shotgun<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.460> submachine<00:00:56.879> gun<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.449> just

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
be a shotgun or submachine gun that just

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.209 
be a shotgun or submachine gun that just
seems<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.050> work<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> best<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:59.070> your

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
seems to work the best and as your

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.889 
seems to work the best and as your
secondary<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.059> will<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.840> an

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
secondary you will have to have an

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.020 
secondary you will have to have an
assault<00:01:01.230> shield<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.430> means<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.820> will

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
assault shield so that means you will

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.899 
assault shield so that means you will
have<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.600> overkill<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> perk<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.610> for

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
have to have overkill as a perk now for

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.120 
have to have overkill as a perk now for
your<00:01:06.000> score<00:01:06.270> streaks<00:01:07.130> this<00:01:08.659> UAV<00:01:09.860> Guardian<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
your score streaks this UAV Guardian and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.280 
your score streaks this UAV Guardian and
sentry<00:01:11.850> gun<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.210> what<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> use<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.260> can

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
sentry gun is what I like to use you can

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.280 
sentry gun is what I like to use you can
cuss<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.490> UAV<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> k-9<00:01:15.659> unit<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:16.110> whatever

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
cuss the UAV to a k-9 unit or whatever

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.160 
cuss the UAV to a k-9 unit or whatever
works<00:01:16.680> best<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.970> seems<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
works best but that is seems to be the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.149 
works best but that is seems to be the
best<00:01:19.290> scorestreaks

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
best scorestreaks

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.280 
best scorestreaks
now<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.670> call<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> pop<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.900> drop<00:01:21.990> you
