00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
really aggressive so I tend to get kills

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.940 
really aggressive so I tend to get kills
a<00:04:15.060> lot<00:04:15.170> faster<00:04:16.170> than<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.440> other<00:04:16.560> people<00:04:16.859> like

a lot faster than the other people like
I<00:04:17.040> said<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.250> mean<00:04:17.310> we<00:04:18.060> got<00:04:18.299> 13<00:04:18.840> kills<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.320> second

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
I said I mean we got 13 kills the second

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.700 
I said I mean we got 13 kills the second
place<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.980> just<00:04:20.310> get<00:04:20.549> kills<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:21.120> lot<00:04:21.150> faster

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
place I just get kills a lot faster

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.500 
place I just get kills a lot faster
hence<00:04:22.710> me<00:04:23.100> getting<00:04:23.430> black<00:04:23.640> birds<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.180> counter

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
hence me getting black birds and counter

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.450 
hence me getting black birds and counter
UAVs<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:24.870> UAVs<00:04:25.380> faster<00:04:25.860> than<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.310> other

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460
