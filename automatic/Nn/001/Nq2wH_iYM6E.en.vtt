00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
chest area doesn't stay together it

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.560 
chest area doesn't stay together it
doesn't<00:03:05.980> actually<00:03:06.420> pig<00:03:07.420> in<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.840> clip<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:09.790> mean

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
doesn't actually pig in and clip I mean

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.050 
doesn't actually pig in and clip I mean
if<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.720> have<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:10.989> up<00:03:11.110> here<00:03:11.549> sometimes<00:03:12.549> pops<00:03:12.850> up

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
if you have it up here sometimes pops up

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.360 
if you have it up here sometimes pops up
but<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.510> lower<00:03:14.079> it<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.350> about<00:03:14.650> there<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.310> I'll

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
but I lower it to about there and I'll

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.060 
but I lower it to about there and I'll
stay<00:03:15.670> together<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.420> little<00:03:16.630> bit<00:03:16.750> better<00:03:16.840> but<00:03:17.739> it

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
stay together a little bit better but it

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.970 
stay together a little bit better but it
will<00:03:18.250> pop<00:03:18.549> out<00:03:18.700> at<00:03:18.850> random<00:03:19.620> alright<00:03:20.620> so<00:03:20.799> there

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
will pop out at random alright so there

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.449 
will pop out at random alright so there
you<00:03:21.100> go<00:03:22.019> chromia<00:03:23.019> in<00:03:23.290> robot<00:03:23.829> mode<00:03:24.989> now<00:03:26.430> some<00:03:27.430> of

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
you go chromia in robot mode now some of

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.890 
you go chromia in robot mode now some of
you<00:03:27.640> might<00:03:27.790> transform<00:03:28.209> this<00:03:28.329> differently<00:03:28.750> you

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
you might transform this differently you

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.500 
you might transform this differently you
might<00:03:29.079> put<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.380> wheels<00:03:29.620> like<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:30.820> or<00:03:31.269> like

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
might put the wheels like that or like

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.849 
might put the wheels like that or like
that<00:03:32.380> or<00:03:32.620> have<00:03:32.829> them<00:03:32.980> have<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:34.030> one<00:03:34.209> up<00:03:34.299> here

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
that or have them have this one up here

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.849 
that or have them have this one up here
down<00:03:35.859> here<00:03:35.920> like<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.670> is<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:38.440> all<00:03:38.590> personal

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
problem in this figure but and that's

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.750 
problem in this figure but and that's
pretty<00:04:48.230> much<00:04:48.350> she<00:04:49.130> can<00:04:49.280> go<00:04:49.400> up<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.610> down<00:04:49.700> like

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
pretty much she can go up and down like

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.670 
pretty much she can go up and down like
that<00:04:50.120> but<00:04:53.919> so<00:04:54.919> that's<00:04:55.100> pretty<00:04:55.250> much<00:04:55.340> it<00:04:55.730> for
