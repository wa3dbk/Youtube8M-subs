00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.990 
this is the clutch and this is so
beautiful<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:19.979> like<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.430> could<00:04:20.579> just<00:04:20.609> wear

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
beautiful and like you could just wear

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.930 
beautiful and like you could just wear
it<00:04:21.180> right<00:04:21.509> outside<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.289> bag<00:04:22.500> like<00:04:22.800> so<00:04:22.940> but

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
it right outside of the bag like so but

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.610 
it right outside of the bag like so but
I<00:04:24.090> recommend<00:04:24.630> wearing<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:25.050> in<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.409> bag
