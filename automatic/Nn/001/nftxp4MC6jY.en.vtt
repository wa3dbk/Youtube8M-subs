 the doorman jesus crown rejected that he

 has been the blue cross figure in the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.779
 match against lion which they won 2-1 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.010
 we have to collaborate with the group if 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.250
 it is clear to me I have to contribute 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:22.290
 but not only study also if it goes 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.850
 to half court of which always 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.850
 we try for the group 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.859
 what 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.859
 s 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.660
 we're 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.670
 Crown stated that winning is always 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.649
 important but he recognized that they lacked 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.579
 put more goals against lion in the idea of 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.579
 the quarterfinals 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.930
 because we know what 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.930
 we're aware 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.880
 see things but good you have to 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:01.220
 Rescue the result is important 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:03.970
 we also know that this mutation 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.970
 end of accounts 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:16.770
 the obligated ones are they are the ones 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.390
 they have this oven that from the pass by 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.230
 our side I think we have to be 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.680
 Very intelligent 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:31.140
 that the team has to go previously 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.140
 from the order that we have 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.590
 gerardo flores who scored a goal against 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.539
 the lion recognized that he is happy 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.540
 help your team and hope to get the 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:44.190
 go to the semifinals 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.190
 good much happiness 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.130
 very happy and more because the 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.640
 result was given but not 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.640
 we wait 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.479
