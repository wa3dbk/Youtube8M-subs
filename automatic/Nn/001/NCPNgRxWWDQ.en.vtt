module operations I encourage you to try

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.410 
module operations I encourage you to try
them<00:01:39.930> all<00:01:40.369> places<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.759> look<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> red

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
them all places if you look for the red

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.359 
them all places if you look for the red
channel<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.259> find<00:01:43.500> out<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.860> red<00:01:44.189> is

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
channel you find out that red is

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.730 
channel you find out that red is
actually<00:01:44.520> represented<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.600> over<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.530> just

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
actually represented all over it just

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.649 
actually represented all over it just
happens<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.369> shines<00:01:47.700> through<00:01:48.180> this

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
happens that it shines through this

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.380 
happens that it shines through this
region<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.759> other<00:01:50.790> channels

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
region here because the other channels

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.170 
region here because the other channels
are<00:01:51.890> absent<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.369> green<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.790> absent

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
are absent that see green is absent

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.480

and<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.819> global<00:02:13.239> so<00:02:13.390> many<00:02:13.569> much<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:14.310> larger

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
and this global so many much is larger

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.030 
and this global so many much is larger
than<00:02:15.489> what<00:02:15.700> he<00:02:15.849> displays<00:02:16.299> this<00:02:17.110> but<00:02:17.829> we'll

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
than what he displays this but we'll

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.000 
than what he displays this but we'll
focus<00:02:18.430> on<00:02:18.549> a<00:02:18.579> specific<00:02:18.819> region<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:20.349> you<00:02:20.769> can

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
focus on a specific region so you can

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.890 
focus on a specific region so you can
see<00:02:21.870> what<00:02:22.870> image<00:02:23.140> analysis<00:02:24.329> processes<00:02:25.329> I<00:02:25.629> are

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
see what image analysis processes I are

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.470 
see what image analysis processes I are
doing<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.379> do<00:02:26.829> different<00:02:27.129> features<00:02:27.489> so<00:02:28.299> one<00:02:28.450> of

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.250 
image so let's imagine you are happy
with<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:39.209> segmentation<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.900> now<00:03:41.199> you

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
with the segmentation and now you

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.559 
with the segmentation and now you
calculate<00:03:41.470> your<00:03:41.829> information<00:03:42.400> because<00:03:43.209> if

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
calculate your information because if

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.479 
calculate your information because if
you<00:03:43.659> capture<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.349> segmentations<00:03:45.129> you'll<00:03:45.280> get

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
you capture the segmentations you'll get

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.300 
you capture the segmentations you'll get
the<00:03:45.729> error<00:03:46.629> message<00:03:47.139> saying<00:03:47.409> that<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:48.190> have

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
the error message saying that you have

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.300 
the error message saying that you have
neither<00:03:48.519> segmented<00:03:49.269> out<00:03:49.389> the<00:03:49.629> nuclei

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
neither segmented out the nuclei

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.509 
neither segmented out the nuclei

imagine<00:04:48.120> now<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.690> you<00:04:48.930> want<00:04:49.199> to<00:04:49.349> change<00:04:49.650> the

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
imagine now that you want to change the

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.270 
imagine now that you want to change the
way<00:04:50.580> we<00:04:50.879> can<00:04:51.090> 67<00:04:51.780> level<00:04:52.110> teachers<00:04:52.830> who<00:04:53.190> are

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
way we can 67 level teachers who are

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.550 
way we can 67 level teachers who are
segmented<00:04:53.759> out<00:04:53.909> by<00:04:54.539> considering<00:04:55.080> only<00:04:55.259> the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
segmented out by considering only the

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.740 
segmented out by considering only the
really<00:04:55.770> dark<00:04:56.099> one<00:04:56.400> so<00:04:56.669> this<00:04:56.789> is<00:04:56.969> just<00:04:57.629> an

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
really dark one so this is just an

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.339 
really dark one so this is just an
example<00:04:57.919> all<00:04:58.919> these<00:04:59.159> multiple<00:04:59.400> operations

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
example all these multiple operations

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.040 
example all these multiple operations
within<00:05:01.349> the<00:05:01.500> class<00:05:01.740> 67<00:05:02.430> model<00:05:02.729> of<00:05:02.969> images<00:05:03.599> can

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
within the class 67 model of images can

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.050 
within the class 67 model of images can
help<00:05:04.349> you<00:05:04.440> do<00:05:04.590> it<00:05:04.680> this<00:05:05.430> is<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.699> could<00:05:05.849> use

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
help you do it this is you could use

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.330 
help you do it this is you could use

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
really light and this is an example of

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.089 
really light and this is an example of
an<00:05:41.719> analytical<00:05:42.719> experiment<00:05:43.380> where<00:05:43.889> you're

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
an analytical experiment where you're

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.740 
an analytical experiment where you're
trying<00:05:44.279> to<00:05:44.400> find<00:05:44.759> out<00:05:44.909> if<00:05:45.870> the<00:05:47.750> value

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
trying to find out if the value

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.719 
trying to find out if the value
proliferation<00:05:49.440> would<00:05:49.529> be<00:05:49.710> much<00:05:49.979> smaller<00:05:50.279> or

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
proliferation would be much smaller or

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.189 
proliferation would be much smaller or
how<00:05:50.969> small<00:05:51.210> or<00:05:51.360> would<00:05:51.509> it<00:05:51.630> be<00:05:51.810> have<00:05:52.110> you

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
how small or would it be have you

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.999 
how small or would it be have you
considered<00:05:52.529> only<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:52.979> darker<00:05:53.639> region<00:05:55.009> so

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
considered only the darker region so

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.700 
considered only the darker region so
requires<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:56.550> to<00:05:56.580> segment<00:05:56.969> it<00:05:57.270> again<00:05:57.629> and<00:05:58.110> to

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
requires you to segment it again and to

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.719 
requires you to segment it again and to
recalculate

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
recalculate

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.550 
recalculate
before<00:06:00.210> refreshing<00:06:00.690> value<00:06:02.990> chart<00:06:03.990> for

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
before refreshing value chart for

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.740 
before refreshing value chart for
significantly<00:06:05.250> small<00:06:06.150> enough<00:06:08.330> ok<00:06:09.330> so<00:06:09.389> let's

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
significantly small enough ok so let's

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.450 
significantly small enough ok so let's
not<00:06:09.930> do<00:06:10.080> it<00:06:10.110> all<00:06:10.409> for<00:06:10.680> a<00:06:10.740> new<00:06:10.860> image<00:06:11.129> you<00:06:11.250> just

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
not do it all for a new image you just

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.240 
not do it all for a new image you just
have<00:06:11.610> to<00:06:11.699> click<00:06:11.849> on<00:06:12.060> reload<00:06:12.240> can<00:06:13.199> we<00:06:13.379> set<00:06:13.650> the

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
have to click on reload can we set the

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.649 
have to click on reload can we set the
application<00:06:14.960> and<00:06:15.960> let's<00:06:16.289> forget<00:06:16.650> this<00:06:16.770> one

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
application and let's forget this one

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:20.360 
application and let's forget this one
the<00:06:18.659> finish<00:06:19.020> is<00:06:19.169> already<00:06:19.620> clear<00:06:19.979> than<00:06:20.340> the

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
the finish is already clear than the

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.779 
the finish is already clear than the
other

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
other

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.219 
other
so<00:06:21.360> let's<00:06:21.539> activate<00:06:22.009> chroma<00:06:23.009> markers<00:06:23.779> but<00:06:24.779> we

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
so let's activate chroma markers but we

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.800 
so let's activate chroma markers but we
could<00:06:25.440> start<00:06:25.680> by<00:06:25.860> segmenting<00:06:26.370> the<00:06:26.819> kind<00:06:27.210> 67

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
could start by segmenting the kind 67

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.730 
could start by segmenting the kind 67
wild<00:06:28.199> regions<00:06:29.029> which<00:06:30.029> really<00:06:30.240> matter<00:06:30.740> which

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
wild regions which really matter which

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.760 
wild regions which really matter which
one<00:06:32.009> goes<00:06:32.190> first

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
one goes first

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.029 
one goes first
hopefully<00:06:34.770> now

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
hopefully now

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.640 
hopefully now
now<00:06:35.669> you're<00:06:35.849> finally<00:06:36.830> last<00:06:37.909> so<00:06:38.909> I<00:06:38.939> see<00:06:39.089> that

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
now you're finally last so I see that

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.100 
now you're finally last so I see that
the<00:06:40.650> browser<00:06:40.860> is<00:06:41.039> not<00:06:41.279> in<00:06:41.610> any<00:06:41.759> way<00:06:42.110> slowing

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
the browser is not in any way slowing

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.459 
the browser is not in any way slowing
you<00:06:43.229> down

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:43.469 
you down

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.290 
you down
this<00:06:43.919> is<00:06:44.069> a<00:06:44.129> very<00:06:44.309> efficient<00:06:44.729> environment<00:06:45.210> to

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
this is a very efficient environment to

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.350 
this is a very efficient environment to
do<00:06:45.419> image<00:06:46.050> analysis<00:06:46.589> it<00:06:47.309> turns<00:06:47.610> out<00:06:47.849> it<00:06:48.059> didn't

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
do image analysis it turns out it didn't

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.809 
do image analysis it turns out it didn't
used<00:06:48.509> to<00:06:48.569> be<00:06:48.629> that<00:06:48.809> way<00:06:49.159> okay<00:06:50.159> so<00:06:50.580> we<00:06:50.789> are

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 
used to be that way okay so we are

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:55.279 
used to be that way okay so we are
capturing<00:06:51.330> can<00:06:51.599> a<00:06:51.689> 67<00:06:52.469> here<00:06:53.689> now<00:06:54.689> even<00:06:55.110> if<00:06:55.199> the

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
capturing can a 67 here now even if the

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.379 
capturing can a 67 here now even if the
image<00:06:55.469> is<00:06:55.589> clear<00:06:56.009> why<00:06:56.520> not<00:06:56.699> use<00:06:56.939> the<00:06:57.210> nuclear

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
image is clear why not use the nuclear

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.589 
image is clear why not use the nuclear
recolor<00:06:57.990> operation<00:06:58.649> to<00:06:59.490> separate<00:06:59.939> the<00:07:00.119> nuclei

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 
recolor operation to separate the nuclei

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:05.529 
recolor operation to separate the nuclei
