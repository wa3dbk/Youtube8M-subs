healthy so the way we start is by

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.380 
healthy so the way we start is by

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
oil in here and we're just going to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.079 
oil in here and we're just going to
blend<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.710> real<00:00:52.920> fast

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.140 

okay<00:01:01.089> so<00:01:01.179> in<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.480> Vitamix<00:01:01.839> we<00:01:02.079> blended<00:01:02.500> the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
okay so in the Vitamix we blended the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.730 
okay so in the Vitamix we blended the
spinach<00:01:04.150> mixture<00:01:04.689> you<00:01:04.960> can<00:01:05.080> probably<00:01:05.379> do<00:01:05.619> that

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
spinach mixture you can probably do that

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.730 
spinach mixture you can probably do that
in<00:01:05.890> any<00:01:06.040> blender<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:07.320> after<00:01:08.320> you've<00:01:08.560> done<00:01:08.680> that

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
in any blender so after you've done that

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.179 
in any blender so after you've done that
you<00:01:09.549> just<00:01:09.790> add<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.659> flour<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:11.189> what

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
you just add it to the flour and what

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.399 
you just add it to the flour and what
I've<00:01:12.310> done<00:01:12.460> is<00:01:12.700> half<00:01:13.090> whole<00:01:13.479> wheat<00:01:13.780> flour<00:01:13.810> in

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
I've done is half whole wheat flour in

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.279 
I've done is half whole wheat flour in
half<00:01:14.770> semolina<00:01:15.610> flour<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.780> can<00:01:16.810> get<00:01:17.080> that<00:01:17.110> at

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
half semolina flour you can get that at

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.370 
half semolina flour you can get that at
most<00:01:17.770> bulk<00:01:18.610> food<00:01:18.820> stores<00:01:19.119> or<00:01:19.390> food<00:01:19.899> stores<00:01:20.140> so

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
most bulk food stores or food stores so

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.529 
most bulk food stores or food stores so
I'm<00:01:20.920> going<00:01:21.039> to<00:01:21.100> mix<00:01:21.280> this<00:01:21.399> together<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:22.180> then

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
I'm going to mix this together and then

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.560 
I'm going to mix this together and then
see<00:01:22.899> what<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.080> looks<00:01:23.200> like<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:25.000> this<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.450> the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
see what it looks like so this is the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.170 
see what it looks like so this is the
dough<00:01:25.780> after<00:01:26.380> it's<00:01:26.590> been<00:01:27.430> needed<00:01:27.850> we're<00:01:28.060> going

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
dough after it's been needed we're going

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.210 
dough after it's been needed we're going
to<00:01:28.240> let<00:01:28.330> it<00:01:28.450> rest<00:01:28.630> for<00:01:28.780> about<00:01:28.899> 10<00:01:29.259> minutes<00:01:29.500> like

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
to let it rest for about 10 minutes like

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.740 
to let it rest for about 10 minutes like
I<00:01:30.250> said<00:01:30.520> this<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.850> spinach<00:01:31.240> kind<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.600> can

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
I said this is the spinach kind you can

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.180 
I said this is the spinach kind you can
make<00:01:31.869> it<00:01:31.990> just<00:01:32.140> regular<00:01:32.500> without<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.890> spinach

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
make it just regular without the spinach

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.190 
make it just regular without the spinach
he'll<00:01:33.399> put<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:33.580> alternate<00:01:34.539> directions<00:01:34.750> for

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
he'll put the alternate directions for

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.350 
he'll put the alternate directions for
that<00:01:35.319> you<00:01:35.890> kind<00:01:36.069> of<00:01:36.159> want<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.520> feel<00:01:36.789> kind<00:01:37.270> of

that you kind of want it to feel kind of
like<00:01:37.710> play-doh<00:01:38.819> so<00:01:39.819> if<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:39.970> can<00:01:40.060> imagine<00:01:40.149> that

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
like play-doh so if you can imagine that

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.059 
like play-doh so if you can imagine that
that's<00:01:40.810> kind<00:01:41.110> of<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.259> texture<00:01:41.619> you<00:01:41.710> want<00:01:41.950> it

ground turkey in there to make it a

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.330 
ground turkey in there to make it a
little<00:01:58.179> bit<00:01:58.360> healthier<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:58.899> as<00:01:59.020> that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
little bit healthier so as that

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.359 
little bit healthier so as that
simmering<00:02:00.340> we<00:02:00.940> can<00:02:01.119> go<00:02:01.270> ahead<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:02.049> start<00:02:02.409> to

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
simmering we can go ahead and start to

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.060 
simmering we can go ahead and start to
rule<00:02:03.520> out<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.850> noodles<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:04.619> how<00:02:05.619> do<00:02:05.680> we<00:02:05.740> do<00:02:05.890> for

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
rule out the noodles so how do we do for

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:15.420 
rule out the noodles so how do we do for
that<00:02:11.519> take<00:02:12.519> it<00:02:12.640> out<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:14.410> there's<00:02:15.130> pasta

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
that take it out just there's pasta

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.220 
that take it out just there's pasta
makers<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.090> are<00:02:16.150> fairly<00:02:16.420> inexpensive<00:02:17.109> that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
makers that are fairly inexpensive that

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.530 
makers that are fairly inexpensive that
you<00:02:17.350> can<00:02:17.530> get<00:02:17.680> but<00:02:18.489> I<00:02:18.579> actually<00:02:18.730> what<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.150> do<00:02:19.239> is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
you can get but I actually what I do is

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.479 
you can get but I actually what I do is
I'll<00:02:19.829> all<00:02:20.829> on<00:02:21.190> split<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.790> dough<00:02:21.910> into<00:02:22.150> 2<00:02:22.690> 2<00:02:22.959> and

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
I'll all on split the dough into 2 2 and

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.370 
I'll all on split the dough into 2 2 and
just<00:02:24.489> kind<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.790> like<00:02:24.989> play<00:02:25.989> with<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.350> little

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
just kind of like play with it a little

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.810 
just kind of like play with it a little
pat<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.519> down<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.780> roll<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.170> out<00:02:29.820> now

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
pat it down and just roll it out now

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.009 
pat it down and just roll it out now
just<00:02:31.450> take<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.840> turn<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.400> roll<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:34.019> my

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
just take it turn it roll it my

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.810 
just take it turn it roll it my
experience<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.799> longer<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.250> let<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.670> dough

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
experience the longer you let the dough

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.680 
experience the longer you let the dough
need<00:02:37.209> before<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:39.250> try<00:02:39.459> doing<00:02:39.519> this<00:02:39.970> the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
need before you try doing this the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.599 
need before you try doing this the
easier<00:02:41.109> it<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.320> going<00:02:41.799> to<00:02:41.859> be<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.430> keep

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
easier it is going to be to just keep

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.430 
easier it is going to be to just keep
turning<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.120> over<00:02:43.359> and<00:02:43.630> over<00:02:43.690> again<00:02:43.930> I'd<00:02:44.260> be<00:02:44.410> a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
turning it over and over again I'd be a

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.740 
turning it over and over again I'd be a
sticky<00:02:44.890> but<00:02:45.519> make<00:02:45.670> sure<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:45.910> let<00:02:46.209> needed<00:02:46.660> it

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
sticky but make sure you let needed it

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.780 
sticky but make sure you let needed it
enough<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.290> then<00:02:47.980> just<00:02:48.130> keep<00:02:48.220> rolling<00:02:48.609> it<00:02:48.700> out

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
enough and then just keep rolling it out

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.520 
enough and then just keep rolling it out
and<00:02:49.030> then<00:02:49.090> hope<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.810> back<00:02:49.959> in<00:02:50.109> a<00:02:50.170> minute<00:02:50.319> when

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
and then hope you back in a minute when

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.890 
and then hope you back in a minute when
it's<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:51.069> lot<00:02:51.850> thinner<00:02:54.030> ok<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:55.299> it's<00:02:55.480> on<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.660> lot

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
it's a lot thinner ok so it's on a lot

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.410 
it's a lot thinner ok so it's on a lot
bigger<00:02:56.139> and<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:57.100> trick<00:02:57.370> one<00:02:57.730> hunnit<00:02:58.000> rixter

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
bigger and the trick one hunnit rixter

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.180 
bigger and the trick one hunnit rixter
rolling<00:02:58.810> is<00:02:58.989> instead<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.319> just<00:02:59.530> trying<00:03:00.069> to

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
rolling is instead of just trying to

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.129 
rolling is instead of just trying to
keep<00:03:00.310> rolling<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.819> rolling<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.239> pick<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.079> up

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
keep rolling and rolling it pick it up

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.539 
keep rolling and rolling it pick it up
and<00:03:02.319> turn<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.620> around<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:02.980> will<00:03:03.190> make<00:03:03.370> sure

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
and turn it around that will make sure

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.400 
and turn it around that will make sure
it<00:03:03.670> doesn't<00:03:03.880> stay

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
it doesn't stay

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.510 
it doesn't stay
sticky<00:03:04.740> for<00:03:05.010> one<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:06.720> also<00:03:06.870> kind<00:03:07.740> of<00:03:07.860> lets

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
sticky for one and it also kind of lets

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.540 
sticky for one and it also kind of lets
gravity<00:03:09.060> be<00:03:09.210> on<00:03:09.300> your<00:03:09.450> side<00:03:10.130> when<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.280> lift<00:03:11.460> it

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
gravity be on your side when you lift it

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.890 
gravity be on your side when you lift it
up<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.880> kind<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.150> let<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.330> swing<00:03:12.600> around<00:03:12.690> a

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
up just kind of let it swing around a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.600 
up just kind of let it swing around a
little<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.200> then<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.440> can<00:03:13.560> see<00:03:13.740> it'll<00:03:14.460> come

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
little and then you can see it'll come

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.000 
little and then you can see it'll come
out<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.090> lot<00:03:15.420> farther<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:15.990> then<00:03:16.500> take<00:03:16.710> too<00:03:16.860> long

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
out a lot farther so then take too long

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.860 
out a lot farther so then take too long
at<00:03:17.190> all<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:18.210> doesn't<00:03:18.570> need<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.690> be<00:03:18.780> perfect

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
at all it doesn't need to be perfect

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.660 
at all it doesn't need to be perfect
because<00:03:19.320> as<00:03:19.680> long<00:03:19.800> your<00:03:20.010> noodles<00:03:20.400> are<00:03:20.520> all

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
because as long your noodles are all

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.280 
because as long your noodles are all
hidden<00:03:20.940> with<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.480> bunch<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.780> sauce<00:03:21.960> and<00:03:22.140> cheese

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
hidden with a bunch of sauce and cheese

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.050 
hidden with a bunch of sauce and cheese
anyways<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.340> once<00:03:23.460> you<00:03:23.550> get<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
anyways so once you get it to the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.000 
anyways so once you get it to the
thickness<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.630> want<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:25.320> want<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.710> little

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
thickness you want you want it a little

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.310 
thickness you want you want it a little
thinner<00:03:26.610> than<00:03:27.240> you<00:03:27.420> like<00:03:27.630> noodles<00:03:28.050> so<00:03:28.170> if<00:03:28.230> you

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
thinner than you like noodles so if you

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.570 
thinner than you like noodles so if you
like<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> really<00:03:28.710> thick<00:03:28.980> noodle<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.340> can<00:03:29.490> make

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
like a really thick noodle you can make

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.360 
like a really thick noodle you can make
it<00:03:29.730> thicker<00:03:29.910> but<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.720> does<00:03:31.020> puff<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.920> little<00:03:31.950> bit

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
it thicker but it does puff a little bit

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.680 
it thicker but it does puff a little bit
so<00:03:32.550> make<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.880> little<00:03:33.060> thinner<00:03:33.330> than<00:03:33.540> you
