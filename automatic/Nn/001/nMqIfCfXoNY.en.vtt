00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.489
 short 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.070
 q 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.239
 here 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.560
 v 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.409
 first because question for them 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.150
 a little tricky there are a lot of players on 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.159
 on the common google who must know how to become 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.130
 this would concern 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.659
 his call to reproach you to my players 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.130
 who lives only poker 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.130
 shame on my personal case 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.400
 I am likened to a pro player I am not a day for pascal 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.580
 I have a job by the way I'm a pharmacist and I know I have a 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.980
 problem I can always 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.660
 Deny my money drugstore 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.600
 so she sinks safety over them 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.950
 now says whoever wants to do 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.140
 for pro 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.720
 I that poker is obliged in my opinion that to have already seen a level 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.640
 sufficient 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.910
 for fo who know each other well enough to know if slovakia to people who 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.010
 overestimate 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.430
 and for 100 th the foot they are going in function of the investment physio 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.880
 investment who who puts on the site what is the report 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.740
 every month if it is regular is it risky without teeth of 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.780
 saw e and then it only takes a month to show it 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.460
 clearly 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.330
 quaff a player who wants to embark on this craft challenge who does not know who 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.090
 can happen periods outside or two years open my stepfather all the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.190
 time because that's how it's statistically 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.400
 we are supposed to win because we have a level 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.620
 lala the situation is that we have no luck for two years and it 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.260
 come 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
 so you have to have the kidneys solid enough to the doors not there at that time 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.110
 so firstly have the level 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.110
 secondly, to have strong enough kidneys 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.450
 and then for 100 th 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.350
 know that they do not go into tournaments that are not above 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.090
 dub between when we have a cost 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.810
 so precisely because there you speak of high level let's start that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.650
 algeria rang 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.650
 no cars at the level it's not complicated you have to do a lot 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.730
 many goals 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.910
 of two we can play too we must do a lot of time on 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.760
 Internet 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.620
 % themselves not very expensive 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.960
 e foshan function of dede of the abandonment in have but on the internet one plays 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.340
 many hands so we can not use at poker school 6 for 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.589
 learn his beginner 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.899
 on postcodes in brazil for example the ardor in ten days the om wins 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:19.909
 five years 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.659
 we find ourselves anyway 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.700
 and then in Europe to all the books you can buy the books 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.659
 4 and then you have tips like the instrument transfer of the 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.349
 concessions made for all the places on the site where there are people 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.519
 who give advice i think kader on the on the forums and so on 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.609
 and then play which a lot a lot of chicago a lot of tournaments 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.189
 and 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.900
 as if I have everything to their fossils foucault to acquire the skill 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.889
 in poker you have to play a lot of hands 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.139
 when you lose important costs 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.659
 you always have to go back to the elysÃ©e try to understand why 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:53.869
 we lost 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:57.219
 because we have lost because we have little chance in the real banca 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.889
 there are no consequences to draw from it have we lost because precisely at the 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.839
 bout of the net then the world level and faith takes airlock improvement 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:10.049
