the<00:00:26.730> unit<00:00:26.849> circle<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:28.380> x<00:00:28.650> coordinate<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.429> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the unit circle the x coordinate of that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.690 
the unit circle the x coordinate of that
point<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:30.210> equal<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.720> cosine<00:00:31.260> theta<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.430> y

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
point is equal to cosine theta and the y

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.580 
point is equal to cosine theta and the y
coordinate<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.630> point<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.140> equal<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
coordinate of that point is equal to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.790 
coordinate of that point is equal to
sine<00:00:34.800> theta<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:36.270> could<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.020> make<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
sine theta so what we could do is make a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.970 
sine theta so what we could do is make a
table<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.550> various<00:00:38.969> angles<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.620> values

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
table with various angles and the values

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.740 
table with various angles and the values
of<00:00:41.010> sine<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.370> cosine<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.090> then<00:00:42.180> plot<00:00:42.420> them<00:00:42.600> on

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
of sine and cosine and then plot them on

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.380 
of sine and cosine and then plot them on
the<00:00:42.930> coordinate<00:00:43.350> plane<00:00:43.760> but<00:00:44.760> before<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.210> do

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the coordinate plane but before we do

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.459 
the coordinate plane but before we do
that<00:00:45.420> let's<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.930> ahead<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.200> look<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that let's go ahead and look at a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.290 
that let's go ahead and look at a
Wolfram<00:00:46.920> demonstration<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> develop<00:00:48.180> this

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
Wolfram demonstration to develop this

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.319 
Wolfram demonstration to develop this
idea<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> what<00:00:50.190> we're<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
idea so what we're going to see here is

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.139 
idea so what we're going to see here is
as<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.780> animate<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.039> point<00:00:53.399> around<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.820> unit

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
as we animate this point around the unit

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.610 
as we animate this point around the unit
circle<00:00:54.180> we're<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> look<00:00:55.050> at<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> graph

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
circle we're going to look at the graph

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.099 
circle we're going to look at the graph
of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> sine<00:00:56.340> function<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.930> we'll<00:00:58.020> be

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
of the sine function so we'll be

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.170 
of the sine function so we'll be
plotting<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> Y<00:00:58.980> coordinates<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.030> point

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
plotting the Y coordinates of this point

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720 
plotting the Y coordinates of this point
so<00:01:01.020> right<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:01.350> we're<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.770> zero<00:01:02.399> therefore

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
so right now we're at one zero therefore

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.469 
so right now we're at one zero therefore
sine<00:01:03.270> theta<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.750> equal<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.229> zero<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.479> we

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
sine theta is equal to zero as we

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.390 
sine theta is equal to zero as we
progress<00:01:06.960> around<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.560> unit<00:01:07.830> circle<00:01:07.860> let's

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
progress around the unit circle let's

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.270 
progress around the unit circle let's
stop<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:08.880> PI<00:01:09.180> over<00:01:09.350> two<00:01:10.350> radians<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:11.070> 90

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
stop at PI over two radians or 90

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.730 
stop at PI over two radians or 90
degrees<00:01:11.720> notice<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.900> y<00:01:13.080> coordinate<00:01:13.590> right

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
degrees notice the y coordinate right

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.340 
degrees notice the y coordinate right
here<00:01:13.950> would<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.159> positive<00:01:14.760> one<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.930> down<00:01:16.170> here

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
here would be positive one so down here

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.910 
here would be positive one so down here
we<00:01:16.409> see<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> point<00:01:17.070> PI<00:01:17.369> over<00:01:17.610> two<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.930> we

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
we see the point PI over two one if we

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.800 
we see the point PI over two one if we
pause<00:01:20.130> again<00:01:20.400> at<00:01:20.729> PI<00:01:21.030> radians<00:01:21.570> or<00:01:21.960> 180<00:01:22.590> degrees

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
pause again at PI radians or 180 degrees

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.880 
pause again at PI radians or 180 degrees
again<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> point<00:01:25.229> right<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.710> would<00:01:25.830> be

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
again the point right here would be

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.640 
again the point right here would be
negative<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.670> zero<00:01:27.080> therefore<00:01:28.080> sine<00:01:28.350> theta

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
negative one zero therefore sine theta

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.230 
negative one zero therefore sine theta
is<00:01:28.829> equal<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.159> zero<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:32.090> we<00:01:33.090> go

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
is equal to zero and so on as we go

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.899 
is equal to zero and so on as we go
around<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.810> entire<00:01:34.140> unit<00:01:34.500> circle<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.520> end<00:01:35.729> up

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
around the entire unit circle we end up

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.330 
around the entire unit circle we end up
back<00:01:36.119> where<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.360> started<00:01:36.770> which<00:01:37.770> shows<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
back where we started which shows the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.819 
back where we started which shows the
period<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> sine<00:01:39.329> function<00:01:39.360> equal<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> two

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
period of the sine function equal to two

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.130 
period of the sine function equal to two
pi<00:01:41.070> radians<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:42.360> could<00:01:42.540> also<00:01:42.689> look<00:01:42.840> at

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
pi radians we could also look at

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.389 
pi radians we could also look at
negative<00:01:43.350> angles<00:01:46.040> rotating<00:01:47.040> around<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
negative angles rotating around the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.060 
negative angles rotating around the
circle<00:01:47.700> clockwise<00:01:48.680> again<00:01:49.680> we're<00:01:49.799> plotting

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
circle clockwise again we're plotting

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.460 
circle clockwise again we're plotting
the<00:01:50.189> Y<00:01:50.430> coordinates<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.270> point<00:01:51.350> which<00:01:52.350> is

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the Y coordinates of this point which is

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.660 
the Y coordinates of this point which is
equal<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.920> sine<00:01:53.310> theta<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.219> see<00:01:56.430> another

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
equal to sine theta so we see another

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.330 
equal to sine theta so we see another
cycle<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.750> sine<00:01:58.140> function<00:01:58.200> again<00:01:59.009> showing

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
cycle of the sine function again showing

going to do this by hand what would be

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.029 
going to do this by hand what would be
helpful<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.780> look<00:02:06.780> at<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> decimal<00:02:07.350> values

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
helpful is to look at the decimal values

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.699 
helpful is to look at the decimal values
of<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.489> function<00:02:08.550> at<00:02:09.270> different<00:02:10.200> angles<00:02:10.319> and

go to our table set and we're going to
start<00:02:38.579> at<00:02:38.700> zero<00:02:38.969> degrees<00:02:39.709> this<00:02:40.709> doesn't

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
start at zero degrees this doesn't

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.869 
start at zero degrees this doesn't
matter<00:02:41.189> because<00:02:41.340> we're<00:02:41.579> going<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.760> go<00:02:41.819> ahead

and set it on ask mode press Enter go to

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.569 
and set it on ask mode press Enter go to
our<00:02:45.420> table<00:02:45.659> and<00:02:46.650> now<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.769> could<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.040> type<00:02:47.340> in

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
our table and now I could just type in

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.759 
our table and now I could just type in
various<00:02:48.000> angles<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.720> write<00:02:49.439> down<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
various angles and write down the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.240 
various angles and write down the
decimal<00:02:50.010> values<00:02:50.609> for<00:02:51.209> sine<00:02:51.540> theta<00:02:51.889> so<00:02:52.889> just<00:02:53.159> to

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
decimal values for sine theta so just to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.569 
decimal values for sine theta so just to
show<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.519> there's<00:02:53.909> zero<00:02:54.150> degrees<00:02:54.480> 30<00:02:54.989> degrees

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
show you there's zero degrees 30 degrees

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.920 
show you there's zero degrees 30 degrees
45<00:02:56.579> degrees<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:59.480> I've<00:03:00.480> already<00:03:00.629> done

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
45 degrees and so on I've already done

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.020 
45 degrees and so on I've already done
this<00:03:01.139> so<00:03:02.099> we'll<00:03:02.219> go<00:03:02.340> ahead<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.669> use<00:03:02.819> this

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
this so we'll go ahead and use this

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.539 
this so we'll go ahead and use this
table<00:03:03.419> that<00:03:03.450> I've<00:03:03.659> created<00:03:04.129> now<00:03:05.129> I<00:03:05.159> won't<00:03:05.370> use

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
table that I've created now I won't use

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.520 
table that I've created now I won't use
all<00:03:05.579> these<00:03:05.969> values<00:03:06.419> to<00:03:06.659> plot<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.169> sine

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
all these values to plot the sine

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.860 
all these values to plot the sine
function<00:03:08.219> I'm<00:03:08.609> going<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.239> just<00:03:09.359> pick<00:03:09.540> key

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
function I'm going to just pick key

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.709 
function I'm going to just pick key
values<00:03:10.379> here<00:03:11.150> let's<00:03:12.150> go<00:03:12.299> ahead<00:03:12.389> and<00:03:12.540> divide

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
values here let's go ahead and divide

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:18.559 
values here let's go ahead and divide
this<00:03:12.989> into<00:03:13.950> fourths<00:03:16.849> so<00:03:17.849> at<00:03:18.000> zero<00:03:18.269> degrees

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
this into fourths so at zero degrees

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.580 
this into fourths so at zero degrees
we're<00:03:18.870> at<00:03:18.989> zero<00:03:19.849> at<00:03:20.849> PI<00:03:21.090> over<00:03:21.120> 2<00:03:21.659> or<00:03:22.019> 90<00:03:22.229> degrees

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
we're at zero at PI over 2 or 90 degrees

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:30.979 
we're at zero at PI over 2 or 90 degrees
we're<00:03:23.579> at<00:03:23.699> 1<00:03:25.310> at<00:03:26.310> PI<00:03:27.049> we're<00:03:28.049> back<00:03:28.229> at<00:03:28.379> 0<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.989> at

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
we're at 1 at PI we're back at 0 and at

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.439 
we're at 1 at PI we're back at 0 and at
270<00:03:31.650> or<00:03:31.769> 3<00:03:31.949> PI<00:03:32.129> over<00:03:32.159> 2<00:03:32.370> we're<00:03:32.729> at<00:03:32.819> negative<00:03:33.180> 1

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
270 or 3 PI over 2 we're at negative 1

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.099 
270 or 3 PI over 2 we're at negative 1
and<00:03:33.979> 2<00:03:34.979> pi<00:03:35.220> we're<00:03:35.579> back<00:03:35.729> at<00:03:35.909> 0<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.840> from<00:03:37.019> the

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
and 2 pi we're back at 0 so from the

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.189 
and 2 pi we're back at 0 so from the
previous<00:03:37.560> animation<00:03:37.859> we<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.579> see<00:03:38.939> the<00:03:39.900> graph

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
previous animation we can see the graph

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.719 
previous animation we can see the graph
of<00:03:40.409> sine<00:03:40.439> function<00:03:41.189> will<00:03:41.340> look<00:03:41.489> something

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
of sine function will look something

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.939 
of sine function will look something
like<00:03:41.879> this<00:03:42.329> again<00:03:43.199> we<00:03:43.319> could<00:03:43.439> fill<00:03:43.620> in<00:03:43.769> more

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
like this again we could fill in more

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.679 
like this again we could fill in more
values<00:03:44.459> but<00:03:44.759> I<00:03:44.790> think<00:03:45.060> from<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.299> previous

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
values but I think from the previous

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.050 
values but I think from the previous
animation<00:03:45.900> we<00:03:46.409> can<00:03:46.439> tell<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.729> graph<00:03:47.909> of

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
animation we can tell that the graph of

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.339 
animation we can tell that the graph of
this<00:03:48.180> function<00:03:48.239> will<00:03:48.780> look<00:03:48.810> something<00:03:49.319> like

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
this function will look something like

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:56.059 
this function will look something like
this<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:54.079> once<00:03:55.079> we<00:03:55.199> have<00:03:55.379> this<00:03:55.560> graph<00:03:55.799> and

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
this so once we have this graph and

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.949 
this so once we have this graph and
we're<00:03:56.189> asked<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.400> find<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.759> domain<00:03:56.879> we<00:03:57.780> could

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
we're asked to find the domain we could

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.530 
we're asked to find the domain we could
find<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.829> value<00:03:59.280> of<00:03:59.310> sine<00:03:59.729> theta<00:03:59.759> for<00:04:00.329> any

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
find the value of sine theta for any

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.780 
find the value of sine theta for any
angle<00:04:00.840> we<00:04:01.109> wanted<00:04:01.379> to<00:04:01.439> choose<00:04:01.699> therefore<00:04:02.699> the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
angle we wanted to choose therefore the

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.110 
angle we wanted to choose therefore the
domain<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.359> all<00:04:03.389> reals<00:04:03.859> but<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:04.979> range<00:04:05.280> will

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
domain is all reals but the range will

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.879 
domain is all reals but the range will
always<00:04:06.359> be<00:04:06.509> between<00:04:06.689> negative<00:04:07.199> 1<00:04:07.620> and

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
always be between negative 1 and

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.640 
always be between negative 1 and
positive<00:04:07.949> 1<00:04:09.109> so<00:04:10.109> on<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.409> closed<00:04:10.620> interval

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
positive 1 so on the closed interval

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.499 
positive 1 so on the closed interval
from<00:04:11.099> negative<00:04:11.310> one<00:04:11.729> to<00:04:11.759> positive<00:04:11.879> one<00:04:12.359> would

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
from negative one to positive one would

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:14.689 
from negative one to positive one would
be<00:04:12.629> our<00:04:12.659> range<00:04:13.040> next<00:04:14.040> we<00:04:14.250> already<00:04:14.519> say<00:04:14.669> that

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
be our range next we already say that

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.469 
be our range next we already say that
the<00:04:15.060> period<00:04:15.389> would<00:04:15.540> equal<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.079> PI<00:04:16.289> radians<00:04:16.739> and

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
the period would equal to PI radians and

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.749 
the period would equal to PI radians and
the<00:04:18.479> amplitude<00:04:18.870> can<00:04:19.620> be<00:04:19.680> viewed<00:04:20.039> as<00:04:20.190> half<00:04:20.549> the

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 
the amplitude can be viewed as half the

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.360 
the amplitude can be viewed as half the
distance<00:04:21.120> from<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.539> max<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.139> men<00:04:22.469> well

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
distance from the max to the men well

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.950 
distance from the max to the men well
the<00:04:23.490> distance<00:04:23.729> from<00:04:24.029> negative<00:04:24.450> 1<00:04:24.659> to<00:04:24.690> positive

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
the distance from negative 1 to positive

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.440 
the distance from negative 1 to positive
1<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.469> 2<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:26.039> half

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
1 is 2 and half

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.660 
1 is 2 and half
that<00:04:26.570> would<00:04:26.720> be<00:04:26.870> one<00:04:27.170> you<00:04:27.890> can<00:04:28.070> also<00:04:28.220> think<00:04:28.550> of

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
that would be one you can also think of

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.370 
that would be one you can also think of
it<00:04:28.790> as<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.060> distance<00:04:29.420> from<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.690> x-axis<00:04:30.050> to

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
it as the distance from the x-axis to

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.800 
it as the distance from the x-axis to
the<00:04:30.590> max<00:04:30.920> or<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.220> min<00:04:31.370> which<00:04:32.330> again<00:04:32.600> would<00:04:32.750> be

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
the max or the min which again would be

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.710 
the max or the min which again would be
equal<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.230> one<00:04:34.150> okay<00:04:35.150> let's<00:04:35.180> go<00:04:35.450> and<00:04:35.600> take<00:04:35.660> a

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
equal to one okay let's go and take a

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.990 
equal to one okay let's go and take a
look<00:04:35.900> at<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.110> graph<00:04:36.290> of<00:04:36.440> cosine<00:04:36.470> theta<00:04:37.160> using

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
look at the graph of cosine theta using

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.910 
look at the graph of cosine theta using
the<00:04:38.090> Wolfram<00:04:38.420> demonstration<00:04:39.140> so<00:04:39.650> we'll<00:04:39.800> get

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
the Wolfram demonstration so we'll get

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.430 
the Wolfram demonstration so we'll get
rid<00:04:40.040> of<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.310> sine<00:04:40.550> function<00:04:41.050> remember<00:04:42.050> cosine

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
rid of the sine function remember cosine

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.560 
rid of the sine function remember cosine
theta<00:04:42.680> is<00:04:42.800> equal<00:04:43.100> to<00:04:43.130> X<00:04:43.610> on<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.120> unit<00:04:44.390> circle

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
theta is equal to X on the unit circle

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.840 
theta is equal to X on the unit circle
so<00:04:45.320> now<00:04:45.440> we're<00:04:45.620> looking<00:04:45.740> at<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.100> x<00:04:46.280> coordinate

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
so now we're looking at the x coordinate

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.270 
so now we're looking at the x coordinate
of<00:04:46.970> this<00:04:47.150> point<00:04:47.540> so<00:04:47.750> at<00:04:47.870> zero<00:04:48.110> degrees<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.770> x

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
of this point so at zero degrees the x

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.730 
of this point so at zero degrees the x
coordinate<00:04:49.790> is<00:04:49.850> equal<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.240> positive<00:04:50.420> one<00:04:50.930> at

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
coordinate is equal to positive one at

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.950 
coordinate is equal to positive one at
PI<00:04:52.700> over<00:04:52.940> two<00:04:53.060> radians<00:04:53.210> or<00:04:53.420> 90<00:04:53.630> degrees<00:04:53.840> that's

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
PI over two radians or 90 degrees that's

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.870 
PI over two radians or 90 degrees that's
equal<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:54.380> zero<00:04:56.560> at<00:04:57.560> PI<00:04:57.620> it's<00:04:58.580> equal<00:04:58.850> to

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
equal to zero at PI it's equal to

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.870 
equal to zero at PI it's equal to
negative<00:05:02.380> 1/3<00:05:03.380> PI<00:05:03.590> over<00:05:03.860> 2<00:05:04.040> or<00:05:04.250> 207<00:05:04.820> degrees

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
negative 1/3 PI over 2 or 207 degrees

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.920 
negative 1/3 PI over 2 or 207 degrees
we're<00:05:05.270> at<00:05:05.360> zero<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:06.050> then<00:05:07.120> at<00:05:08.120> 2<00:05:08.360> pi<00:05:08.600> we're

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
we're at zero and then at 2 pi we're

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.540 
we're at zero and then at 2 pi we're
back<00:05:09.080> at<00:05:09.290> positive<00:05:09.800> one<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:10.220> this<00:05:10.340> is<00:05:10.400> a

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
back at positive one so this is a

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.220 
back at positive one so this is a
different<00:05:10.970> graph<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.510> sine<00:05:11.780> theta<00:05:11.810> this<00:05:12.170> is

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
different graph and sine theta this is

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.410 
different graph and sine theta this is
cosine<00:05:12.770> theta<00:05:12.830> but<00:05:13.730> again<00:05:14.030> we<00:05:14.150> can<00:05:14.270> see<00:05:14.390> the

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
cosine theta but again we can see the

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.560 
cosine theta but again we can see the
period<00:05:14.900> would<00:05:15.050> be<00:05:15.110> two<00:05:15.440> pi<00:05:15.680> radians<00:05:16.190> and<00:05:16.580> again

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
period would be two pi radians and again

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.860 
period would be two pi radians and again
we<00:05:17.690> can<00:05:17.870> use<00:05:18.110> negative<00:05:18.500> angles<00:05:19.040> to<00:05:19.250> produce

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
we can use negative angles to produce

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:27.090 
we can use negative angles to produce
another<00:05:20.870> period<00:05:21.260> of<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.770> cosine<00:05:22.040> function

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.050 

okay<00:05:28.100> let's<00:05:28.250> go<00:05:28.370> ahead<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.580> graph<00:05:28.730> this<00:05:28.880> by

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
okay let's go ahead and graph this by

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.940 
okay let's go ahead and graph this by
hand<00:05:29.300> as<00:05:29.480> well<00:05:29.660> again<00:05:30.260> I've<00:05:30.380> already<00:05:30.500> taken

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.960 
the liberty to fill out this table again
you<00:05:33.410> could<00:05:33.560> do<00:05:33.650> this<00:05:33.770> on<00:05:33.980> your<00:05:34.160> own<00:05:34.190> if<00:05:34.580> changed

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
you could do this on your own if changed

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.450 
you could do this on your own if changed
the<00:05:35.090> function<00:05:35.480> to<00:05:35.660> cosine<00:05:36.140> X<00:05:36.410> and<00:05:36.680> go<00:05:37.280> to<00:05:37.370> the

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.550 
should be able to figure out that the
graph<00:06:14.750> of<00:06:14.870> this<00:06:14.990> will<00:06:15.200> be<00:06:15.290> a<00:06:15.320> nice<00:06:15.590> curve

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
graph of this will be a nice curve

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.790 
graph of this will be a nice curve
something<00:06:18.560> like<00:06:18.740> this<00:06:19.190> and<00:06:20.260> again<00:06:21.260> our<00:06:21.470> domain

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
something like this and again our domain

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.280 
something like this and again our domain
would<00:06:21.950> be<00:06:22.010> all<00:06:22.130> reals<00:06:22.550> this<00:06:23.420> graph<00:06:23.750> moves<00:06:24.020> left

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
would be all reals this graph moves left

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.800 
would be all reals this graph moves left
and<00:06:24.440> right<00:06:24.530> forever<00:06:24.890> and<00:06:25.340> the<00:06:26.270> range<00:06:26.510> again

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
and right forever and the range again

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.810 
and right forever and the range again
would<00:06:27.110> be<00:06:27.230> from<00:06:27.440> negative<00:06:27.470> 1<00:06:27.980> to<00:06:28.010> positive<00:06:28.130> 1

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
would be from negative 1 to positive 1

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.140 
would be from negative 1 to positive 1
and<00:06:29.030> our<00:06:29.930> period<00:06:30.380> is<00:06:30.500> also<00:06:30.890> 2<00:06:30.950> pi<00:06:31.370> radians<00:06:31.550> and

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
and our period is also 2 pi radians and

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.930 
and our period is also 2 pi radians and
our<00:06:32.600> amplitude<00:06:32.930> is<00:06:33.290> also<00:06:33.620> 1<00:06:33.890> we'll<00:06:34.550> talk<00:06:34.730> more

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
our amplitude is also 1 we'll talk more

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.970 
our amplitude is also 1 we'll talk more
about<00:06:35.000> the<00:06:35.300> amplitude<00:06:35.480> and<00:06:35.720> period<00:06:35.780> later<00:06:36.230> ok

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
about the amplitude and period later ok

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.410 
about the amplitude and period later ok
so<00:06:37.040> let's<00:06:37.220> briefly<00:06:37.460> talk<00:06:37.790> about<00:06:37.820> periodic

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
so let's briefly talk about periodic

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.910 
so let's briefly talk about periodic
functions

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
functions

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.820 
functions
a<00:06:40.000> function<00:06:41.000> f<00:06:41.150> is<00:06:41.300> said<00:06:41.330> to<00:06:41.600> be<00:06:41.690> periodic<00:06:42.140> if<00:06:42.560> f

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830

of<00:06:46.310> X<00:06:46.700> so<00:06:47.480> for<00:06:47.630> the<00:06:47.720> two<00:06:47.870> graphs<00:06:48.080> we<00:06:48.320> just

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
of X so for the two graphs we just

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.510 
of X so for the two graphs we just
looked<00:06:48.740> at<00:06:48.980> if<00:06:49.160> P<00:06:49.820> was<00:06:50.000> 2<00:06:50.240> pi<00:06:51.280> these<00:06:52.280> two

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
looked at if P was 2 pi these two

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.950 
looked at if P was 2 pi these two
