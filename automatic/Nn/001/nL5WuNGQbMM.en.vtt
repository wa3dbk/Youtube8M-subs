00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
happen is the wet rub gets applied to

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.299 
happen is the wet rub gets applied to
the<00:00:29.189> flesh<00:00:30.080> it<00:00:31.080> will<00:00:31.349> start<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.679> draw<00:00:31.859> moisture

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the flesh it will start to draw moisture

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.569 
the flesh it will start to draw moisture
out<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.969> flesh<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.510> pull<00:00:34.200> back<00:00:34.579> moisture

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
out of the flesh and pull back moisture

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.160

from the marinade that flavors
everything<00:00:37.590> else<00:00:37.710> translates<00:00:38.309> into<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.940> lot<00:00:39.120> of

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
everything else translates into a lot of

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.590 
everything else translates into a lot of
flavor<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.809> fact<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:41.239> eventually<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> cell

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
flavor in fact and eventually the cell

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200 
flavor in fact and eventually the cell
walls<00:00:42.989> will<00:00:43.710> not<00:00:43.920> let<00:00:44.129> any<00:00:44.399> more<00:00:44.640> moisture<00:00:44.789> out

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
walls will not let any more moisture out

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.330 
walls will not let any more moisture out
of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:47.149> product<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.980> not<00:00:49.980> pull

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
of the product and it will not pull

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.840 
of the product and it will not pull
anymore<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.809> take

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
anymore in but that that can take

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.810 
anymore in but that that can take
several<00:00:53.850> hours<00:00:54.620> according<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.309> density

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
several hours according to the density

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.900 
several hours according to the density
of<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.059> flesh<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.410> halibut<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.219> fairly

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
of the flesh and the halibut is a fairly

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.150 
of the flesh and the halibut is a fairly
medium<00:01:00.239> density<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.680> quite<00:01:01.890> delicate

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
medium density and it's quite delicate

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.729 
medium density and it's quite delicate
so<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> doesn't<00:01:03.000> take<00:01:03.180> anywhere<00:01:03.899> from<00:01:03.960> what

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
so it doesn't take anywhere from what

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.609 
so it doesn't take anywhere from what
doesn't<00:01:05.010> take<00:01:05.159> more<00:01:05.400> than<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.640> couple<00:01:06.090> hours<00:01:06.619> so

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
doesn't take more than a couple hours so

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.690 
doesn't take more than a couple hours so
what<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.369> I'm<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.520> to
