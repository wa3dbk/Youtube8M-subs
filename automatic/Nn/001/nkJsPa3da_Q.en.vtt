00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.389 

let's<00:00:00.719> look<00:00:00.870> at<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.079> variation<00:00:01.650> that<00:00:01.740> exists<00:00:02.280> on

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
let's look at a variation that exists on

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.630 
let's look at a variation that exists on
your<00:00:02.580> chart<00:00:02.959> example<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.200> vary<00:00:04.920> some<00:00:05.190> example

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
your chart example to vary some example

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.629 
your chart example to vary some example
one<00:00:05.819> only<00:00:06.390> at<00:00:06.569> measure<00:00:06.870> 10<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:08.189> allows<00:00:08.490> you

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
one only at measure 10 this allows you

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.370 
one only at measure 10 this allows you
to<00:00:08.730> walk<00:00:09.000> down<00:00:09.330> from<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.809> peak<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
to walk down from that peak of the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.780 
to walk down from that peak of the
progression<00:00:10.860> remember<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.160> said<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.580> when<00:00:11.700> we

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
progression remember I said that when we

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.910 
progression remember I said that when we
hit<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.120> five<00:00:12.360> chord<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.840> measure<00:00:13.049> 9<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.620> call

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
hit the five chord in measure 9 I call

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.589 
hit the five chord in measure 9 I call
that<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.280> peak<00:00:14.549> because<00:00:14.969> it's<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> highest

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
that the peak because it's the highest

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.439 
that the peak because it's the highest
pitched<00:00:16.049> cord<00:00:16.529> I'm<00:00:17.490> going<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.789> play<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.270> now

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.820 
pitched cord I'm going to play that now
I<00:00:18.510> don't<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.779> track<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.140> demonstrates

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
I don't have a track that demonstrates

I don't have a track that demonstrates
every<00:00:20.160> single<00:00:20.460> example<00:00:20.789> here<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.720> only

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
every single example here so the only

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960 
every single example here so the only
variation<00:00:22.410> would<00:00:22.830> be<00:00:23.039> when<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.279> get<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.850> that

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
variation would be when we get to that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.730 
variation would be when we get to that
change<00:00:24.359> let's<00:00:25.080> play<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.590> these

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that that means you're just connecting

from Mattingly between two chords you do

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.549 
from Mattingly between two chords you do

in<00:01:12.630> measure<00:01:12.869> 12<00:01:13.260> now<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> very<00:01:13.740> important

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
in measure 12 now a very important

in measure 12 now a very important
theory<00:01:14.460> principle<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.330> five<00:01:15.600> always

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
theory principle is that the five always

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.660 
theory principle is that the five always
wants<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> resolve<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.340> that's<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
wants to resolve to the one that's a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.969 
wants to resolve to the one that's a
very<00:01:17.880> strong<00:01:18.299> movement<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.409> occurs<00:01:19.770> in

very strong movement that occurs in

very strong movement that occurs in
nature<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.520> music<00:01:21.110> let's<00:01:22.110> play<00:01:22.350> the

you hear how strong that makes it want

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.510 
you hear how strong that makes it want
to<00:01:51.330> start<00:01:51.630> over<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.140> that's<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:53.160> common

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to start over and that's a very common

five chord in measure 12 let's combine
examples<00:01:58.830> one<00:01:59.370> two<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.240> three<00:02:00.690> we're<00:02:01.260> going

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
examples one two and three we're going

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.230 
examples one two and three we're going
to<00:02:01.440> put<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.770> variation<00:02:02.370> from<00:02:02.490> example<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to put the variation from example to

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.570 
to put the variation from example to
wherein<00:02:04.110> measure<00:02:04.500> 10<00:02:04.860> you're<00:02:05.100> walking<00:02:05.460> down

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
wherein measure 10 you're walking down

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.760 
wherein measure 10 you're walking down
to<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.820> four<00:02:06.090> chord<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:06.900> an<00:02:07.050> example<00:02:07.500> 3

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
to the four chord and then an example 3

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.710 
to the four chord and then an example 3
we<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.070> that<00:02:08.280> five<00:02:08.520> chord<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.270> our<00:02:09.390> complete

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
we have that five chord so our complete

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.350 
we have that five chord so our complete
progression<00:02:10.200> will<00:02:10.320> be<00:02:10.410> as<00:02:10.530> follows<00:02:11.959> 1111<00:02:14.360> 441

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
progression will be as follows 1111 441

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.699 
progression will be as follows 1111 441
15<00:02:16.290> for<00:02:16.740> 15<00:02:17.220> I'm<00:02:18.000> calling<00:02:18.600> out<00:02:18.900> what<00:02:19.380> occurs
