00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 but opinions don't work no way 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.189
 the caterpillars arrived as your name is 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.360
 Anatoly Surname and Ichu 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.059
 tell me how many days you are here already 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.099
 the third day I stand 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.390
 the third day in which queue I am now 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.460
 I look you do not know there somewhere 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.170
 more than a pound above the workers that is you 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.570
 according to your calculations how much more about 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.320
 probably it will probably 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.750
 still probably a couple of days behind and 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.440
 documents handed over to us 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.280
 permission the cut means told us 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.170
 battle for three days 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.780
 we will stand it a hundred percent they 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.170
 will declare what here I survive a kiosk with 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.550
 products with drinking water as if from water 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.270
 Nothing of course on how much prices can 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.360
 raised 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.930
 very much three times higher than usual 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.899
 give an example let's say we sell 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:06.750
 marinations 312 loaf of bread 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:10.170
 tanks is here in these cafes in yesterday 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.130
 will work today on 12 one carbonyl 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.950
 I bought for 4 years today a cafe 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.840
 have a bite to eat here's a cutlet river 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.579
 cabbage salad 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.250
 and a piece of bread here 32 32 hryvnia 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.829
 and then so it is what time they say 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.770
 that brought like a bit of toilets not 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.590
 apparently found on no old wreckage 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.130
 cost we do not know where they are either wrong 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.469
 side food stay on stay here 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.009
 such a thing on bye on the other side of the queue 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:50.039
 no no not only from this side 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.420
 with Russia on the outskirts of a man passes 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.239
 maybe you want to wish for something 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.599
 Russian customs or 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:02:08.640
 the Russian government came out faster 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:10.289
 we were released and there was a problem 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.299
 some may be perishable 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.500
 products 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:18.690
 No I did not expect this time all will 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.620
 I didn't buy any products 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.390
 except gas water and sugar a couple of pieces 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.720
 instead there is nothing and I did not expect that 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.579
 such if earlier they passed less than 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.120
 for the day should sweat Kirov 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.579
 how did the changes go 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.410
 happen the first but 25 happened 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:42.209
 until a little later I took the ranch 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.970
 food warned 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.010
 and now only happened but not 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.049
 warned do n't let them anyway 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.930
 warned would you think that with 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:55.019
 on the first day it will be nobody 25 us 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.169
 am making out but maybe they are nothing 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:01.910
 know they stupidly heard the dash canceled 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.910
 more and more nobody's water 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.170
 there are these that i have friends and people they 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.060
 Shakira said the groom as all 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.290
 let them not go they walk me dark 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.790
 in issued released although on the way here 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.610
 no cherries cat on the phone 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:27.870
 I think, and so this ad is 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.120
 it turns out the customer is already and not 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.910
 worried here is that the goods will be 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:40.300
 to pass through the border while as if 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.310
 I guarantee declaration 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.190
 really going to that power not 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.790
 somewhere at the customs here and that everything is there 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.920
 things will not be in addition to the well that is it in 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.850
 I already have but some passage 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.030
 equally here and so people took the coil 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.610
 this whole thing or something else I also do not 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.850
 knew they drove and you want to hold 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.239
 through them in and from whom cattle cannot 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.480
 field 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.910
 that is, there as a cork so neutral 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.840
 hammered from the main hammered and here I am 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:17.380
 here the guys are waiting too shagin come this 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.410
 code then they can't go either 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.410
 and
