just<00:02:43.379> behind<00:02:43.650> us<00:02:43.860> here<00:02:44.040> we've<00:02:44.250> got<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.459> solid<00:02:44.940> c

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
just behind us here we've got a solid c

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.660 
just behind us here we've got a solid c
mekole<00:02:45.659> where<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.319> plant<00:02:46.560> life<00:02:46.739> just<00:02:47.040> felt<00:02:47.280> on

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
mekole where the plant life just felt on

mekole where the plant life just felt on
top<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:48.060> each<00:02:48.150> other<00:02:48.239> continuously<00:02:48.959> here<00:02:49.680> it

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
top of each other continuously here it

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.410 
top of each other continuously here it
was<00:02:49.920> very<00:02:50.159> sporadic<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.790> that's<00:02:50.970> hence<00:02:51.209> why

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
was very sporadic and that's hence why

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.589 
was very sporadic and that's hence why
we've<00:02:51.659> got<00:02:51.840> just<00:02:52.260> single<00:02:52.680> leaves<00:02:52.920> here

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
we've got just single leaves here

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.970 
we've got just single leaves here
another<00:02:54.599> good<00:02:54.870> example<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.470> different

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
another good example is the different

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.589 
another good example is the different
type<00:02:56.129> of<00:02:56.159> vegetation<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.940> we<00:02:57.090> have<00:02:57.269> here<00:02:57.420> too

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
type of vegetation that we have here too

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.020 
type of vegetation that we have here too
is<00:02:57.720> leaf<00:02:57.959> almost<00:02:58.349> there<00:02:58.560> it's<00:02:59.370> it's<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.879> pretty
