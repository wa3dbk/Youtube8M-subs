00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
and sometimes people even do a hammer on

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.990 
and sometimes people even do a hammer on
like<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:36.100> it's<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.160> very<00:02:37.370> nice<00:02:37.550> sound

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
like this and it's a very nice sound

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.240 
like this and it's a very nice sound
it's<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.140> little<00:02:39.230> bit<00:02:39.380> more<00:02:39.530> difficult<00:02:39.740> though

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
it's a little bit more difficult though

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.040 
it's a little bit more difficult though
because<00:02:40.490> you're<00:02:40.940> not<00:02:41.060> just<00:02:41.270> hammering<00:02:41.570> on<00:02:41.720> one

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
because you're not just hammering on one

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.600 
because you're not just hammering on one
of<00:02:42.140> those<00:02:42.230> you're<00:02:42.500> hammering<00:02:42.740> on<00:02:42.920> two<00:02:43.310> notes

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
of those you're hammering on two notes

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.400 
of those you're hammering on two notes
and<00:02:43.880> this<00:02:44.090> one's<00:02:44.300> time<00:02:44.510> more<00:02:44.780> like<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:44.930> slide

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
and this one's time more like a slide

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.140 
and this one's time more like a slide
into<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:46.010> note<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:46.519> you're<00:02:46.670> going<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:49.150> say

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
into that note so you're going I say

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.080 
into that note so you're going I say
Oscar<00:02:50.390> use<00:02:50.780> this<00:02:50.959> technique<00:02:51.530> sometimes<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:52.970> it

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
Oscar use this technique sometimes so it

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.979 
Oscar use this technique sometimes so it
goes<00:02:57.489> making<00:02:58.489> sense<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:58.880> hope<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.239> so<00:02:59.780> that's

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
goes making sense I hope and so that's

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.660 
goes making sense I hope and so that's
the<00:03:00.140> key<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.560> D<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.040> let<00:03:01.160> me<00:03:01.250> show<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.489> how<00:03:01.519> you

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
the key of D so let me show you how you

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.580 
the key of D so let me show you how you
incorporate<00:03:02.269> this<00:03:02.390> into<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.750> song<00:03:03.170> let's<00:03:03.470> say

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
incorporate this into a song let's say

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:23.820 
incorporate this into a song let's say
you're<00:03:03.739> playing<00:03:04.010> deep<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:16.220> anything<00:03:16.519> indeed

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.460 

back<00:03:24.830> you<00:03:25.549> could<00:03:25.730> also<00:03:25.910> likewise<00:03:26.540> change<00:03:27.170> the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
back you could also likewise change the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.800 
back you could also likewise change the
key<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.980> take<00:03:28.549> the<00:03:28.700> same<00:03:28.940> leg<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.450> use<00:03:29.600> it

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
key and take the same leg and use it

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.949 
key and take the same leg and use it
let's<00:03:29.989> say<00:03:30.140> we're<00:03:30.320> in<00:03:30.730> G<00:03:31.730> now<00:03:31.940> you<00:03:32.570> would<00:03:32.720> play

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
let's say we're in G now you would play
