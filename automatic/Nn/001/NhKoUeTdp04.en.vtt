00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 So I greet everyone dear friends with 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.980
 by you again I am the domino of the space today 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.300
 I will look at my custom 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.900
 creation transformer bounder crush a 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.820
 assembled from their own league details that is 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.800
 Home made clear to all without instructions by 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.599
 Nothing would do it in general and Crusher 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.179
 First, what I want to say first is 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.570
 why did they start to leave the video more often on 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.410
 English than in Russian, all because 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.030
 I go international 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.200
 I do not know how to say something differently 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.660
 I will do reviews in English 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.390
 more often in what and in Russian as in 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.700
 Russian look only guys from there not 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.730
 I know with Russia from Ukraine to Kazakhstan more 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:00.420
 from somewhere well, in general, very small 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.430
 the soil to the people that is and therefore i will be on 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.450
 international scale to go out already 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.409
 shoot a video in English to 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.420
 attract people from other countries 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.500
 Actually I think I explained myself 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.700
 so videos will be more common in Welsh 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.509
 than in Russian that is in Russian 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.890
 almost not at all but 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.460
 Actually do not grieve the ice 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.770
 if so than we start the review that is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.350
 I will have a video review first in Russian 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.920
 I'll post this video review then I'm on 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.659
 English God, and so I won Crusher 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.200
 actually showed you how he 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:43.399
 looks in my machine model i don't 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:50.090
 I know something else to say in general 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.090
 transform it all turns head 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:57.869
 fingers that case and hands and actually before 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.149
 you are the bone crusher of your own person and 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.009
 so that this philomena would not bother you 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.020
 you can just take it back 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:09.810
 and everything will be fine and so here 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.590
 our bank rasher looks nothing 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.590
 very special but very necessary 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:20.830
 out and there such a bank rush as well 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.599
 fingers move everything he moves the same 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.349
 so you can do how to walk and 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.530
 actually on this i finish the guys 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:32.769
 this is probably the last video in Russian 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.910
 maybe I'm not saying that this is true but I 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.470
 as I already said 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.910
 I will do them in English so yes 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.910
 good luck everyone all bye
