00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.150 
today I want to ever talk to you about a
bit<00:00:13.120> more<00:00:13.150> of<00:00:13.360> an<00:00:13.450> advanced<00:00:13.840> scale<00:00:14.469> exercise

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
bit more of an advanced scale exercise

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.070 
bit more of an advanced scale exercise
if<00:00:16.029> you're<00:00:16.150> just<00:00:16.390> getting<00:00:16.660> started<00:00:16.750> with<00:00:17.020> your

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
if you're just getting started with your

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.620 
if you're just getting started with your
major<00:00:17.289> scales<00:00:17.710> and<00:00:18.070> you<00:00:18.279> you're<00:00:19.270> learning

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
major scales and you you're learning

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.779 
major scales and you you're learning
them<00:00:20.230> over<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.680> whole<00:00:20.859> range<00:00:21.100> of<00:00:21.220> instruments

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
them over the whole range of instruments

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.160 
them over the whole range of instruments
and<00:00:21.850> I<00:00:21.939> think<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.210> next<00:00:22.390> step<00:00:22.539> really<00:00:22.810> is<00:00:22.840> to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
and I think the next step really is to

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.460 
and I think the next step really is to
be<00:00:23.800> a<00:00:23.830> bit<00:00:24.039> brave<00:00:24.310> and<00:00:24.640> try<00:00:25.330> learning<00:00:25.600> all<00:00:26.199> of

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
be a bit brave and try learning all of

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.839 
be a bit brave and try learning all of
your<00:00:26.590> major<00:00:26.740> scales<00:00:27.160> because<00:00:27.490> at<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.730> end<00:00:27.760> of

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
your major scales because at the end of

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.870 
your major scales because at the end of
the<00:00:27.939> day<00:00:28.119> scales<00:00:28.869> are<00:00:29.439> just<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:29.830> pattern<00:00:30.099> and<00:00:30.490> if

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
the day scales are just a pattern and if

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.030 
the day scales are just a pattern and if
you<00:00:31.300> can<00:00:31.480> memorize<00:00:31.720> that<00:00:32.199> pattern<00:00:32.710> get<00:00:32.950> it

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
you can memorize that pattern get it

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.500 
you can memorize that pattern get it
under<00:00:33.250> your<00:00:33.280> fingers<00:00:33.370> and<00:00:33.910> use<00:00:34.059> what<00:00:34.239> we<00:00:34.329> call

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
under your fingers and use what we call

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.979 
under your fingers and use what we call
if<00:00:34.930> your<00:00:35.440> muscle<00:00:35.860> memory<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:37.329> retain<00:00:37.719> those

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
if your muscle memory to retain those

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.110 
if your muscle memory to retain those
those<00:00:38.530> scales<00:00:38.829> in<00:00:39.010> other<00:00:39.129> words<00:00:39.340> practice

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
those scales in other words practice

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.119 
those scales in other words practice
them<00:00:40.329> just<00:00:40.870> like<00:00:40.989> a<00:00:41.050> sportsman<00:00:41.680> would<00:00:41.860> if<00:00:41.980> you

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
them just like a sportsman would if you

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.340 
them just like a sportsman would if you
know<00:00:42.190> shooting<00:00:42.550> goals<00:00:42.910> or<00:00:43.300> well<00:00:43.809> playing<00:00:44.050> golf

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
know shooting goals or well playing golf

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.049 
know shooting goals or well playing golf
whatever<00:00:44.530> you<00:00:44.860> know<00:00:44.980> you're<00:00:45.280> learning<00:00:45.430> with

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
whatever you know you're learning with

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.209 
whatever you know you're learning with
your<00:00:46.210> muscles<00:00:46.539> basically<00:00:47.079> to<00:00:47.500> memorize<00:00:47.950> how

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
your muscles basically to memorize how

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.760 
your muscles basically to memorize how
that<00:00:48.430> pattern<00:00:48.640> works<00:00:48.969> and<00:00:49.450> then<00:00:49.840> when<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:50.559> get

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
that pattern works and then when you get

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.930 
that pattern works and then when you get
to<00:00:50.920> playing<00:00:51.100> your<00:00:51.280> piece<00:00:51.460> whether<00:00:51.699> it's<00:00:51.789> a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
to playing your piece whether it's a

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.639 
to playing your piece whether it's a
classical<00:00:52.329> piece<00:00:52.539> or<00:00:52.780> a<00:00:52.809> jazz<00:00:53.020> piece<00:00:53.289> pop

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
classical piece or a jazz piece pop

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.369 
classical piece or a jazz piece pop
whatever<00:00:54.039> you'll<00:00:54.910> be<00:00:55.690> able<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.930> draw<00:00:56.079> on<00:00:56.230> that

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
whatever you'll be able to draw on that

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.580 
whatever you'll be able to draw on that
memory<00:00:56.680> to<00:00:57.250> use<00:00:57.430> those<00:00:57.640> scales<00:00:57.969> and<00:00:58.590> sound

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
memory to use those scales and sound

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.849 
memory to use those scales and sound
amazing<00:01:00.039> alright<00:01:00.640> so<00:01:01.510> here<00:01:01.870> we<00:01:01.960> go<00:01:02.140> with<00:01:02.829> a

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
amazing alright so here we go with a

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.060 
amazing alright so here we go with a
major<00:01:03.129> scale<00:01:03.489> a<00:01:04.379> fundable<00:01:05.379> way<00:01:05.590> of<00:01:05.710> practice

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
major scale a fundable way of practice

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.490 
major scale a fundable way of practice
that<00:01:06.100> is<00:01:06.400> to<00:01:06.610> actually<00:01:06.790> take<00:01:07.180> you<00:01:07.360> take<00:01:07.720> a<00:01:07.750> one

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
that is to actually take you take a one

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.520 
that is to actually take you take a one
octave<00:01:08.680> of<00:01:09.040> each<00:01:09.159> major<00:01:09.460> scale<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.290> play<00:01:11.290> that

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
octave of each major scale and play that

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.950 
octave of each major scale and play that
octave<00:01:12.189> C<00:01:12.430> let's<00:01:12.670> say<00:01:12.729> we<00:01:12.880> start<00:01:13.090> on<00:01:13.180> G<00:01:13.450> right

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
octave C let's say we start on G right

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.980 
octave C let's say we start on G right
so<00:01:14.170> we<00:01:14.260> get<00:01:14.380> from<00:01:14.560> G<00:01:14.860> although<00:01:15.580> out<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.880> G<00:01:16.119> go<00:01:16.840> up

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
so we get from G although out to G go up

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.870 
so we get from G although out to G go up
one<00:01:17.200> extra<00:01:17.470> note<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:17.890> then<00:01:18.400> all<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.759> way<00:01:18.850> back

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
one extra note and then all the way back

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.510 
one extra note and then all the way back
down<00:01:19.119> but<00:01:19.630> when<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:19.900> get<00:01:20.049> to<00:01:20.229> G<00:01:20.470> instead<00:01:21.430> of

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
down but when you get to G instead of

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.390 
down but when you get to G instead of
playing<00:01:21.700> G<00:01:21.970> go<00:01:22.360> up<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.570> semitone<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.380> play<00:01:23.590> G

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
playing G go up a semitone and play G

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.060 
playing G go up a semitone and play G
sharp<00:01:24.670> or<00:01:25.330> a<00:01:25.390> flat<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:26.080> then<00:01:26.590> play<00:01:26.770> your<00:01:26.799> a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
sharp or a flat and then play your a

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.310 
sharp or a flat and then play your a
flat<00:01:27.369> major<00:01:27.520> scale<00:01:27.729> all<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.689> way<00:01:28.780> out<00:01:28.869> one

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
flat major scale all the way out one

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.920 
flat major scale all the way out one
extra<00:01:29.619> note<00:01:29.770> all<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:31.000> way<00:01:31.119> back<00:01:31.329> down<00:01:31.509> but

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
extra note all the way back down but

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.090 
extra note all the way back down but
instead<00:01:32.049> of<00:01:32.200> playing<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.560> flat<00:01:32.950> at<00:01:33.070> the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
instead of playing the a flat at the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.940 
instead of playing the a flat at the
bottom<00:01:33.430> we<00:01:33.579> play<00:01:33.850> yes<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.110> guessed<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.470> an<00:01:35.680> A

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
bottom we play yes you guessed it an A

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.190 
bottom we play yes you guessed it an A
and<00:01:36.310> then<00:01:36.670> we<00:01:36.729> play<00:01:36.880> an<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.060> major<00:01:37.299> scale<00:01:37.450> so<00:01:38.170> you

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
and then we play an a major scale so you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.440 
and then we play an a major scale so you
can<00:01:38.290> see<00:01:38.380> how<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.710> pattern<00:01:38.979> works<00:01:39.189> now<00:01:40.119> there

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
can see how that pattern works now there

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.870 
can see how that pattern works now there

this<00:01:49.600> lesson<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.439> also<00:01:50.890> as<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.340> practice<00:01:52.060> guide

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
this lesson and also as a practice guide

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.840 
this lesson and also as a practice guide
when<00:01:52.750> you're<00:01:52.990> hopefully<00:01:53.770> practicing<00:01:54.579> this<00:01:54.700> at

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
when you're hopefully practicing this at

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.420 
when you're hopefully practicing this at
home<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:56.409> is<00:01:56.560> what<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.829> sounds<00:01:57.130> like<00:01:57.280> if

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
home so this is what it sounds like if

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.940 
home so this is what it sounds like if
we<00:01:57.549> start<00:01:57.820> with<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.119> G<00:01:58.329> Major<00:01:58.630> scale<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.469> I'm

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
we start with the G Major scale so I'm

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.219 
we start with the G Major scale so I'm
going<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.310> do<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.430> G<00:02:00.759> an<00:02:01.000> a-flat<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.719> an<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:01.930> major

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
going to do a G an a-flat and an a major

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.560 
going to do a G an a-flat and an a major
scale<00:02:02.380> just<00:02:02.860> as<00:02:03.070> a<00:02:03.100> starting<00:02:03.520> point<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:04.299> give

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
scale just as a starting point and give

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.880 
scale just as a starting point and give
you<00:02:04.659> an<00:02:04.719> idea<00:02:04.960> what<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.140> sounds<00:02:05.469> like

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
you an idea what it sounds like

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.309 
you an idea what it sounds like
it's<00:02:06.700> one<00:02:06.969> more<00:02:07.180> thing<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.689> would<00:02:08.140> definitely

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
it's one more thing I would definitely

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.640 
it's one more thing I would definitely
recommend<00:02:08.679> using<00:02:09.310> your<00:02:09.429> metronome<00:02:10.470> when<00:02:11.470> you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
recommend using your metronome when you

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.170 
recommend using your metronome when you
practicing<00:02:12.069> this<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.489> start<00:02:12.730> off<00:02:12.819> really

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
practicing this and start off really

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.589 
practicing this and start off really
slowly<00:02:13.689> because<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:15.159> always<00:02:15.549> the<00:02:16.030> thing<00:02:16.269> is<00:02:16.450> to

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
slowly because as always the thing is to

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.020 
slowly because as always the thing is to
be<00:02:16.750> able<00:02:17.049> to<00:02:17.230> play<00:02:17.439> it<00:02:17.530> accurately<00:02:18.099> at<00:02:18.519> first

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
be able to play it accurately at first

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.729 
be able to play it accurately at first
not<00:02:19.420> necessarily<00:02:19.870> playing<00:02:20.079> it<00:02:20.200> fast<00:02:20.470> but

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
not necessarily playing it fast but

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.800 
not necessarily playing it fast but
playing<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.069> accurately<00:02:21.640> if<00:02:22.299> you<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.569> get<00:02:22.720> it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
playing it accurately if you can get it

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.530 
playing it accurately if you can get it
fast<00:02:23.079> if<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.829> can<00:02:23.950> get<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.129> accurate<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.819> slow

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
fast if you can get it accurate and slow

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.539 
fast if you can get it accurate and slow
then<00:02:26.260> you'll<00:02:26.409> be<00:02:26.500> able<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.709> play<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:26.980> accurate

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
then you'll be able to play it accurate

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.819 
then you'll be able to play it accurate
and<00:02:27.760> fast<00:02:28.150> okay<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.319> other<00:02:29.379> way<00:02:29.530> around<00:02:29.739> if

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
and fast okay the other way around if

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.589 
and fast okay the other way around if
you<00:02:29.890> try<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.099> play<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.579> too<00:02:30.760> fast<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.390> it's

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
you try and play it too fast and it's

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.050 
you try and play it too fast and it's
not<00:02:31.750> accurate<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.890> unlikely<00:02:33.549> to<00:02:33.730> get<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.879> lot

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
not accurate it's unlikely to get a lot

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.569 
not accurate it's unlikely to get a lot
better<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.750> start<00:02:35.019> slow<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.560> accuracy<00:02:36.280> here

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
better so start slow and accuracy here

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:46.060 
better so start slow and accuracy here
we<00:02:36.640> go<00:02:36.730> G<00:02:36.939> major

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:57.890 

the<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.100> fly

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.110 

and<00:02:58.900> then<00:02:59.020> we<00:02:59.110> would<00:02:59.230> do<00:02:59.380> V<00:02:59.620> flat<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.640> on<00:03:00.850> up

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
and then we would do V flat and so on up

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.320 
and then we would do V flat and so on up
up<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.690> up<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.760> chromatic<00:03:03.760> scale<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:04.000> suppose

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
up the up the chromatic scale I suppose

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.830 
up the up the chromatic scale I suppose
B<00:03:04.660> flat<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.080> then<00:03:05.200> B<00:03:05.380> major<00:03:05.650> C<00:03:05.980> etc<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.660> it's<00:03:07.780> a

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
B flat and then B major C etc so it's a

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.720 
B flat and then B major C etc so it's a
great<00:03:08.020> fun<00:03:08.230> exercise<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:09.070> ideally<00:03:09.550> what

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
great fun exercise and ideally what

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.450 
great fun exercise and ideally what
you're<00:03:09.880> trying<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.180> do<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.690> play<00:03:11.460> that

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
you're trying to do is play that

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.220 
you're trying to do is play that
exercise<00:03:13.030> over<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.450> whole<00:03:13.690> range<00:03:13.930> of<00:03:14.110> the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
exercise over the whole range of the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.780 
exercise over the whole range of the
instrument<00:03:14.320> so<00:03:15.160> if<00:03:15.250> you're<00:03:15.370> really<00:03:15.580> brave

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
instrument so if you're really brave

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.190 
instrument so if you're really brave
what<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.180> do<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.570> can<00:03:16.660> start<00:03:16.780> on<00:03:16.960> the<00:03:17.050> low

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
what you do is you can start on the low

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.070 
what you do is you can start on the low
B<00:03:17.380> flat<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:19.090> would<00:03:19.240> keep<00:03:19.420> going<00:03:19.660> through

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
B flat and you would keep going through

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.900 
B flat and you would keep going through
until<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.860> reach<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.100> point<00:03:21.280> where<00:03:21.490> you<00:03:21.550> go<00:03:21.670> up

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
until you reach a point where you go up

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.330 
until you reach a point where you go up
to<00:03:22.150> high<00:03:22.360> F<00:03:22.780> or<00:03:23.110> higher<00:03:23.470> sharp<00:03:23.890> if<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.130> have<00:03:24.220> an

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
to high F or higher sharp if you have an

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.570 
to high F or higher sharp if you have an
F<00:03:24.460> sharp<00:03:24.490> key<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.590> then<00:03:26.590> gradually<00:03:27.190> try

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
F sharp key and then gradually try

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.580 
F sharp key and then gradually try
speeding<00:03:27.940> up<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.180> metronome<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.500> you

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
speeding up that metronome so that you

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.890 
speeding up that metronome so that you
can<00:03:29.740> play<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.010> quite<00:03:30.130> fast<00:03:30.490> okay<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.630> if

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
can play it quite fast okay so if

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
can play it quite fast okay so if
they're<00:03:32.080> not<00:03:32.110> going<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.410> end<00:03:32.590> up<00:03:32.710> sounding

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
they're not going to end up sounding

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.310 
they're not going to end up sounding
something<00:03:33.730> like<00:03:34.000> this<00:03:34.300> I'll<00:03:34.630> play<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.050> just<00:03:35.230> as

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
something like this I'll play it just as

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.380 
something like this I'll play it just as
we're<00:03:35.470> finishing<00:03:35.770> up<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.010> lesson<00:03:36.400> but<00:03:36.850> please
