and<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.580> picked<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:17.940> thing<00:00:18.240> up<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:19.199> second<00:00:19.859> hand

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570

which is a bit of a harder stock card

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.600 
which is a bit of a harder stock card
thing<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:16.810> gives<00:03:17.080> some<00:03:17.170> examples<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:18.040> the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
thing and it gives some examples of the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.880 
thing and it gives some examples of the
mechanics<00:03:19.120> by<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.390> looks<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:19.810> here<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:22.890> how

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
mechanics by the looks of it here so how

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.490 
mechanics by the looks of it here so how
those<00:03:24.100> work<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.970> system<00:03:25.180> there's<00:03:26.080> it's<00:03:26.410> a

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
those work in the system there's it's a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.620 
those work in the system there's it's a
countess<00:03:26.890> game<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.520> have<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.210> escape

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
countess game and you have to escape

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.750 
countess game and you have to escape
from<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:30.090> prison<00:03:31.770> camp<00:03:32.770> effectively<00:03:33.580> the

from the prison camp effectively the
fortress<00:03:34.570> look<00:03:35.380> at<00:03:35.530> this<00:03:35.770> look<00:03:36.580> at<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.790> the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
fortress look at this look at the the

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.840 
fortress look at this look at the the
box<00:03:37.690> has<00:03:37.990> even<00:03:38.230> got<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.620> sticker<00:03:39.130> thing<00:03:39.490> on<00:03:39.640> with

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
box has even got a sticker thing on with

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.640 
box has even got a sticker thing on with
this<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:41.020> know<00:03:41.170> for<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.470> oh<00:03:43.320> my<00:03:44.320> gosh

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
the board so well that is a that is a

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.390 
the board so well that is a that is a
big<00:03:48.910> big<00:03:49.180> boys<00:03:49.450> in<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.650> we<00:03:50.770> can<00:03:50.950> see<00:03:51.130> here

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
big big boys in it so we can see here

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.050 
big big boys in it so we can see here
that<00:03:51.670> it's<00:03:52.360> it's<00:03:53.260> got<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.710> grid<00:03:54.430> system<00:03:54.610> of

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
that it's it's got a grid system of

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.420 
that it's it's got a grid system of
circles<00:03:55.800> so<00:03:56.800> they'll<00:03:56.950> be<00:03:57.070> used<00:03:57.280> and

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
circles so they'll be used and

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.030 
circles so they'll be used and
apparently<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.030> layout<00:03:58.840> here<00:03:59.140> it's<00:03:59.860> all

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
apparently the layout here it's all

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.090 
apparently the layout here it's all
being<00:04:00.220> done<00:04:00.370> on<00:04:00.550> one<00:04:00.730> level<00:04:01.380> for<00:04:02.380> ease<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.590> play

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
being done on one level for ease of play

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.880 
being done on one level for ease of play
for<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.430> game<00:04:03.670> but<00:04:04.510> other<00:04:04.660> than<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:05.140> this<00:04:05.830> is

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
for a game but other than that this is

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.560 
for a game but other than that this is
the<00:04:06.370> actual<00:04:06.760> original<00:04:07.660> layout<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.470> Colditz<00:04:09.570> so

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
the actual original layout of Colditz so

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.540 
the actual original layout of Colditz so
it's<00:04:10.720> been<00:04:10.930> historically<00:04:11.530> recreated<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.460> be

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
it's been historically recreated to be

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.160 
it's been historically recreated to be
able<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.790> play<00:04:13.000> in<00:04:13.740> so<00:04:14.740> that<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.930> that's<00:04:16.930> just

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
able to play in so that is that's just

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.959 
able to play in so that is that's just
really<00:04:17.470> impressive<00:04:17.799> isn't<00:04:18.070> it

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:18.969 
really impressive isn't it

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:25.140 
really impressive isn't it
