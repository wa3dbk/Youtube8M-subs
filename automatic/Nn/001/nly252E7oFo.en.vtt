so many video game things back in

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.830 
so many video game things back in
whenever<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.400> growing<00:00:26.730> up<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.510> guess<00:00:27.689> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
whenever I was growing up and I guess I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.450 
whenever I was growing up and I guess I
just<00:00:28.019> missed<00:00:28.260> these<00:00:28.470> cuz<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:28.920> no<00:00:29.160> idea

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
just missed these cuz I have no idea

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.929 
just missed these cuz I have no idea
what<00:00:29.640> they<00:00:29.760> are

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
what they are

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.380 
what they are
they<00:00:30.900> were<00:00:30.990> only<00:00:31.199> 50<00:00:31.650> cents<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> mean<00:00:33.360> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
they were only 50 cents so I mean I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.520 
they were only 50 cents so I mean I
guess<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:33.719> were<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> quarter<00:00:34.200> whenever<00:00:34.440> they

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
guess they were a quarter whenever they

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.229 
guess they were a quarter whenever they
came<00:00:34.739> out<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.610> looks<00:00:35.640> like<00:00:35.850> they<00:00:36.030> come

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
came out but it looks like they come

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.880 
came out but it looks like they come
with<00:00:36.390> three<00:00:36.630> scratch-off<00:00:37.170> cards<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.739> two

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
stickers and they came out in 1989 so I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.660 
stickers and they came out in 1989 so I

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.690 

guess<00:02:36.040> that's<00:02:36.250> not<00:02:36.400> gonna<00:02:36.520> work<00:02:36.730> so<00:02:36.790> well<00:02:38.700> can

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
guess that's not gonna work so well can

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.880 
guess that's not gonna work so well can
barely<00:02:40.030> make<00:02:40.300> them<00:02:40.480> how<00:02:40.630> big<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:41.080> he<00:02:41.260> guess

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
barely make them how big is he guess

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.010 
barely make them how big is he guess
they<00:02:42.040> got<00:02:42.190> old<00:02:42.460> let<00:02:43.180> me<00:02:43.240> try<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.540> scratch<00:02:43.840> it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020

off<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.140> little<00:02:44.500> bit<00:02:44.620> more<00:02:47.100> yeah<00:02:48.130> that's<00:02:48.460> not

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
off a little bit more yeah that's not

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.390 
off a little bit more yeah that's not
even<00:02:48.940> gonna<00:02:49.030> work<00:02:49.330> guess<00:02:50.110> these<00:02:50.290> things<00:02:50.590> don't

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
even gonna work guess these things don't

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.240 
even gonna work guess these things don't
work<00:02:51.610> after<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.090> couple<00:02:52.420> years<00:02:52.680> well<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.890> lot<00:02:54.220> of

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
work after a couple years well a lot of

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.790 
work after a couple years well a lot of
years<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.570> guess<00:02:55.780> we<00:02:55.930> can't<00:02:56.140> see<00:02:56.320> what<00:02:56.470> what

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
years so I guess we can't see what what

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.950 
years so I guess we can't see what what
the<00:02:56.920> actual<00:02:57.190> game<00:02:57.490> was<00:02:57.700> about<00:02:57.820> but<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.660> figured

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
the actual game was about but I figured

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.110 
the actual game was about but I figured
I'd<00:02:59.050> open<00:02:59.350> these<00:02:59.440> up<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.280> know<00:03:00.760> figure

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
I'd open these up and you know figure

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.310 
I'd open these up and you know figure
out<00:03:01.150> what<00:03:01.390> they<00:03:01.540> were<00:03:01.600> with<00:03:01.930> all<00:03:02.110> my

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
out what they were with all my

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.820 
out what they were with all my
