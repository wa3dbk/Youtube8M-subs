00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.830
 good I told them I talked about the process of 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.530
 photosynthesis in that every 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.279
 organisms need energy skin 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:23.029
 board say to sprinkle airports 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:34.730
 hold their lives and their bodies holds 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:36.739
 this energy of chemical energy which 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.980
 are two foods that are 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.649
 initially leads the potash he tests 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.710
 so photosynthesis and the state was 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.600
 designed larger than standard 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:56.090
 because the production of German products 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:01:07.210
 who count are the elected representatives of the 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:07.210
 borders fats and videos 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.869
 that you have washed the myth of 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.670
 working on photosynthesis 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.330
 in vivo animal and plant agent that 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.430
 are used as on top of that of 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.170
 paper wood led them 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:31.520
 manufacturers like the cancun jackets at 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.280
 binary camp of its byproducts of 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.439
 photosynthesis thanks the mannequins 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.960
 store like the planes of cars the 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.439
 other means of transportation that uses 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.619
 of the campuses such as oil the 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.619
 natural gas 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.090
 the natural gas of sharon an orgy of 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:06.930
 plants of this information can say 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:12.260
 that the life of a potocnick phenomenon because 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.260
 converting energy plants from winners 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:30.200
 in the form of energy that now him 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:34.320
 know the raw materials an aura 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.020
 so is the only strength of the bro gen for 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.800
 the plans she plant uses two 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:53.040
 projects a sitting for 6 place de 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:56.640
 carbides of carbon dioxide that the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:02.340
 only source of white paul carbon and 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:17.100
 black you asshole angular matter of 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:22.410
 fat the nitrates layer paws they are 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.390
 more important to convert twelve 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:31.050
 they come from 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:34.560
 thank you phosphorus and fousseret 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.780
 larger animals that form the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.640
 heart that carries the energy one turns 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.980
 photosynthesis 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.390
 this is the magnesium that plays a role 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.060
 Very important 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.320
 training more and son and 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.590
 finally we have two brothers he participates 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.950
 to training 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.049
 some designate complete process of 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.060
 the prophetess us now what 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:09.109
 are the results of photosynthesis 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.109
 we have first results is souk 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:23.880
 I come from blue coat he did it the 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.920
 main product of the sadness there 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.160
 can be used to produce the 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.220
 essential protein for growth 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.230
 where it can be exposed during 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.920
 representing income subsidies 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.650
 to energy where it can be opened and 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:48.090
 by mingling there will be able to store is the 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:50.720
 second gene product so ultimately 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.270
 will know where photosynthesis will take place 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:05:03.630
 the field protein will take place in the 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:05.960
 green tissue of the plant so given 10 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.960
 green 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:20.930
 because it contains sugar the diet at 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:30.889
 sugar the Chinese rice contains their 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:33.500
 in case the green squares that have the 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.210
 key alive so that's it today the 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.030
 next time I was talking about places 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.050
 father until then thank you claude 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.050
