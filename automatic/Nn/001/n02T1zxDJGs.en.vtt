00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
a very small program it's new that gives

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.299 
a very small program it's new that gives

the program the other thing that really
attracted<00:00:31.529> me<00:00:31.589> in<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> program<00:00:32.070> was<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> fact

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:32.519 
attracted me in the program was the fact

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:33.979 
attracted me in the program was the fact
that<00:00:32.609> it<00:00:32.820> doesn't<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.210> focus<00:00:33.809> on

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
that it doesn't just focus on

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.900 
that it doesn't just focus on
