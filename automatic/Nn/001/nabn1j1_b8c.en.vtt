00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
cage so I moved it it used to sit right

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.979 
cage so I moved it it used to sit right
here<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.070> used<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.520> facing<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:51.719> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
here and it used to be facing like this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.130

it takes like three hours to do a like a

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.520 
it takes like three hours to do a like a
five<00:03:47.100> minute<00:03:47.400> video<00:03:47.810> anyway<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.050> I<00:03:49.080> had<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.320> do
