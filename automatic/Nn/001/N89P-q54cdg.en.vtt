00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.499
 greetings to all 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.750
 you are the one to wish and this will be a new segment of curiosity despotism 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.859
 well before starting 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.849
 I want to mention to you that this is pure hypothesis, that is, nothing is certain 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.000
 this is a research that a user mentioned to me in the social network not 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.380
 I will say which 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.350
 pussy that funny 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.530
 as well 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.610
 I came to the task of investigating in some forums and videos in 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.380
 the network to draw some conclusions and theories 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.720
 As you know some foreign forums are sometimes very helpful 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.420
 and of course also Mr. Google Translate xd 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.260
 Enough of blowjobs and cochi things 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.620
 I'm going to ask everyone in the room to turn off their cell phones send to the cock 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.380
 to his girlfriends and if they are girls send him to the cock but if they are sports fans 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.280
 send him the limit of this video so that they see it because it will be very good 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.510
 and also advised them to close their hurry your interest mary species 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.510
 metroflog and the television to it does not besides to the mother 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.770
 the name of this video will be curiosity despotism the theory of 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.070
 brother of euros 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.760
 all that we have seen there in Latin America by the cartoon channel 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.950
 network the first sporting chapters will have realized that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.340
 they 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.479
 started as a port of 10 years embarking on its journey to become 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.530
 in a teacher because 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.820
 we all know that his first match was a pikachu that is something that everyone 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.410
 already knows 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.870
 Now I want you to listen to these questions that I am going to ask you 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.050
 stop the video and remember it is very important that they do it so that 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.840
 understand the message in any way I will leave a waiting time 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.579
 ever 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.220
 when the first red and blue sports versions came out 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.220
 for those of us who had the joy of having a goal and in the times of the council 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.459
 we could name the character as years 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.480
 says that they always confused that character with an anime character 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.889
 the same series is not like that 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:19.420
 that's something that once we have spent saying that the character network 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.669
 of red and blue pokémon heras ketchum 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.649
 I suppose that at the time they will have felt something we are going to know that 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:30.790
 character was nothing less than red a totally different character to those that 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.669
 we all know because in fact the funny thing is that almost all the characters 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.999
 that have appeared from the game to date have appeared as a cameo in the 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.649
 anime as they say 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:41.460
 crystal 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.799
 sapir platinum 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.939
 pearl diamond not to mention those who have not yet appeared 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.979
 but because I mention all this 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:53.439
 there is a theory that says that the protagonist network of the first versions 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.809
 sports is older brother of years the protagonist of the anime sport 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.239
 I'm almost certain that many will tell me 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.340
 and its success do not confuse anime events with those of the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.860
 banking since the assembly is more faithful to fire 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.419
 two of the false allegations that the sidewalk was avoided 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.919
 They are partly right, but not in another because, as I mentioned 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:18.959
 pokémon is famous for being the anime with more fields of its times but good the 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.919
 theory that will translate into this that you pray more complaints as the challenger undertook his 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:30.039
 trip in 1996 in the game and hd in the girl in 1997 is a bit obvious but nothing 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.749
 far from reality 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:36.139
 another fact is that as times the older brother is to highlight more than the younger 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.819
 proof of this is that retention almost by itself to the organization 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.230
 biggest criminal in the region I sing the roque team 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.019
 only has two mentally retarded from the same organization as a rival 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.319
 they do not represent big problem for any coach 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.099
 ref beat the elite four of its region even discovered the double 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.889
 morale of the roque team 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.739
 no league won except for the orange islands but let's be honest it was 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.019
 a simple filling in my opinion 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.559
 a clue to their kinship is that both are from the palette town they only have one 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:12.559
 mother also know the pokémon teacher 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:17.419
 my second theory is that as everyone will remember the pokémon that was obtained 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.129
 it was a pikachu since to send mander that had omc it was left to saw it better 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:25.790
 known as rim the bare hulk was left to bru good 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.499
 he stole it xd 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:31.189
 and finally the bonus more slack was left to network this is the event 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:35.979
 of the manga but in the anime it is not known who were the owners of escort 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.969
 urizar keep for what I suspect is fourth use left him to retire 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:42.009
 un sharman 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.250
 do not advance much that we say will win to the gyms of the different regions 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.509
 but receives has won the worst coaches and has even challenged 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:51.860
 legendary pokémon 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.960
 this is the reason why caritas owns added 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.110
 has no interest in h 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.630
 since he is more busy formulating a strategy of how to beat the network since 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.650
 he is a high-ranking coach but he only appears on the road of years 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.150
 just to test your skills since 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.770
 as they are brothers could find their mental weakness to use it in network 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:15.199
 also a theory is 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.580
 which network could have spoken with putin and sting 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.250
 so they accompany Hansen on his trip to help him in any 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.509
 problem when regno could 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.590
 another theory is that when network became pokémon master of his 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:31.520
 disappearance was not but three years that happened to be found in the 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.249
 silver mount 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.809
 He sent his pikachu back to town paddle to be with years to pikachu not 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:41.979
 he liked the idea but he knew he quit because he was worried about 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.059
 years 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:47.099
 that's why that pikachu that is completely mastered in reference to 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.209
 battle as it is well trained although there are some reasons why 

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:55.429
 that pikachu lost in certain battles consequently the one that gave him 

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:59.659
 orders was another coach as he did not know how to handle battles well 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.029
 peak 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:04.949
 well friends this was some theories that could well be 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.469
 wrong but they are very curious I would also like to emphasize that we receive almost 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:13.439
 they have the same characteristics only that it is thus more adapted in a way 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.110
 child while network is greater 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.240
 but that's just an idea so do not touch me on the balls xd 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.519
 I hope you liked this video do not forget to comment 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:26.730
 I speak to you gel grow
