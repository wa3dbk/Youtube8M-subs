00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.560
 hello friends I present here the per se 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.660
 It's a pleasure to be here with you in this 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.969
 first video I will give you information 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.429
 that you have collected while I am in the 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.070
 network following the affairs of the atuel and 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.410
 those things even though most of 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.270
 my videos will be defending and I opted 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.460
 by first upload one to clarify 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.880
 many things that remained in the air of the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.250
 series and its aftermath below 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.380
 I will clarify some points about what 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.659
 it happens with everything and animation in this 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.969
 moment and all the irregularities that 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:38.269
 have been seen in saint seiya including 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.609
 its aftermath in the first place I imagine 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.710
 that more than one will have seen the sequel 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.960
 called as saint seiya of the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.600
 cambas that is not from the original author 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.789
 masami kurumada since the latter only 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.639
 supervised the ladies and roy and who was 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.370
 who created this sequel this new series 

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:58.190
 many fans loved including me 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.199
 but to others not so much for those who 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.210
 we like this saga was a great 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.760
 disappointment in knowing that the third 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.990
 season would be canceled and since 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.720
 happened days ago 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.000
 and there have been many rumors throughout the 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.970
 network but there are two which are the most 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.520
 probable one of them is the output 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.159
 easy for those who unite this first 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.770
 rumor says that the cambas did not have much 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.990
 success and that the sales of the dvd's were 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.479
 very low so it did not recover the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.570
 budget invested in the animation and 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.759
 so they had to cancel it for me 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.369
 this rumor does not fit much because of the fact 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.619
 that if he was succeeding he was a 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.569
 new series and I was just taking 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.720
 flight and so far he was going 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.580
 well the other rumor that is actually 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.190
 more than a rumor because if it is 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.679
 happening is that as the cambas is 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.170
 belonging to tms and saint seiya 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.539
 original hatuey animation this last 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.030
 imposed a demand for the rights of 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.220
 the canvases since said being and although 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.860
 was from an author other than Kurumada 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.350
 it was part of the series that they had 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.539
 encouraged because of this the rights of 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.840
 the canvas as they themselves 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.700
 they would belong to this and not to cms when 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.720
 I had the animation took letters in the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.300
 issue to put 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.790
 judgment to your competition the company's 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.920
 tms had to cancel the third 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.110
 season of the cambas which already 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.240
 I was about to be encouraged yet 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.820
 there are people who say that the real 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.770
 reason is the first one that like the fans 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.710
 they watched the series over the internet and did not 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.690
 they bought the works but believe me the real 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.420
 reason for the suspension of the third 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.060
 season was the trial that everything put him 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.790
 to cms just before it started with 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.100
 the new season animation and up 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.040
 the moment unfortunately is still in 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.290
 the trial what I will tell you now about the 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.050
 new season of the series are just 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.630
 rumors so that they are not deluded though 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.600
 they are very likely as everyone knows in 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.120
 August 2012 began to be issued 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.670
 another sequel called side would be a mega 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.740
 which I did not like at all 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.930
 and it makes completely disappointing what 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.540
 it was the original but going back to the subject 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.490
 the other reason why they could not get out 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.330
 the episodes of the third season 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.120
 It would be because of 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.970
 pm s against but the fact that is 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.830
 Leaving 66 young goal is a sign of 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.010
 that although they have not finished the quarrels 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.020
 even the trial was regularized so 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.690
 probably tms 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.700
 new plans to resume the animation of 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.430
 change them and finish the series by 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.430
 complete but as I said before they are 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.800
 just rumors good what's coming is not 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.770
 a rumor is also about the trial of 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.930
 boy of ms but the goal is different 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.120
 is about who will be in charge of 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.670
 animate the saint seiya manga next 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.100
 dimension according to information that I 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.870
 keeps constantly reviewing 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.880
 the computer is that when you are 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.880
 animation was interested to animate the 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.130
 mentioned brand also ts would have 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.680
 interested and both companies started 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.600
 a new lawsuit that seeks to define who 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.090
 will take the responsibility to encourage 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.850
 this new story that to more than some 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.070
 I imagine we are excited and 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.950
 I also suppose that more than a few 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.739
 they will ask and curved because it does not take 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.630
 letters in the matter because he does not decide 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.730
 well cheer up your series 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.340
 so let me tell you that masami 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.890
 kurumada practically does not own any 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.720
 right of saint seiya if it is that none 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.690
 why his decision is not very 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.570
 influential that we say and good friends of 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.060
 youtube so far this would be all 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.460
 thanks for watching this video as soon as 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.590
 have more information regarding the case 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.180
 I will inform you, qualify 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.030
 comment and if you have more information 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.010
 Regarding the matter, I would appreciate it if 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.950
