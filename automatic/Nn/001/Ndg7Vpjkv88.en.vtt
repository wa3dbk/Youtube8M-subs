00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.370
 healthy 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.050
 everything starts when you understand 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.540
 what are the factors that lead to 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.690
 have a sculptural physique a body 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.070
 overweight 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.950
 how your body works 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.780
 You know your body risks 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.600
 rebuild permanently while 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.490
 you read this prayer your body replaces 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.460
 around 30 thousand cells by others 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.440
 completely new considering this 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.479
 done your body possesses around a 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.940
 trillion cells the process so that 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.160
 the body replace this trillion of 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.320
 cells by completely new ones 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.600
 It may take a couple of years 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.520
 this is really good news already 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.770
 which means that if your body cooperates 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.350
 with you you can build your 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.350
 body making it thinner in less than 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.270
 time that you believe but the question is 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.850
 how do you get your body to cooperate 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.490
 with you first you must start with 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.040
 understand the system that controls the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.790
 way in which the body reconstitutes itself to 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.800
 itself what is the metabolism 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.810
 the metabolism has complete control 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.300
 in terms of the speed at which you 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.290
 body is reconstituted as it processes and 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.820
 assimilates food therefore 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.399
 determines the condition of your body of 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.680
 this way 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.810
 if you want to control the speed in the 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.970
 which your body loses weight that more 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.540
 energy you have to make your account 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.969
 Buddhism work for you 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.370
 achieving this goal is not so complex 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:25.019
 as it seems in fact what prevents that 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.390
 many people can not control the 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.340
 metabolic process is the thought of 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.709
 that the operation of it is 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.560
 impossible to control and that there is nothing 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.180
 what to do about it there are actually 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.730
 much you can do to make the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.859
 metabolism collaborate with your goal of 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.990
 lose weight and processed in greater quantity 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:46.270
 of energy faster than you think 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.530
 here we have these three factors that 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.800
 accelerate the operation of 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.070
 metabolism number 1 eat food 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.080

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.510
 relate to what you eat, however 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.720
 it's not about eating little or doing 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.210
 little exercise you must make the commitment 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.580
 to consume less amount of food 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.350
 Unhealthy as refined sugars 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.140
 simple carbohydrates food 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.690
 processed trans fats and foods 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.670
