any debris or or other matter gets into
the<00:00:41.129> motor<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.539> stop<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.780> impeller<00:00:43.199> from

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the motor it can stop the impeller from

the motor it can stop the impeller from
turning<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> lower<00:00:44.730> wattage<00:00:45.000> very

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510

much debris to potentially stop it you

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.689 
much debris to potentially stop it you
got<00:00:49.859> to<00:00:49.980> keep<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.250> clean

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
got to keep it clean

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.700 
got to keep it clean
in<00:00:50.910> order<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.210> maintain<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.320> basically

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
in order to maintain it it's basically

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.430 
in order to maintain it it's basically
just<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.070> non<00:00:53.190> sorry<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.359> maintenance<00:00:54.570> of
