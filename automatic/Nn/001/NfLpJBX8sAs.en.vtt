00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.000 

sorry<00:01:33.920> about<00:01:34.070> me<00:01:34.310> adjusting<00:01:34.880> my<00:01:35.030> camera

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.800 

it's<00:01:40.430> real<00:01:40.610> pain<00:01:40.970> in<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.120> ass<00:01:41.420> because<00:01:41.600> I

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
it's real pain in the ass because I

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.890 
it's real pain in the ass because I
can't<00:01:42.110> get<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.350> raw<00:01:42.560> file<00:01:42.950> of<00:01:43.450> what<00:01:44.450> I'm<00:01:44.570> playing

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
can't get a raw file of what I'm playing

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.850 
can't get a raw file of what I'm playing
right<00:01:45.200> now<00:01:45.230> I<00:01:46.000> have<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.270> record<00:01:48.260> it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.920 

the<00:01:53.250> quality<00:01:53.820> isn't<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.540> make<00:01:54.720> sure

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the quality isn't that you make sure

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.590 
the quality isn't that you make sure
your<00:01:55.560> toes<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:56.250> body<00:01:56.550> isn't<00:01:56.970> picture-perfect

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
your toes the body isn't picture-perfect

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:06.330 
your toes the body isn't picture-perfect
right

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.190 

so<00:02:06.549> they<00:02:06.759> give<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.090> two<00:02:07.329> minutes<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:07.960> 30

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
so they give you two minutes and 30

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.350 
so they give you two minutes and 30
seconds<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:09.039> it<00:02:09.190> seems<00:02:09.519> like<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.759> lot<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.000> time

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
seconds and it seems like a lot of time

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.710 
seconds and it seems like a lot of time
but<00:02:11.260> it's<00:02:11.560> actually<00:02:11.680> not<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:13.180> want<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.480> try<00:02:13.660> to

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
but it's actually not you want to try to

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.720 
but it's actually not you want to try to
hurry<00:02:14.019> up

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.509 

and<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.480> don't<00:02:19.690> think<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.140> matters<00:02:20.349> if<00:02:20.860> you

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
and I don't think it matters if you

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.729 
and I don't think it matters if you
should<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:21.909> your<00:02:22.060> car<00:02:22.330> right<00:02:22.569> here<00:02:22.599> but<00:02:23.500> I

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
should have your car right here but I

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.010 
should have your car right here but I
would<00:02:23.860> just<00:02:24.040> try<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:24.340> to

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.800 

this<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.440> probably<00:02:28.740> my<00:02:28.980> fifth<00:02:29.400> time<00:02:29.810> trying

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
this is probably my fifth time trying

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.620 
this is probably my fifth time trying
this

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:46.050 

really<00:02:38.380> hot

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060

I

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.500 

would<00:04:51.220> be<00:04:51.310> very<00:04:51.520> unlikely<00:04:51.760> that<00:04:52.150> you'll

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
would be very unlikely that you'll

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.629 
would be very unlikely that you'll
actually<00:04:52.600> hit<00:04:53.050> it<00:04:54.750> yet<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:55.960> don't<00:04:56.140> know<00:04:56.260> why

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639

stop

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.080 

actually<00:05:02.680> i<00:05:02.710> only<00:05:02.860> got<00:05:03.190> hit<00:05:03.400> one<00:05:03.700> spot<00:05:04.060> i

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
actually i only got hit one spot i

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.990 
actually i only got hit one spot i
reckon<00:05:04.450> when<00:05:04.570> i<00:05:04.750> got<00:05:04.900> pretty<00:05:05.139> lucky<00:05:05.320> right<00:05:05.680> now

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
reckon when i got pretty lucky right now

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.450 
reckon when i got pretty lucky right now
so<00:05:07.000> just<00:05:07.360> try<00:05:07.840> not<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:08.620> get<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:09.100> again

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460
