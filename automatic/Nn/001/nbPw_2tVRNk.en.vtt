00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.639 
rifle that is about as big as he is and
I<00:00:54.390> don't<00:00:54.570> know<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.170> Abraham's

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
I don't know if that's a Abraham's

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
assault rifle but it looks like it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.000 
assault rifle but it looks like it
because<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.629> remember<00:00:57.839> Abraham<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.710> use<00:00:58.859> an

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
because I remember Abraham we use an

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.279 
because I remember Abraham we use an
assault<00:00:59.280> rifle<00:00:59.339> similar<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.719> just

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
assault rifle similar to that and just

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.119 
assault rifle similar to that and just
you<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.530> mow<00:01:01.980> down<00:01:02.190> walkers<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.969> stuff<00:01:04.129> and

you know mow down walkers and stuff and
I<00:01:05.430> also<00:01:05.820> don't<00:01:06.150> know<00:01:06.390> how<00:01:06.570> Carl<00:01:06.990> could

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
I also don't know how Carl could

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.490 
I also don't know how Carl could
possibly<00:01:08.220> use<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.630> thing<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.990> mean<00:01:10.140> it's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
possibly use the thing I mean it's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.609 
possibly use the thing I mean it's
bigger<00:01:10.890> than<00:01:11.009> him<00:01:11.280> pretty<00:01:11.640> much<00:01:11.909> um<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:13.439> how

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
bigger than him pretty much um like how

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.080 
bigger than him pretty much um like how
could<00:01:13.770> he<00:01:13.890> shoulder<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> how<00:01:14.579> could<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> fire

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
could he shoulder it how could you fire

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
could he shoulder it how could you fire
it<00:01:15.119> i<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.630> i<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.500> no<00:01:16.740> idea<00:01:16.920> maybe<00:01:17.310> his

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
it i just i have no idea maybe his

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
it i just i have no idea maybe his
accuracy<00:01:18.060> well<00:01:18.360> he's<00:01:19.049> got<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.409> eye<00:01:19.439> so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
accuracy well he's got one eye so

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.380 
accuracy well he's got one eye so
obviously<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.340> accuracy<00:01:20.759> wouldn't<00:01:21.149> be<00:01:21.210> that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
obviously as accuracy wouldn't be that

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.300 
obviously as accuracy wouldn't be that
good<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.840> regular<00:01:21.990> gun<00:01:22.320> either<00:01:22.560> stuff

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
good with a regular gun either stuff

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.280 
good with a regular gun either stuff
doesn't<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:23.729> matter<00:01:24.090> he's<00:01:24.810> never<00:01:25.049> going

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
doesn't really matter he's never going

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.800 
doesn't really matter he's never going
to<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> sharp<00:01:25.860> shooter<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.430> hey<00:01:26.610> i<00:01:26.880> mean<00:01:27.420> i

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
to be a sharp shooter but hey i mean i

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600 
to be a sharp shooter but hey i mean i
guess<00:01:28.320> one<00:01:28.560> way<00:01:28.710> or<00:01:28.860> another<00:01:28.890> doesn't<00:01:29.490> really

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
guess one way or another doesn't really

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.480 
guess one way or another doesn't really
matter<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.659> mean<00:01:31.560> he's<00:01:31.680> still<00:01:31.890> probably<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
matter so I mean he's still probably the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.149 
matter so I mean he's still probably the
most<00:01:32.670> badass<00:01:33.170> 11<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:34.259> 12<00:01:34.469> year<00:01:34.680> old<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:34.979> however

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
most badass 11 or 12 year old or however

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.789 
most badass 11 or 12 year old or however
old<00:01:35.460> he<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.759> now<00:01:36.140> kid<00:01:37.140> you've<00:01:37.320> ever<00:01:37.469> seen<00:01:37.680> in

old he is now kid you've ever seen in

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.520

the<00:01:37.860> comic<00:01:38.280> series<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:39.360> think<00:01:39.899> it's<00:01:39.990> also<00:01:40.170> funny

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the comic series I think it's also funny

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.920 
the comic series I think it's also funny
that<00:01:40.710> his<00:01:41.549> cowboy<00:01:41.969> hat<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.270> missing<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> piece

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
that his cowboy hat is missing the piece

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.469 
that his cowboy hat is missing the piece
of<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> back<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.969> left<00:01:45.210> side

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
of the back there on the the left side

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.859 
of the back there on the the left side
which<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.439> great<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.430> really<00:01:47.670> shows<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
which is just great it really shows the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.289 
which is just great it really shows the
evolution<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.890> Carl<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> character<00:01:50.820> into

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
when you first see him in the complex

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.130 
when you first see him in the complex

series he looks way way younger and he
just<00:01:58.380> has<00:01:58.619> grown<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> lot<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.280> terms<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
just has grown a lot in terms of

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.499 
just has grown a lot in terms of
character<00:02:00.719> development<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.229> course<00:02:02.509> having

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to do things that obviously no normal

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.330 
to do things that obviously no normal
kid<00:02:06.000> would<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.539> and<00:02:07.070> being<00:02:08.070> one<00:02:08.280> of

the<00:02:08.460> most<00:02:08.490> hardened<00:02:09.090> probably<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.470> world

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
the most hardened probably in that world

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.980 
the most hardened probably in that world
almost<00:02:11.850> because<00:02:12.210> probably<00:02:12.480> kids<00:02:12.780> would<00:02:12.960> be

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
almost because probably kids would be

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.259 
almost because probably kids would be
easier<00:02:13.350> kids<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.099> adapt<00:02:14.730> quite<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> bit<00:02:15.239> easier

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
easier kids can adapt quite a bit easier

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.420 
easier kids can adapt quite a bit easier
than<00:02:15.660> adults<00:02:15.870> don't<00:02:16.560> seem<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.920> get<00:02:17.040> stuck<00:02:17.280> into

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
i think in terms of the character

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.470 
i think in terms of the character
storyline<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.800> herd<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.370> walkers<00:02:57.060> come<00:02:57.240> in

and<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:57.750> break<00:02:58.020> down<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.350> whole<00:02:58.440> thing<00:02:58.650> and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
and just break down the whole thing and

almost<00:02:58.950> kill<00:02:59.130> everybody<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.970> then<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.300> course

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
almost kill everybody and then of course

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.210 
almost kill everybody and then of course
you've<00:03:00.690> got<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:00.960> group<00:03:01.170> with<00:03:01.320> Meegan<00:03:01.680> coming
