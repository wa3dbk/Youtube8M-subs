00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.280 
but I think that some people need to
just<00:02:39.180> say<00:02:39.300> well<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.629> personal<00:02:40.019> choice<00:02:40.080> and

think<00:04:35.159> that<00:04:35.310> listen<00:04:35.909> if<00:04:36.030> you<00:04:36.150> don't<00:04:36.180> gear<00:04:36.570> up

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
think that listen if you don't gear up

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.390 
think that listen if you don't gear up
for<00:04:37.289> whatever<00:04:37.590> reason<00:04:37.860> no<00:04:37.919> matter<00:04:38.070> what<00:04:38.250> you

for whatever reason no matter what you
ride<00:04:38.580> it's<00:04:38.789> just<00:04:38.970> because<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.360> don't<00:04:39.599> want<00:04:39.659> to

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900
