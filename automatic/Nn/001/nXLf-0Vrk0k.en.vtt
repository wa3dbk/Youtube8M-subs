00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.440
 hello everyone welcome on the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.510
 nonsense to catch her today I 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.529
 take you to italy we will realize 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.509
 pasta with Sicilian 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.800
 you will see that it is very fragrant 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.500
 and it's simple to do all the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 steps in video we start this 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.349
 recipe with eggplant so you got it 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.910
 passed under clear water you remove the 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.040
 two ends you go next the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.540
 cut in length and cut it to 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.520
 new in two to make it easier 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.440
 then we'll do some long 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.239
 blades she's actually going to be doing 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.129
 to disgorge the eggplant so that is to say 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.329
 that we will remove the excess water so 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.649
 for that we will place a layer 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.989
 eggplant in the bottom of a salad bowl 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.999
 we add coarse salt we add 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.800
 a layer of eggplant and repeat yourself 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:48.559
 in fact the operation you add big 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.300
 salt and so on 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.010
 so to speed up the process 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.929
 we will add a small plate on the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.670
 on top of you will press hard on the 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.829
 eggplants and then you go place 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.239
 and a pack of water or milk or coca 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.399
 finally a pack of something something 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.050
 something that is heavy and so like that 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.320
 they will be in a hurry and have 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.250
 have actually made the euro fast 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.930
 so the eggplants wanted to leave 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.220
 like that for about 45 minutes 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.560
 during this time we will prepare the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.880
 rest so you're going to cut an onion 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.020
 you finely chisel it you 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.329
 book in a small plate 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.250
 then we take care of the same garlic you 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.810
 go chisel it finely and you him 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.820
 book now we will go to 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.740
 tomatoes so I have a thrifty who is 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.789
 more really super good so I have not 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.210
 needed to scald them 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.159
 tomatoes 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.689
 but if you can not peel them 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.460
 wanted to spend 20 seconds in the water 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.590
 hot and then that's it 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.509
 remains more than the shoulder and then with 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.289
 his tomatoes we'll just cut them 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.390
 in quarters 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.770
 so now we'll go to the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.630
 cooking in a large pan 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.079
 on a medium heat we will brown the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.390
 onions 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.770
 salt and pepper are added and when 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.579
 they become a little yellow 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.770
 translucent 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.619
 we will be able to add the garlic you 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.810
 mix well in stride one continues 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.340
 with tomatoes we readjust 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.590
 seasoning a little bit of salt 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.939
 pepper and a little bit of sugar knows 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.079
 not yet summer tomatoes so me 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.469
 I added a little bit of sugar 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.560
 powder 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.539
 we finish by adding concentrate of 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.450
 tomato give you a good change again 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.890
 and really leave you two three 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.200
 minutes but then throw you off 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.940
 the fire you book so now 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.280
 you will drain the eggplants and 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.470
 switch to cooking then then in 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.420
 another big pan on a medium fire 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.620
 we will add olive oil and there 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.330
 we will do you 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.310
 but then really gild the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.720
 eggplant with a little bit of salt 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.760
 and pears and when they have a 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.409
 nice color like on the video you 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.750
 turn off the fire and there you will add 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.090
 so eggplants to the preparation of 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.620
 tomatoes just now so there I 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.909
 specifies that the fire is off it's not 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.769
 the trouble to reignite everything is 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.569
 still very hot you incorporate well 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.730
 the eggplants you mix well 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.400
 we then add it per need 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.110
 freshly grated mozzarella cheese 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.549
 buffalo who care has nothing to do 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.739
 with lots of mozzarella which is milk 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.730
 cow or really preferably 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.959
 costs a little more expensive but world to 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.079
 preferences chosen this is really the one 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.390
 this is then we finish with the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.859
 basil so you add it which you 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.750
 change and now learn 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.099
