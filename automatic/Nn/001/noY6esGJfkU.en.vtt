guys a flight demonstration of how

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.630 
guys a flight demonstration of how
awesome<00:01:13.190> this<00:01:13.310> plane<00:01:13.520> flies

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
awesome this plane flies

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.270 
awesome this plane flies
[Music]

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:03:28.550 

you

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.470 

this<00:03:29.010> plane<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.490> actually<00:03:29.700> pretty<00:03:30.150> easy<00:03:30.240> to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
this plane is actually pretty easy to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.900 
this plane is actually pretty easy to
fly<00:03:30.810> for<00:03:31.080> uh<00:03:31.140> took<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> cooler<00:03:31.860> bird<00:03:32.069> majority

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
fly for uh took a cooler bird majority

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.430 
fly for uh took a cooler bird majority
of<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.060> warbirds<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.569> have<00:03:33.750> flown<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.200> far

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
of the warbirds that have flown so far

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.050 
of the warbirds that have flown so far
like<00:03:34.770> Mustangs<00:03:35.490> are<00:03:35.610> actually<00:03:35.819> pretty<00:03:36.000> easy

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
like Mustangs are actually pretty easy

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.059 
like Mustangs are actually pretty easy
to<00:03:36.270> fly<00:03:36.450> but<00:03:36.690> Spitfires<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.470> stuff<00:03:37.740> like<00:03:37.890> that

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
to fly but Spitfires and stuff like that

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.220 
to fly but Spitfires and stuff like that
that<00:03:38.280> kind<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:38.970> stall<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.630> little<00:03:39.750> bit<00:03:39.990> just

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that kind of stall a little bit just

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.690 
that kind of stall a little bit just
because<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.770> nature<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.190> word<00:03:41.340> bird<00:03:41.520> once

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
because the nature of the word bird once

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.850 
because the nature of the word bird once
again<00:03:41.970> they<00:03:42.180> have<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.660> same<00:03:42.990> cancer<00:03:43.350> risks<00:03:43.709> as

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
again they have the same cancer risks as

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.740 
again they have the same cancer risks as
the<00:03:44.340> larger<00:03:44.850> models<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.300> actual<00:03:45.569> real-life

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
the larger models the actual real-life

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.050 
the larger models the actual real-life
models<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.950> one<00:03:47.190> actually<00:03:47.370> flew<00:03:47.730> really

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
models this one actually flew really

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.750 
models this one actually flew really
good<00:03:48.209> once<00:03:48.420> again<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.110> flying<00:03:49.770> it<00:03:49.980> fast<00:03:50.550> is

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
good once again so flying it fast is

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.610 
good once again so flying it fast is
good<00:03:50.940> slow<00:03:51.390> speed<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:51.750> good<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.170> stall<00:03:52.440> speed

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
good slow speed is good the stall speed

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.260 
good slow speed is good the stall speed
is<00:03:52.830> actually<00:03:53.160> pretty<00:03:53.310> excellent<00:03:53.819> on<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.000> BF

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
is actually pretty excellent on this BF

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.770 
is actually pretty excellent on this BF
109<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:54.989> can<00:03:55.500> come<00:03:55.680> in<00:03:55.830> you<00:03:56.489> know<00:03:56.610> walking<00:03:57.360> speed

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
109 I can come in you know walking speed

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.470 
109 I can come in you know walking speed
into<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.410> wind<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.220> just<00:03:59.520> floats<00:04:00.270> right

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
into the wind and it just floats right

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.390 
into the wind and it just floats right
on<00:04:00.600> in<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.900> wings<00:04:01.110> barely<00:04:01.590> Rock<00:04:01.830> pretty<00:04:02.190> much

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
on in the wings barely Rock pretty much

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.530 
on in the wings barely Rock pretty much
because<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.730> wing<00:04:02.910> has<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> little<00:04:03.330> bit<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.480> the

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
because the wing has a little bit of the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.740 
because the wing has a little bit of the
he'd<00:04:03.720> roll<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:03.989> here<00:04:04.200> actually<00:04:04.739> guys<00:04:04.980> can<00:04:05.220> see

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
he'd roll on here actually guys can see

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.060 
he'd roll on here actually guys can see
you<00:04:06.750> can<00:04:06.870> see<00:04:07.050> from<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.320> front<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.709> wings<00:04:07.890> do

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
you can see from the front the wings do

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.560 
you can see from the front the wings do
flare<00:04:08.340> up<00:04:08.430> a<00:04:08.459> little<00:04:08.580> bit<00:04:08.700> on<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.850> tip<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.090> adds

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
flare up a little bit on the tip so adds

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.380 
flare up a little bit on the tip so adds
a<00:04:09.720> bit<00:04:09.870> more<00:04:09.900> stability<00:04:10.260> on<00:04:10.739> this<00:04:11.250> warbird<00:04:11.790> so

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
a bit more stability on this warbird so

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.330 
a bit more stability on this warbird so
one<00:04:13.260> thing<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.620> did<00:04:13.769> through<00:04:13.890> this<00:04:13.980> plane<00:04:14.310> that

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
one thing I did through this plane that

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.460 
one thing I did through this plane that
the<00:04:14.700> factory<00:04:15.209> did<00:04:15.420> not<00:04:15.569> do<00:04:15.780> from<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.019> start<00:04:16.230> is

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
the factory did not do from the start is

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.949 
the factory did not do from the start is
I<00:04:16.650> added<00:04:16.950> another<00:04:17.070> vent<00:04:17.549> hole<00:04:17.760> because<00:04:18.570> there

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
I added another vent hole because there

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.240 
I added another vent hole because there
is<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.079> vent<00:04:19.380> hole<00:04:19.530> on<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.709> bottom<00:04:19.890> right<00:04:20.130> here

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
is a vent hole on the bottom right here

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.069 
is a vent hole on the bottom right here
for<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.459> air<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.700> go<00:04:20.880> in<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.329> cools<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.690> ESC

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
for the air to go in it cools the ESC

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.409 
for the air to go in it cools the ESC
but<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.860> battery<00:04:23.220> fits<00:04:23.550> right<00:04:23.790> up<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.060> here<00:04:24.270> in

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
but the battery fits right up in here in

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.060 
but the battery fits right up in here in
the<00:04:24.479> front<00:04:24.720> compartment<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:25.320> before<00:04:26.010> you

the front compartment and before you
guys<00:04:26.190> actually<00:04:26.550> glue<00:04:26.700> on<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.940> scoop<00:04:27.240> take<00:04:27.810> a

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
guys actually glue on the scoop take a

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.810 
guys actually glue on the scoop take a
sharp<00:04:28.139> exacto<00:04:28.590> knife<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:28.919> just<00:04:29.430> cut<00:04:29.669> out<00:04:29.790> the

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
sharp exacto knife and just cut out the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.370 
sharp exacto knife and just cut out the
little<00:04:30.060> hole<00:04:30.270> glue<00:04:30.690> on<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.900> scoop<00:04:31.139> and<00:04:31.290> that

little hole glue on the scoop and that

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.469 
little hole glue on the scoop and that
actually<00:04:31.680> has<00:04:32.010> an<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.640> has<00:04:32.820> another<00:04:33.030> intake

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
actually has an it has another intake

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.300 
actually has an it has another intake
for<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.110> air<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.380> come<00:04:34.560> in<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.860> helps<00:04:35.040> keep

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
for the air to come in it helps keep

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.880 
for the air to come in it helps keep
this<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.550> whole<00:04:35.880> setup<00:04:36.270> nice<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.140> cool<00:04:37.290> when

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
this a whole setup nice and cool when

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.170 
this a whole setup nice and cool when
it's<00:04:38.010> cooler<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:38.460> get<00:04:38.580> more<00:04:38.760> flight<00:04:38.970> time

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
it's cooler you get more flight time

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.850 
it's cooler you get more flight time
more<00:04:39.419> performance<00:04:39.870> out<00:04:39.930> of<00:04:39.990> it<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.410> longer

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
more performance out of it and longer

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.040 
more performance out of it and longer
life<00:04:41.010> out<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.280> your<00:04:41.430> batteries<00:04:41.850> too<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.300> right

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
life out of your batteries too and right

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.640 
life out of your batteries too and right
now<00:04:43.229> I'm<00:04:43.410> using<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.860> blue<00:04:44.610> lipo<00:04:45.530> unplug<00:04:46.530> the

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
now I'm using a blue lipo unplug the

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.550 
now I'm using a blue lipo unplug the
better<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:46.979> be<00:04:47.070> safe<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.520> blue<00:04:48.060> lipo<00:04:48.479> for<00:04:49.289> so

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
better to be safe a blue lipo for so

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.800 
better to be safe a blue lipo for so
2,200<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.550> there's<00:04:50.789> only<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.030> 20<00:04:51.390> seat<00:04:51.600> pack

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
2,200 and there's only a 20 seat pack

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.140 
2,200 and there's only a 20 seat pack
and<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.110> 20<00:04:52.380> seat<00:04:52.530> pack<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:52.890> pretty<00:04:52.919> much<00:04:53.370> all

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
and a 20 seat pack is pretty much all

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.960 
and a 20 seat pack is pretty much all
you<00:04:54.270> need<00:04:54.419> for<00:04:55.080> this<00:04:55.260> sized<00:04:55.979> airplane<00:04:56.430> the

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
you need for this sized airplane the

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.430 
you need for this sized airplane the
motor<00:04:57.210> is<00:04:57.300> very<00:04:57.330> efficient<00:04:57.870> setup<00:04:58.169> so<00:04:58.320> it's

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
motor is very efficient setup so it's

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.990 
motor is very efficient setup so it's
not<00:04:58.530> going<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.740> overpower<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.520> battery<00:04:59.940> you

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
not going to overpower the battery you

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.490 
not going to overpower the battery you
can<00:05:00.090> see<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.270> better<00:05:00.450> right<00:05:00.630> now<00:05:00.690> it's<00:05:01.289> about

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
can see the better right now it's about

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.650 
can see the better right now it's about
80<00:05:01.890> 90<00:05:02.010> degrees<00:05:02.550> so<00:05:02.729> it's<00:05:02.880> an<00:05:02.970> awesome<00:05:03.180> setup

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
80 90 degrees so it's an awesome setup

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.080 
80 90 degrees so it's an awesome setup
right<00:05:03.870> here<00:05:03.930> you<00:05:04.620> have<00:05:04.650> nine<00:05:05.370> gram<00:05:05.610> servos

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
right here you have nine gram servos

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.270 
right here you have nine gram servos
want<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.419> point<00:05:06.600> out<00:05:06.720> for<00:05:07.620> rudder<00:05:08.130> and

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
want to point out for rudder and

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.279 
want to point out for rudder and
elevator<00:05:08.729> at<00:05:09.180> first<00:05:09.479> I<00:05:09.630> was<00:05:09.780> wondering<00:05:10.169> you

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
elevator at first I was wondering you

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.750 
elevator at first I was wondering you
know<00:05:10.320> 9<00:05:10.560> gram<00:05:10.740> storage<00:05:10.979> might<00:05:11.190> not<00:05:11.340> be<00:05:11.490> enough

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
know 9 gram storage might not be enough

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.310 
know 9 gram storage might not be enough
because<00:05:12.000> I<00:05:12.150> was<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.450> is<00:05:12.570> a<00:05:12.600> 1200<00:05:13.110> millimeter

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
because I was it is a 1200 millimeter

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.440 
because I was it is a 1200 millimeter
plane<00:05:13.740> but<00:05:14.010> these<00:05:14.160> servos<00:05:14.490> are<00:05:14.640> torquey<00:05:15.000> so<00:05:15.210> I

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
plane but these servos are torquey so I

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.170 
plane but these servos are torquey so I
didn't<00:05:16.229> notice<00:05:16.500> any<00:05:16.830> of<00:05:17.100> you<00:05:17.370> know<00:05:17.520> drawbacks

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
didn't notice any of you know drawbacks

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.880 
didn't notice any of you know drawbacks
with<00:05:18.390> the<00:05:18.479> 9<00:05:18.630> gram<00:05:18.810> servos<00:05:19.200> that's<00:05:19.650> pretty

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
with the 9 gram servos that's pretty

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.580 
with the 9 gram servos that's pretty
much<00:05:20.039> it<00:05:20.340> flight<00:05:20.610> toms<00:05:20.850> are<00:05:21.060> about<00:05:21.330> 5<00:05:22.080> to<00:05:22.440> 7

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
much it flight toms are about 5 to 7

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.350 
much it flight toms are about 5 to 7
minutes<00:05:22.890> depending<00:05:23.280> on<00:05:23.400> how<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:23.669> manage<00:05:24.210> your

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
minutes depending on how you manage your

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.870 
minutes depending on how you manage your
throttle<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:24.960> that's<00:05:25.770> up<00:05:26.070> average<00:05:26.700> flight

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
throttle and that's up average flight

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.909 
throttle and that's up average flight
time<00:05:27.150> for<00:05:27.419> electric<00:05:27.900> plane<00:05:28.140> you<00:05:28.440> know<00:05:28.590> so

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
time for electric plane you know so

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.140 
time for electric plane you know so
that's<00:05:29.100> pretty<00:05:29.460> much<00:05:29.550> a<00:05:29.640> bad<00:05:29.880> thing<00:05:30.060> about

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
that's pretty much a bad thing about

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.909 
that's pretty much a bad thing about
electric<00:05:30.630> planes<00:05:30.810> flight<00:05:31.229> toms<00:05:31.470> are<00:05:31.620> kind<00:05:31.860> of

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
electric planes flight toms are kind of

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.770 
electric planes flight toms are kind of
short<00:05:32.160> compared<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:32.580> Nitro<00:05:32.940> so<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:33.539> hope<00:05:33.690> you

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
short compared the Nitro so I hope you

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.420 
short compared the Nitro so I hope you
