00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.790
 in 2015 we chose to change the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.309
 futuroscope communication because we 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.420
 wanted to stick to the evolution of the park that 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.280
 has invested a lot in recent years 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.650
 with new attractions like 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.330
 arthur the adventurous 4d dance with the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.429
 robots and last year obviously 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.050
 the rabbids 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.990
 we evolved to something more 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.560
 more festive fun more suited to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.480
 young children 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.710
 so this summer we shot two movies 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.020
 advertising on the park 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.060
 he wanted to show a park with a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.100
 diversified offer an offer for 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.110
 small and big show 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.020
 outside dutarte I knew the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.239
 futuroscope obviously as 95% 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 French is a well known park 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.539
 who has a lot of notoriety 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.129
 we have already heard of futuroscope 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.699
 but by cons I had no idea of 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.309
 what was in it 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.660
 I admit that when I crossed for the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.230
 first time this park and I did these 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 attractions 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.809
 I was amazed at what I saw a 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.090
 landscape that is very particular because 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.400
 nothing to do with the other parks 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.220
 attractions and as advertising the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.009
 futuroscope seems to me and centered on 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.570
 the attractions for years I 'm 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.750
 I'm just saying that there were 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.060
 bunch of people like me who 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.310
 had an image of the attractions but who 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.930
 did not have a picture of the park the limit on 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.600
 did not really know what it looks like 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.150
 and even for very basic things s 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.320
 to agree with children is what is 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.760
 what we can sit on a bench for 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.150
 eat his sandwich stuff too silly 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.790
 only that 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.170
 I had no idea what 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.280
 like this park is that it's 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.540
 large black rooms in which we 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.190
 stay a whole day to watch 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.560
 movies on giant screen or at the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.900
 contrary to your thing and I told myself 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.210
 of a first job to make bruno you have to 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.920
 arthur show this not the creation of 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.399
 capture that was great we made 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.960
 plans to are the labaki nacelles was 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.880
 Great 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.650
 1 after it was also shot in the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.720
 hall and the tractions of the rabbids 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.340
 I love her dancing with robots 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.290
 of course but dance with robots that 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.580
 I had but it's myself and 6 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.770
 difficult moments in this shoot 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.540
 no but it was a challenge anyway 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.520
 we did some lead shots anyway 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.350
 finds it very ambitious all the same 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.489
 world you are who told me that's 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.620
 spring have made turns we have this 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.660
 as complicated we made hooks 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.700
 camara on the attractions we made some 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.410
 things but the result is still 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.370
 at least rather well because it wants 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.160
 to say that we are images rather 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.260
 original is beautiful I kill you 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.180
 the actors that kills the kids 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.290
 and the parents who stake what you 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.390
 it's great day 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.210
 we really created an atmosphere I hope 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.500
 than to the author of a film that will trade 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.240
 so after the shoot 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.520
 there is still a lot of work to do 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.700
 post-production to add effects 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.980
 visuals see special effects and 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.260
 then also the choice of the voice 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.100
 off the voice that will carry the film of 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.780
 futuroscope 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.550
 this is a message for visitors 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.200
 Futuroscope at the exit of 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.950
 the attraction arthur the adventurous in four 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.300
 dimensions 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.930
 some visitors lose completely 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.930
 their benchmarks 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.349
 but
