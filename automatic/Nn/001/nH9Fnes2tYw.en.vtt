we're taking a look at a potential

we're taking a look at a potential
problem<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.629> might<00:00:06.750> be<00:00:06.870> having<00:00:07.170> with<00:00:07.379> your

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
SSD what it comes down is a while ago I

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.360 
SSD what it comes down is a while ago I
was<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.639> thought<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.420> had<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> bad<00:00:12.809> SSD<00:00:13.469> because

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
was I thought I had a bad SSD because

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.070 
was I thought I had a bad SSD because
every<00:00:14.700> time<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.910> opened<00:00:15.420> well<00:00:15.690> not<00:00:15.809> every<00:00:16.020> time

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
every time I opened well not every time

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.300 
every time I opened well not every time
but<00:00:16.230> once<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.650> while<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.830> would<00:00:16.949> open<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
but once in a while I would open a

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.920 
but once in a while I would open a
folder<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.240> folder<00:00:18.630> would<00:00:18.750> take<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
folder and that folder would take a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.599 
folder and that folder would take a
little<00:00:19.170> bit<00:00:19.320> like<00:00:19.680> maybe<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.580> three

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
little bit like maybe one to three

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.609 
little bit like maybe one to three
seconds<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> actually<00:00:22.260> start<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
seconds for it to actually start to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.950 
seconds for it to actually start to
populate<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:24.269> was<00:00:24.359> kind<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.570> odd<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> mean

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
populate and that was kind of odd I mean

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.720 
populate and that was kind of odd I mean
in<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.109> old<00:00:25.170> hard<00:00:25.619> drive<00:00:25.890> days<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.400> making

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
in the old hard drive days I was making

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.450 
in the old hard drive days I was making
okay<00:00:27.029> well<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.779> hard<00:00:27.930> drives<00:00:28.230> gone<00:00:28.470> asleep<00:00:28.830> so

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
okay well the hard drives gone asleep so

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.919 
okay well the hard drives gone asleep so
it<00:00:29.580> needs<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.849> start<00:00:30.060> spinning<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.510> again<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
it needs to start spinning up again and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.229 
it needs to start spinning up again and
you<00:00:31.109> know<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> get<00:00:31.560> back<00:00:31.590> any<00:00:31.949> action<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.880> with

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
you know to get back any action but with

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.180 
you know to get back any action but with
an<00:00:33.329> SSD<00:00:33.630> know<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.469> shouldn't<00:00:34.770> happen<00:00:34.860> at<00:00:35.070> all

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
an SSD know that shouldn't happen at all

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.250 
an SSD know that shouldn't happen at all
and<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.149> even<00:00:36.239> noticing<00:00:36.690> sometimes<00:00:37.110> I'd

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
and I was even noticing sometimes I'd

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.959 
and I was even noticing sometimes I'd
open<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.469> Start<00:00:37.739> bar<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.489> would<00:00:38.610> again

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
open the Start bar and it would again

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.729 
open the Start bar and it would again
take<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> little<00:00:39.540> while<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.110> didn't<00:00:40.469> start

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
take a little while for I didn't start

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.369 
take a little while for I didn't start
loading<00:00:40.950> up<00:00:41.360> once<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.510> actually<00:00:42.540> kicked<00:00:43.200> into

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
loading up once it actually kicked into

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.529 
loading up once it actually kicked into
effect<00:00:43.680> it'd<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.950> quick<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:45.030> getting

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
effect it'd be quick but just getting

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.889 
effect it'd be quick but just getting
there<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.309> couldn't<00:00:47.760> explain<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> did<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
there I I couldn't explain it so I did a

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.439 
there I I couldn't explain it so I did a
bit<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.079> research<00:00:49.140> around<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> found<00:00:50.449> some

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
bit of research around and I found some

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.229 
bit of research around and I found some
information<00:00:51.570> by<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.770> user<00:00:53.190> named<00:00:53.489> zoo<00:00:53.789> work<00:00:53.940> on

victim of this so there's a rather easy
fix<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.770> little<00:01:43.979> boring<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> fix

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
fix it's a little boring to do the fix

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.749 
fix it's a little boring to do the fix

but it's an easy fix nonetheless and
what<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.780> involves<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.649> involves

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
what it involves is and it involves

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.319 
what it involves is and it involves
making<00:01:50.610> some<00:01:50.759> changes<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.750> registry<00:01:52.009> now

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
making some changes to the registry now

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.490 
making some changes to the registry now
it's<00:01:54.329> not<00:01:54.479> about<00:01:54.689> changing<00:01:55.649> settings<00:01:56.250> because

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
it's not about changing settings because

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.020 
it's not about changing settings because
just<00:01:58.500> by<00:01:58.619> them<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:59.009> being<00:01:59.340> there<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.850> feature

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
just by them not being there the feature

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.580 
just by them not being there the feature
is<00:02:00.299> enabled<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.810> basically<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.469> add

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
is enabled but basically you have to add

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.859 
is enabled but basically you have to add
the<00:02:01.890> registry<00:02:02.520> settings<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.600> able<00:02:03.719> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the registry settings to be able to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.289 
the registry settings to be able to
disable<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:05.219> again<00:02:05.399> these<00:02:05.549> are<00:02:05.610> steps

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
disable it and again these are steps

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.410 
disable it and again these are steps

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
doing LP m2 and that's it that's simple

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.560 
doing LP m2 and that's it that's simple
for<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.800> value<00:03:59.190> inside<00:03:59.400> it<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.270> want<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.480> to

for the value inside it you want it to
be<00:04:00.690> zero<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.140> you're<00:04:01.260> not<00:04:01.350> touching<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:01.830> you

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
be zero so you're not touching it you

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.280 
be zero so you're not touching it you
just<00:04:02.070> got<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.340> create<00:04:02.760> those<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.270> you're<00:04:04.050> good

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
just got to create those and you're good

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.630 
just got to create those and you're good
and<00:04:04.470> you<00:04:04.560> have<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.800> do<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.280> each<00:04:05.430> and

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
and you have to do that for each and

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.050 
and you have to do that for each and

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
some people have noticed they've

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.460 
some people have noticed they've
actually<00:04:36.060> had<00:04:36.360> performance<00:04:37.050> increases

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
actually had performance increases

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.190 
actually had performance increases
that's<00:04:38.220> usually<00:04:38.669> been<00:04:38.820> due<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.630> an<00:04:39.840> older

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
that's usually been due to an older

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.040 
that's usually been due to an older
firmware<00:04:41.040> on<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.430> r<00:04:41.580> SS<00:04:41.910> d<00:04:42.090> so<00:04:42.690> that's

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
firmware on the r SS d so that's

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.690 
firmware on the r SS d so that's
probably<00:04:43.320> not<00:04:43.500> going<00:04:43.620> to<00:04:43.710> happen<00:04:43.800> for<00:04:44.100> you<00:04:44.220> but

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
probably not going to happen for you but

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.790 
probably not going to happen for you but
in<00:04:44.790> terms<00:04:44.820> of<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.660> delay<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.230> lag<00:04:46.470> that's

in terms of the delay and lag that's

in terms of the delay and lag that's

takes a little bit of what Dino time to

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.620 
takes a little bit of what Dino time to
answer<00:04:53.070> all<00:04:53.280> that<00:04:53.430> but<00:04:53.669> again<00:04:54.060> put<00:04:54.419> all<00:04:54.510> that

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
answer all that but again put all that
