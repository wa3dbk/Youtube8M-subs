00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.400
Whoa! Don’t move, please!

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.366
- Suji? Can you help me?
- Sure!

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.700
Hey Dad?
When are you coming

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.500
to be a guest teacher
at our school?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.866
Ah! Uh… The truth is…

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:43.366
I have zero experience
with being a teacher…

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:46.600
But Doug’s father
came to school last week…

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.933
Ta-da! It’s time
for our yummy picnic!

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.400
Wow! The car looks new!
Great!

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.733
Thanks! Off we go…!

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:08.400
Now, Poli! Get ready to enter
the wet part of the course!

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.833
All set!

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:13.766
Now stop!

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:19.066
All right! Poli!
Excellent work! Good job!

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:23.166
You too, Jin! You know,
I really like these new tires!

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.000
Now I won’t have to
be as concerned

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.033
when I’m driving
on rainy days!

00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:36.566
Hey Dad, why do you
keep looking at the mirrors?

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:39.566
Well, son,
they’re like a third eye!

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.266
The mirrors help me
keep track

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.900
of what the cars
around me are doing.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.433
I see…

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:48.800
Look! Hurry and speed up
before the light changes!

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.466
Not a good idea, son.

00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:53.933
If the light turns red,
we won’t be able to stop.

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.766
Hey! You almost ran me over!

00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:01.566
- I’m so sorry…
- Wow! That was so close!

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:04.733
At high speeds,
it’s very hard to stop.

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:06.300
When you cross the road,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.266
never assume a car
will be able to go around you.

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:11.600
Make sure it’s
at a complete stop first!

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.166
Okay!

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.266
- Got it!
- Hey! Suji!

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:29.733
You know you can’t
use your hands!

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.366
Yum!

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:38.866
And…

00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:41.533
- Cheese!
- Okay, cheese!

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:45.866
Oh dear!

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.600
Looks like we’re in for some
bad weather this afternoon!

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.533
- You mean like rain?
- Remember the last storm?

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:53.066
It was really horrible.

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:55.900
We should do some
safety checks around town!

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.266
You’re right.
Let’s check it out!

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.000
We were lucky!

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.966
Thank goodness
we’re out of the rain!

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:10.566
Isn’t it great to be
safe in our nice car?

00:03:10.566 --> 00:03:14.200
Wow, Dad! It’s really
hard to see the road!

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.066
True, son. It’s dusk.

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:17.733
Hard to see
at this time of day,

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:19.700
plus we’ve got
all of this rain.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.333
Those two factors
make driving a challenge!

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:24.900
They’re already
fast asleep!

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.733
Uh, hey!
my umbrella!

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:39.433
Oh NOOO!!

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:41.700
LOOK OUT!

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.866
- Is everyone okay?
- Yes, we’re okay, Poli…

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.866
Cars make our lives
more convenient

00:03:56.866 --> 00:03:59.300
and they are really
good friends to us.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.900
But still, if we don’t
learn enough about them,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.133
they can be a lot
like scary monsters!

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:08.433
Now, what are some things
we should know about our cars?

00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:11.066
First, moving cars
cannot stop instantly,

00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:12.900
nor can they turn quickly.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.166
So, if you see a car
coming from a distance,

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:17.433
you need to wait
until it passes…

00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:20.333
or until it comes
to a complete stop.

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.800
Then you can cross!

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.866
Second, when driving on either
rainy or snowy, slippery roads,

00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:28.466
cars can lose
traction and start to skid.

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:32.766
On rainy or snowy days, drivers
have very low visibility.

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:35.200
So if you’re walking, make
sure there’s enough room

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.800
between you and the road!

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.700
And third… if you get into
an accident in the car,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.300
you can hit something
or even roll over!

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.900
You could get really hurt.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.900
So the first thing you do
when you get in the car is…?

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.800
Buckle your seatbelt!

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.100
Couldn’t have said it
better myself!

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:01.366
The car is back
and it’s good as new!

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:03.766
Wow! It does look new,
doesn’t it?

00:05:03.766 --> 00:05:07.866
- All right!
- We’ve got our car back…!

00:05:07.866 --> 00:05:10.533
Honey, do you think
we should go out for dinner?

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:12.966
- YAY!!
- Sounds GREAT!
