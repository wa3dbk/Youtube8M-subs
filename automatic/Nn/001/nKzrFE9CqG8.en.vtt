00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
impatience like this sometimes they're a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.410 
impatience like this sometimes they're a
little<00:00:19.920> too<00:00:20.130> crowded<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.760> want<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.240> maybe

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
little too crowded and you want to maybe

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.029 
little too crowded and you want to maybe
spread<00:00:21.779> them<00:00:21.930> around<00:00:22.020> or<00:00:22.500> put<00:00:22.769> them<00:00:22.949> in

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
spread them around or put them in

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.470 
spread them around or put them in
different<00:00:23.130> pots<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.820> put<00:00:23.910> them<00:00:24.090> around<00:00:24.269> your

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
different pots and put them around your

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.189 
different pots and put them around your
house<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> very<00:00:25.920> simple<00:00:26.340> way<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
house this is a very simple way to do it

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.310 
house this is a very simple way to do it
basically<00:00:28.279> each<00:00:29.279> impatient<00:00:30.000> plant<00:00:30.320> needs

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
basically each impatient plant needs

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.069 
basically each impatient plant needs
about<00:00:31.560> 3<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.040> 5<00:00:32.219> inches<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.940> space<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.600> each<00:00:33.719> pot

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
about 3 to 5 inches of space in each pot

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.990 
about 3 to 5 inches of space in each pot
so<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.860> want<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> get<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> pot<00:00:35.520> that's<00:00:35.700> large

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
so you want to get a pot that's large

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.520 
so you want to get a pot that's large
enough<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.570> actually<00:00:37.079> gives<00:00:37.230> them<00:00:37.350> enough

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
enough that actually gives them enough

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.900 
enough that actually gives them enough
room<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:37.829> their<00:00:38.129> roots<00:00:38.370> because<00:00:38.610> they<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
room for their roots because they get a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610 
room for their roots because they get a
pretty<00:00:39.210> big<00:00:39.450> root<00:00:39.690> system<00:00:40.110> because

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
pretty big root system because

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.959 
pretty big root system because
impatients<00:00:41.129> are<00:00:41.250> known<00:00:41.399> for<00:00:41.610> spreading

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
impatients are known for spreading

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.380 
impatients are known for spreading
around<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.450> lot<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.640> we're<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> start<00:00:45.149> by

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
around a lot so we're going to start by

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
around a lot so we're going to start by
examining<00:00:45.780> our<00:00:46.320> impatient<00:00:46.770> plants<00:00:47.129> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
examining our impatient plants and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.010 
examining our impatient plants and
making<00:00:47.820> sure<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.239> they<00:00:48.390> look<00:00:48.570> healthy<00:00:48.989> and

making sure that they look healthy and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.299 
making sure that they look healthy and
you<00:00:49.350> want<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> because<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> want<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> pick<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you want to because you want to pick the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.910 
you want to because you want to pick the
healthiest<00:00:50.760> plants<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> move<00:00:51.390> into<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.780> pot<00:00:52.050> so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
healthiest plants to move into a pot so

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.470 
healthiest plants to move into a pot so
you<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.190> check<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.760> little<00:00:53.940> bit<00:00:54.090> you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
you just check them out a little bit you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
you just check them out a little bit you
can<00:00:54.629> remove<00:00:54.899> any<00:00:55.170> old<00:00:55.260> flowers<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.280> maybe

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
can remove any old flowers that maybe

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.869 
can remove any old flowers that maybe
you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:57.960> spent<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.730> good

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you know are spent this is a really good

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.520 
you know are spent this is a really good
sign<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.539> plant<00:01:00.870> has<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> lot<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.379> new

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
sign that this plant has a lot of new

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.759 
sign that this plant has a lot of new
buds<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.570> looks<00:01:03.750> very<00:01:03.989> healthy<00:01:04.229> so

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
buds on it and it looks very healthy so

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.920 
buds on it and it looks very healthy so
I<00:01:05.010> think<00:01:05.610> these<00:01:05.700> are<00:01:05.760> perfect<00:01:06.330> candidates<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
I think these are perfect candidates to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.710 
I think these are perfect candidates to
go<00:01:07.080> into<00:01:07.320> our<00:01:07.439> pots<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.390> our<00:01:09.510> terra

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
go into our pots so we have our terra

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.840 
go into our pots so we have our terra
cotta<00:01:09.900> pot<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.189> use<00:01:11.340> any<00:01:11.549> kind<00:01:11.700> of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
cotta pot and you can use any kind of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.539 
cotta pot and you can use any kind of
organic<00:01:12.060> potting<00:01:12.420> soil<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.560> definitely

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
organic potting soil I definitely

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.719 
organic potting soil I definitely
recommend<00:01:14.790> organic<00:01:15.090> soils<00:01:16.549> we're<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
recommend organic soils we're going to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.850 
recommend organic soils we're going to
just<00:01:17.880> put<00:01:18.060> about<00:01:18.150> an<00:01:18.450> inch<00:01:18.780> maybe<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.770> know

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
just put about an inch maybe you know

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.640 
just put about an inch maybe you know
about<00:01:20.070> an<00:01:20.220> inch<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> two<00:01:20.790> inches<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.420> soil<00:01:22.409> at

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
about an inch to two inches of soil at

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
about an inch to two inches of soil at
the<00:01:22.680> bottom<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> pot<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> plant

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the bottom of the pot so that the plant

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.249 
the bottom of the pot so that the plant
has<00:01:24.750> plenty<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> soil<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.549> its<00:01:26.670> roots<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
has plenty of soil for its roots so it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.950 
has plenty of soil for its roots so it
gets<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> nice<00:01:28.590> healthy<00:01:28.950> start<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.869> you

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
gets a nice healthy start and then you

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.080 
gets a nice healthy start and then you
want<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.200> gently<00:01:31.500> break<00:01:32.189> up<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.549> impatient

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
want to gently break up your impatient

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.719 
want to gently break up your impatient
plant<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.220> disturb<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
plant so that you don't disturb the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
plant so that you don't disturb the
roots<00:01:35.850> too<00:01:36.240> much<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.500> doesn't<00:01:37.590> go<00:01:37.799> through

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
roots too much and it doesn't go through

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.539 
roots too much and it doesn't go through
too<00:01:38.070> much<00:01:38.220> shock<00:01:39.079> so<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.439> gently<00:01:40.680> work

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
too much shock so you just gently work

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.880 
too much shock so you just gently work
your<00:01:41.759> way<00:01:41.850> around<00:01:41.970> there<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.990> get<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> plant

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
your way around there and get the plant

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.520 
your way around there and get the plant
out<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.600> then<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.020> break<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.470> up

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
out and then you can break it up

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.800 
out and then you can break it up

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
their roots kind of bundled together you

want<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.820> break<00:01:51.000> them<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.420> little<00:01:51.540> bit<00:01:52.009> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
want to break them up a little bit and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.020 
want to break them up a little bit and
then<00:01:53.189> put<00:01:53.399> them<00:01:53.549> into<00:01:53.700> their<00:01:53.880> new<00:01:53.939> home<00:01:54.950> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that's a perfect amount of space in

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.590 
that's a perfect amount of space in
between<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.369> edge<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.939> pot<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
between the edge of the pot and the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:10.620 
between the edge of the pot and the
plant<00:02:01.880> then<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.329> fill<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:03.899> soil

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
plant so that each side of it gets

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:24.190 
plant so that each side of it gets
filled<00:02:15.740> in<00:02:15.920> has<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> good<00:02:17.170> anchor<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:23.200> after

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
filled in has a good anchor to it after

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.780 
filled in has a good anchor to it after
you<00:02:24.350> put<00:02:24.560> your<00:02:24.590> impatient<00:02:25.130> in<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.310> pot<00:02:25.520> it's
