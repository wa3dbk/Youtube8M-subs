00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.859
 Buck mid-range combo is truly enough sleep with all-wheel drive 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.349
 equipped and the offer on the other hand small 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.709
 besides, there is hardly a better driven one to brave the elements 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.339
 Mode of Transport 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.859
 To test this, we have a Japanese and two German on board 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:19.949
 operated come way 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.820
 On the track sent the Subaru Legacy with three liters of displacement and 245 hp 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.119
 13 hp more is the BMW 3 30 15 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.710
 the Mercedes c 350 CHF with three and a half liters capacity the largest and most 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.710
 strongest engine in this test 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.800
 the acceleration from zero to one hundred make BMW and Mercedes under themselves 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.000
 while the c 350 has the lead in the end 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.470
 The residue of the Subaru grows with increasing speed 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.370
 in terms of pulling power and acceleration 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.370
 the Mercedes and BMW in their own league 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.930
 On slippery roads, the Super Bowl automatically shifts from the front wheel 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.220
 Four-wheel drive Rome 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.420
 This affects the driving behavior impacting victories 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.620
 of overriding hundreds is the result 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.010
 BMW's intelligent x already system is said to lack traction already in the 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.140
 Recognize the approach 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.800
 that allows to use cornering at Mercedes is the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.300
 conditioned 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.180
 a little quieter 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.700
 For the SP intervention takes place here noticeably the driving safety is however 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.700
 still guaranteed 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.909
 if you are traveling fast you need good brakes of the c-class Porsche 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:48.570
 MeeGo 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.650
 the BMW is hardly worse 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.760
 The Legacy comes with warm brakes, however, only penalty after Mercedes 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.130
 to stand

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.710
 Collision transport vehicles who only load the trunk 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.970
 is operated at Mercedes with 470 liters capacity 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:17.079
 the UBA where almost 400 59 liters 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.560
 the BMW is similar in size with 460 liters nevertheless in contrast to Mercedes remains 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.889
 luckily there is still room in the back seat for a bag 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.239
 miracle converted to fold down the rear seats but only one 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.060
 By far the best impression he leaves Super ARO with over 1000 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.060
 600 liters capacity 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:47.129
 How much of the Super Bowl but must at the German Live Style com is too 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.659
 stay at home 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.700
 at the BMW 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.700
 After all, there are two medium-sized bags 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.380
 the Mercedes has even less to offer 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.330
 Here, besides a bag, even a suitcase remains at least left 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.729
 the role 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:06.539
 comfortable traveling with four adults that is theirs for all three candidates 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:10.579
 difficult the best place still offers the 3er BMW 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.579
 even with longer trips so tight here too 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.339
 MHz 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:25.069
 The 3 30 x has a tidy cockpit that one buys himself with the 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.350
 a german thing 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.969
 that bundles a large part of the functions 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.099
 Most extras you have to sell but expensive 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.209
 unlike the Sugar Open word computer and navigation belong to 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.699
 After all, the standard equipment also costs 3000 euros more than the standard equipment 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.699
 BMW 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.459
 typical Mercedes but still good to use the many buttons and buttons 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.819
 in the center console 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.109
 However, the equipment is also comparatively meager here 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:59.329
 and the ride comfort 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.239
 the Subaru Legacy is hard-fought the sport suspension allows though 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.529
 Fleet cornering 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:05.510
 at the comfort 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.510
 but he loses ground clearly 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:16.369
 his biggest plus is in addition to the load volume, the standard equipment 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:21.229
 the drive that the SPD and especially the brakes can with the competition 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.680
 do not keep up 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.309
 when driving comfort is the BMW 3 30, she was clearly better 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.680
 the sporty touch is also underlined by the precise steering 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.300
 there 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.289
 thanks to the good six-speed automatic transmission is winning 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.530
 he also just the drive rating the structure driving safety is also on 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.819
 He lives Minus points are there for the small trunk 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:56.789
 The Mercedes C 350 C is the most effective before bad 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:57.270
 Weather 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.499
 and sex isolated from the barrel 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.499
 this includes the lowest noise level in the interior 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:11.759
 his strengths include not only the driving comfort but also the operability and the 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:12.689
 slow down 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.689
 only the space could be better 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.009
 the victory in this comparison goes to Stuttgart, the c 350 CDI 4matic 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.309
 Of the three, the most balanced car 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:31.830
 even if the BMW shines with the West all-wheel drive 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.690
 This must be improved, especially with the brakes
