for a tan so I thought it was really
really<00:04:37.020> cute<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.680> just<00:04:37.919> adored<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:38.840> when<00:04:39.840> I

really cute and I just adored it when I
got<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.639> so<00:04:41.639> then<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.210> couple<00:04:42.600> of<00:04:42.840> years<00:04:42.870> later<00:04:43.139> I

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
got it so then a couple of years later I

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.560 
got it so then a couple of years later I
just<00:04:44.280> felt<00:04:44.490> like<00:04:44.520> she<00:04:44.790> needed<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:45.180> be<00:04:45.330> sitting

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570

just felt like she needed to be sitting
on<00:04:45.900> something<00:04:46.229> so<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.979> went<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:48.000> another<00:04:48.210> person

pumice stone e type of rock and the
waves<00:04:55.710> kind<00:04:56.130> of<00:04:56.220> splashing<00:04:56.669> out<00:04:56.790> behind<00:04:57.060> her

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
waves kind of splashing out behind her

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.540 
waves kind of splashing out behind her
and<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:58.050> just<00:04:58.229> kind<00:04:58.410> of<00:04:58.470> anchors<00:04:58.830> her<00:04:59.100> more<00:04:59.340> on

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
and it just kind of anchors her more on

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.390 
and it just kind of anchors her more on
my<00:04:59.729> leg<00:04:59.940> but<00:05:00.720> this<00:05:00.990> piece<00:05:01.320> is<00:05:01.620> on<00:05:01.830> my<00:05:02.010> right<00:05:02.040> leg
