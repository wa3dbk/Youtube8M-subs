is<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.350> big<00:03:05.680> game<00:03:05.890> but<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.250> developers

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
is a big game but the developers

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.759 
is a big game but the developers
intentionally<00:03:07.510> slowed<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.019> down<00:03:08.200> because

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
intentionally slowed it down because

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.020 
intentionally slowed it down because
you're<00:03:08.920> going<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.160> be<00:03:09.250> searching<00:03:09.489> every

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
you're going to be searching every

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.060 
you're going to be searching every
corner<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.720> room<00:03:10.959> for<00:03:11.200> supplies<00:03:11.769> to

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
construct new weapons and health kits

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.949 
construct new weapons and health kits
also<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.459> don't<00:03:15.610> move<00:03:15.730> very<00:03:16.000> quickly<00:03:16.180> Joel<00:03:16.780> is

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
also you don't move very quickly Joel is

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.259 
also you don't move very quickly Joel is
really<00:03:17.320> slow<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.860> think<00:03:18.549> he<00:03:18.670> needs<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:18.970> find<00:03:19.150> a

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
really slow I think he needs to find a

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.880 
really slow I think he needs to find a
shopping<00:03:19.720> cart<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.079> have<00:03:20.170> Ellie<00:03:20.380> push<00:03:20.709> him

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
shopping cart and have Ellie push him

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.740 
shopping cart and have Ellie push him
around<00:03:21.010> but<00:03:21.400> then<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.700> game<00:03:21.910> would<00:03:22.060> be<00:03:22.269> more

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
around but then the game would be more

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:32.960 
around but then the game would be more
like<00:03:22.900> Dead<00:03:23.110> Rising

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.240 
way out west via Pittsburgh let's talk
about<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.080> realism<00:03:44.380> here<00:03:44.620> because<00:03:44.890> we<00:03:45.040> see

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
about the realism here because we see

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.820 
about the realism here because we see
Joel<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:45.730> Ellie<00:03:45.820> driving<00:03:46.480> west<00:03:46.720> on<00:03:46.870> 76<00:03:47.620> and

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
Joel and Ellie driving west on 76 and

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.490 
Joel and Ellie driving west on 76 and
then<00:03:47.920> somehow<00:03:48.280> end<00:03:48.610> up<00:03:48.730> downtown<00:03:49.060> now<00:03:49.630> 76<00:03:50.260> does

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
then somehow end up downtown now 76 does

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.380 
then somehow end up downtown now 76 does
not<00:03:50.650> actually<00:03:50.920> directly<00:03:51.760> connect<00:03:52.150> with

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
downtown Pittsburgh which means he would

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.000 
downtown Pittsburgh which means he would
have<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.670> take<00:03:54.820> 376<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:55.930> that's<00:03:56.620> one<00:03:56.800> of<00:03:56.920> the
