00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 good 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:14.480
 corner of holland anp corner of holland north holland and what do you think 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.170
 the first car manufacturer there are now with an electric cars on 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.480
 the market but us 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.439
 volkswagen is not there yet 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.439
 but they do work hard behind the scenes and electric cars 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.900
 and to show what they are doing they have made it is a wave 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.630
 the wave blue e motion 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.630
 we are going to ride a bit today 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.870
 this electric wave 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.220
 has all the features that we encounter other electric cars 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.890
 at silence 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.890
 he sets pulling power he responds nice and fast on the gas pedal 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.250
 power pedal actually 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.680
 this electric wave distinguishes itself from other electric cars 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.790
 are the shifters behind the wheel 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.450
 thereby determine to what extent the engine is braked and therefore how much energy 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.100
 be recovered 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.290
 families train with the other electric car's bad trainer 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.340
 switching flippers 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.470
 and that is, they win this indicating best lesson the same 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.840
 furthermore, this electric wave has a button with which the characteristic of the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.280
 determine the engine 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.310
 choose the period settings 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.649
 between more performances or the longer the range 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
 9 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.780
 4 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.780
 you 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.170
 the Serbian people 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.520
 if you get there if you do this co production 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.660
 electric motor linked to about that on the site 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.280
 this car is more than two months much heavier than a regular with one 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.650
 diesel engine 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.530
 nevertheless full of stains 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.259
 the feet can 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:14.259
 question of good chassis coordination 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.039
 go build a nice driving prototype so a whole lot different 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:19.929
 a series of production 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.369
 before that time we have to wait 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:23.409
 until 2013
