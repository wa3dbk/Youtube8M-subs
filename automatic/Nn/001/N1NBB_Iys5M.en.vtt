00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
always our biggest concern was was

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.380 
always our biggest concern was was
making<00:00:20.800> sure<00:00:20.830> that<00:00:21.130> we<00:00:21.250> had<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.789> halo<00:00:22.119> vibe

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
making sure that we had the halo vibe

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.269 
making sure that we had the halo vibe
down<00:00:22.689> the<00:00:23.170> lure<00:00:23.380> is<00:00:23.410> really<00:00:23.769> deep<00:00:23.949> and<00:00:24.189> rich

has<00:00:24.519> a<00:00:24.550> lot<00:00:24.730> of<00:00:24.759> units<00:00:25.179> that<00:00:25.300> we<00:00:25.390> can<00:00:25.509> play<00:00:25.689> with

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
has a lot of units that we can play with

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.540 
has a lot of units that we can play with
which<00:00:26.050> is<00:00:26.170> great<00:00:26.410> for<00:00:26.439> a<00:00:26.619> strategy<00:00:27.039> game<00:00:27.189> we

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
which is great for a strategy game we

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.310 
which is great for a strategy game we
found<00:00:27.759> the<00:00:27.880> coven's<00:00:28.240> be<00:00:28.330> pretty<00:00:28.570> fooled<00:00:28.900> that

found the coven's be pretty fooled that

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.989 
found the coven's be pretty fooled that
they<00:00:29.439> generally<00:00:29.800> had<00:00:29.949> a<00:00:29.980> good<00:00:30.279> array<00:00:30.970> of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.490 
vehicles that you could already fight we

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
the people have played the halo shooter

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.970 
the people have played the halo shooter
games<00:00:37.210> are<00:00:37.420> familiar<00:00:37.750> with<00:00:37.780> Master<00:00:38.230> Chief<00:00:38.440> but

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
games are familiar with Master Chief but

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.980 
games are familiar with Master Chief but
in<00:00:39.130> a<00:00:39.550> strategy<00:00:39.850> game<00:00:40.150> it's<00:00:40.360> about<00:00:40.540> multiple

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990 
in a strategy game it's about multiple

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.750 
in a strategy game it's about multiple
units<00:00:41.290> so<00:00:41.800> we<00:00:41.920> actually<00:00:42.160> had<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.340> fill<00:00:42.580> in

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
units so we actually had to fill in

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.550 
units so we actually had to fill in
quite<00:00:43.060> a<00:00:43.090> little<00:00:43.390> bit<00:00:43.510> for<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.750> UNSC<00:00:44.260> in<00:00:44.380> order

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
quite a little bit for the UNSC in order

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.260 
quite a little bit for the UNSC in order
to<00:00:44.710> make<00:00:45.280> them<00:00:45.580> feel<00:00:45.880> like<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.090> complete<00:00:46.510> tommy

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
to make them feel like a complete tommy

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.240 
to make them feel like a complete tommy
Halo<00:00:49.270> Wars<00:00:49.450> is<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:49.870> next<00:00:50.320> halo<00:00:50.560> game<00:00:50.770> but<00:00:51.130> it's

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
Halo Wars is the next halo game but it's

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.890 
Halo Wars is the next halo game but it's
a<00:00:51.310> prequel<00:00:51.580> so<00:00:52.300> from<00:00:52.480> a<00:00:52.540> game<00:00:52.690> design

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
a prequel so from a game design

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.210 
a prequel so from a game design
standpoint<00:00:53.110> it<00:00:53.380> was<00:00:53.440> challenging<00:00:53.860> to<00:00:53.920> go<00:00:54.070> back

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
standpoint it was challenging to go back

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.130 
standpoint it was challenging to go back
and<00:00:54.460> create<00:00:54.640> units<00:00:55.300> that<00:00:55.840> felt

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
and create units that felt

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.470 
and create units that felt
technologically<00:00:57.070> in<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.730> milieu<00:00:58.090> of<00:00:58.120> what

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
technologically in the milieu of what

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.840 
technologically in the milieu of what
something<00:00:58.810> would've<00:00:58.960> had<00:00:59.080> 20<00:00:59.380> years<00:00:59.410> earlier

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
something would've had 20 years earlier

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.040 
something would've had 20 years earlier
so<00:01:00.850> one<00:01:01.000> of<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.120> best<00:01:01.270> examples<00:01:01.420> we<00:01:01.780> have<00:01:01.900> is<00:01:02.020> a

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
so one of the best examples we have is a

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.229 
so one of the best examples we have is a
cyclops<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:03.010> cyclops<00:01:03.040> is<00:01:03.700> this<00:01:03.850> new<00:01:04.000> unit

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
cyclops the cyclops is this new unit

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.999 
cyclops the cyclops is this new unit
that<00:01:04.390> we<00:01:04.479> added<00:01:04.659> he's<00:01:05.170> almost<00:01:05.379> like<00:01:05.619> a<00:01:05.680> big

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
that we added he's almost like a big

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.420 
that we added he's almost like a big
giant<00:01:06.250> robot<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.290> cool<00:01:08.470> unit<00:01:08.860> because<00:01:09.130> he

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
giant robot it's a cool unit because he

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.520 
giant robot it's a cool unit because he
can<00:01:09.550> repair<00:01:09.880> other<00:01:10.060> stuff<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.750> he<00:01:10.870> he<00:01:11.320> throws

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
can repair other stuff and he he throws

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.350 
can repair other stuff and he he throws
things<00:01:11.920> on<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.220> battlefield<00:01:12.730> he<00:01:12.970> can<00:01:13.090> pick<00:01:13.240> up

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
things on the battlefield he can pick up

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.330 
things on the battlefield he can pick up
stuff<00:01:13.570> and<00:01:13.750> throw<00:01:14.020> it<00:01:14.200> it's<00:01:14.350> very<00:01:14.500> clunky<00:01:14.830> 20

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
stuff and throw it it's very clunky 20

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.770 
stuff and throw it it's very clunky 20
years<00:01:15.580> before<00:01:15.910> halo<00:01:16.090> 1<00:01:16.300> this<00:01:16.480> thing<00:01:16.660> was

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
years before halo 1 this thing was

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.630 
years before halo 1 this thing was
awesome<00:01:16.870> it<00:01:17.560> was<00:01:17.590> very<00:01:17.830> cool<00:01:17.980> could<00:01:18.190> rip

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
awesome it was very cool could rip

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.640 
awesome it was very cool could rip
chunks<00:01:18.880> off<00:01:19.120> of<00:01:19.270> vehicles<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:19.870> all<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.140> but

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
chunks off of vehicles and all that but

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.980 
chunks off of vehicles and all that but
it<00:01:20.770> was<00:01:20.860> too<00:01:21.040> bulky<00:01:21.340> too<00:01:21.730> unwieldy<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.540> so

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
it was too bulky too unwieldy and so

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.660 
it was too bulky too unwieldy and so
eventually<00:01:23.200> it<00:01:23.470> was<00:01:23.680> abandoned<00:01:24.070> in<00:01:24.340> favor<00:01:24.550> of

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
eventually it was abandoned in favor of

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.490 
eventually it was abandoned in favor of
this<00:01:25.000> partner

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:37.050 

a<00:01:34.630> definite<00:01:35.630> feeling<00:01:35.870> when<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.320> Spartans

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060

a definite feeling when the Spartans
show<00:01:38.060> up<00:01:38.300> for<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.630> first<00:01:38.780> time<00:01:39.020> in<00:01:39.170> the

that comes and in this four of them when
you're<00:02:47.090> based<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.600> kind<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.840> freaked<00:02:48.049> out

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
you're based you kind of freaked out
