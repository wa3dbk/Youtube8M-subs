00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.990
 and how are youtube people have 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.450
 metal greets and welcome 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.420
 back to my channel the day of them 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.820
 I bring the video of a boxing of this 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.689
 game that is called billion his shows for 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.290
 Playstation 3 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.660
 it is more is exclusive to playstation according to 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.190
 they told me in this game that is first 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.130
 that nothing a greeting to die 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.200
 I think I do not know if you recommended this 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.080
 game but he gave very good opinions and 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.010
 that's why I decided to spend money on 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.100
 buy this 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.560
 It cost me $ 25 very good price 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.600
 true for the game 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.630
 to another thing where the complete gives the 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.070
 opportunity to try the playstation 4 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.500
 it felt pretty good the play3 for 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.410
 have something interesting and good to love that 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.060
 box 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.880
 well this game is a bit curious 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.560
 because he uses actors more I think that 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.060
 all games use actors like 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:10.390
 base model but good here mentions you 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:15.350
 ellen paige and william dafoe villon you 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.450
 you know what it means beyond souls 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.970
 how much during that I think it was the 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.799
 company that made a game of sony only 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.590
 for play station so from players of 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.979
 pc and xbox you have to buy a 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.229
 play 3 to play this I will see that 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.490
 says here the image of willem 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:38.270
 dafoe as a character and the different 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.200
 photos of the game itself excuse me if not yes 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.930
 is not great but good is what 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.840
 discover the mystery of 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.080
 from beyond, do not stay in a powerful 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.960
 and exciting day of I do not know that I do not know 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.230
 how much of jodi holmes that character 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.340
 well what else says the game bluray dolby 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.189
 digital as always 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.590
 this curious health can be played from 1 to 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.860
 2 players I do not know if one day he will 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.830
 focus on this but I do not think 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.640
 you can play two players 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.690
 good requires 2 255 gigs of hard drive 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.690
 it's not much 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.870
 Bone image output resolutions 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.580
 compatible with 480 and 720p since yes 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.540
 they have this kind of 1080 game 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.790
 covers in the play only in dry 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.489
 dualshock 3 as always 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.750
 and well let's open this we have already 2 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.750
 minutes more than I expected 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.900
 the plastiki all the devil 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.900
 that is always very broken ball 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.019
 good 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.930
 to what does not work for us, what are we going to do? 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.920
 ball and make a side 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.920
 everything Everything everything 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.070
 this also good 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.620
 here we have it billion its sun we are going to 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.200
 see what it brings inside that there is no 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.880
 code 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.800
 do not 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.800
 let me leave you the bolus 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.840
 do not 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.400
 why 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.890
 They do not bring anything in the house, not that 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.319
 not that scam dry for me that you 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.000
 can see contraband and they took away what 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.280
 that it was inside 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 good that they compensated a little here 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.380
 I always knew what I did not know 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.140
 had seen any one boxing of this 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.230
 thing so I did not know what was going to come 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.290
 it does not bring any paper it does not bring anything but 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.300
 brings us this background image 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.310
 I guess it's nice for example if 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.360
 I want you if you want to have a box 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.090
 personalized mood 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.680
 maybe the cover and you turn around 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.590
 I'm going to do that, I'm going to show you 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.450
 end of the video how is and good the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.910
 disco villon your shows I did not expect 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.150
 that nothing comes to me but the fucking 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.859
 disco but good 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.370
 I'm going to make the cover change and now 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.590
 He flew 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.100
 and good people here is like that would be the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.170
 cover page 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.690
 and in custom box bus it is also not 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.529
 the great thing but good is what there is 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.249
 with the disc inside more things 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:38.819
 I will upload this game to you 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:40.379
 video does not interest me that what you have 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.389
 promised that I will not upload more campaign 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.729
 this game is going to come yes or yes because 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.839
 the truth is that it is very epic is more 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.909
 it's almost like one as a series like a 

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:54.209
 telenovela turned into a video game where 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:56.999
 liked more day and more good decisions 

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:59.820
 yes or if I 'm going to bring this game to you 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:02.820
 videos wait with 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.770
 with much desire in countdown and 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.780
 good if you liked this video I can 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.870
 leave a comment 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.400

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.170
 first video that you see from my channel like this 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.870
 You can find out when I upload videos from 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.240

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.430
 is going up there another notice 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.830
 important the series of penumbra overture 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.040
 I started not going to continue because 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.750
 the truth is a game 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.890
 that you can not play in a short time in 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.420
 a game that you have to take your 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.130
 time to explore the map itself 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.010
 learn well how things are done 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.290
 so unfortunately I will not be able to 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.930
 continue maybe in a future yes that 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.630
 I do a livestream or something there such 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.280
 time but good that was all people now 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.630
 without saying more than saying goodbye and see you 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.810

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.810
 bye
