Russ I thought that Jim Jones played
better<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.579> the<00:00:29.759> second<00:00:30.119> game<00:00:30.269> than<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> head

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
better in the second game than a head

throughout<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.309> Seattle<00:00:32.759> service<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.390> in

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
throughout the Seattle service and in

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.389 
throughout the Seattle service and in
the<00:00:33.570> first<00:00:33.780> game<00:00:34.020> did<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.410> notice<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.739> yes

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
the first game did you notice that yes

he<00:00:35.579> plays<00:00:35.850> easier<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.750> lot<00:00:36.989> better<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
he plays easier to a lot better and I

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.920
