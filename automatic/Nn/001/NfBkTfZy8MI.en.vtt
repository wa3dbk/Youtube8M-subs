between the three different types here

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.279 
between the three different types here
we<00:00:51.519> go

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
we go

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:01.649 
we go
create<00:00:53.289> a<00:00:53.320> rib<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:56.940> his<00:00:57.940> roll<00:00:58.420> three<00:01:00.329> wall<00:01:01.329> two

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
create a rib and his roll three wall two

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:12.380

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.950 

I'm<00:01:16.000> not<00:01:16.090> really<00:01:16.210> sure<00:01:16.450> if<00:01:16.539> you<00:01:16.600> can<00:01:16.689> see<00:01:16.840> the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
I'm not really sure if you can see the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.950 
I'm not really sure if you can see the
glowing<00:01:17.350> effects<00:01:17.829> they're<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:19.479> supposed<00:01:19.840> to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
glowing effects they're just supposed to

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.690 
glowing effects they're just supposed to
be

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.230 

the<00:01:27.150> glow<00:01:27.330> effect<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.810> hello<00:01:29.030> but<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the glow effect here hello but the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.700 
the glow effect here hello but the
advantages<00:01:31.050> of<00:01:31.110> having<00:01:32.570> these<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.350> glowing

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
advantages of having these the glowing

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.770 
advantages of having these the glowing
sprites<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.060> punked<00:01:36.479> up<00:01:36.630> your

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
sprites is it is it's punked up your

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.260 
sprites is it is it's punked up your
game<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.229> know<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.470> makes<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.770> look<00:01:37.950> better

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
game you know it makes it look better

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.690 
game you know it makes it look better
the<00:01:39.270> disadvantages<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:42.350> it's<00:01:43.580> sort<00:01:44.580> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the disadvantages is it's sort of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.240 
the disadvantages is it's sort of
pointing<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.300> direction<00:01:45.470> yeah<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:47.100> if

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
pointing in one direction yeah like if

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
pointing in one direction yeah like if
you<00:01:47.369> see<00:01:47.580> that<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.479> would<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
you see that is this would be on the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.840 
you see that is this would be on the
side<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.860> room<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.520> need<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.759> make

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
side of a room so you need to make

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.999 
side of a room so you need to make
another<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> bottom<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.140> room<00:01:52.350> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
another one to the bottom of a room so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.660

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.509 

okay<00:02:09.420> see<00:02:09.659> how<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:10.229> how<00:02:10.259> insanely<00:02:10.979> cool<00:02:11.340> that

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
okay see how see how insanely cool that

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.899 
okay see how see how insanely cool that
looks<00:02:12.319> glowing<00:02:13.319> but<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.129> have<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.519> make<00:02:14.730> a

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
looks glowing but you have to make a

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.369 
looks glowing but you have to make a
separate<00:02:15.420> sprite<00:02:15.959> for<00:02:16.230> each<00:02:16.500> wall<00:02:17.569> okay<00:02:18.569> so

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
separate sprite for each wall okay so

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.490 
separate sprite for each wall okay so
it's<00:02:19.560> kind<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:21.000> know<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.870> sacrifice

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
it's kind of you know it's you sacrifice

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.160 
it's kind of you know it's you sacrifice
one<00:02:22.860> thing<00:02:23.189> for<00:02:23.879> a<00:02:23.909> different<00:02:24.329> thing<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.720> it

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
one thing for a different thing so it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.740 
one thing for a different thing so it
looks<00:02:25.440> better<00:02:25.819> but<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.090> takes<00:02:27.329> more<00:02:27.480> time

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
looks better but it just takes more time

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.210 
looks better but it just takes more time
and<00:02:28.019> effort<00:02:29.329> I<00:02:30.329> haven't<00:02:31.049> got<00:02:31.200> any<00:02:31.440> maze<00:02:31.769> games

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
and effort I haven't got any maze games

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:41.640 
and effort I haven't got any maze games
actually<00:02:33.260> but<00:02:36.769> let<00:02:37.769> me<00:02:37.829> just<00:02:37.859> create<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> object

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.729 

but<00:02:42.220> if<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.459> show<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.730> what<00:02:42.940> I'd<00:02:43.030> run<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:44.590> I

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
but if I show you what I'd run and if I

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:45.899 
but if I show you what I'd run and if I
try<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.069> show<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.310> what<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.459> meant<00:02:45.730> by<00:02:45.849> the

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
try and show you what I meant by the

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.750 
try and show you what I meant by the
other<00:02:46.180> wall<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.680> advantages<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.250> having<00:02:48.640> that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
other wall the advantages of having that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.289 
other wall the advantages of having that
wall<00:02:49.030> is<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:51.069> know<00:02:51.190> it's<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.430> simple<00:02:51.730> design

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
wall is you know it's a simple design

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.559 
wall is you know it's a simple design
it's<00:02:52.840> quick<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.110> draw<00:02:53.530> it's<00:02:54.430> quicker<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.790> draw

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
it's quick to draw it's quicker to draw

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.440 
it's quick to draw it's quicker to draw
than<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.870> other<00:02:56.019> one<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.799> know<00:03:00.450> it's

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
than the other one you know it's

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.559 
than the other one you know it's
reasonably<00:03:02.430> basic<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:07.180> can<00:03:07.420> be

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
reasonably basic so and it can be

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.990 
reasonably basic so and it can be
anywhere<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.319> want<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.560> put<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.159> rather

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
anywhere you want to put it so rather

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.880 
anywhere you want to put it so rather
than<00:03:10.299> creating<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.530> separate<00:03:12.099> sprite<00:03:12.549> you<00:03:13.890> can

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
than creating a separate sprite you can

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.440 
than creating a separate sprite you can
create<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:16.209> can<00:03:16.359> create<00:03:16.629> the<00:03:16.780> whole<00:03:16.810> room

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
create you can create the whole room

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.170 
create you can create the whole room
