00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.729
 all boys are j and here we are 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:10.030
 here with the first video on fifa 14 in 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:11.320
 especially on the fifa web app 14 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.750
 sorry if I didn't make a video 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.280
 concerning maybe first paco for the 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.860
 but already seeing that they had been 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.460
 loaded 100 billion on youtube then 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.940
 I simply decided not to get bored 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.050
 further with that kind of video 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.010
 I'm here today to show you a 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:33.129
 as started I make you a little bit like it is 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.230
 made the main web app 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.350
 changes that we find in 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.210
 this application I remind you that 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.710
 I will leave linking description of the web 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.710
 app for those who don't know it yet 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.219
 nothing we leave immediately with the fact that 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.850
 currently 10,000 credits plus credits 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.649
 of this series I got to 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.979
 all these jerks or earned with a 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.049
 little bit of sale however is also a 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.590
 with what I managed to sell 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.299
 from the first initial packages here is me 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.280
 gone some ass for some players 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.930
 such as vidal that I bought it 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.990
 only at 7,900 or a good pay 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.829
 only 1700 here are the shots 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.250
 better then for example we have mertens 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.740
 that was not paid much 1900 e 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.140
 other players here I've chosen this 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.149
 module because I like it a lot but here 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.729
 more or less all is well 4 3 3 you vi 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.079
 you will ask but cannot have type 40,000 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.479
 credits of stuff like that 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.340
 and instead it was because I went well 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.079
 at the beginning even with some 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.689
 buying and selling I did with some 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.689
 silver player as you see here in 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.329
 transfer list, unfortunately, not 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.770
 I still start a series because anyway 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.950
 despite having made a bit of buying and selling 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.719
 I admit I am struggling a lot 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.390
 because there are very few offers 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.650
 valid and many times the auctions end 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.130
 at the same price as the buy gold 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.100
 so it's totally useless but let's go 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.680
 to see the changes then as already 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.620
 announced there are so many i 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.930
 modules as you see many more modules 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.960
 compared to past years 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.580
 and this is the main change the 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.250
 second change concerns everything 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.750
 always concerning the modules to the fact that 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.400
 therefore, players do not have a module 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.490
 for example if I want to pass another 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.870
 kind of 4 3 3 now let it be that 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:39.590
 done by chance but here you see more or less 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.650
 understanding 99 with a change almost nothing e 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.720
 nothing 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:53.420
 then now back to my normal 4 3 3 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:56.240
 so then other changes concern in 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.360
 especially the market in the meantime 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.770
 let's save the market then i 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.090
 players are always bronze silver gold 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.120
 nationality championship solid things 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.030
 except one thing the style understood then 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.350
 the intended style concerns children 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.400
 power ups that the players of the 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.950
 will hold according to the agreement 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.680
 you will give we sniper finalizer 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.840
 predator so on now especially 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.790
 so what all these styles do 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.250
 I do not know, though, but it can only be done 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.350
 guess but you can search in 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.120
 consumables given the agreement the problem 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.340
 that the still understand some cost 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.540
 a lot and to make me buy 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.220
 It occurred to me to change something 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.060
 Understanding style of some player who 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.500
 however it is sold quite easily 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.350
 to then sell it at a higher price 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.120
 even if you look like now 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.510
 I show for example the player or 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.040
 we do sniper then good at 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.080
 Pull 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.880
 I don't think there are much if there are any 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.350
 here they are made a little randomly though ad 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.040
 example 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.860
 as you can see the prices of some 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.270
 they are not high 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.310
 apart from her not that it was put 11 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.150
 I do not understand why millions 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.030
 but for example a sniper player 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.590
 good maybe that costs 6 thousand since 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.960
 there are those who do not seem to me that it costs anyway 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.920
 1000 2000 here will increase a little bit the 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.480
 price 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.610
 the problem is that with packages 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.230
 used all apply to them 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.450
 consumables that have any 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.570
 player then at the end 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.550
 for now the price won't stay much 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.160
 in short, it will not remain high for ad 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.190
 example yesterday I saw luca co con 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.590
 gunner which cost instead of 6,000 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.960
 type 8,000 and was purchased 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.820
 so I said why we couldn't 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.520
 buy that I don't understand for which 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.960
 strange reason a midfielder 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.570
 central defensive must have the 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.050
 gunner in spite of shooting 45 between 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:06.350
 these are details in any case 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.200
 then we yes always regards the 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.300
 market concerns staff 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.510
 now the coaches will be able to search 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.560
 by championship by nationality and own 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.920
 it's about the coaches 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.520
 going back to the consumables you will have to 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.400
 to buy 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.260
 for example if we want to use that is 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.780
 we can safely change the 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.230
 a coach's championship then ad 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.370
 example I don't know mourigno for the series 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.660
 to give more understanding than mourinho 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.640
 of the premier league for included in one 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.460
 team of standard and few players 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.190
 words so then another change 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:48.020
 regards the club or the objects of the 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:51.590
 club in fact the uniforms will be ad 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.480
 example I take this makes active if 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.820
 you can insert a transfer currency 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.130
 even as divided into the house the fact that 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.550
 of the example and vice versa therefore one 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.210
 divided in house use it as divided by 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.620
 transfer 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.180
 so this is a very nice thing 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.710
 once we could have two example 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.600
 transfer uniforms 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.060
 at the same time then 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.790
 as you can see, two uniforms are divided by 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.820
 transfer away and away and 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.520
 so this echo is a good thing a 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.010
 my opinion because if maybe you have 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.690
 two uniforms of the beautiful and beautiful 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.480
 you want those two you can at all costs 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.940
 put them at the same time not 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.310
 alternating them for the rest is not enough 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.400
 there is nothing to add 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.500
 here I show you the team like 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.690
 you can see there are players who 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.000
 they look really promising as 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:46.180
 caceres 81 speed that did not pay 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.450
 not even much 3,700 then the walls and there 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.310
 wrong he paid only 4 thousand e 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.140
 then ok, the others let you see it 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.700
 bomb in the golan 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.600
 revenge they were paid a little bit 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.770
 too good too much 2,300 and how 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.220
 I already said a couple of videos ago 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.020
 the only decent left back is 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.910
 constant that already costs a 1200 pure 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.710
 being a player not rare not a 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.620
 bad statistics for charity to be 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.330
 a fullback, however, I did n't want to 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:17.380
 spend so much for a not fullback 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:22.000
 rare but now I'll see what to do 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:24.190
 in any case, here is to make a sale 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.440
 for now I do not tell you anything but a will come out 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.060
 video later then guys for 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.560
 this video is all i hope to be 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.870
 been clear enough to remind you 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.670
 leave a like a comment 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.790
 and why not maybe you embody them 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:39.370
 your team that you've already done 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:41.620
 so I could take inspiration here for 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.390
 maybe make us some videos so there 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.230
 we hear in a few days precisely with 

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.230
 a new beautiful video
