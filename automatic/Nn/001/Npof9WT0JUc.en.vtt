because deer die where they live where

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.660 
because deer die where they live where
they<00:00:42.960> bit<00:00:43.379> bed<00:00:43.770> where<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.129> spend<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> most

roaming is where they live and that's

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.240 
roaming is where they live and that's
where<00:00:49.950> they<00:00:50.070> die<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.449> isn't<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.320> isn't<00:00:53.070> a

where they die so it isn't it isn't a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.279 
where they die so it isn't it isn't a

of your goals when developing a

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.870 
of your goals when developing a
sanctuary<00:02:52.390> is<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.500> if<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.340> don't<00:02:54.519> have<00:02:54.850> a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
sanctuary is that if you don't have a

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.850 
sanctuary is that if you don't have a
real<00:02:55.180> rough<00:02:55.420> topography<00:02:56.049> that<00:02:56.080> hides<00:02:56.440> deer

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
real rough topography that hides deer

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.380 
real rough topography that hides deer
that<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.430> at<00:02:57.549> least<00:02:57.730> try<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.000> build<00:02:58.269> an

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
that you at least try to build an

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.509 
that you at least try to build an
understory<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.260> one<00:02:59.590> way<00:02:59.799> to<00:02:59.830> do<00:03:00.099> that<00:03:00.280> is

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
understory and one way to do that is

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.759 
understory and one way to do that is
through<00:03:00.700> select<00:03:01.150> cutting<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.690> hinge<00:03:02.380> cutting

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
through select cutting and hinge cutting

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:03.930 
through select cutting and hinge cutting
where<00:03:02.890> you'll<00:03:03.010> cut<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.250> trees<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.849> they

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
where you'll cut the trees that they

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.699 
where you'll cut the trees that they
fall<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:04.360> such<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.599> way<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:04.840> they<00:03:05.080> provide<00:03:05.470> a

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
fall in such a way that they provide a

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.220 
fall in such a way that they provide a
bedding<00:03:06.310> area<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.880> provide<00:03:07.420> light<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:08.080> the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
bedding area and provide light to the

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.770 
bedding area and provide light to the
forest<00:03:08.830> floor<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.970> lot<00:03:10.599> of<00:03:10.720> the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
forest floor so that a lot of the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.110 
forest floor so that a lot of the
vegetation<00:03:11.230> can<00:03:11.620> grow<00:03:11.860> we've<00:03:12.459> even<00:03:12.760> gone<00:03:12.880> in

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
vegetation can grow we've even gone in

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.420 
vegetation can grow we've even gone in
there<00:03:13.269> sometimes<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.019> taking<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.769> disc<00:03:15.069> and

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
there sometimes and taking a disc and

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.220 
there sometimes and taking a disc and
you<00:03:16.060> know<00:03:16.150> some<00:03:16.330> of<00:03:16.360> that<00:03:16.540> forest<00:03:16.840> floor<00:03:17.109> is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
you know some of that forest floor is

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.680 
you know some of that forest floor is
matted<00:03:17.709> down<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.670> heavily<00:03:19.150> from<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.359> leaves

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
matted down so heavily from the leaves

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.020 
matted down so heavily from the leaves
through<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.560> years<00:03:20.829> that<00:03:21.370> it's<00:03:21.549> hard<00:03:21.790> for

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
through the years that it's hard for

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.180 
through the years that it's hard for
anything<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.540> grow<00:03:22.709> we've<00:03:23.709> gone<00:03:23.890> in<00:03:24.040> there

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
anything to grow we've gone in there

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.460 
anything to grow we've gone in there
with<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.340> disc<00:03:24.640> ripped<00:03:25.269> it<00:03:25.450> up<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.690> few<00:03:25.870> times<00:03:26.109> got

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
with a disc ripped it up a few times got

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.080 
with a disc ripped it up a few times got
out<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.799> there<00:03:26.950> after<00:03:27.100> we<00:03:27.400> cut<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.760> up<00:03:27.880> pretty

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
out of there after we cut it up pretty

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.170 
out of there after we cut it up pretty
good<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.769> shoot<00:03:29.769> even<00:03:29.950> Cedars<00:03:30.489> pop<00:03:30.760> up<00:03:31.000> now
