hey<00:00:01.890> YouTube<00:00:02.280> it's<00:00:02.580> time<00:00:03.360> for<00:00:03.570> another<00:00:03.750> app<00:00:04.049> so

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
hey YouTube it's time for another app so

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.579 
hey YouTube it's time for another app so
to<00:00:04.500> fix<00:00:05.069> it<00:00:05.279> Friday<00:00:05.930> I've<00:00:06.930> seen<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.230> think<00:00:07.440> this

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
to fix it Friday I've seen I think this

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.080 
to fix it Friday I've seen I think this
is<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.830> first<00:00:07.950> episode<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.460> fix<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:08.880> Friday

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
is the first episode of fix it Friday

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.570 
is the first episode of fix it Friday
and<00:00:09.599> we're<00:00:10.320> starting<00:00:10.710> off<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.040> grand<00:00:11.340> fashion

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
and we're starting off in grand fashion

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.000 
and we're starting off in grand fashion
with<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.809> repair<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.440> realistic<00:00:13.860> Sta<00:00:14.490> 2300

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
with the repair of a realistic Sta 2300

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.460 
with the repair of a realistic Sta 2300
here<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.130> its<00:00:17.279> AM<00:00:17.400> amplifier<00:00:18.119> module<00:00:18.439> one<00:00:19.439> of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
here is its AM amplifier module one of

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.189 
here is its AM amplifier module one of
them<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.730> uses<00:00:21.060> two<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.359> these<00:00:21.539> they're<00:00:22.020> good

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
them it uses two of these they're good

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.910 
them it uses two of these they're good
for<00:00:22.350> 120<00:00:22.920> watts<00:00:23.130> per<00:00:23.369> channel<00:00:23.400> and

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
for 120 watts per channel and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.109 
for 120 watts per channel and
unfortunately<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.070> one's<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.760> need<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
unfortunately this one's in need of a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.519 
unfortunately this one's in need of a
little<00:00:27.359> bit<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.539> repair<00:00:27.869> which<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.230> why<00:00:28.349> it's

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
little bit of repair which is why it's

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.030 
little bit of repair which is why it's
being<00:00:28.769> talked<00:00:28.980> about<00:00:30.230> let's<00:00:31.230> go<00:00:31.619> through<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
being talked about let's go through the

its<00:01:03.979> orange<00:01:04.979> color<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> low<00:01:06.299> leakage

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
its orange color this is a low leakage

anymore<00:01:10.229> unfortunately<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.340> rely

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
anymore unfortunately you have to rely

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370 
anymore unfortunately you have to rely
on<00:01:11.610> type<00:01:12.030> codes<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.630> determine<00:01:13.049> whether<00:01:13.200> it's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
on type codes to determine whether it's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.080 
on type codes to determine whether it's
low<00:01:13.590> leakage<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:14.070> not<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.700> was<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> nice

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
low leakage or not and it was a nice

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
don't do anymore

they're<00:02:13.299> not<00:02:13.510> drivers<00:02:14.110> because<00:02:14.500> they're<00:02:14.650> too
