00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.180
 hello to all pokemon players in 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.310
 this time I will make a list of 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.349
 pokémons that deserve to be crowned as 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.360
 birth trolls since I'm sure that 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.340
 have you ever encountered any 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.779
 of these in combat and your desire to 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.270
 kill went up like foam 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.310
 the desperation reached such levels 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.239
 high that today I will dedicate a video 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.059
 without further delay let's start pokémons 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.160
 trolls I will start with one that is not so 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.640
 known in this bullfighting but that a 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.190
 Once you find it, you can find it 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.140
 this pokemones scj armor and some me 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.449
 they will say that it has is troll car mori 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.330
 Well, his attacks are good 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.309
 chosen may hurt your 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.890
 strategy is based on placing spikes 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.769
 trap poisonous rocks and quills 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.900
 more place much better then use the 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.760
 swirl attack roar continuously 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.030
 to change pokemon and that these 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.680
 hurt with all the barbs and other 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.720
 you can also change one of these 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.150
 attacks for respite so that his 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.160
 troll period last much longer 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.230
 it's a good strategy in my opinion 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.510
 but it does not ensure victory much 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.400
 less but the important thing here is not 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.290
 win but make our 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.950
 opponent and endure the most 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.320
 possible the next pokemon is that if 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.840
 that turtle is seemingly useless is 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.730
 more troll than this pokemon seems 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.890
 is characterized by having the defense and 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.830
 highest special defense of all 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.890
 pokemon reaching to reach 612 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.020
 incredible points but true the bad is 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.869
 that his attack and special attack is almost 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.520
 an insult but good what really troll 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.680
 of this pokemon is an attack that 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.450
 flame trick force this attack 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.700
 exchange the attack points and 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.280
 defense so your attack happens to be 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.320
 really colossal does not have a 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.150
 defined strategy but yes that can 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.729
 get to do a lot of damage if done 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.460
 well I love it when people tell me 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.520
 that is that is useless hahahaha poor 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.770
 ignorant then we have to 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.320
 wisin a pretty troll pokemon for the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.240
 following reasons within this type 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.290
 poison and the only weakness of the type 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.299
 poison is the earth type 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.730
 because within thanks to his ability 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.010
 levitation is immune to type attacks 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.439
 earth what turns you into a pokemon 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.879
 without weaknesses he has some attacks 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.920
 Pretty trolls for situations 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.010
 criticism as same destination and 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.340
 Self-destruction can also learn 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.159
 Toxic rest and substitute is undoubtedly 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.780
 a pokemon difficult to overcome I do not understand 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.909
 as james from the rocket team lost 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.079
 always fighting having a 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.810
 pokemon of that caliber 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.329
 the next pokemones is fix me 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.299
 this pokemon can learn all the 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.220
 attacks I repeat every single one of the 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.069
 attacks had and for having in the game 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.870
 having this quality the strategies 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.879
 for this pokemon they are endless 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.760
 one of them that I personally 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.680
 use a lot is the next first 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.230
 you start with spores to sleep at 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.290
 enemy continuous with cobwebs or evil of 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.909
 eye so your opponent can not run away 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.970
 then you use telepath and finally 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.250
 Cold polar and strategy has its flaws 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.409
 since sometimes the 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.819
 enemy earlier than planned and weaken 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.489
 to your pokemon 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.549
 this strategy was an example the 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.769
 possibilities are endless last 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.499
 we have the pokemon that surely is 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.269
 the most hated by the whole community one 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.370
 of the most difficult to overcome and for 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.760
 both of the most trolls ladies and 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.530
 Gentlemen, I offer you to open this 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.900
 Pokémon has a number of points of 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.689
 exaggeratedly high health and a great 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.639
 defense and special defense a good wall 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:52.129
 for your team but the best of this 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.260
 Pokémon is your strategy has several 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.269
 strategies although most are 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.849
 similar one of the strategies 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.069
 is to make your enemy toxic 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.900
 and reduction repeatedly so that your 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.389
 evasion is very high and you can not 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.280
 practically attack when we see each other 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.799
 in danger we use 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.959
 shock absorber and everything arranged too 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.939
 we can add some physical attack to 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.820
 streamline the process if toxic 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:18.919
 fails I shit on everything who has not 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.780
 happened to meet one of these and 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.990
 that when we are about to kill him 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.150
 you go to cushion my god what bad what 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.710
 happened though the bad thing about this pokemon is 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.790
 that with a fight type attack you 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.130
 charges 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.500
 good and up to here the hall of fame of 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.680
 trolls I know there are many more but these 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.300
 they are the most meaningful and fun 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.190
 Besides, I did not want to extend the 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.830
 video in order 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.090
 enough talk I say goodbye to 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.090
 then pokemon lovers
