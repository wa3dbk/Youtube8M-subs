actually a responsive live wallpaper do

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.529 
actually a responsive live wallpaper do
several<00:00:20.609> things<00:00:20.789> one<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.840> comes<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:24.150> arc

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
several things one it comes the the arc

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.300 
several things one it comes the the arc
reactor<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.260> middle<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> light<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
reactor the middle in the light and the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.509 
reactor the middle in the light and the
ice<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.760> light<00:00:26.970> actually<00:00:28.070> changes<00:00:29.070> depending

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
ice the light actually changes depending

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.669 
ice the light actually changes depending
on<00:00:29.670> your<00:00:29.849> battery<00:00:30.060> status<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.840> if<00:00:31.080> your<00:00:31.260> low<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
on your battery status so if your low it

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.340 
on your battery status so if your low it
will<00:00:31.830> go<00:00:32.009> red<00:00:32.250> high<00:00:33.210> will<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:33.510> yellow<00:00:33.960> medium

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
will go red high will be yellow medium

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.430 
will go red high will be yellow medium
will<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.559> blue<00:00:35.040> now<00:00:35.690> if<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.870> change<00:00:37.110> the

will be blue now if you change the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.979 
will be blue now if you change the
angles<00:00:37.860> change<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.579> Iron<00:00:39.210> Man<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:39.840> you

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the settings so that you can actually

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.490 
the settings so that you can actually

can also choose to display the armor in
full<00:01:05.729> or<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.060> want<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.380> arc

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
full or if you just want to see the arc

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.440 
full or if you just want to see the arc
reactor<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.189> let's<00:01:08.400> try<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.180> just

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
reactor so let's try that so it's just

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.530 
reactor so let's try that so it's just
the<00:01:12.720> arc<00:01:12.900> reactor<00:01:13.939> of<00:01:14.939> course<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.509> change

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
the arc reactor of course we can change

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.770 
the arc reactor of course we can change
that<00:01:15.900> back<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.409> double<00:01:16.710> tap<00:01:17.270> display<00:01:18.270> armor

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that back just double tap display armor

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
that back just double tap display armor
then<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.290> again<00:01:19.530> what<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.460> also

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
then you have it again what you can also

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.460 
then you have it again what you can also
do<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.090> change<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.110> turn<00:01:22.320> on

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
do is you can change you can turn on

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.580 
do is you can change you can turn on
suit<00:01:22.710> audio<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.310> each<00:01:23.520> time<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.790> move<00:01:24.590> their

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
suit audio so each time you move their

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.710 
suit audio so each time you move their
sound<00:01:25.920> effects<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.150> also<00:01:27.330> change<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
sound effects you can also change the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.450 
sound effects you can also change the
armor<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.740> buy<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.340> actually

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
armor if you do buy it you can actually

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.170 
armor if you do buy it you can actually
get<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> iron<00:01:30.180> peak<00:01:30.390> written<00:01:30.750> version<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.180> it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
get the iron peak written version and it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.210 
get the iron peak written version and it
should<00:01:33.479> load<00:01:33.720> let's<00:01:34.079> give<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.409> few<00:01:34.619> seconds

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
should load let's give it a few seconds

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.719 
should load let's give it a few seconds
there<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> go

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
there you go

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.910 
there you go
this<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> iron<00:01:39.360> patriot<00:01:39.900> model<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.799> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
this is the iron patriot model as you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.889 
this is the iron patriot model as you
can<00:01:41.070> see<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.460> change<00:01:41.759> you've<00:01:42.570> turned<00:01:42.780> on

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the music it can actually hurt the sound

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.370 
the music it can actually hurt the sound
effects<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.579> you<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> sound<00:01:47.970> effects

Jarvis<00:01:58.740> should<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:59.070> talking<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.450> also

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
Jarvis should be talking and you also

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.410 
Jarvis should be talking and you also
have<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> options<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> add<00:02:01.670> stickers<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:03.270> you

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
can see here you can move that enlarge

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.370 
can see here you can move that enlarge
that<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.759> there<00:02:06.210> are<00:02:06.329> notifications<00:02:07.079> as<00:02:07.200> well
