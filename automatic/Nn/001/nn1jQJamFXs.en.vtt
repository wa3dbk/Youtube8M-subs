this<00:00:30.640> will<00:00:30.790> give<00:00:30.910> us<00:00:30.939> about<00:00:31.149> sixty<00:00:31.570> percent

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
this will give us about sixty percent

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.020 
this will give us about sixty percent
more<00:00:31.899> volume<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:32.649> give<00:00:33.550> us<00:00:33.670> a<00:00:33.730> little<00:00:33.790> more

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
more volume and give us a little more

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.740 
more volume and give us a little more
juice<00:00:34.210> of<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.540> egk<00:00:35.670> start<00:00:36.670> out<00:00:36.790> by<00:00:37.030> removing

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
juice of the egk start out by removing

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.550 
juice of the egk start out by removing
the<00:00:37.900> stocks<00:00:38.170> normal<00:00:43.080> actually

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
the stocks normal actually

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.650 
the stocks normal actually
so<00:00:45.250> he's<00:00:45.400> enough<00:00:45.670> by<00:00:45.790> hand<00:00:50.730> there<00:00:51.730> you<00:00:52.090> can<00:00:52.450> see

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
so he's enough by hand there you can see

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.430 
so he's enough by hand there you can see
is<00:00:52.840> our<00:00:53.020> stock<00:00:53.440> snorkel<00:00:54.329> looks<00:00:55.329> about<00:00:55.630> an<00:00:55.960> inch

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
is our stock snorkel looks about an inch

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.310 
is our stock snorkel looks about an inch
which<00:00:56.829> is<00:00:56.890> pretty<00:00:57.520> tiny<00:00:57.730> in<00:00:58.630> comparison<00:00:58.690> to

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
which is pretty tiny in comparison to

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.720 
which is pretty tiny in comparison to
what<00:00:59.470> we're<00:00:59.650> going<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.829> be<00:00:59.920> putting<00:01:00.100> in<00:01:00.310> so

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
what we're going to be putting in so

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.400 
what we're going to be putting in so
sure<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.690> bike<00:01:01.810> will<00:01:01.960> definitely<00:01:02.290> appreciate

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
sure the bike will definitely appreciate

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.039 
sure the bike will definitely appreciate
a<00:01:02.650> little<00:01:02.770> more<00:01:02.860> airflow<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:04.180> make<00:01:04.600> use<00:01:04.780> of<00:01:04.809> our

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
a little more airflow to make use of our

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:11.160 
a little more airflow to make use of our
ejk<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.869> what<00:01:08.380> I'm<00:01:08.649> going<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:08.979> do<00:01:09.189> is<00:01:10.140> take<00:01:11.140> that

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
ejk so what I'm going to do is take that

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.770 
ejk so what I'm going to do is take that
bracket<00:01:11.830> off<00:01:11.950> set<00:01:12.550> this<00:01:12.729> in<00:01:12.970> there<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.360> trace

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
bracket off set this in there and trace

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.600 
bracket off set this in there and trace
it<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.020> cut<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.680> whole<00:01:14.800> bit<00:01:15.040> smaller<00:01:15.310> so<00:01:15.400> we

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
it and cut the whole bit smaller so we

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.420 
it and cut the whole bit smaller so we
can<00:01:15.729> just<00:01:15.970> pressure<00:01:16.210> fit<00:01:16.479> it<00:01:16.600> in<00:01:16.720> place<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.280> I'm

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
can just pressure fit it in place so I'm

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.010 
can just pressure fit it in place so I'm
likely<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.880> make<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.270> bit<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.540> a<00:01:19.600> mess<00:01:19.750> in<00:01:19.780> the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
likely to make a bit of a mess in the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.310 
likely to make a bit of a mess in the
airbox<00:01:20.290> so<00:01:20.560> I'm<00:01:20.650> going<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.630> pop<00:01:22.630> off<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:23.049> side

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
airbox so I'm going to pop off the side

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.620 
airbox so I'm going to pop off the side
panel<00:01:26.729> we're<00:01:27.729> gonna<00:01:27.850> keep<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.120> bottom<00:01:28.360> screw

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
panel we're gonna keep the bottom screw

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.590 
panel we're gonna keep the bottom screw
out

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.140 

get<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.720> off<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.290> near<00:01:34.830> boxes<00:01:35.400> I'm<00:01:35.640> probably

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
get that off up near boxes I'm probably

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.520 
get that off up near boxes I'm probably
gonna<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.510> some<00:01:36.630> plastic<00:01:36.990> shavings<00:01:37.380> will

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
gonna have some plastic shavings will

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.060 
gonna have some plastic shavings will
