00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
one really quick thing before the boss

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.909 
one really quick thing before the boss
fight<00:00:06.240> even<00:00:06.450> starts<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:07.290> don't<00:00:07.560> want<00:00:07.799> to

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
fight even starts is you don't want to

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.009 
fight even starts is you don't want to
jump<00:00:08.160> off<00:00:08.429> anywhere<00:00:09.120> but<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.480> exact<00:00:09.750> center

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
jump off anywhere but the exact center

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.570 
jump off anywhere but the exact center
because<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.410> can't<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.830> fact<00:00:11.040> die<00:00:11.309> from<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
because you can't in fact die from the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.770 
because you can't in fact die from the
following<00:00:11.820> damage<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.210> hitting<00:00:12.450> those<00:00:12.599> things

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
following damage of hitting those things

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.900 
following damage of hitting those things
on<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.960> side<00:00:13.340> you<00:00:14.340> can<00:00:14.460> see<00:00:14.490> me<00:00:14.670> putting<00:00:14.849> on

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
on the side you can see me putting on

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.250 
on the side you can see me putting on
the<00:00:15.000> magic<00:00:15.269> shield<00:00:15.450> spell<00:00:15.719> but<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.049> really

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
the magic shield spell but that really

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.200 
the magic shield spell but that really
isn't<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:17.070> factor<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.670> boss<00:00:17.820> fight<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.119> just

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
isn't a factor in this boss fight I just

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.590 
isn't a factor in this boss fight I just
wanted<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.600> try<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.779> out<00:00:19.100> so<00:00:20.270> really<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.510> most

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
wanted to try it out so really the most

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.450 
wanted to try it out so really the most
important<00:00:22.109> thing<00:00:22.199> about<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.470> boss<00:00:22.680> fight<00:00:22.920> is

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
important thing about this boss fight is

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.820 
important thing about this boss fight is
to<00:00:24.180> make<00:00:24.420> certain<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.779> get<00:00:24.930> really<00:00:25.289> close<00:00:25.500> at

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
to make certain to get really close at

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.650 
to make certain to get really close at
all<00:00:26.130> times<00:00:26.430> because<00:00:26.730> if<00:00:26.910> you're<00:00:27.029> really<00:00:27.119> close

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
all times because if you're really close

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.720 
all times because if you're really close
you<00:00:27.810> don't<00:00:28.170> take<00:00:28.529> much<00:00:29.010> damage<00:00:29.400> at<00:00:29.490> all<00:00:29.580> for

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
you don't take much damage at all for

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.589 
you don't take much damage at all for
them<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.880> see<00:00:30.029> that's<00:00:30.210> really<00:00:30.420> doing

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
them you see that's really doing

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.330 
them you see that's really doing
anything<00:00:30.840> if<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.439> even<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.859> little<00:00:31.890> bit

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
anything if I was even just a little bit

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.410 
anything if I was even just a little bit
further<00:00:32.579> out<00:00:32.669> they'd<00:00:32.940> be<00:00:33.000> hitting<00:00:33.270> me<00:00:33.360> with

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
further out they'd be hitting me with

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.970 
further out they'd be hitting me with
the<00:00:33.510> blade<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.899> sword<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.440> I'd<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.710> taking<00:00:34.950> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the blade that sword and I'd be taking a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.889 
the blade that sword and I'd be taking a
massive<00:00:35.219> amounts<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.579> damage<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:36.390> you're<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
massive amounts of damage if you're that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.180 
massive amounts of damage if you're that
closer<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.620> start<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.920> handing

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
closer you can just start to handing

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.180 
closer you can just start to handing
your<00:00:38.280> weapon<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.640> murdering<00:00:38.969> them<00:00:39.090> really

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
your weapon and murdering them really

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.590 
your weapon and murdering them really
the<00:00:41.190> grab<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.640> kind<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.090> irritating<00:00:42.239> it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the grab is kind of irritating it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.209 
the grab is kind of irritating it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
doesn't do a whole lot of damage but it

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.819 
doesn't do a whole lot of damage but it
will<00:00:44.370> delay<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.090> delays<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.530> fatal

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
will delay you and delays can be fatal

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.470

in<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.160> boss<00:00:47.340> fight<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.239> really

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
in this boss fight because it's really

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.920 
in this boss fight because it's really
just<00:00:48.600> sort<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> damage<00:00:49.800> rush<00:00:50.149> as<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.719> do

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
just sort of a damage rush as you do

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.990 
just sort of a damage rush as you do
enough<00:00:52.170> damage<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> four<00:00:53.699> kings

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
enough damage to one of the four kings

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.420 
enough damage to one of the four kings
they<00:00:54.539> will<00:00:54.660> disappear<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:56.070> want<00:00:56.250> them<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
they will disappear and you want them to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.650 
they will disappear and you want them to
keep<00:00:56.579> disappearing<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.390> don't

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
keep disappearing because if you don't

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.510 
keep disappearing because if you don't
make<00:00:58.020> them<00:00:58.140> disappear<00:00:58.379> very<00:00:58.800> quickly<00:00:58.949> then

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
disappears and I have a little bit of a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.690 
disappears and I have a little bit of a
breathing<00:01:04.500> room<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:04.650> before<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> fight<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
breathing room here before I fight the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490 
breathing room here before I fight the
next<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:05.970> actually<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> don't<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:07.080> much<00:01:07.350> of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
next one actually I don't have much of

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.080 
next one actually I don't have much of
one<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.760> even

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
one here and as you can see even

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.609 
one here and as you can see even
blocking<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.630> took<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.869> significant

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
blocking that I took a significant

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.530 
blocking that I took a significant
amount<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.860> damage<00:01:11.060> which<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.180> why<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> want<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
amount of damage which is why I want to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.149 
amount of damage which is why I want to
get<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.689> close<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> they're<00:01:13.619> not<00:01:13.830> even

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
get in close and they're not even

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.060 
get in close and they're not even
blocking<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:14.790> far<00:01:15.000> less<00:01:15.210> damage<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:19.070> it's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
blocking I take far less damage so it's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.740 
blocking I take far less damage so it's
really<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.850> dangerous<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.390> fight<00:01:21.570> until

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
really not that dangerous to fight until

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.830 
really not that dangerous to fight until
one<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:22.700> one-one<00:01:23.700> more<00:01:23.880> shows<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.570> starts

really really quickly now so you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.350 
really really quickly now so you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
health to survive their attacks and then

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.249 
health to survive their attacks and then
rush<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.579> them<00:01:44.790> as<00:01:44.909> fast<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.329> possible<00:01:45.390> try

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
rush in on them as fast as possible try

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.800

not<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.500> get<00:01:46.590> hit<00:01:46.710> by<00:01:46.740> their<00:01:46.979> magic<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.610> that's

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
not to get hit by their magic but that's

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.330 
not to get hit by their magic but that's
really<00:01:48.810> hard<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.590> homes<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.100> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
really hard to do because it homes for I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.649 
really hard to do because it homes for I
have<00:01:50.490> no<00:01:50.700> idea<00:01:51.000> how<00:01:51.119> long<00:01:51.270> actually<00:01:51.479> I've

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
have no idea how long actually I've

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.850 
have no idea how long actually I've
never<00:01:51.689> even<00:01:51.960> really<00:01:52.170> successfully<00:01:52.619> gotten

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
never even really successfully gotten

never even really successfully gotten
away<00:01:52.950> from<00:01:53.220> one<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.399> those<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:54.570> yeah<00:01:54.799> that's

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
away from one of those so yeah that's

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.039 
away from one of those so yeah that's
the<00:01:56.340> fight<00:01:56.579> that's<00:01:56.909> how<00:01:57.060> you'll<00:01:57.270> win<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.630> lose

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
the fight that's how you'll win or lose

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.289 
the fight that's how you'll win or lose
is<00:01:58.439> whether<00:01:59.189> or<00:01:59.280> not<00:01:59.340> you're<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.790> there<00:02:00.030> close

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
is whether or not you're up there close

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.819 
is whether or not you're up there close
enough<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:00.990> take<00:02:01.170> very<00:02:01.320> much<00:02:01.439> damage<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
enough to not take very much damage to

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.069 
enough to not take very much damage to
them<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.100> you're<00:02:03.000> attacking<00:02:03.270> animations<00:02:03.750> and

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
them and you're attacking animations and

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.319

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
then pushing you with their body and can

hi Romancing it's very simple learned

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.940 
hi Romancing it's very simple learned
from<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.780> very<00:02:15.930> first<00:02:16.110> Pyromancer<00:02:16.680> training

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950

from the very first Pyromancer training
you<00:02:17.010> save<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.850> started<00:02:18.120> doing<00:02:18.330> that

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
you save and I started doing that

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.030 
you save and I started doing that
because<00:02:18.750> multiple<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.440> them<00:02:19.530> were<00:02:19.650> appearing

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
because multiple of them were appearing

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.470 
because multiple of them were appearing
and<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.700> was<00:02:20.790> because<00:02:20.910> I've<00:02:21.090> been<00:02:21.180> delayed

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
and that was because I've been delayed

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.180 
and that was because I've been delayed
in<00:02:21.660> various<00:02:21.930> parts<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> fight<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.650> I

in various parts of the fight and I

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.350 
in various parts of the fight and I
didn't<00:02:23.400> want<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.580> start<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.240> know<00:02:24.270> I

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
didn't want to start and you know I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.940 
didn't want to start and you know I
didn't<00:02:24.720> want<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.900> die<00:02:25.200> because<00:02:25.800> they're<00:02:25.920> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
didn't want to die because they're a

didn't want to die because they're a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
whole bunch of them there you can see a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.000 
whole bunch of them there you can see a
charge<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.960> attack<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.260> doesn't<00:02:28.860> do<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.950> whole

lot of damage when you have iron flush

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.700 
lot of damage when you have iron flush
going<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.600> would<00:02:30.750> do<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> lot<00:02:30.990> more<00:02:31.170> if<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.530> didn't

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
going it would do a lot more if I didn't

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.050 
going it would do a lot more if I didn't

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
have iron flush going in which case you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.210 
have iron flush going in which case you
would<00:02:33.150> probably<00:02:33.180> want<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.570> block<00:02:33.810> it

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
would probably want to block it

possible sprinting towards the boss and
hopefully<00:02:45.060> getting<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.360> before<00:02:45.660> he<00:02:45.720> hits<00:02:45.930> you

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
hopefully getting in before he hits you

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.230 
hopefully getting in before he hits you
so<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.100> can<00:02:47.220> get<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.490> nice<00:02:47.670> sort<00:02:48.180> of

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
so that you can get to that nice sort of

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.310 
so that you can get to that nice sort of
sweet<00:02:48.300> spot<00:02:48.660> where<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.870> don't<00:02:49.020> take<00:02:49.140> very

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
sweet spot where you don't take very

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.520 
sweet spot where you don't take very
much<00:02:49.410> damage<00:02:50.630> that's<00:02:51.630> pretty<00:02:52.110> much<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.350> fight

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
much damage that's pretty much the fight

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.760 
much damage that's pretty much the fight
and<00:02:52.709> they<00:02:53.070> don't<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:53.340> much<00:02:53.490> besides<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:54.060> grab

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
and they don't do much besides to grab

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.000 
and they don't do much besides to grab
slicing<00:02:55.770> attacks<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:58.050> sort<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.590> throwing

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
slicing attacks and the sort of throwing

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.430 
slicing attacks and the sort of throwing
the<00:02:59.130> bolts<00:02:59.400> at<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.640> as<00:03:00.330> well<00:03:00.570> as<00:03:00.750> their<00:03:01.080> AoE

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
the bolts at you as well as their AoE

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.520 
the bolts at you as well as their AoE
attack<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.720> if<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.870> really<00:03:04.110> feel<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.290> it

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
attack and if you really feel like it

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.380 
attack and if you really feel like it
you<00:03:04.650> can<00:03:04.800> back<00:03:04.920> out<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> AoE<00:03:05.520> but<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:06.060> never

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
you can back out of the AoE but I never

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.880 
you can back out of the AoE but I never
did<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.780> because<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.140> was<00:03:07.260> more<00:03:07.590> concerned

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
did that because I was more concerned

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.080 
did that because I was more concerned
with<00:03:07.980> damaging<00:03:08.430> them<00:03:08.520> enough<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.790> get<00:03:08.910> them<00:03:09.030> to

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
with damaging them enough to get them to

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.850 
with damaging them enough to get them to
disappear<00:03:11.030> it<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.590> something<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.740> an

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
disappear it is something of an

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.880 
disappear it is something of an
endurance<00:03:14.130> fight<00:03:14.400> but<00:03:15.090> it's<00:03:15.270> also<00:03:15.590> more<00:03:16.590> so

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
endurance fight but it's also more so

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.930 
endurance fight but it's also more so
focused<00:03:17.310> on<00:03:17.400> your<00:03:17.580> damage-dealing

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
focused on your damage-dealing

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.290 
focused on your damage-dealing
capabilities<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.640> yeah<00:03:20.640> that's<00:03:21.030> pretty<00:03:21.180> much

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
capabilities and yeah that's pretty much

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.120 
capabilities and yeah that's pretty much
that<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.989> have<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.350> do<00:03:22.440> enough<00:03:22.620> damage<00:03:22.650> to

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
that you have to do enough damage to

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.860 
that you have to do enough damage to
kill<00:03:23.400> them<00:03:23.610> before<00:03:23.940> too<00:03:24.180> many<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.420> them<00:03:24.510> pop<00:03:24.690> up

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
kill them before too many of them pop up

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:34.460 
kill them before too many of them pop up
and<00:03:25.019> then<00:03:25.200> kill<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:31.250> basically<00:03:33.350> that's<00:03:34.350> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
and then kill you basically that's the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.080 
and then kill you basically that's the
fight<00:03:34.680> there's<00:03:35.160> not<00:03:35.519> much<00:03:35.670> more<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.880> say<00:03:36.000> I

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
fight there's not much more to say I

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.630 
fight there's not much more to say I
guess<00:03:36.500> it's<00:03:37.500> kind<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.800> neat<00:03:37.950> fight<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.519> know

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
guess it's kind of a neat fight you know

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.340 
guess it's kind of a neat fight you know
once<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.880> get<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.030> hang<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.330> if<00:03:40.050> you<00:03:40.200> don't

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
once you get the hang of it if you don't

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.780 
once you get the hang of it if you don't
do<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.590> right<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.980> could<00:03:41.130> very<00:03:41.310> easily<00:03:41.370> assume

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
do it right you could very easily assume

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.850 
do it right you could very easily assume
it's<00:03:41.940> sort<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.150> impossible<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.590> get<00:03:43.739> this

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
it's sort of impossible and you get this

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.259 
it's sort of impossible and you get this
cold<00:03:44.100> little<00:03:44.250> cinematic<00:03:44.820> after<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.120> kill

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
cold little cinematic after you kill

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.670 
cold little cinematic after you kill
them<00:03:45.390> because<00:03:45.870> they're<00:03:46.140> really<00:03:46.260> just<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.560> bunch

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
them because they're really just a bunch

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.310 
them because they're really just a bunch
of<00:03:46.769> jerks<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.820> there<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.660> go<00:03:48.750> that's<00:03:49.050> for

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
of jerks so there you go that's for

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.130 
of jerks so there you go that's for
Kings<00:03:49.560> good<00:03:49.980> luck
