Robbins<00:00:12.059> with<00:00:12.300> body<00:00:12.690> temple<00:00:13.049> system<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.620> I

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
Robbins with body temple system and I

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.910 
Robbins with body temple system and I
want<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.370> talk<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.880> guys<00:00:15.059> about<00:00:15.920> corpse

want to talk to you guys about corpse

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.050 
want to talk to you guys about corpse
and<00:00:17.720> specifically<00:00:18.720> low<00:00:19.529> carb<00:00:20.010> diets<00:00:20.520> because

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and specifically low carb diets because

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.929 
and specifically low carb diets because
I<00:00:21.630> feel<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.289> first<00:00:22.619> thing<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.400> anyone

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
I feel like the first thing that anyone

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.460 
I feel like the first thing that anyone
says<00:00:24.390> when<00:00:24.689> they're<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.080> want<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> lose

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
says when they're like I want to lose

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.939 
says when they're like I want to lose
fat<00:00:25.820> somebody<00:00:26.820> says<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.420> think<00:00:27.810> will<00:00:28.769> just

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
fat somebody says or you think will just

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
fat somebody says or you think will just
decrease<00:00:29.160> your<00:00:29.550> carbs<00:00:29.849> eat<00:00:30.330> less<00:00:30.510> carbs

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
decrease your carbs eat less carbs

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.720 
decrease your carbs eat less carbs
that's<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.800> because<00:00:32.250> cars<00:00:32.489> make<00:00:32.700> a

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
that's what you do because cars make a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.780 
that's what you do because cars make a
fat<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:34.440> actually<00:00:34.920> not<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> hundred

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
fat and it's actually not a hundred

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.670 
fat and it's actually not a hundred
percent<00:00:35.910> true

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
percent true

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.340 
percent true
so<00:00:38.040> first<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.120> really<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> low<00:00:39.930> carb<00:00:40.260> diet

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
so first what is really a low carb diet

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.130 
so first what is really a low carb diet
look<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:42.120> what<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.450> looks<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.780> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
look like so what that looks like is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.279 
look like so what that looks like is
having<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:44.129> carbohydrate<00:00:44.670> intake<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.600> less

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
having a carbohydrate intake of less

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.340 
having a carbohydrate intake of less
than<00:00:46.590> 50<00:00:46.980> grams<00:00:47.250> per<00:00:47.760> day<00:00:47.969> which<00:00:48.629> usually<00:00:48.989> ends

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
than 50 grams per day which usually ends

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
than 50 grams per day which usually ends
up<00:00:49.559> being<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.070> residual<00:00:50.550> carbohydrates

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
up being just residual carbohydrates

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.060 
up being just residual carbohydrates
from<00:00:51.860> vegetables<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:54.770> sometimes<00:00:55.770> different

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
from vegetables and sometimes different

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.610 
from vegetables and sometimes different
types<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.430> proteins<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.180> things<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
types of proteins and things like that

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.229 
types of proteins and things like that
so<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.489> actually<00:00:59.640> doing<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.120> your

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
so what is that actually doing to your

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.590 
so what is that actually doing to your
body

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
body

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.810 
body
well<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.440> putting<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:02.010> body<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.609> state

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
well it's putting your body in a state

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.560 
well it's putting your body in a state
of<00:01:03.059> dietary<00:01:03.809> ketosis<00:01:04.790> which<00:01:05.790> basically<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
of dietary ketosis which basically is a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.399 
of dietary ketosis which basically is a
fancy<00:01:06.630> way<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.409> talking<00:01:08.100> about<00:01:09.409> increasing

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
fancy way of talking about increasing

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.149 
fancy way of talking about increasing
the<00:01:11.010> level<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.640> ketones<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:13.170> our<00:01:13.650> body<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.070> our

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the level of ketones in our body in our

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.660 
the level of ketones in our body in our
blood<00:01:14.450> being<00:01:15.450> released<00:01:15.840> from<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> liver<00:01:16.670> but

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
blood being released from the liver but

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.980 
blood being released from the liver but
the<00:01:17.729> ketones<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.210> actually<00:01:18.570> doing<00:01:18.750> or

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the ketones are actually doing or

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.620 
the ketones are actually doing or
increasing<00:01:19.770> fat<00:01:20.400> lipolysis<00:01:20.850> which<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
increasing fat lipolysis which is the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.219 
increasing fat lipolysis which is the
breakdown<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.549> fat<00:01:23.549> cells<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:24.229> extracting

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
breakdown of fat cells or extracting

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.850 
breakdown of fat cells or extracting
again<00:01:25.890> those<00:01:26.299> fatty<00:01:27.299> acids<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.140> glucose<00:01:28.590> out

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
again those fatty acids and glucose out

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.700 
again those fatty acids and glucose out
of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.070> fat<00:01:29.250> cells<00:01:29.460> or<00:01:29.759> burning<00:01:30.090> fat<00:01:30.680> which<00:01:31.680> is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
of the fat cells or burning fat which is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.700 
of the fat cells or burning fat which is
why<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.070> does<00:01:32.460> work<00:01:32.909> however<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:34.380> lot<00:01:34.680> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
why it does work however a lot of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.069 
why it does work however a lot of
studies<00:01:35.070> are<00:01:35.280> showing<00:01:35.540> that<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.720> actually<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
studies are showing that it's actually a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.420 
studies are showing that it's actually a
very<00:01:37.280> short<00:01:38.280> term<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.509> may<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.960> even<00:01:40.170> be

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
very short term and it may not even be

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.649 
very short term and it may not even be
100%<00:01:41.430> connected<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.869> being<00:01:43.409> low-carb<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.659> so

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
100% connected to being low-carb as so

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.780 
100% connected to being low-carb as so
much<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.259> decreasing<00:01:46.920> your<00:01:47.100> total<00:01:47.460> calorie

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
much just decreasing your total calorie

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.660 
much just decreasing your total calorie
intake<00:01:48.140> eating<00:01:49.140> less<00:01:49.290> food<00:01:49.399> because<00:01:50.399> when<00:01:50.579> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
intake eating less food because when you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.030 
intake eating less food because when you
cut<00:01:50.880> out<00:01:50.909> carbohydrates<00:01:51.750> especially<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.860> our

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
cut out carbohydrates especially in our

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.580 
cut out carbohydrates especially in our
American<00:01:53.790> diets<00:01:54.119> you're<00:01:54.869> basically<00:01:55.530> just

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
American diets you're basically just

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.459 
American diets you're basically just
eating<00:01:56.040> vegetables<00:01:56.630> dense<00:01:57.630> proteins<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
eating vegetables dense proteins and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.789 
eating vegetables dense proteins and
fats<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.659> that<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.840> decrease<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.439> calorie

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
fats and that can decrease your calorie

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.219 
fats and that can decrease your calorie
intake<00:02:01.890> by<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> lot<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> lot<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.719> people<00:02:03.869> may

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
intake by a lot so a lot of people may

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.889 
intake by a lot so a lot of people may
actually<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.740> experiencing<00:02:05.399> weight<00:02:05.969> loss<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
actually be experiencing weight loss you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.719 
actually be experiencing weight loss you
know<00:02:07.020> right<00:02:07.229> off<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> bat<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.399> really

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
know right off the bat but it's really

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.720 
know right off the bat but it's really
just<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.239> decrease<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.660> calories<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.200> not

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
just a decrease in calories and not

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.550 
just a decrease in calories and not
decreasing<00:02:11.730> carbohydrates<00:02:12.450> because

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
decreasing carbohydrates because

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.840 
decreasing carbohydrates because
there's<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.860> lot<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.100> studies<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.400> show<00:02:14.520> in

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
there's a lot of studies that show in

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.780 
there's a lot of studies that show in
the<00:02:14.940> long<00:02:15.120> term<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:16.080> people<00:02:16.140> who<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:17.010> high

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the long term that people who do a high

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.240 
the long term that people who do a high
or<00:02:18.210> medium<00:02:18.780> carbohydrate<00:02:19.650> intake<00:02:19.950> diet

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.240 
or medium carbohydrate intake diet
compared<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> low<00:02:21.570> carbohydrate<00:02:21.950> diet<00:02:22.950> are

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
compared to a low carbohydrate diet are

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.990 
compared to a low carbohydrate diet are
actually<00:02:23.970> getting<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.390> same<00:02:24.420> results<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:26.000> so

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
actually getting the same results and so

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.640 
actually getting the same results and so
it<00:02:27.240> kind<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.480> makes<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.750> wonder<00:02:27.990> like<00:02:28.410> well

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
it kind of makes you wonder like well

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.800 
it kind of makes you wonder like well
what<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.980> heck<00:02:29.160> what<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> low<00:02:30.510> carb<00:02:30.720> diet

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
what the heck what is a low carb diet

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.090 
what the heck what is a low carb diet
then<00:02:31.260> doing<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.120> good<00:02:33.390> or<00:02:33.660> bad<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.830> we

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
then doing and is it good or bad so we

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.140 
then doing and is it good or bad so we
kind<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.400> talked<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.640> little<00:02:35.760> bit<00:02:35.970> about

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
kind of talked a little bit about

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.480 
kind of talked a little bit about
putting<00:02:36.930> your<00:02:37.050> body<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.320> ketosis<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.280> how

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
putting your body in ketosis and how

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.110 
putting your body in ketosis and how
that<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:39.030> increase<00:02:39.570> fat<00:02:40.080> lipolysis

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
that can increase fat lipolysis

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.610 
that can increase fat lipolysis
but<00:02:42.120> what<00:02:42.270> we<00:02:42.390> really<00:02:42.690> want<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.900> talk<00:02:43.080> about<00:02:43.140> is

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
but what we really want to talk about is

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.160 
but what we really want to talk about is
our<00:02:43.950> hormones<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.900> that's<00:02:45.900> what's<00:02:46.110> really

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
our hormones and that's what's really

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.010 
our hormones and that's what's really
being<00:02:46.680> affected<00:02:46.800> by<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> low<00:02:47.370> carb<00:02:47.640> diet<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.120> so

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
being affected by a low carb diet and so

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.150 
being affected by a low carb diet and so
first<00:02:49.620> we'll<00:02:50.040> talk<00:02:50.220> about<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:51.060> thyroid<00:02:52.160> which

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
first we'll talk about the thyroid which

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.370 
first we'll talk about the thyroid which
is<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.640> gland<00:02:53.850> in<00:02:54.000> our<00:02:54.120> body<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.390> releases<00:02:55.140> a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
is a gland in our body that releases a

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.350 
is a gland in our body that releases a
few<00:02:55.920> different<00:02:56.220> hormones<00:02:56.550> but<00:02:56.760> actually<00:02:57.239> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
few different hormones but actually the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.900 
few different hormones but actually the
most<00:02:57.510> prominent<00:02:58.320> hormone<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.100> our<00:02:59.190> body<00:02:59.250> one

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
most prominent hormone in our body one

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.870 
most prominent hormone in our body one
of<00:03:00.090> them<00:03:00.270> is<00:03:00.480> T<00:03:01.230> 3<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.709> T<00:03:01.800> 3<00:03:02.550> actually

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
of them is T 3 and T 3 actually

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.280 
of them is T 3 and T 3 actually
regulates<00:03:03.510> our<00:03:04.370> metabolism<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.540> how<00:03:06.540> we<00:03:07.050> burn

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
regulates our metabolism of how we burn

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.340 
regulates our metabolism of how we burn
calories<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.150> how<00:03:09.150> we<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.989> know<00:03:10.080> how<00:03:10.200> we're

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
calories and how we you know how we're

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.380 
calories and how we you know how we're
burning<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.770> churning<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.400> burning<00:03:11.940> fat<00:03:12.330> and

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
burning and churning and burning fat and

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.640 
burning and churning and burning fat and
burning<00:03:13.380> other<00:03:13.620> energy<00:03:14.370> substrates<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.750> t3<00:03:16.110> is

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
burning other energy substrates so t3 is

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.800 
burning other energy substrates so t3 is
a<00:03:16.709> really<00:03:17.459> good<00:03:17.610> thing<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.970> have<00:03:18.180> high<00:03:18.420> levels

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
a really good thing to have high levels

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.199 
a really good thing to have high levels
of<00:03:18.900> because<00:03:19.350> it's<00:03:19.739> making<00:03:20.640> our<00:03:20.700> metabolic

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
of because it's making our metabolic

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.660 
of because it's making our metabolic
rate<00:03:21.390> higher<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.709> what<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> low<00:03:23.280> carbohydrate

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
rate higher so what a low carbohydrate

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.289 
rate higher so what a low carbohydrate
diet<00:03:24.540> does<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.950> actually<00:03:26.310> decreases<00:03:26.700> your

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
diet does is it actually decreases your

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.680 
diet does is it actually decreases your
t3<00:03:27.840> significantly<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:29.670> as<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.360> can<00:03:30.480> imagine

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
t3 significantly so as you can imagine

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.199 
t3 significantly so as you can imagine
going<00:03:31.110> low-carb<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.250> going<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.760> hurt<00:03:33.030> your

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
going low-carb is going to hurt your

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.150 
going low-carb is going to hurt your
thyroid<00:03:33.660> function<00:03:33.769> because<00:03:34.769> it's<00:03:34.950> going<00:03:35.100> to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
thyroid function because it's going to

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.150 
thyroid function because it's going to
decrease<00:03:35.549> t3<00:03:36.120> which<00:03:37.080> also<00:03:37.440> ends<00:03:38.070> up

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
decrease t3 which also ends up

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.039 
decrease t3 which also ends up
increasing<00:03:38.670> reverse<00:03:39.120> t3<00:03:39.360> which<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.810> another

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
increasing reverse t3 which is another

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.170 
increasing reverse t3 which is another
hormone<00:03:40.370> that<00:03:41.370> also<00:03:42.470> regulates<00:03:43.470> our

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
hormone that also regulates our

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.650 
hormone that also regulates our
metabolism<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:45.360> in<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:46.110> reverse<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.829> so

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
metabolism but in the reverse and so

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.270 
metabolism but in the reverse and so
decreasing<00:03:48.660> t3<00:03:49.079> and<00:03:49.230> increasing<00:03:49.769> reverse<00:03:50.040> t3

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
decreasing t3 and increasing reverse t3

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.240 
decreasing t3 and increasing reverse t3
is<00:03:50.670> making<00:03:51.390> our<00:03:51.480> metabolism<00:03:52.049> slow<00:03:52.320> which<00:03:52.650> can

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
is making our metabolism slow which can

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.069 
is making our metabolism slow which can
have<00:03:53.400> long-term<00:03:53.670> effects<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.989> know

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
have long-term effects of you know

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.170 
have long-term effects of you know
destroying<00:03:55.530> our<00:03:55.650> thyroid<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:56.400> giving<00:03:57.030> us

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
destroying our thyroid and giving us

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.240 
destroying our thyroid and giving us
poor<00:03:57.540> thyroid<00:03:57.900> function<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.500> poor

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
poor thyroid function and poor

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.460 
poor thyroid function and poor
metabolism<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.090> people<00:04:00.930> will<00:04:01.079> put<00:04:01.290> weight

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
metabolism and people will put weight

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.949 
metabolism and people will put weight
back<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.890> because<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.519> that<00:04:02.640> or<00:04:02.850> they'll<00:04:03.239> stop

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
back on because of that or they'll stop

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.690 
back on because of that or they'll stop
seeing<00:04:04.320> results<00:04:04.530> because<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.549> low

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
seeing results because of a low

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.600 
seeing results because of a low
carbohydrate<00:04:06.299> diet<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:08.160> other<00:04:08.370> thing<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:09.380> the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
carbohydrate diet the other thing is the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.580 
carbohydrate diet the other thing is the
hypothalamus<00:04:11.610> okay<00:04:12.299> which<00:04:12.570> is<00:04:12.750> another<00:04:13.200> gland

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
hypothalamus okay which is another gland

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.670 
hypothalamus okay which is another gland
that<00:04:13.980> secretes<00:04:14.850> hormones<00:04:15.239> in<00:04:15.570> our<00:04:15.630> body<00:04:15.690> and

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
that secretes hormones in our body and

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.840 
that secretes hormones in our body and
specifically<00:04:17.370> sort<00:04:17.700> of<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:18.030> axis<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:19.850> the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
specifically sort of the axis the the

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.909 
specifically sort of the axis the the
inner<00:04:21.060> working<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:22.169> hypothalamus

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
inner working of the hypothalamus

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.750 
inner working of the hypothalamus
pituitary<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.419> adrenal<00:04:24.750> gland

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
pituitary and the adrenal gland

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.410 
pituitary and the adrenal gland
and<00:04:25.850> they<00:04:26.360> kind<00:04:26.600> of<00:04:26.660> create<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.310> HPA<00:04:28.310> axis<00:04:29.150> is

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
and they kind of create this HPA axis is

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.040 
and they kind of create this HPA axis is
what<00:04:29.570> it's<00:04:29.690> called

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
what it's called

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.610 
what it's called
and<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:31.490> basically<00:04:31.940> when<00:04:32.420> studies<00:04:33.410> have

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
and and basically when studies have

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.410 
and and basically when studies have
shown<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:33.890> when<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:35.000> have<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.210> low

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
shown that when you have a low

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.500 
shown that when you have a low
carbohydrate<00:04:36.020> diet<00:04:36.260> that<00:04:36.980> in<00:04:37.190> men<00:04:37.520> because<00:04:38.480> of

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
carbohydrate diet that in men because of

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.760 
carbohydrate diet that in men because of
this<00:04:39.080> HPA<00:04:39.740> axis<00:04:41.110> testosterone<00:04:42.110> goes<00:04:42.470> down

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
this HPA axis testosterone goes down

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.430 
this HPA axis testosterone goes down
like<00:04:42.950> crazy<00:04:43.250> okay<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.420> no<00:04:44.540> you<00:04:44.780> actually<00:04:44.990> both

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
like crazy okay and no you actually both

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.200 
like crazy okay and no you actually both
men<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:45.770> women<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.190> don't<00:04:46.460> want<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.940> Salzburg

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
men and women you don't want to Salzburg

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.240 
men and women you don't want to Salzburg
go<00:04:47.420> down<00:04:47.630> because<00:04:48.050> that<00:04:48.290> helps<00:04:48.740> regulate<00:04:49.100> your

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
go down because that helps regulate your

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
metabolism that helps keep lean tissue

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.620 
metabolism that helps keep lean tissue
on<00:04:51.950> your<00:04:51.980> body<00:04:52.280> which<00:04:52.850> having<00:04:53.300> more<00:04:53.450> lean

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
those great things and cortisol is

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.730 
those great things and cortisol is
actually<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.570> stress<00:05:02.840> hormone<00:05:03.230> so<00:05:03.470> when<00:05:03.650> we

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
actually the stress hormone so when we

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.340 
actually the stress hormone so when we
have<00:05:03.950> elevated<00:05:04.550> levels<00:05:04.880> of<00:05:05.000> cortisol<00:05:05.450> you're

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
have elevated levels of cortisol you're

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.720 
have elevated levels of cortisol you're
putting<00:05:06.890> your<00:05:07.010> body<00:05:07.040> in<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.430> heightened<00:05:07.700> state

go<00:05:15.230> on<00:05:15.260> red<00:05:15.650> alert<00:05:15.680> when<00:05:16.490> our<00:05:16.700> cortisol<00:05:17.090> goes

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
go on red alert when our cortisol goes

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.510 
go on red alert when our cortisol goes
up<00:05:17.540> and<00:05:17.720> so<00:05:18.170> we<00:05:18.500> don't<00:05:18.800> digest<00:05:18.980> food<00:05:19.370> like

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
up and so we don't digest food like

up and so we don't digest food like
we're<00:05:19.700> supposed<00:05:19.850> to<00:05:20.090> we<00:05:20.360> don't<00:05:20.510> synthesize

we're supposed to we don't synthesize

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.110 
we're supposed to we don't synthesize
nutrients<00:05:21.500> like<00:05:21.590> we're<00:05:21.740> supposed<00:05:22.070> to<00:05:22.160> your

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
nutrients like we're supposed to your

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.060 
nutrients like we're supposed to your
exercise<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:23.720> performance<00:05:24.590> starts<00:05:24.950> to

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
exercise and performance starts to

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.550 
exercise and performance starts to
diminish<00:05:25.220> you<00:05:26.180> have<00:05:26.330> poor<00:05:26.690> brain<00:05:27.020> function

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
diminish you have poor brain function

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.430 
diminish you have poor brain function
you<00:05:28.250> can't<00:05:28.520> focus<00:05:28.730> you<00:05:29.090> can't<00:05:29.330> sleep<00:05:29.570> I<00:05:29.810> mean<00:05:30.290> I

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
you can't focus you can't sleep I mean I

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.440 
you can't focus you can't sleep I mean I
could<00:05:30.680> go<00:05:30.800> on<00:05:30.950> and<00:05:31.130> on<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.340> on<00:05:31.400> about<00:05:31.580> why<00:05:31.910> high

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
could go on and on and on about why high

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.230 
could go on and on and on about why high
cortisol<00:05:32.870> is<00:05:33.110> bad<00:05:33.670> so<00:05:34.670> it's<00:05:34.820> increasing

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
cortisol is bad so it's increasing

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.720 
cortisol is bad so it's increasing
cortisol<00:05:35.720> and<00:05:36.500> then<00:05:36.680> your<00:05:36.920> insulin<00:05:37.400> levels

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
cortisol and then your insulin levels

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.630 
cortisol and then your insulin levels
are<00:05:37.850> going<00:05:38.000> down<00:05:38.150> which<00:05:38.900> can<00:05:39.800> be<00:05:39.980> really<00:05:40.490> bad

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
are going down which can be really bad

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.630 
are going down which can be really bad
too<00:05:40.910> because<00:05:41.440> insulin<00:05:42.440> actually<00:05:42.920> is<00:05:43.070> the

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
too because insulin actually is the

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.690 
too because insulin actually is the
hormone<00:05:44.030> of<00:05:44.060> say<00:05:44.480> shitty<00:05:44.890> when<00:05:45.890> insulin<00:05:46.370> comes

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
hormone of say shitty when insulin comes

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.670 
hormone of say shitty when insulin comes
up<00:05:46.940> we<00:05:47.240> feel<00:05:47.630> satiated<00:05:48.170> we<00:05:48.650> feel<00:05:48.830> full<00:05:49.130> one

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
up we feel satiated we feel full one

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.540 
up we feel satiated we feel full one
insulin<00:05:51.680> can<00:05:51.980> actually<00:05:52.220> be<00:05:52.280> a<00:05:52.310> good<00:05:52.490> thing

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
insulin can actually be a good thing

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.290 
insulin can actually be a good thing
insulin<00:05:53.030> is<00:05:53.150> not<00:05:53.330> what<00:05:53.630> causes<00:05:54.490> fat<00:05:55.490> so<00:05:56.240> that's

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
insulin is not what causes fat so that's

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.450 
insulin is not what causes fat so that's
kind<00:05:56.660> of<00:05:56.720> a<00:05:57.020> myth<00:05:57.440> that<00:05:57.800> we'll<00:05:58.010> have<00:05:58.160> to<00:05:58.280> talk

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
kind of a myth that we'll have to talk

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.530 
kind of a myth that we'll have to talk
about<00:05:58.490> another<00:05:58.970> time<00:05:59.180> with<00:06:00.140> women<00:06:00.620> also

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
about another time with women also

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.820 
about another time with women also
testosterone<00:06:02.540> going<00:06:02.780> down<00:06:02.960> cortisol<00:06:03.560> going

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
testosterone going down cortisol going

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.460 
testosterone going down cortisol going
on<00:06:03.980> but<00:06:04.730> also<00:06:05.060> progesterone<00:06:05.960> and<00:06:06.110> estrogen

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.760 
on but also progesterone and estrogen
are<00:06:06.980> going<00:06:07.220> down<00:06:07.400> which<00:06:08.090> those<00:06:08.750> things<00:06:08.990> would

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
are going down which those things would

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
are going down which those things would
be<00:06:09.890> bad<00:06:10.070> to<00:06:10.100> go<00:06:10.280> down<00:06:10.460> because<00:06:10.760> again

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
be bad to go down because again

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.230 
be bad to go down because again

a child which is what really your body
was<00:06:19.220> made<00:06:19.460> to<00:06:19.610> do<00:06:19.790> can't<00:06:20.510> do<00:06:20.630> that<00:06:20.780> anymore

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
was made to do can't do that anymore

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.260 
was made to do can't do that anymore
because<00:06:21.650> you<00:06:22.070> can't<00:06:22.340> have<00:06:22.520> a<00:06:22.730> normal<00:06:22.940> period

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
because you can't have a normal period

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.360 
because you can't have a normal period
and<00:06:23.600> your<00:06:24.260> menstrual<00:06:24.560> cycle<00:06:24.860> gets<00:06:24.950> thrown<00:06:25.190> off

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
and your menstrual cycle gets thrown off

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.240 
and your menstrual cycle gets thrown off
and<00:06:25.720> it<00:06:26.720> just<00:06:26.930> causes<00:06:27.110> a<00:06:27.350> cascade<00:06:27.560> of<00:06:28.040> other

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
and it just causes a cascade of other

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.720 
and it just causes a cascade of other
problems<00:06:28.550> that<00:06:28.850> come<00:06:29.000> with<00:06:29.030> that<00:06:29.440> so<00:06:30.730> the
