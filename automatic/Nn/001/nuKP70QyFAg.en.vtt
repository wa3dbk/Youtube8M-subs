mr. Goodwrench engine in it with the
micro<00:00:15.599> injector<00:00:16.020> heads<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.640> runs

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
micro injector heads on it so it runs

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:29.599 
micro injector heads on it so it runs
pretty<00:00:18.119> decent<00:00:19.160> we'll<00:00:21.320> do<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.529> here<00:00:28.609> there's

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
pretty decent we'll do it here there's

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:49.639 
pretty decent we'll do it here there's
no<00:00:29.820> exhaust<00:00:30.359> pipes<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.960> it

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:01.369 

as<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:53.040> measured<00:00:54.040> diesel<00:00:54.340> badges<00:00:54.730> on<00:00:54.910> it<00:00:57.540> for

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:15.840 

diesel<00:01:02.379> hood<00:01:02.680> ornament<00:01:05.280> very<00:01:06.280> stylish<00:01:14.850> this

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
diesel hood ornament very stylish this

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850 
diesel hood ornament very stylish this
is<00:01:16.090> out<00:01:16.300> of<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:17.790> basically<00:01:18.790> a<00:01:19.110> 1980<00:01:20.110> car<00:01:20.440> engine

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
is out of a basically a 1980 car engine

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.639 
is out of a basically a 1980 car engine
is<00:01:20.979> what<00:01:21.159> this<00:01:21.340> is<00:01:21.610> this<00:01:22.570> has<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.259> micro

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
is what this is this has the micro

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.600 
is what this is this has the micro
injectors<00:01:24.160> in<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.990> without<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.590> return<00:01:27.369> line

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
injectors in it without the return line

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.160 
injectors in it without the return line
so<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.060> makes<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.300> really<00:01:28.479> nice<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.810> change<00:01:28.990> the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
so it makes it really nice to change the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.330 
so it makes it really nice to change the
nozzle<00:01:29.350> versus<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.490> pencil<00:01:31.210> nozzles<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
nozzle versus the pencil nozzles the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.940 
nozzle versus the pencil nozzles the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
risers on the air cleaner did that on

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:48.480 
risers on the air cleaner did that on
these<00:01:41.490> few<00:01:42.490> little<00:01:42.700> engine

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.179 

take<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.520> quick<00:01:49.700> look<00:01:49.969> over<00:01:50.329> here<00:01:50.600> at<00:01:50.869> some<00:01:51.259> mock

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.169 

pencil<00:01:55.189> nozzles<00:01:55.969> and<00:01:56.289> the<00:01:57.289> micro<00:01:57.679> injector

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
pencil nozzles and the micro injector

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.209 
pencil nozzles and the micro injector
here<00:01:59.179> is<00:01:59.329> the<00:01:59.600> first<00:02:00.020> design<00:02:00.319> ultima<00:02:01.069> real

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
here is the first design ultima real

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.910 
here is the first design ultima real
diesel<00:02:01.549> model<00:02:01.969> here<00:02:02.179> is<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.420> second<00:02:03.020> design<00:02:03.469> and

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
diesel model here is a second design and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.370 
diesel model here is a second design and
then<00:02:04.579> we<00:02:04.670> have<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:04.819> 6.2<00:02:05.329> nozzle<00:02:05.840> next<00:02:06.109> to<00:02:06.200> that

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
then we have a 6.2 nozzle next to that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.400 
then we have a 6.2 nozzle next to that
so<00:02:07.569> something<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.720> keep<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:09.019> mind<00:02:09.049> when

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
so something to keep in mind when

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.280 
so something to keep in mind when
working<00:02:09.590> on<00:02:09.860> one<00:02:10.039> of<00:02:10.069> these<00:02:10.330> 350<00:02:11.330> diesel

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
working on one of these 350 diesel

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.910 
working on one of these 350 diesel
engines<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.780> oil<00:02:14.780> pump<00:02:14.989> drive<00:02:15.319> here<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
engines the oil pump drive here in the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.259 
engines the oil pump drive here in the
vacuum<00:02:16.280> pump<00:02:16.549> is<00:02:16.760> very<00:02:17.690> notorious<00:02:18.099> for

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
vacuum pump is very notorious for

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.930 
vacuum pump is very notorious for
stripping<00:02:20.269> out<00:02:20.799> there's<00:02:21.799> an<00:02:21.920> octagon<00:02:22.519> shaft

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
stripping out there's an octagon shaft

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.369 
stripping out there's an octagon shaft
and<00:02:23.360> something<00:02:23.629> you<00:02:23.690> want<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.900> check<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.349> make

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
and something you want to check to make

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.920 
and something you want to check to make
sure<00:02:24.849> it's<00:02:25.849> not<00:02:26.030> ready<00:02:26.299> to<00:02:26.420> strip<00:02:26.629> when<00:02:26.810> you're

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
sure it's not ready to strip when you're

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.619 
sure it's not ready to strip when you're
ready<00:02:27.079> to<00:02:27.170> go<00:02:27.260> on<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.379> little<00:02:27.799> road<00:02:28.010> trip<00:02:28.569> so<00:02:29.569> I

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
ready to go on a little road trip so I

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.300 
ready to go on a little road trip so I
could<00:02:29.780> really<00:02:29.930> spoil<00:02:30.230> your<00:02:30.410> day<00:02:30.590> but<00:02:31.099> that

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
could really spoil your day but that

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.819 
could really spoil your day but that
thing<00:02:31.870> gives<00:02:32.870> out<00:02:33.019> an<00:02:33.140> oil<00:02:33.319> light<00:02:33.470> comes<00:02:33.709> on

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
thing gives out an oil light comes on

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.640 
thing gives out an oil light comes on
that<00:02:34.099> would<00:02:34.220> be<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.400> main<00:02:34.549> reason<00:02:34.579> why<00:02:35.530> if<00:02:36.530> it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
that would be the main reason why if it

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.470 
that would be the main reason why if it
happens<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.129> can<00:02:37.400> pull<00:02:37.579> the<00:02:37.670> pump<00:02:37.849> out<00:02:38.090> and

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
happens you can pull the pump out and

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.300 
happens you can pull the pump out and
the<00:02:38.959> back<00:02:39.109> and<00:02:39.260> pump<00:02:39.410> out<00:02:39.590> turn<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.129> rod

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
the back and pump out turn the rod

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.610 
the back and pump out turn the rod
upside<00:02:40.790> down<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.269> put<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.510> back<00:02:41.660> in<00:02:41.959> in<00:02:42.290> the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
upside down and put it back in in the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.800 
upside down and put it back in in the
area<00:02:43.099> that<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.430> damaged<00:02:44.090> will<00:02:44.299> be<00:02:44.420> in<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.629> oil

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
area that is damaged will be in the oil

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.830 
area that is damaged will be in the oil
pump<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.319> it<00:02:45.379> won't<00:02:46.329> be<00:02:47.329> in<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.450> oil<00:02:47.510> pump

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
pump so it won't be in the oil pump

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.380 
pump so it won't be in the oil pump
drive<00:02:48.200> size<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.730> won't<00:02:49.910> have<00:02:50.060> an<00:02:50.239> issue

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
drive size so you won't have an issue

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.449 
drive size so you won't have an issue
the<00:02:50.660> issue<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:51.170> on<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.590> bottom<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.099> vacuum

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
the issue is on the bottom of the vacuum

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.160 
the issue is on the bottom of the vacuum
pump<00:02:52.639> is<00:02:52.819> where<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.120> strips<00:02:53.420> out<00:02:53.569> on<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.930> and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
pump is where it strips out on that and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.270 
pump is where it strips out on that and
not<00:02:54.410> in<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.650> oil<00:02:54.799> pump

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
not in the oil pump

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.920 
not in the oil pump
so<00:02:55.849> anyways<00:02:56.060> we'll<00:02:56.209> go<00:02:56.299> back<00:02:56.450> over<00:02:56.690> here<00:02:56.720> to

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
so anyways we'll go back over here to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:38.750 
so anyways we'll go back over here to
the<00:02:57.829> truck<00:02:58.099> and<00:02:58.340> we'll<00:02:58.519> start<00:02:58.849> it<00:02:59.000> up

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.110 

here<00:03:39.500> divide<00:03:40.500> pretty<00:03:40.830> well<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.640> most<00:03:41.849> of<00:03:42.030> his

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
here divide pretty well that most of his

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.390
