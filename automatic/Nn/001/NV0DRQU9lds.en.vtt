00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460 

so<00:00:00.570> here's<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.260> crashed<00:00:01.560> version<00:00:02.129> of<00:00:02.280> cinema

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:03.470 
so here's the crashed version of cinema

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.349 
so here's the crashed version of cinema
there<00:00:04.470> it<00:00:04.589> is<00:00:04.620> just<00:00:05.490> coming<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:05.970> end<00:00:06.060> of

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
there it is just coming to the end of

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.209 
there it is just coming to the end of
its<00:00:06.480> line<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:08.030> there's<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.570> beach<00:00:09.750> gone

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
its line and there's the beach gone

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.990 
its line and there's the beach gone
however<00:00:11.219> what<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.670> weird<00:00:12.030> thing<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.360> this

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
however what the weird thing is this

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.080 
however what the weird thing is this
it's<00:00:15.000> just<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.330> frozen<00:00:15.809> app<00:00:16.279> but<00:00:17.279> then<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.940> is

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
it's just a frozen app but then this is

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.929 
it's just a frozen app but then this is
the<00:00:18.119> same<00:00:18.449> app<00:00:19.640> I've<00:00:20.640> been<00:00:20.820> able<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.300> open<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
the same app I've been able to open it a

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.609 
the same app I've been able to open it a
different<00:00:23.939> bush<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.359> I've<00:00:25.019> run<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> simulation

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
different bush and I've run a simulation

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.919 
different bush and I've run a simulation
and<00:00:26.630> if<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.810> look<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> preview<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.689> can<00:00:30.689> show

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
and if we look at the preview I can show

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.049 
and if we look at the preview I can show
the<00:00:31.140> simulation<00:00:31.859> through<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:33.260> it's<00:00:34.260> working

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
the simulation through and it's working

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.650 
the simulation through and it's working
which<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.239> really<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.930> odd<00:00:37.370> um<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:39.480> let's

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
which is really really odd um and let's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.319 
which is really really odd um and let's
change<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.530> parameter<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:41.129> something<00:00:44.329> do

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
change a parameter or something do

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.600 
change a parameter or something do
something<00:00:45.390> down<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.899> rerun<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
something down here and then rerun the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.810 
something down here and then rerun the
fluid<00:00:50.610> sim<00:00:51.289> bang<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.680> goes<00:00:53.390> done<00:00:55.820> but

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
fluid sim bang there it goes done but

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.220 
fluid sim bang there it goes done but
what's<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.180> weird<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.629> what's<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.020> doing

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
what's really weird is what's this doing

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.299 
what's really weird is what's this doing
it<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:59.719> click<00:01:00.719> over<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.649> there's<00:01:02.010> no<00:01:02.129> way<00:01:02.280> I

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
it I click over it and there's no way I

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
it I click over it and there's no way I
can<00:01:02.430> get<00:01:02.730> rid<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.149> without<00:01:03.449> doing<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.960> hard

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
can get rid of this without doing a hard

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.330 
can get rid of this without doing a hard
reset<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.909> very<00:01:06.270> very<00:01:06.570> odd

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
reset so it's all very very odd

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.280 
reset so it's all very very odd
similarly<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> activity<00:01:08.939> monitor<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:12.290> have

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
similarly the activity monitor I have

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.890 
similarly the activity monitor I have
got<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.680> cinema<00:01:14.010> 4d<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> logo<00:01:15.630> that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
got a cinema 4d there with a logo that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.640 
got a cinema 4d there with a logo that
looks<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:18.210> then<00:01:19.080> I've<00:01:19.200> got<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.470> other

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
looks right and then I've got this other

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.880 
looks right and then I've got this other
one<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.479> which<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.600> sort<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.020> same<00:01:22.759> but<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.880> I

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
one here which is sort of same but if I

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.270 
one here which is sort of same but if I
sample<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> process

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.040 

this<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> process<00:01:32.940> of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.180> crashed<00:01:33.450> one

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.630 

it's<00:01:37.050> all<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.350> had<00:01:37.650> no<00:01:37.830> idea<00:01:37.860> what's<00:01:38.340> going

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it's all really had no idea what's going

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.150 
it's all really had no idea what's going
on<00:01:38.790> also<00:01:39.660> if<00:01:39.870> I<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.290> try<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.560> forth<00:01:40.860> quick

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
on also if I just try and forth quick

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.670 
on also if I just try and forth quick
this<00:01:42.920> done<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.190> won't<00:01:44.430> force<00:01:44.730> quit<00:01:45.050> in<00:01:46.050> fact<00:01:46.320> in

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
this done it won't force quit in fact in

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.160 
this done it won't force quit in fact in
the<00:01:47.010> force<00:01:47.220> quick<00:01:47.490> menu<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.090> don't<00:01:48.900> even<00:01:49.020> have

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the force quick menu I don't even have

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.870 
the force quick menu I don't even have
it<00:01:49.440> there<00:01:49.670> doesn't<00:01:50.670> even<00:01:50.790> appear<00:01:51.260> this<00:01:52.260> one<00:01:52.880> is

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
it there doesn't even appear this one is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.500 
it there doesn't even appear this one is
the<00:01:54.150> one<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.420> working<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:56.970> is<00:01:57.000> most

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
the one that's working so this is most

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.810 
the one that's working so this is most
perplexing
