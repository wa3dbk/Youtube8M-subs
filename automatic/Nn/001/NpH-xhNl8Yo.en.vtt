00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
that I didn't see coming because I was

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.890 
that I didn't see coming because I was
just<00:03:25.850> trying<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.060> hit<00:03:26.210> with<00:03:26.360> one<00:03:26.510> point<00:03:26.690> she

how's<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.400> mentality<00:03:28.790> within<00:03:29.000> yeah<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:29.990> was

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
how's the mentality within yeah that was

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.500 
how's the mentality within yeah that was
a<00:03:30.110> different<00:03:30.470> mentality<00:03:30.560> but<00:03:31.130> but<00:03:31.510> he

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
a different mentality but but he

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.730 
a different mentality but but he
probably<00:03:32.720> would<00:03:32.990> have<00:03:33.020> made<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.440> six<00:03:33.650> or

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
probably would have made in the six or

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.990 
probably would have made in the six or
seven<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.310> know<00:03:34.340> it's<00:03:34.550> a<00:03:34.640> little<00:03:34.880> above
