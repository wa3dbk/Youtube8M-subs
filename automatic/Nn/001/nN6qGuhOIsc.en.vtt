00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
both of they've added Google's two-step

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.330 
both of they've added Google's two-step
verification<00:02:05.659> process<00:02:06.770> where<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.190> have

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
verification process where if you have

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.910 
verification process where if you have
assigned<00:02:08.759> your<00:02:08.879> google<00:02:09.179> account<00:02:09.319> to<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> phone

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
assigned your google account to a phone

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.690 
assigned your google account to a phone
then

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
then

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.100 
then
you<00:02:12.060> will<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.480> two-step<00:02:12.959> verification

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
you will have a two-step verification

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.979 
you will have a two-step verification
that<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.830> have<00:02:14.160> on<00:02:14.340> Android<00:02:14.730> now<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> already

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
that you have on Android now I already

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.559 
that you have on Android now I already
did<00:02:16.230> see<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> try<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:17.010> iOS<00:02:17.430> 8.2<00:02:18.000> device<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.540> I

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
did see a try it on iOS 8.2 device and I

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.240 
did see a try it on iOS 8.2 device and I
already<00:02:18.870> saw<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.500> was<00:02:19.620> working<00:02:20.040> over

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
already saw that it was working over

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.650 
already saw that it was working over
there<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.819> looks<00:02:20.849> like<00:02:21.120> we<00:02:21.209> might<00:02:21.420> get<00:02:21.599> a

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
there it looks like we might get a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.809 
there it looks like we might get a
little<00:02:21.900> bit<00:02:22.050> higher<00:02:22.290> here<00:02:22.620> now<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.860> want<00:02:23.430> then

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
little bit higher here now I want then

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.210 
little bit higher here now I want then
what<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.599> been<00:02:24.780> saying<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.319> past<00:02:25.560> so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
what I have been saying in the past so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.530 
what I have been saying in the past so
let's<00:02:26.489> take<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.670> look<00:02:26.849> at<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:26.970> if<00:02:27.269> you<00:02:27.390> never

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
let's take a look at that if you never

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.229 
let's take a look at that if you never
seen<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.840> two-step<00:02:28.590> verification<00:02:29.239> process

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
seen that two-step verification process

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.740 
seen that two-step verification process
how<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.230> screen<00:02:31.950> looks<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.060> whether<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.569> is

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
how that screen looks so whether this is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.600 
how that screen looks so whether this is
how<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.019> screen<00:02:34.590> looks<00:02:34.890> if<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.370> have<00:02:35.580> a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
how the screen looks if you have a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.180 
how the screen looks if you have a
google<00:02:36.060> account<00:02:36.180> assigned<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.290> phone<00:02:37.530> you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
google account assigned to a phone you

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.210 
google account assigned to a phone you
need<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.519> enter<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.819> little<00:02:39.060> code<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:40.220> yeah

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
need to enter a little code so yeah

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.280 
need to enter a little code so yeah
that's<00:02:41.640> that's<00:02:42.090> use<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.629> little<00:02:42.900> thing<00:02:43.080> of

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
that's that's use that little thing of

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.170 
that's that's use that little thing of
there<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.680> did<00:02:43.830> see<00:02:44.099> some<00:02:44.640> benchmark

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
there so you did see some benchmark

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.300 
there so you did see some benchmark
scores<00:02:45.510> here<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.080> carplay<00:02:46.650> feature<00:02:46.890> that

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
scores here so carplay feature that

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.250 
scores here so carplay feature that
you'll<00:02:47.459> be<00:02:47.670> able<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.910> see<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.299> they're

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
you'll be able to see that they're

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.220 
you'll be able to see that they're
working<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.799> that<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:51.329> also<00:02:51.690> looks<00:02:52.019> like

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
working on that and it also looks like

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.430 
working on that and it also looks like
in<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:53.489> aramid<00:02:53.849> beta<00:02:54.120> lab<00:02:54.420> label<00:02:55.049> from<00:02:55.380> the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
in the aramid beta lab label from the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.059 
in the aramid beta lab label from the
iCloud<00:02:56.370> photo<00:02:56.940> library<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.410> don't<00:02:58.709> use<00:02:58.920> it

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
iCloud photo library so I don't use it

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.490 
iCloud photo library so I don't use it
at<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.370> moment<00:02:59.730> but<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.630> looks<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:00.930> they<00:03:01.470> are

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
at the moment but it looks like they are

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.660 
at the moment but it looks like they are
starting<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.190> finish<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.819> up<00:03:03.030> as<00:03:03.450> well<00:03:04.670> and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
starting to finish that up as well and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.539 
starting to finish that up as well and
that's<00:03:05.910> nice<00:03:06.269> once<00:03:06.959> upon<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.440> time<00:03:07.530> series<00:03:08.190> was

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
that's nice once upon a time series was

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.729 
that's nice once upon a time series was
in<00:03:08.849> in<00:03:09.120> beta<00:03:09.390> mode<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.079> that's<00:03:10.349> also<00:03:10.500> kind<00:03:10.709> of

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
in in beta mode so that's also kind of

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.770 
in in beta mode so that's also kind of
way<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.099> mean<00:03:11.489> there's<00:03:11.700> not<00:03:11.849> like<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.569> many

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
way I mean there's not like that many

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.770 
way I mean there's not like that many
revolutionary<00:03:13.620> things<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.060> new<00:03:15.420> here

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
revolutionary things that is new here

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.199 
revolutionary things that is new here
see<00:03:16.260> if<00:03:16.290> we<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.799> go<00:03:16.950> into<00:03:17.959> storage<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:21.060> mean

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
see if we can go into storage and I mean

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.800 
see if we can go into storage and I mean
I<00:03:21.359> do<00:03:21.420> have<00:03:21.690> apps<00:03:21.900> installed<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:23.299> you<00:03:24.299> probably

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
I do have apps installed so you probably

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.309 
I do have apps installed so you probably
might<00:03:25.139> not<00:03:25.380> see<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:26.480> difference<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:30.200> don't<00:03:31.200> want

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
might not see a difference I don't want

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.140 
might not see a difference I don't want
to<00:03:31.410> delete<00:03:31.620> all<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.069> apps<00:03:32.220> every<00:03:32.670> time<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:32.910> do<00:03:33.030> a

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
to delete all the apps every time I do a

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.050 
to delete all the apps every time I do a
video<00:03:33.859> but<00:03:34.859> let's<00:03:34.920> see<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.310> going<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.819> speed
