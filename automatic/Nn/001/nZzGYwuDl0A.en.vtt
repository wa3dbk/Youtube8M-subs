 the shock absorbers don't just give us a comfortable ride compensate

 without their action we will lose control of the car affect 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.230
 therefore, brake substance and stability are therefore a fundamental element for the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.230

 the oscillations of the wheel up piston within the death ita torrent that 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.809
 push out through once 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.280
 this is the kinetic energy and dampens the oscillations the mechanism yes 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.570
 realize the two coaxial cylinders of the shock absorber an external ring 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.809
 and an interior that praises the piston that the compression valve 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.830
 factory both cylinders are made from working steel 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.430
 re this profiler placed in a refrigerant bath and prevents the cutter 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.060
 that works inside it overheats while other cylindrical cutters 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.060
 they realize the external surface of the cylinder 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.100
 then a copper electrode welding machine melts the cylindrical seal when the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.680
 price from 5 meters and a half el shaddai profilatrice a heavy head battle 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.010
 according to the size of the shock absorber 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.040
 the same process to realize two coaxial cylinders only that the climate 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.680
 subjected to a further passage it is compressed at the end this serves 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.000
 to house the inner cylinder that contains more obvious 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.730
 vidmp3 the last step for the external cylinder is the press one 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.550
 internal matrix prints on a piece of a given word of manufacture of 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.790
 Many machine elements are made of especially metal powder 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.940
 really mixed graphite iron before a press involves dust in one 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.940
 mold with particles are merged into cameras 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.700
 the piece thus obtained is the valve in which the piston will push to the yogurt

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.959
 fully assembled valve closes the bottom of the inner cylinder 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.969

 photo prices are now on a conveyor belt with the part open towards 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.829
 up so that you can insert the inner cylinder into each one
