hi guys got a comment here from Eli leg
and<00:00:06.870> he<00:00:07.049> suggests<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.799> very<00:00:08.160> simple<00:00:08.700> flying

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
and he suggests a very simple flying

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.890 
and he suggests a very simple flying
machine<00:00:09.769> you<00:00:10.769> need<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> straw<00:00:11.809> preferably<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
machine you need a straw preferably a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.860 
machine you need a straw preferably a
thick<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.349> like<00:00:13.620> McDonald's<00:00:14.540> scotch<00:00:15.540> tape

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
thick one like McDonald's scotch tape

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.929 
thick one like McDonald's scotch tape
and<00:00:16.100> one<00:00:17.100> three<00:00:17.760> by<00:00:18.119> five<00:00:18.390> inch<00:00:18.720> note<00:00:19.170> card<00:00:19.939> cut

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and one three by five inch note card cut

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.210 
and one three by five inch note card cut
the<00:00:21.060> note<00:00:21.240> card<00:00:21.539> into<00:00:22.500> thirds<00:00:22.830> horizontally

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the note card into thirds horizontally

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.599 
the note card into thirds horizontally
so<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.210> three<00:00:24.449> long<00:00:24.660> strips<00:00:25.340> now<00:00:26.340> take

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
so you have three long strips now take

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.509 
so you have three long strips now take
two<00:00:26.880> strips<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.539> tape<00:00:28.019> each<00:00:28.199> end<00:00:28.500> together<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
two strips and tape each end together to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.510 
two strips and tape each end together to
form<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.849> circle<00:00:30.830> now<00:00:31.830> with<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> other<00:00:32.279> one

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
form a circle now with the other one

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.330 
form a circle now with the other one
take<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.480> ends<00:00:33.809> also<00:00:34.410> together<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.160> have

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
take the ends also together so you have

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.680 
take the ends also together so you have
a<00:00:35.760> large<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.690> small<00:00:36.770> circle<00:00:38.090> next<00:00:39.090> take<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
a large and a small circle next take the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.010 
a large and a small circle next take the
end<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.860> straw<00:00:41.190> inside<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.180> small<00:00:42.420> circle

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
end of the straw inside the small circle

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.680 
end of the straw inside the small circle
this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> front<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.879> now<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.660> same

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
this is the front and now do the same

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.380 
this is the front and now do the same
with<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> big<00:00:46.440> circle<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.120> should<00:00:48.239> look

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
with the big circle and it should look

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.319 
with the big circle and it should look
like<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.370> throw<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.239> will

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
like this and now throw it and it will

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.049 
like this and now throw it and it will
glide<00:00:51.649> you<00:00:52.649> may<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.100> adjust<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.610> circles

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
glide you may have to adjust the circles

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.229 
glide you may have to adjust the circles
if<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> flies<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.809> left<00:00:55.050> alright<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.489> I've

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
if it flies to the left alright so I've

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.750 
if it flies to the left alright so I've
got<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.420> bit<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.570> card<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:58.350> I'll<00:00:59.190> cut<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
got a bit of card here I'll cut it to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.049 
got a bit of card here I'll cut it to
the<00:00:59.789> right<00:00:59.910> size<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:01.699> I'm<00:01:02.699> sure<00:01:02.940> I've<00:01:03.030> got

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the right size and I'm sure I've got

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.509 
the right size and I'm sure I've got
some<00:01:03.180> straws<00:01:03.690> somewhere<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.979> we'll<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:05.430> we

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
some straws somewhere so we'll see if we

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.750 
some straws somewhere so we'll see if we
can<00:01:05.640> make<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.750> that's<00:01:09.960> our<00:01:10.200> three<00:01:11.159> by<00:01:11.430> five

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
can make it so that's our three by five

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:24.569 
can make it so that's our three by five
card

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:31.270 

that's<00:01:25.579> our<00:01:25.789> three<00:01:26.119> strips<00:01:29.409> all<00:01:30.409> right<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:30.770> need

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
that's our three strips all right I need

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:46.540 
that's our three strips all right I need
some<00:01:31.490> tape

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.600 

might<00:01:47.550> have<00:01:47.729> been<00:01:47.850> better<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.180> overlap<00:01:48.720> them

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
might have been better to overlap them

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:34.690 
might have been better to overlap them
it<00:01:50.610> makes<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.940> better<00:01:51.060> shape

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.949 

give<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.569> test<00:02:35.780> run<00:02:35.959> or<00:02:36.740> test<00:02:37.069> flight<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:38.780> the

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959

I'm sure with a bit of adjustment I

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:32.070 
I'm sure with a bit of adjustment I
could<00:03:07.730> make<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.030> fly<00:03:08.300> quite<00:03:08.569> well<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:14.390> flies
