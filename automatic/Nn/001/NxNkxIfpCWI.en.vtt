it's<00:04:19.810> got<00:04:20.049> removable<00:04:20.799> side<00:04:21.040> fences<00:04:21.640> that<00:04:22.050> let

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
it's got removable side fences that let

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.500 
it's got removable side fences that let
it<00:04:23.170> do<00:04:23.290> knife<00:04:23.530> edge<00:04:23.910> much<00:04:24.910> much<00:04:25.150> better<00:04:25.360> than

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
it do knife edge much much better than

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.730 
it do knife edge much much better than
it<00:04:25.660> will<00:04:25.900> without<00:04:26.140> them

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
it will without them

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.880 
it will without them
it's<00:04:27.160> got<00:04:27.550> turbulator<00:04:28.500> leading<00:04:29.500> edge<00:04:29.650> on

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
it's got turbulator leading edge on

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.580 
it's got turbulator leading edge on
upper<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.280> lower<00:04:30.550> surfaces<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.510> this<00:04:32.140> gives

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
upper and lower surfaces and this gives

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.580 
upper and lower surfaces and this gives
it<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.950> lower<00:04:33.760> stall<00:04:34.090> speed<00:04:34.450> lets<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:35.080> do

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
it a lower stall speed lets it do

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.340 
it a lower stall speed lets it do
Harriers<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.280> things<00:04:36.540> with<00:04:37.540> less<00:04:37.780> power<00:04:38.080> and

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
Harriers and things with less power and

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.950 
Harriers and things with less power and
a<00:04:38.440> more<00:04:38.800> stable<00:04:39.270> performance<00:04:40.270> than<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:40.780> would

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
a more stable performance than it would

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.530 
a more stable performance than it would
without<00:04:41.140> them<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:42.160> is<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.370> true<00:04:42.700> airfoil<00:04:43.210> shape

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
without them it is a true airfoil shape

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.080 
without them it is a true airfoil shape
wing<00:04:43.810> which<00:04:44.530> works<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.430> lot<00:04:45.550> better<00:04:45.820> than<00:04:46.030> a

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
wing which works a lot better than a

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.050 
wing which works a lot better than a
flat<00:04:46.360> plate<00:04:46.660> type<00:04:47.020> aeroplane<00:04:48.060> airfoil

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
flat plate type aeroplane airfoil

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.210 
flat plate type aeroplane airfoil
airplane<00:04:49.540> and<00:04:49.870> you<00:04:50.380> can<00:04:50.530> see<00:04:50.740> on<00:04:50.890> this<00:04:51.010> it's

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
airplane and you can see on this it's

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.740 
airplane and you can see on this it's
the<00:04:51.400> first<00:04:51.669> time<00:04:51.910> where<00:04:52.150> they've<00:04:52.360> hollowed

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
the first time where they've hollowed

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.350 
the first time where they've hollowed
out<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.290> structure<00:04:53.740> of<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.980> foam<00:04:54.250> both<00:04:55.150> to

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
out the structure of the foam both to

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.690 
out the structure of the foam both to
reduce<00:04:55.720> weight<00:04:56.050> and<00:04:56.260> to<00:04:56.830> reduce<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.160> moment

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
reduce weight and to reduce the moment

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.670 
reduce weight and to reduce the moment
of<00:04:57.760> inertia<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.419> makes<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.870> wingtip<00:04:59.320> slider

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
of inertia it makes the wingtip slider

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.300 
of inertia it makes the wingtip slider
so<00:05:00.400> it'll<00:05:00.850> stop<00:05:01.300> in<00:05:01.780> rolling<00:05:02.530> manoeuvres<00:05:03.070> more

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
so it'll stop in rolling manoeuvres more

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.210 
so it'll stop in rolling manoeuvres more
crisply<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.030> needs<00:05:04.810> less<00:05:04.930> aileron<00:05:05.620> input<00:05:06.040> to

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
crisply and needs less aileron input to

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.640 
crisply and needs less aileron input to
perform<00:05:06.640> those<00:05:06.850> maneuvers<00:05:07.380> little<00:05:08.380> bit<00:05:08.530> of

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
perform those maneuvers little bit of

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.800 
perform those maneuvers little bit of
carbon<00:05:08.919> bracing<00:05:09.550> on<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:09.790> tail<00:05:10.030> plane<00:05:10.330> has<00:05:10.600> let

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
carbon bracing on the tail plane has let

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.630 
carbon bracing on the tail plane has let
them<00:05:10.990> keep<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.470> rear<00:05:11.680> end<00:05:11.919> structure<00:05:12.370> very

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
them keep the rear end structure very

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.480 
them keep the rear end structure very
light<00:05:12.930> you<00:05:13.930> can<00:05:14.110> see<00:05:14.140> the<00:05:14.410> big<00:05:14.830> vertical

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
light you can see the big vertical

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.150 
light you can see the big vertical
surfaces<00:05:16.360> so<00:05:17.020> it's<00:05:17.169> going<00:05:17.350> to<00:05:17.440> do<00:05:17.560> really<00:05:17.590> nice

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
surfaces so it's going to do really nice

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.490 
surfaces so it's going to do really nice
knife<00:05:18.520> edge<00:05:18.790> and<00:05:18.970> maneuvers<00:05:19.450> couple<00:05:20.320> that

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
knife edge and maneuvers couple that

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.400 
knife edge and maneuvers couple that
with<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.830> as3x<00:05:21.790> electronics<00:05:22.720> the

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
with the as3x electronics the

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.040 
with the as3x electronics the
performance<00:05:23.979> will<00:05:24.220> be<00:05:24.370> fantastic<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.810> does

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
performance will be fantastic it does

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.290 
performance will be fantastic it does
include<00:05:26.410> a<00:05:26.560> new<00:05:27.510> 2's<00:05:28.510> 150-million<00:05:29.790> 45c<00:05:30.790> lipo

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
include a new 2's 150-million 45c lipo

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.750 
include a new 2's 150-million 45c lipo
so<00:05:31.930> this<00:05:32.110> combination<00:05:32.410> really<00:05:33.100> does<00:05:33.460> need<00:05:33.729> to

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
so this combination really does need to

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.810 
so this combination really does need to
have<00:05:34.090> power<00:05:34.560> available<00:05:35.560> on<00:05:35.770> tap<00:05:36.010> to<00:05:36.340> deliver

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
have power available on tap to deliver

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.420 
have power available on tap to deliver
its<00:05:37.030> best<00:05:37.300> performance<00:05:37.510> this<00:05:38.500> new<00:05:38.770> lipo<00:05:39.280> is

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
its best performance this new lipo is

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.690 
its best performance this new lipo is
going<00:05:39.640> to<00:05:39.700> do<00:05:39.820> exactly<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:41.190> so<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.370> is<00:05:42.460> gonna

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
going to do exactly that so it is gonna

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.150 
going to do exactly that so it is gonna
be<00:05:42.880> an<00:05:43.000> awesome<00:05:43.270> performer<00:05:44.169> we<00:05:44.650> look<00:05:44.860> forward

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
be an awesome performer we look forward

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.040 
be an awesome performer we look forward
to<00:05:45.310> getting<00:05:45.460> some<00:05:45.850> flight<00:05:46.150> testing<00:05:46.660> done<00:05:46.870> and
