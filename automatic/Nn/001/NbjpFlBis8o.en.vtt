need a mapping GPS and I'm going to show
you<00:00:47.539> how<00:00:47.840> I<00:00:48.109> use<00:00:48.469> a<00:00:49.420> custom<00:00:50.420> map<00:00:50.600> that<00:00:50.809> I've

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
you how I use a custom map that I've

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.380 
you how I use a custom map that I've
created<00:00:51.170> for<00:00:51.379> this<00:00:51.620> area

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
created for this area

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.549

my etrex GPS and my compass to figure
out<00:00:57.679> exactly<00:00:58.129> where<00:00:58.370> I<00:00:58.399> am<00:00:58.550> on<00:00:59.179> the<00:00:59.449> map<00:00:59.629> so

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
out exactly where I am on the map so

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.290 
out exactly where I am on the map so
this<00:01:01.429> is<00:01:01.550> going<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.730> be<00:01:01.789> just<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.999> real<00:01:02.149> quick

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
this is going to be just a real quick

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.410 
this is going to be just a real quick
tutorial<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.409> I'm<00:01:04.370> going<00:01:04.550> to<00:01:04.610> stop<00:01:05.300> the

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
tutorial and I'm going to stop the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.940 
tutorial and I'm going to stop the
camera<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.900> move<00:01:06.050> things<00:01:06.320> around<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:06.830> I

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
camera and move things around so that I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.590 
camera and move things around so that I
can<00:01:07.159> focus<00:01:07.340> in<00:01:07.640> on<00:01:07.730> the<00:01:07.850> map<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:08.210> show<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:08.420> how

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
can focus in on the map and show you how

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.290 
can focus in on the map and show you how
I<00:01:08.630> do<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:08.990> I'll<00:01:09.260> be<00:01:09.410> right<00:01:09.590> back<00:01:11.590> okay<00:01:12.590> got<00:01:13.040> the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
I do it I'll be right back okay got the

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.600 
I do it I'll be right back okay got the
got<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.380> flat<00:01:15.380> rock<00:01:15.590> set<00:01:15.890> up<00:01:15.980> here<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.160> can<00:01:16.370> put<00:01:16.490> my

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
got a flat rock set up here I can put my

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.950 
got a flat rock set up here I can put my
map<00:01:16.790> on<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.180> make<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.330> little<00:01:17.480> bit<00:01:17.630> easier<00:01:17.870> to

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
map on it to make a little bit easier to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.620 
map on it to make a little bit easier to
show<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:18.610> first<00:01:19.610> thing<00:01:19.820> we<00:01:19.940> want<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.210> do<00:01:20.360> is<00:01:20.510> we

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
show you first thing we want to do is we

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.960 
show you first thing we want to do is we
want<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.900> orient<00:01:21.380> our<00:01:21.560> map<00:01:21.800> so<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:22.430> north<00:01:22.730> on

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
want to orient our map so that north on

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.940 
want to orient our map so that north on
the<00:01:23.060> map<00:01:23.210> lines<00:01:23.690> up<00:01:23.990> with<00:01:24.110> north<00:01:24.470> in<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.740> world

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
the map lines up with north in the world

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.730 
the map lines up with north in the world
so<00:01:25.760> the<00:01:26.180> way<00:01:26.270> I'm<00:01:26.420> going<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.690> do<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.530> I'm

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
so the way I'm going to do that is I'm

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.430 
so the way I'm going to do that is I'm
going<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.920> set<00:01:28.160> my<00:01:28.310> compass<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:30.080> North<00:01:32.440> just

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
going to set my compass to North just

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.050 
going to set my compass to North just
like<00:01:33.620> that

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.430 

and<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:37.050> on<00:01:38.010> this<00:01:38.250> particular<00:01:38.430> map<00:01:42.440> this

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
and then on this particular map this

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.530 
and then on this particular map this
this<00:01:43.920> border<00:01:44.340> right<00:01:44.550> here<00:01:44.580> runs<00:01:45.090> north<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
this border right here runs north and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.210 
this border right here runs north and
south<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.080> I'm<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.350> I'm<00:01:46.650> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.979> line

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
south so I'm going to I'm going to line

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.920 
south so I'm going to I'm going to line
that<00:01:48.180> border<00:01:48.690> up<00:01:53.270> with<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.690> lines

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that border up with one of the lines

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.580 
that border up with one of the lines
that<00:01:55.380> runs<00:01:56.310> along<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.210> compass<00:01:57.720> there<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
that runs along the compass there and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.080 
that runs along the compass there and
then<00:01:58.920> I'm<00:01:59.010> just<00:01:59.040> going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.400> lay<00:01:59.550> it<00:01:59.580> down<00:01:59.729> flat

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
then I'm just going to lay it down flat

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.900 
then I'm just going to lay it down flat
on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> rock<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:02.369> I'm<00:02:02.550> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> rotate

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
on the rock here and I'm going to rotate

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:10.550 
on the rock here and I'm going to rotate
it<00:02:06.860> until<00:02:07.860> everything<00:02:09.020> lines<00:02:10.020> up<00:02:10.259> nice<00:02:10.530> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
it until everything lines up nice and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.820 
it until everything lines up nice and
straight<00:02:13.160> just<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:15.500> now<00:02:16.500> I'm<00:02:16.560> going<00:02:16.770> to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
straight just like that now I'm going to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.260 
straight just like that now I'm going to
move<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.250> I'm<00:02:17.430> going<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.580> move<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.880> camera<00:02:18.090> a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
move but I'm going to move the camera a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.180 
move but I'm going to move the camera a
second<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.810> get<00:02:18.959> everything<00:02:19.140> squared<00:02:19.380> up<00:02:19.800> so

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
second so I get everything squared up so

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.150 
second so I get everything squared up so
now<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.370> have<00:02:20.610> my<00:02:20.760> map<00:02:20.970> lined<00:02:21.360> up<00:02:21.630> with<00:02:22.500> north<00:02:22.980> on

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
now I have my map lined up with north on

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.180 
now I have my map lined up with north on
the<00:02:23.250> map<00:02:23.480> being<00:02:24.480> directly<00:02:25.380> in<00:02:25.770> line<00:02:25.830> with

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
the map being directly in line with

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.460 
the map being directly in line with
north<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.930> world

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
north in the world

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.060 
north in the world
I<00:02:28.500> have<00:02:29.459> lake<00:02:29.790> over<00:02:30.570> this<00:02:30.720> direction<00:02:31.380> which<00:02:31.920> is

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
I have lake over this direction which is

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.760 
I have lake over this direction which is
right<00:02:32.370> here<00:02:32.610> as<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.880> would<00:02:33.000> expect<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:34.590> hill

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
right here as I would expect the hill

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.460 
right here as I would expect the hill
rises<00:02:35.430> up<00:02:35.610> behind<00:02:36.450> me<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.840> direction<00:02:37.350> as

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
rises up behind me in this direction as

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.320 
rises up behind me in this direction as
I<00:02:37.590> would<00:02:37.739> expect<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:38.790> what<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:38.970> want<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.239> do

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
I would expect so now what I want to do

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.850 
I would expect so now what I want to do
is<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.540> want<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.750> pinpoint<00:02:39.989> my<00:02:40.440> location

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
is I want to pinpoint my location

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.310 
is I want to pinpoint my location
somewhere<00:02:41.790> I'm<00:02:42.150> somewhere<00:02:42.540> along<00:02:42.810> this

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
somewhere I'm somewhere along this

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.190 
somewhere I'm somewhere along this
shoreline<00:02:43.650> right<00:02:44.130> here<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.670> what<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.630> did<00:02:45.959> was

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
shoreline right here and what I did was

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.850 
shoreline right here and what I did was
at<00:02:46.440> home<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:47.070> set<00:02:47.310> up<00:02:47.340> three<00:02:47.730> arbitrary

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
at home I set up three arbitrary

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.830 
at home I set up three arbitrary
waypoints<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.130> named<00:02:50.340> them<00:02:50.519> LH<00:02:50.850> o<00:02:51.000> o1<00:02:51.209> la

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
waypoints and I named them LH o o1 la

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.289 
waypoints and I named them LH o o1 la
202<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.680> LH<00:02:52.890> oo<00:02:53.040> three<00:02:53.489> chose<00:02:54.120> them

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
202 and LH oo three chose them

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.289

I use LH since we're in long hunter this
was<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.220> first<00:03:02.430> one<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.610> created<00:03:02.970> second<00:03:03.390> one

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
was the first one I created second one

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.400 
was the first one I created second one
of<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.660> third<00:03:03.810> one<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.080> created<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:05.810> what<00:03:06.810> what

of the third one I created and what what

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.680 
of the third one I created and what what
I<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.890> when<00:03:08.400> I'm<00:03:08.519> in<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.670> new<00:03:08.880> area<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.570> I

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
haven't created any waypoints there yet

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.060 
haven't created any waypoints there yet

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
review it shows exactly how to do that

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.100 
review it shows exactly how to do that
so<00:03:35.130> anyway<00:03:35.400> I've<00:03:35.940> got<00:03:36.180> these<00:03:36.360> waypoints<00:03:36.570> here

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
so anyway I've got these waypoints here

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.030 
so anyway I've got these waypoints here
and<00:03:37.200> then<00:03:37.290> what<00:03:37.410> I'm<00:03:37.500> going<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.680> do<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:37.950> I'm

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
and then what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.740 
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.250> use<00:03:38.519> I'm<00:03:38.970> going<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.180> take<00:03:39.299> bearings

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
going to use I'm going to take bearings

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.630 
going to use I'm going to take bearings
to<00:03:39.900> each<00:03:39.959> of<00:03:40.110> those<00:03:40.170> waypoints<00:03:40.860> I'm<00:03:41.340> going<00:03:41.579> to

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
to each of those waypoints I'm going to

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.190 
to each of those waypoints I'm going to
basically<00:03:41.940> look<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.239> where<00:03:42.570> those<00:03:42.720> bearings

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
basically look for where those bearings

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.410 
basically look for where those bearings
cross<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.920> where<00:03:44.520> those<00:03:44.640> cross<00:03:45.000> that's

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
cross and where those cross that's

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.949 
cross and where those cross that's
that's<00:03:45.750> where<00:03:45.930> I'm<00:03:46.020> located<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.910> let's<00:03:48.750> take<00:03:48.930> a

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
that's where I'm located so let's take a

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:49.960 
that's where I'm located so let's take a
bearing<00:03:49.200> office<00:03:49.620> fer

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
bearing office fer

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.570 
bearing office fer
Waypoint<00:03:50.480> which<00:03:50.660> is<00:03:50.810> lhr<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.920> bearing<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.340> this

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
Waypoint which is lhr a bearing to this

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.720 
Waypoint which is lhr a bearing to this
first<00:03:52.790> Waypoint<00:03:53.030> which<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.630> LH<00:03:53.990> 0<00:03:54.170> 1<00:03:54.730> alright

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
first Waypoint which is LH 0 1 alright

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.570 
first Waypoint which is LH 0 1 alright
so<00:03:55.880> the<00:03:55.970> way<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.090> I'm<00:03:56.300> going<00:03:56.420> to<00:03:56.480> do<00:03:56.630> that<00:03:57.580> is

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
so the way that I'm going to do that is

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.210 
so the way that I'm going to do that is
I'm<00:03:58.790> going<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.000> on<00:03:59.210> my<00:03:59.690> GPS<00:04:00.650> here<00:04:00.980> I'm<00:04:01.040> going<00:04:01.130> to

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
I'm going to on my GPS here I'm going to

I'm<00:05:22.830> going<00:05:23.070> to<00:05:23.130> draw<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.640> line<00:05:27.050> right<00:05:28.050> through

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
I'm going to draw a line right through

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.290 
I'm going to draw a line right through
there<00:05:28.440> like<00:05:28.620> that<00:05:28.890> okay<00:05:31.760> now<00:05:32.760> what<00:05:32.940> I<00:05:32.970> need<00:05:33.180> is

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
there like that okay now what I need is

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.900 
there like that okay now what I need is
one<00:05:33.330> other<00:05:33.690> bearing<00:05:34.200> and<00:05:34.670> see<00:05:35.670> where<00:05:35.790> that

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
one other bearing and see where that

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.210 
one other bearing and see where that
crosses<00:05:36.480> my<00:05:36.690> first<00:05:36.990> line<00:05:37.290> and<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:37.950> will<00:05:38.040> tell

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
crosses my first line and that will tell

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.880 
crosses my first line and that will tell
me<00:05:38.340> exactly<00:05:38.430> where<00:05:38.880> I<00:05:38.910> am<00:05:39.530> so<00:05:40.530> what<00:05:40.590> I'm<00:05:40.740> going

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
me exactly where I am so what I'm going

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.350 
me exactly where I am so what I'm going
to<00:05:40.920> do<00:05:41.130> is<00:05:41.310> I'm<00:05:41.460> going<00:05:41.640> to<00:05:41.700> choose<00:05:44.360> again

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
to do is I'm going to choose again

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:52.520 
to do is I'm going to choose again
nearest<00:05:46.820> and<00:05:48.380> then<00:05:49.380> I'm<00:05:49.530> going<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:49.890> use<00:05:50.730> LH<00:05:51.720> 0<00:05:51.960> 3

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
nearest and then I'm going to use LH 0 3

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.680 
nearest and then I'm going to use LH 0 3
since<00:05:52.830> that's<00:05:53.010> kind<00:05:53.190> of<00:05:53.220> crossways<00:05:53.880> to<00:05:54.600> the

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
since that's kind of crossways to the

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.100 
since that's kind of crossways to the
line<00:05:54.870> that<00:05:55.050> I<00:05:55.110> just<00:05:55.140> drew<00:05:55.380> I'm<00:05:55.770> select<00:05:56.220> that<00:05:57.110> go

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
line that I just drew I'm select that go

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.460 
line that I just drew I'm select that go
to<00:05:58.820> make<00:05:59.820> gives<00:06:00.000> me<00:06:00.120> a<00:06:00.150> bearing<00:06:00.540> of<00:06:00.630> 148

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
to make gives me a bearing of 148

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.960 
to make gives me a bearing of 148
degrees<00:06:01.620> there<00:06:03.410> so<00:06:04.410> I'll<00:06:04.530> set<00:06:04.800> 148<00:06:05.490> degrees<00:06:05.610> on

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
degrees there so I'll set 148 degrees on

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:24.230 
degrees there so I'll set 148 degrees on
my<00:06:06.090> compass

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.629 

draw<00:06:25.240> a<00:06:25.270> line<00:06:25.570> there<00:06:25.870> and<00:06:26.220> it's<00:06:27.220> hard<00:06:27.400> to<00:06:27.460> see

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
draw a line there and it's hard to see

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:28.830 
draw a line there and it's hard to see
where<00:06:27.760> those<00:06:27.880> lines<00:06:28.150> drew<00:06:28.600> because<00:06:28.720> they

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
where those lines drew because they

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.659 
where those lines drew because they
didn't<00:06:29.080> draw<00:06:29.229> my<00:06:29.530> Maps<00:06:29.919> kind<00:06:30.220> of<00:06:30.280> gotten<00:06:30.490> wet

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
didn't draw my Maps kind of gotten wet

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.550 
didn't draw my Maps kind of gotten wet
