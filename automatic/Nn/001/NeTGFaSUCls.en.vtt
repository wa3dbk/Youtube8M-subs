00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:09.210
 tutorial we will see how to install then 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.550
 stephen we have it here and x-raid the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.480
 two go from the fifa where without last 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.699
 version and well the x raid in the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.320
 only version that there is for the 1.8 voucher and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.689
 let's start to start tv the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.050
 heights eliminates description would take us 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.170
 to the x ray applies to version 1.8 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:35.160
 and here you give it to download and now 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.640
 would start the download worth the stores 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.640
 Wherever you want 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.489
 it's worth the next would be of the fine already 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.710
 it was for 1.8 so only 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.470
 you have to come here and go to 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.720
 boxes of 1.8 and vice seeking the 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.680
 most recent version in this case to this 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.440
 from here then you give them here pain and 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.250
 will take to this tab you give here 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.070
 download to find 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.920
 to win the same thing that he has to 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.270
 ask where you think to save them or 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.359
 it has established a what they have 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.890
 save it for nothing 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:15.530
 will stop all files is very easy to 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.219
 install good I'll start with the end 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.560
 of the jce double click and wait for it to 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:25.100
 start here you go to the option of 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.750
 install that install and it's already 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.539
 it would be eye installer takes a little 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.729
 more what happens that I already have 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.060
 installed ok you can leave this part 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:39.549
 and now the x raid do the same thing you give 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.549
 double click and wait for it to start 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.479
 ok it would be that the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.479
 eyelash 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.120
 and here or going to say the versions that 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.360
 there is one in the version that manages to install 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.430
 ok and as you want it to be called it has 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.850
 to be called that that 1.8 then it 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.180
 call 1.8 bar x raid let's go 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.180
 upload 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.550
 and if you give here logically it's not going to 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.210
 appear no more because they know that 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.620
 will be 1.8 but I do not know if I also 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.470
 will serve for later versions 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.990
 worth as for 1.8 point 1 I do not know if 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.790
 it will work as you want it to 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.880
 call and put that raye well and you must to 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.390
 incite 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.670
 here you are going to give accept and already 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.950
 I would be installing what he tells you since 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.350
 have no initiate can be launcher of 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.540
 mike and this is going to work as much as 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.460
 for premium users as for users 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.750
 I do not project without it would be the same 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.750
 wait for it to settle 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.069
 and there is no one accepts and these files 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.550
 they are no longer useful, it will not be necessary anymore 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.440
 and now let's start michaels 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.780
 me as you can see here I have two 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.100
 versions the pirated version and the version 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.340
 authentic and in this case like 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.230
 surely what most travel 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.660
 will be what you have in premium baker 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.210
 you can start that you believe and in this case 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.270
 start this I'll show you how to 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:16.080
 put for minecraft to go a little more 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.050
 fast and do not need to be anything 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.860
 let's wait for it to be installed 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.860
 closing this 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.660
 well here you can see that it is the last 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.190
 breathe taba you put as you want 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.190
 they called there 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.710
 that play does not matter 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.170
 as you call it, and here automatically 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.950
 Well, that's going to look like the last one 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.900
 that has installed is optimal or is the x 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.530
 re my case has been the x raid we are going to 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.240
 edith so she can teach 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.210
 OK 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.420
 since it's here it's also worth it if 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.230
 you want to play the versions at 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.240
 sales 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.060
 here you have vale 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.670
 here it appears to me I have two because I already 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.450
 you have it installed and when you have it 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.940
 installed then I get double voucher here 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.790
 we are here is very installed voucher x 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.790
 raid tutorial source damos e isabÃ¡ 6 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.510
 well and here it would also be charged 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:33.250
 can give you here directly and fix 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.250
 here so you can see better 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.149
 and now let's go with the of titans and 

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:42.610
 as you can see this is the version that 

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:46.770
 I have an entrance ticket and it is in 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:50.379
 we have done what the hd 4 to 4 that says 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.909
 because before we have to give him we would arrive 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:55.779
 to which is put here as you can see already 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:58.770
 I'm here and isa profile saveh and so on and 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:02.409
 I would be already fully installed 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.749
 remember that these two can not be 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.339
 put together for now the compatible x rain 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:08.409
 with stephen ross 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:10.929
 maybe I'll leave you another video worth 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.389
 personally in which I forced by 

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:16.060
 how to have the two together since 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:19.480
 possibly from now on it can be 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.600
 Now I'm going to say how it would be installed 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.910
 if any case that there is uninstall it 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.810
 you can press the symbol on the keyboard 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:33.130
 of windows and the r key and it will come out 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:38.800
 this and here you are going to put percent to 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:40.240
 pepe data percent is accept and already 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.470
 I would take this page 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.160
 ok it 's before you can federal 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.080
 for it is here for it or else 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.030
 we can put it here or the 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.680
 folder is called roaming as a company 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:56.449
 here you go to the point folder minecraft 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.449
 and here I go to the version 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.910
 and in version it may seem to all 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.009
 versions that you have 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.729
 I'm erasing some of you here 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:09.520
 but here I have the Stephen team that 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.349
 have to pay 1.7 points that I think 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.289
 I did not make any video to comment on it but 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:17.259
 well it's okay to remove forget 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.569
 it takes for some stolen mods like 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:22.120
 the active there are nine of that ray no longer 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.990
 it takes 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.460
 to see how it looks what we 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.560
 here we have is and is closed 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.610
 I'm going to erase this tutorial time already 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.860
 I have this and well, I do not want it 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.690
 I'm going to upload 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.820
 and a half calculates new since I was 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.610
 updated that the one that I have here 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.370
 you see is the one of steel to the one of I do not know well 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.760
 how would it be and this is a 4 as we erase 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.760
 is 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.300
 and then we only have these two and 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.150
 here you can also erase any 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.650
 version that you have because logically 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.480
 with themes more space will occupy 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.430
 more embroidery and so therefore served 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.400
 a cleaning is worth erase the old one and 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:09.180
 ready 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.759
 well that's how the x-ray is installed 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:15.000
 soft and fine this has been everything since you are me 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:17.100
 he liked to give like commented if 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.480
 you have any doubt if you think that some 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.690
 tutorial 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.220
 and share it with friends and if you have 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.530
 liked 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:29.940
 and well here is going to say since I 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:32.760
 they put the comments on making a 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.910
 I'm going to make a video of how to put skin 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:40.510
 in pirate minecraft and I'm going to do it 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:44.320
 Well, well, I'm going to take it out shortly 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:47.200
 and I tell you how to get it as 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.290
 I will independently remove it first to 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.120
 explain the way to the pirate and already 

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.860
 he can possibly draw the prize but 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:08:00.039
 I do the first one is very easy 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:00.039
 and with this I say goodbye and even another goodbye
