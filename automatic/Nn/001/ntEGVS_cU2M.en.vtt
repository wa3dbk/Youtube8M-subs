today<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.390> things<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.780> intrigues

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
today one of the things that intrigues

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.650 
today one of the things that intrigues
me<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> most<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.160> speed<00:00:38.460> shooting<00:00:38.940> well<00:00:39.510> I'm

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
me the most is speed shooting well I'm

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.260 
me the most is speed shooting well I'm
thinking<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.350> if<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.680> put<00:00:40.980> seven<00:00:41.520> targets<00:00:41.760> up

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
thinking that if we put seven targets up

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.510 
thinking that if we put seven targets up
in<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> air<00:00:42.780> each<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.350> us<00:00:43.500> that'll<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> stack

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
in the air each of us that'll be a stack

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.299 
in the air each of us that'll be a stack
of<00:00:44.550> 14<00:00:45.510> targets<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.710> smoke<00:00:46.739> in

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
of 14 targets going up in smoke in

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.729 
of 14 targets going up in smoke in
probably<00:00:47.940> less<00:00:48.120> than<00:00:48.180> two<00:00:48.510> seconds<00:00:49.020> sounds

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
probably less than two seconds sounds

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.110 
probably less than two seconds sounds
pretty<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:50.100> won't<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.430> give<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.700> track<00:00:50.910> all

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
pretty good won't we give it a track all

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.660 
pretty good won't we give it a track all
