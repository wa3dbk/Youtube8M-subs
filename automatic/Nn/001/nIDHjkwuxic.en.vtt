00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
good i'm going to put a little bit of

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.270 
good i'm going to put a little bit of
Mishima<00:01:25.680> oil<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.500> since<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> light<00:01:29.040> oil

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
Mishima oil on it since it's a light oil

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.469 
Mishima oil on it since it's a light oil
whatever<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.509> don't<00:01:31.110> know<00:01:31.380> how<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.450> see<00:01:33.450> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
whatever I don't know how to see I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.179 
whatever I don't know how to see I
should<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.930> curled<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.439> down<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.890> other<00:01:35.070> way

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
should have curled it down the other way

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.490 
should have curled it down the other way
because<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.090> curl<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.659> going<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.229> way

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
because now this curl is going this way

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.990 
because now this curl is going this way
but<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> separate<00:01:39.150> them<00:01:39.329> sure<00:01:39.780> it'll<00:01:40.259> be

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
but when I separate them sure it'll be

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.929 
but when I separate them sure it'll be
better<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.390> i<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.290> i<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.649> i'm<00:01:43.939> some

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
better but i like it i think i'm some

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.960 
better but i like it i think i'm some
parts<00:01:45.329> here's<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> little<00:01:46.560> bit

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
parts here's to a little bit

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.810 
parts here's to a little bit
research<00:01:47.630> into<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:49.130> sometimes<00:01:49.430> I<00:01:49.760> don't

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
research into it and sometimes I don't

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.890 
research into it and sometimes I don't
know<00:01:50.030> which<00:01:50.210> way<00:01:50.480> to<00:01:50.680> unroll<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:51.740> but<00:01:53.800> you<00:01:54.800> see

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
know which way to unroll it but you see

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.540 
know which way to unroll it but you see
so<00:01:56.900> far<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:57.380> good<00:01:57.410> I'll<00:01:57.770> keep<00:01:57.980> trying<00:01:58.250> these

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
so far so good I'll keep trying these

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.430 
so far so good I'll keep trying these
roller<00:01:58.880> sets<00:01:59.210> until<00:01:59.540> I<00:01:59.630> get<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.960> hang<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.290> it

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
roller sets until I get the hang of it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.350 
roller sets until I get the hang of it
but<00:02:00.980> I<00:02:01.070> think<00:02:01.280> that's<00:02:01.520> really<00:02:01.820> what<00:02:02.060> it's<00:02:02.210> all

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
but I think that's really what it's all

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.740 
but I think that's really what it's all
about<00:02:02.420> was<00:02:03.170> trying<00:02:03.590> things<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:05.420> front

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
about was trying things and the front

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.160 
about was trying things and the front
seems<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.410> be<00:02:06.680> still<00:02:07.010> damp<00:02:07.390> but<00:02:08.390> trying<00:02:08.810> things

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
seems to be still damp but trying things

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.450 
seems to be still damp but trying things
and<00:02:10.150> continuing<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.360> do<00:02:11.540> them<00:02:11.780> until<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:13.190> have

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
and continuing to do them until you have

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:22.440 
and continuing to do them until you have
mastered<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:15.100> stuff<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.230> i<00:02:19.420> think<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:22.340> is

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
mastered that stuff so i think it is

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.750 
mastered that stuff so i think it is
successful<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.630> time<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:27.410> this<00:02:27.470> was<00:02:28.220> Donald

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
successful this time and this was Donald

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.630 
successful this time and this was Donald
freshly<00:02:29.330> washed<00:02:29.570> hair<00:02:30.160> right<00:02:31.160> after<00:02:31.370> I

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
freshly washed hair right after I

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.800 
freshly washed hair right after I
watched<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.330> i<00:02:32.450> smoothed<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.110> out<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.810> this

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
watched it i smoothed it out and this

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.570 
watched it i smoothed it out and this
one's<00:02:36.050> gone<00:02:36.320> every<00:02:36.740> which<00:02:36.950> way<00:02:36.980> I'm<00:02:37.459> gonna

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
one's gone every which way I'm gonna

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.190 
one's gone every which way I'm gonna
have<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.880> separate<00:02:38.270> them<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:38.570> they<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:39.020> go

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
have to separate them so they can go

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.190 
have to separate them so they can go
down<00:02:39.520> but<00:02:40.520> um<00:02:40.820> yeah<00:02:41.720> that's<00:02:42.020> how<00:02:42.170> they're

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
down but um yeah that's how they're

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.640 
down but um yeah that's how they're
looking<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.310> little<00:02:43.940> tight<00:02:44.510> but<00:02:44.900> hopefully

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
looking a little tight but hopefully

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.100 
looking a little tight but hopefully
after<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.459> separate<00:02:47.120> them<00:02:47.330> we'll<00:02:47.959> have

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
after I separate them we'll have

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.130 
after I separate them we'll have
something<00:02:48.440> going<00:02:48.740> on<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:50.000> was<00:02:50.360> my<00:02:50.600> result

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
something going on so this was my result

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.080 
something going on so this was my result
it<00:02:51.830> looked<00:02:52.100> like<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.459> came<00:02:52.700> out<00:02:52.730> pretty

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
it looked like you came out pretty

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.040 
it looked like you came out pretty
straight<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:55.370> could<00:02:55.580> try<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.120> get<00:02:56.390> closer<00:02:56.750> to

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
straight you could try to get closer to

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:05.710 
straight you could try to get closer to
show<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:58.690> cool<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:04.190> I'm<00:03:04.459> gonna<00:03:04.730> separate<00:03:05.420> them

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
show you cool so I'm gonna separate them

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.330 
show you cool so I'm gonna separate them
and<00:03:05.750> fix<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.410> all<00:03:06.530> up<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.890> come<00:03:07.130> back<00:03:07.160> in

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
and fix it all up and come back in

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.260 
and fix it all up and come back in
