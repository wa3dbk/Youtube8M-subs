a good strong gaiden just one one more
thing<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.350> eliminate<00:00:37.559> off<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
thing you can eliminate off of the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.389 
thing you can eliminate off of the
troubleshooting<00:00:39.200> process<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> we're<00:00:41.309> going

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
troubleshooting process so we're going

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.950 
troubleshooting process so we're going
to<00:00:41.460> give<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.850> give<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.300> jolt<00:00:42.629> right

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
to give it a give it a little jolt right

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.840 
to give it a give it a little jolt right
now<00:00:43.140> all<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.190> little<00:00:44.399> boost

now all that little boost

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.240 
now all that little boost
one<00:00:45.809> thing<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:45.989> Mike<00:00:46.230> did<00:00:46.500> hid<00:00:46.710> had<00:00:47.010> built

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
one thing that Mike did hid had built

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.000 
one thing that Mike did hid had built
this<00:00:47.719> big<00:00:48.719> machine<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.680> big<00:00:49.829> heavy

this big machine here this big heavy
steel<00:00:50.340> thing<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.210> he<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:51.329> gonna<00:00:51.480> wrap<00:00:51.750> it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
steel thing and he was gonna wrap it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.639 
steel thing and he was gonna wrap it
with<00:00:52.250> enamel<00:00:53.250> coated<00:00:53.699> wire<00:00:53.940> yeah<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.530> know

with enamel coated wire yeah you know
it's<00:00:55.739> very<00:00:56.039> expensive<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.820> cheaped<00:00:57.120> out<00:00:57.300> yeah<00:00:57.600> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it's very expensive I cheaped out yeah I

wire<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.510> had<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> bunch<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.080> laying

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
wire and I had a bunch of it laying

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.170 
wire and I had a bunch of it laying
around<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.710> different<00:01:05.100> colors<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.580> lengths

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
around of different colors and lengths

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.010 
around of different colors and lengths
and<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> got<00:01:08.240> let's<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.479> three

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and you know I got let's see three

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.640 
and you know I got let's see three
three-and-a-half<00:01:10.710> layers<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:12.500> windings<00:01:13.500> on

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
three-and-a-half layers of windings on

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.149 
three-and-a-half layers of windings on
each<00:01:13.799> one<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.220> each<00:01:14.369> side<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:16.740> works

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
each one on each side here so it works

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.760 
each one on each side here so it works
just<00:01:17.340> fine<00:01:17.580> does<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.570> needed<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> magneto

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
just fine does we needed a magneto

I<00:02:26.700> tried<00:02:26.969> it<00:02:27.150> earlier<00:02:27.180> let's<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:28.049> this<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.409> put

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
I tried it earlier let's see this I put

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.800 
I tried it earlier let's see this I put
a<00:02:28.709> meter<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.069> this<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.519> will<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.909> draws<00:02:30.209> 25

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
a meter on this this will this draws 25

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.229 
a meter on this this will this draws 25
amps<00:02:31.260> off<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:32.189> little<00:02:32.400> 12<00:02:32.640> volt<00:02:32.849> battery

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
amps off of this little 12 volt battery

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.399 
amps off of this little 12 volt battery
and<00:02:33.329> that's<00:02:33.450> probably<00:02:33.689> all<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.049> battery<00:02:34.379> can

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
and that's probably all this battery can

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.069 
and that's probably all this battery can
couldn't<00:02:35.010> put<00:02:35.159> out<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.790> bet<00:02:36.659> you<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.900> had<00:02:37.019> a

magnet lined up with the South Pole of
the<00:03:11.310> charger<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.939> vice-versa<00:03:12.810> here<00:03:13.139> and<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
the charger and vice-versa here and the

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.809 
the charger and vice-versa here and the
easy<00:03:13.590> way<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.829> do<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.129> just<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.489> hold<00:03:14.639> it<00:03:14.760> a

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
easy way to do that just to hold it a

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.699 
easy way to do that just to hold it a
few<00:03:14.970> inches<00:03:15.120> above<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:16.519> hit<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.669> charger<00:03:18.180> I

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
few inches above and hit the charger I

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.439 
few inches above and hit the charger I
mean<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:20.310> wasn't<00:03:20.549> my<00:03:20.609> type<00:03:20.909> but<00:03:21.120> here<00:03:21.359> I'll

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
mean that wasn't my type but here I'll

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:22.759 
mean that wasn't my type but here I'll
spin<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.810> for<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.079> and<00:03:22.169> you<00:03:22.229> can<00:03:22.379> see<00:03:22.590> it'll

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
spin it for you and you can see it'll

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.949 
spin it for you and you can see it'll
it'll<00:03:23.280> come<00:03:23.430> on<00:03:23.489> home<00:03:23.760> find<00:03:24.150> its<00:03:24.299> home<00:03:24.449> right

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.250 

so<00:03:27.959> yeah<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.370> means<00:03:29.870> that's<00:03:30.870> where<00:03:31.139> the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
so yeah so that means that's where the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.879 
so yeah so that means that's where the
core<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.560> want<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.799> be<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.650> just<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.859> that

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
core is want to be so just like that

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.610 
core is want to be so just like that
we're<00:03:35.280> ready<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.519> charge<00:03:36.109> that<00:03:37.109> string<00:03:37.440> out

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
we're ready to charge that string out

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.449 
we're ready to charge that string out

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
there so you put it on there sprint the

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.170 
there so you put it on there sprint the
core<00:03:41.669> zap<00:03:41.940> little<00:03:42.239> ways<00:03:43.760> evenly<00:03:44.760> like<00:03:44.909> that

it for 5 seconds and you tap on it with

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.710 
it for 5 seconds and you tap on it with
with<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> piece<00:03:55.109> of<00:03:55.260> brass<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:56.479> basically<00:03:57.479> what

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
off and we'll do it one more time let it

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.070 
off and we'll do it one more time let it
sit<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.290> few<00:04:43.350> minutes<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:44.040> few<00:04:44.250> seconds<00:04:44.990> write<00:04:45.990> it

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
sit a few minutes a few seconds write it

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:56.629 
sit a few minutes a few seconds write it

little little bit more out of it but
yeah<00:05:37.080> that's<00:05:37.320> about<00:05:37.470> 1/2<00:05:37.889> that's<00:05:37.979> plate<00:05:38.190> looks

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
yeah that's about 1/2 that's plate looks

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.860

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
said this is a low tension ignition so

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.460 
said this is a low tension ignition so
right<00:05:44.340> it<00:05:44.880> uh<00:05:44.940> I'm<00:05:45.660> not<00:05:45.870> really<00:05:46.050> it's<00:05:46.229> not<00:05:46.260> as

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
though attention yeah it's lower than

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.060 
though attention yeah it's lower than
it's<00:05:48.449> not<00:05:48.570> a<00:05:48.599> spark<00:05:48.900> plug<00:05:48.930> it's<00:05:49.260> not<00:05:49.410> a<00:05:49.440> not<00:05:50.039> a

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
it's not a spark plug it's not a not a

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.520 
it's not a spark plug it's not a not a
really<00:05:50.310> high<00:05:50.430> voltage<00:05:50.760> man<00:05:50.940> right<00:05:51.120> now<00:05:51.150> so<00:05:52.139> you

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
really high voltage man right now so you

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.930 
really high voltage man right now so you
know<00:05:52.590> it<00:05:52.740> look<00:05:52.830> like<00:05:52.979> a<00:05:53.010> horseshoe<00:05:53.430> magnet<00:05:53.550> but

all<00:06:59.270> needs<00:06:59.479> a<00:06:59.539> little<00:06:59.750> spark<00:07:00.080> flow<00:07:00.500> tension

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:00.949 
all needs a little spark flow tension

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:04.409 
all needs a little spark flow tension
yeah

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:04.419 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.350 

what's<00:07:05.419> this<00:07:06.580> it's<00:07:07.580> hard<00:07:07.729> to<00:07:07.820> get<00:07:07.940> a<00:07:07.970> good<00:07:08.120> hook

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 
what's this it's hard to get a good hook

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.580 
what's this it's hard to get a good hook
one<00:07:08.570> with<00:07:08.750> a<00:07:08.810> screwdriver

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
one with a screwdriver

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.770 
one with a screwdriver
yeah<00:07:09.889> it's<00:07:10.370> hard<00:07:10.550> to<00:07:10.669> simulate<00:07:10.910> you<00:07:11.330> I<00:07:11.539> just

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 
yeah it's hard to simulate you I just

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:23.589 
yeah it's hard to simulate you I just
action<00:07:12.110> of<00:07:12.169> the<00:07:12.259> engine<00:07:12.590> but<00:07:19.840> you<00:07:20.840> see<00:07:22.599> you

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 
action of the engine but you see you

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:25.000 
action of the engine but you see you
know<00:07:23.690> I<00:07:23.720> could<00:07:24.199> see<00:07:24.440> it<00:07:24.530> when<00:07:24.680> I'm<00:07:24.830> not<00:07:24.949> looking

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010 
know I could see it when I'm not looking

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.439 
know I could see it when I'm not looking
through<00:07:25.310> the<00:07:25.430> camera<00:07:28.060> camera<00:07:29.060> don't<00:07:29.270> pick<00:07:29.419> it

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:29.449 
through the camera camera don't pick it

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.850 
through the camera camera don't pick it
up<00:07:31.180> probably<00:07:32.180> does<00:07:32.449> but<00:07:32.630> just<00:07:33.110> remove<00:07:33.620> it<00:07:33.740> of

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860 
up probably does but just remove it of

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.870 
up probably does but just remove it of
snapping<00:07:34.190> so<00:07:34.310> fast
