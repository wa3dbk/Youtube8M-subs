00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.590
 and my friend is the most friendly of the deep 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.260
 and today again in that line of ice cream 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.349
 I like a lot and taste good. 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.239
 quiet sweet milk and oh no 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.489
 sorry to do because you do not need 

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:21.619
 absorb more light and have equipment 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:23.210
 want to use it without any problem then 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.999
 come on 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.069
 if the recipe calls for glucose and is transparent 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.109
 and advises that you have to find out why 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.849
 helps a lot in texture prevents training 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.950
 of ice crystals 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.880
 but of course if not you will not find it 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.880
 to do the same thing 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.300
 I try to find a brand that does not have 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.540
 thickeners because if you have too much 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.579
 the taste of toasted toasted you more 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.260
 smoother than we want what will 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.800
 interfere a little with the final taste of the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.800
 ice cream 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.530
 while the ice cream is in the freezer 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.630
 to take advantage of that young man and let 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.700
 the dislike comment below with your 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.649
 preferred flavor of ice cream or some 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.590
 Suggestion for me to do next time 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.000
 and also follows us there in the neshat eu 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.920

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.789

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.789
