you want to do is get that out it'll
relax<00:07:32.090> you<00:07:33.070> can<00:07:34.070> lift<00:07:34.220> that<00:07:34.370> whole<00:07:34.550> assembly

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:34.700 
relax you can lift that whole assembly

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.520 
relax you can lift that whole assembly
so<00:07:35.390> this<00:07:35.690> should<00:07:35.840> actually<00:07:35.960> be<00:07:36.230> three<00:07:36.500> of

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:36.530 
so this should actually be three of

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.450 
so this should actually be three of
these<00:07:36.800> and<00:07:37.180> one<00:07:38.650> looks<00:07:39.650> like<00:07:39.830> a<00:07:39.860> bolt<00:07:40.160> with<00:07:40.370> a

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:40.460 
these and one looks like a bolt with a

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.090 
these and one looks like a bolt with a
stud<00:07:41.140> sticking<00:07:42.140> down<00:07:42.290> to<00:07:42.530> remove<00:07:42.740> off<00:07:42.980> the

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.100 
stud sticking down to remove off the

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.550 
stud sticking down to remove off the
other<00:07:43.250> side<00:07:43.780> so<00:07:44.780> that's<00:07:44.900> how<00:07:45.050> you<00:07:45.170> remove<00:07:45.380> the

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 
other side so that's how you remove the

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.980 
other side so that's how you remove the
cowling<00:07:46.010> and<00:07:46.160> the<00:07:46.460> wife<00:07:46.610> right

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:49.990 

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.350 

on<00:07:50.990> your<00:07:51.170> pond
