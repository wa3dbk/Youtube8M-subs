your panic to your pentatonic scale
which<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.389> give<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> very

you<00:00:16.379> kind<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.420> sound<00:00:18.420> better<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.170> more

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
you kind of sound better and more

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.830 
you kind of sound better and more
interesting<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:21.270> know<00:00:21.390> let's<00:00:21.570> say<00:00:21.779> you

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
interesting so you know let's say you

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.900 
interesting so you know let's say you
were<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.230> doing<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.859> know<00:00:23.010> pentatonix

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
were just doing like you know pentatonix

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:40.490 
were just doing like you know pentatonix
and<00:00:24.539> see<00:00:33.170> it<00:00:34.170> sounds<00:00:34.500> fine<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:39.379> sounds<00:00:40.379> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and see it sounds fine but sounds a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.400 
and see it sounds fine but sounds a
little<00:00:40.710> bit<00:00:40.770> one-dimensional<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.030> too<00:00:42.260> we<00:00:43.260> can

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
little bit one-dimensional so too we can

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.569 
little bit one-dimensional so too we can
add<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.770> note<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.040> make<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.430> more

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
add this note to make it more

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.279 
add this note to make it more
interesting<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.750> instead<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:48.289> we

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
interesting so instead of just this we

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.229 
interesting so instead of just this we
could<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:51.559> okay<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:53.160> simple<00:00:53.699> leg<00:00:54.059> would

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
could do this okay so a simple leg would

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.880 
could do this okay so a simple leg would
be<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.870> slide<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> 10th

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
be like this so slide out to the 10th

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.660 
be like this so slide out to the 10th
fret<00:00:59.129> D<00:00:59.370> string<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.370> g<00:01:02.640> string

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
fret D string and then on the g string

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.980 
fret D string and then on the g string
8th<00:01:03.180> 10th<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:05.030> then<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.330> her<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.630> from<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
8th 10th and then have her on from the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.480 
8th 10th and then have her on from the
8th<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.439> knife

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.320 

okay<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> batch<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.049> rupee<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
okay and the batch the rupee so the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.500 
okay and the batch the rupee so the
theory<00:01:15.570> behind<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.100> sea

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
theory behind this is that the sea

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.230 
theory behind this is that the sea
pentatonic<00:01:18.510> scale<00:01:19.430> it's<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.550> a<00:01:20.700> C<00:01:20.940> minor

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
pentatonic scale it's really a C minor

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.940 
pentatonic scale it's really a C minor
scale<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:25.100> it's<00:01:26.100> got<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.610> flat<00:01:27.950> minor

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
scale because it's got your a flat minor

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.940 
scale because it's got your a flat minor
third<00:01:29.310> interval<00:01:29.670> which<00:01:29.880> makes<00:01:30.240> also<00:01:30.740> C<00:01:31.740> minor

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
third interval which makes also C minor

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.760 
third interval which makes also C minor
chord<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:33.350> natural<00:01:34.350> instead<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.830> flat

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
chord the natural instead of you flat

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.550 
chord the natural instead of you flat
gives<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:39.470> c-major<00:01:40.470> chord<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.780> by

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
gives you a c-major chord so by

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.169 
gives you a c-major chord so by
combining<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:44.310> minor<00:01:44.550> third<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:47.179> major

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
combining the minor third and the major

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.260 
combining the minor third and the major
third<00:01:48.710> you're<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.039> some<00:01:50.250> new<00:01:50.520> cool

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
third you're going to get some new cool

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:07.219 
third you're going to get some new cool
