the<00:01:57.570> first<00:01:57.780> thing<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.990> we're<00:01:58.079> going<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the first thing that we're going to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.080 
the first thing that we're going to
compare<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.070> cooling<00:01:59.490> performance<00:01:59.969> on

both of these two graphics cards we're

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.740 
both of these two graphics cards we're
going<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> talk<00:02:02.549> about<00:02:02.579> noise<00:02:03.060> first<00:02:03.479> though

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
going to talk about noise first though

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.679

960<00:03:34.739> is<00:03:34.890> going<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.100> draw<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.340> little<00:03:35.730> bit<00:03:35.940> more

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
960 is going to draw a little bit more

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.300 
960 is going to draw a little bit more
wattage<00:03:36.510> i've<00:03:36.840> had<00:03:36.989> about<00:03:37.140> seven<00:03:37.860> more<00:03:38.010> watts

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
wattage i've had about seven more watts

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.780 
wattage i've had about seven more watts
compared<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.120> system<00:03:39.570> running<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.739> 370<00:03:41.579> now

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
compared to a system running the 370 now

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.100 
compared to a system running the 370 now
again<00:03:42.299> we<00:03:42.510> have<00:03:42.600> achieved<00:03:42.930> these<00:03:43.049> results

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
again we have achieved these results

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.130 
again we have achieved these results
using<00:03:43.950> firm<00:03:44.220> work<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.700> load<00:03:44.940> up<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.600> GPUs<00:03:46.110> to

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
using firm work to load up the GPUs to

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.470 
using firm work to load up the GPUs to
their<00:03:46.620> maximum<00:03:46.860> potential<00:03:47.610> but<00:03:48.030> as<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.329> see

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
their maximum potential but as you see

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.050 
their maximum potential but as you see
for<00:03:48.630> my<00:03:48.780> results<00:03:49.079> essentially<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:50.070> 370<00:03:50.760> just

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
for my results essentially the 370 just

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.240 
for my results essentially the 370 just
edges<00:03:51.390> out<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.930> power<00:03:52.200> consumption<00:03:52.769> of<00:03:52.920> the

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
edges out the power consumption of the

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.460 
edges out the power consumption of the
GTX<00:03:53.640> 960<00:03:54.030> now<00:03:54.540> let's<00:03:54.720> move<00:03:54.840> forward<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.290> talk

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
GTX 960 now let's move forward and talk

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.750 
GTX 960 now let's move forward and talk
about<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.860> main<00:03:56.070> thing<00:03:56.100> over<00:03:56.459> here<00:03:56.489> and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
about the main thing over here and

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.490 
about the main thing over here and
that's<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.970> gaming<00:03:57.360> performance<00:03:57.510> let's<00:03:58.320> see

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
that's the gaming performance let's see

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.259 
that's the gaming performance let's see
how<00:03:58.650> both<00:03:58.980> graphics<00:03:59.459> cards<00:03:59.700> do<00:03:59.880> playing

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
how both graphics cards do playing

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.270 
how both graphics cards do playing
different<00:04:00.780> titles<00:04:01.140> across<00:04:01.829> three<00:04:02.250> different

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
different titles across three different

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.710 
different titles across three different
resolutions<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:03.299> we're<00:04:03.450> going<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.630> be

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
resolutions so we're going to be

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.300 
resolutions so we're going to be
basically<00:04:04.170> taking<00:04:04.440> only<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.680> average<00:04:05.040> frames

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
basically taking only the average frames

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.140 
basically taking only the average frames
per<00:04:05.459> second<00:04:05.820> score<00:04:06.090> at<00:04:06.239> 1080p<00:04:06.720> 1440p<00:04:07.709> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
per second score at 1080p 1440p and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.410 
per second score at 1080p 1440p and
2160p

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
2160p

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.780 
2160p
and<00:04:09.600> see<00:04:10.109> how<00:04:10.320> each<00:04:10.590> graphics<00:04:11.100> card<00:04:11.340> compares

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
and see how each graphics card compares

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.849 
and see how each graphics card compares
at<00:04:11.970> those<00:04:12.660> different<00:04:13.079> resolutions<00:04:13.709> now

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
at those different resolutions now

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.140 
at those different resolutions now
certainly<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.220> have<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.430> mention<00:04:14.609> that<00:04:14.940> both

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
certainly I have to mention that both

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.000 
certainly I have to mention that both
these<00:04:15.299> two<00:04:15.570> graphics<00:04:15.959> cards<00:04:16.229> are<00:04:16.350> not<00:04:16.560> really

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
these two graphics cards are not really

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.849 
these two graphics cards are not really
4k<00:04:17.669> gaming<00:04:18.269> capable<00:04:18.989> but<00:04:19.200> we're<00:04:19.470> going<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.709> do

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
4k gaming capable but we're going to do

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.830 
4k gaming capable but we're going to do
it<00:04:20.010> for<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.880> sake<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.390> comparison

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
it for the sake of this comparison

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.779 
it for the sake of this comparison
anyways<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:22.860> therefore<00:04:23.190> without<00:04:23.430> any<00:04:23.610> further

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
anyways so therefore without any further

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.190 
anyways so therefore without any further
ado<00:04:24.060> let's<00:04:24.090> go<00:04:24.479> ahead<00:04:24.599> and<00:04:24.690> take<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> look<00:04:25.080> at

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
ado let's go ahead and take a look at

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.140 
ado let's go ahead and take a look at
all<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.470> our<00:04:25.680> gaming<00:04:26.039> benchmarks<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.760> really

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
all of our gaming benchmarks and really

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.440 
all of our gaming benchmarks and really
see<00:04:27.300> if

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
see if

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.360 
see if
my<00:04:27.600> real-world<00:04:28.110> perspective<00:04:28.470> on<00:04:29.010> which

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
my real-world perspective on which

00:04:29.370 --> 00:05:34.680 
my real-world perspective on which
grasses<00:04:29.820> card<00:04:30.090> comes<00:04:30.390> out

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.210 

but<00:05:35.690> really<00:05:35.930> on<00:05:36.050> that<00:05:36.259> guy's<00:05:36.470> that's<00:05:36.889> really

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
but really on that guy's that's really

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.469 
but really on that guy's that's really
it<00:05:37.370> and<00:05:37.580> now<00:05:37.699> make<00:05:37.910> sure<00:05:38.060> to<00:05:38.180> leave<00:05:38.300> your
