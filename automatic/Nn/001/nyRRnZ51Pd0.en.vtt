micro<00:01:33.689> USB<00:01:34.229> they<00:01:34.590> supply<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.189> cable<00:01:36.680> that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
micro USB they supply this cable that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.679 
micro USB they supply this cable that
connects<00:01:38.040> into<00:01:38.930> one<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> USB<00:01:41.420> sockets<00:01:42.420> on
