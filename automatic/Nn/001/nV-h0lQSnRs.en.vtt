00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.210
 what kind of job do you actually learn? 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:30.080
 I am a trainee in the retail trade 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:30.080
 area to the retail salesman 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.700
 but you can see that I am one 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.110
 warehouse logistics but actually i like it 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.399
 single businessman agrees there are the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.309
 he always taught me what a profession he was 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.430
 too cramped expert for warehouse logistics 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.410
 question mark no there he just becomes 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.930
 fies used 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:53.180
 actually, the retail trade does 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.640
 in tight times because he is so universal 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:02.210
 can be used in all areas of this 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.409
 business so on the edge of the present 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.970
 At the moment he is also doing the shipping 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.590
 It was not like that at the beginning 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.180
 big enough here that somehow 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.510
 warehouse logistics 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.380
 we have always been so incredible 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.680
 Big at the beginning was still the only one 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.680
 employee 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.330
 It is after that is the criterion for the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.549
 hired that you paid because 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.470
 then you were it not and is just 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.689
 times still practical since you can still 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.900
 pay less for services and then heart 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:40.369
 but clearly logical and last question 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.369

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.439

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.689

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.939

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.680
