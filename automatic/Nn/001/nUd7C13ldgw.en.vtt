feet keeping your weight on your feet I

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.850 
feet keeping your weight on your feet I
mean<00:00:30.779> look<00:00:30.930> I've<00:00:31.110> found<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> vertical<00:00:31.529> wall

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
mean look I've found a vertical wall

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.520 
mean look I've found a vertical wall
here<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.000> no<00:00:33.150> hands<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:34.440> of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
here but it's with no hands and one of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.740 
here but it's with no hands and one of
the<00:00:34.590> tricks<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.510> instead<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.630> always

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the tricks for that is instead of always

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.340 
the tricks for that is instead of always
trying<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.079> climb<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.470> this<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> ladder

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
trying to climb like this like a ladder

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.600 
trying to climb like this like a ladder
using<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> inside<00:00:40.800> edge<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.130> your<00:00:41.280> boot<00:00:41.489> you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
using the inside edge of your boot you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.090 
using the inside edge of your boot you
use<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> outside<00:00:42.570> edge<00:00:42.810> at<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> front<00:00:43.590> when<00:00:44.070> I

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
use the outside edge at the front when I

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.970 
use the outside edge at the front when I
mean<00:00:44.370> by<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:45.059> instead<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:46.530> putting<00:00:46.800> this

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
mean by that is instead of putting this

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.670 
mean by that is instead of putting this
on<00:00:47.220> here<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.180> put<00:00:48.930> my<00:00:49.080> outside

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
on here like that and put my outside

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.430 
on here like that and put my outside
edge<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.310> I<00:00:50.840> can<00:00:51.840> reach<00:00:51.990> all<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> way<00:00:52.350> up

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
edge on that I can reach all the way up

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.130 
edge on that I can reach all the way up
to<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.370> same<00:00:53.550> again<00:00:53.880> instead<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> put<00:00:55.020> my

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
to here the same again instead of put my

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.249 
to here the same again instead of put my
inside<00:00:55.620> edge<00:00:55.830> on<00:00:56.040> here<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.840> issues<00:01:04.229> that

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
inside edge on here the issues that

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.140 
inside edge on here the issues that
Nixon<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> really<00:01:05.189> useful<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.759> whenever

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
Nixon is a really useful one whenever

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.600 
Nixon is a really useful one whenever
you<00:01:06.360> stood<00:01:06.659> still<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.130> clipping<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
you stood still so if you clipping it

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.899 
you stood still so if you clipping it
ball<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.180> had<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> rest<00:01:09.780> straight<00:01:10.500> arms

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
ball or if you had to rest straight arms

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.609 
ball or if you had to rest straight arms
never<00:01:11.909> try<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.360> rest<00:01:12.509> like<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.290> think

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
never try and rest like this I think

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.399 
never try and rest like this I think
always<00:01:14.360> rock<00:01:15.360> straight<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.259> what<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
always rock straight and then what that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.999 
always rock straight and then what that
means<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:18.299> example<00:01:18.679> you<00:01:19.679> can<00:01:19.859> do<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
means it can do for example you can do a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.679 
means it can do for example you can do a
lot<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.520> twisting<00:01:21.119> your<00:01:21.270> shoulders

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
lot with just twisting your shoulders

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.480 
lot with just twisting your shoulders
you<00:01:21.810> don't<00:01:21.990> need<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.740> doing<00:01:22.859> pull-ups<00:01:23.219> on

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
you don't need to be doing pull-ups on

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.580 
you don't need to be doing pull-ups on
the<00:01:23.579> time<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.880> just

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the time you just

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.420 
the time you just
see<00:01:26.549> my<00:01:26.729> arms<00:01:26.939> taught<00:01:27.149> me<00:01:27.329> straight<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.840> then

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
see my arms taught me straight and then

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.570 
see my arms taught me straight and then
twist<00:01:29.430> again<00:01:30.290> you<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.500> bend<00:01:31.710> your<00:01:31.860> heart

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.870 

it's<00:01:35.090> all<00:01:35.240> about<00:01:35.480> saving<00:01:36.020> energy<00:01:36.880> keeping

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
it's all about saving energy keeping

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.810 
it's all about saving energy keeping
weight<00:01:38.090> on<00:01:38.240> your<00:01:38.360> feet

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.830 

so<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> more<00:01:45.390> advanced<00:01:45.659> technique

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
so this is a more advanced technique

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.230 
so this is a more advanced technique
it's<00:01:46.259> called<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.530> double<00:01:46.680> die<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.189> basically<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it's called a double die now basically a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.030 
it's called a double die now basically a
big<00:01:48.509> jump

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.840 

yep<00:01:52.070> get<00:01:52.310> fit<00:01:52.610> super<00:01:53.330> high

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.320 

but<00:01:56.390> laughs<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:58.070> then<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.250> have<00:01:58.400> to<00:01:58.580> focus<00:01:58.850> on

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
but laughs and then you have to focus on

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.249 
but laughs and then you have to focus on
the<00:01:59.510> health

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.009 

two<00:02:06.259> minutes<00:02:06.590> between<00:02:06.860> those
