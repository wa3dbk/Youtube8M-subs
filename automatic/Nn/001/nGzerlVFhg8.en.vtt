comes<00:00:33.290> inside<00:00:33.680> these<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.370> heat<00:00:34.550> pipe<00:00:35.140> and

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
comes inside these the heat pipe and

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.900 
comes inside these the heat pipe and
we'll<00:00:36.379> show<00:00:36.530> you<00:00:36.559> how<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:36.830> do<00:00:36.950> that<00:00:37.130> so<00:00:37.820> the

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
we'll show you how to do that so the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.120 

it<00:01:00.810> sounds<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.260> horrible<00:01:01.710> when<00:01:01.830> you<00:01:01.920> open

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
it sounds really horrible when you open

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:15.400 
it sounds really horrible when you open
up<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.340> box

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.490 

chump<00:01:16.410> so<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.740> don't<00:01:16.890> need<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.930> garbage<00:01:19.260> can

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
chump so we don't need the garbage can

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:34.670 
chump so we don't need the garbage can
hear<00:01:28.940> another<00:01:29.940> piece<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:34.170> pretty<00:01:34.410> tight

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
hear another piece it's pretty tight

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.700 
hear another piece it's pretty tight
it's<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.310> inside<00:01:35.640> part<00:01:36.000> let's<00:01:36.350> come<00:01:37.350> out<00:01:37.470> here

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
it's the inside part let's come out here

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.280 
it's the inside part let's come out here
this<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.009> part<00:01:38.940> that<00:01:39.000> absorbs<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.750> solar

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
this is the part that absorbs the solar

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:59.380 
this is the part that absorbs the solar
light<00:01:41.390> it's<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.540> little<00:01:43.820> tighter

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.700 

there's<00:02:00.390> your<00:02:00.540> silicon<00:02:00.990> piece<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> end<00:02:03.710> so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
there's your silicon piece on the end so

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.580 
there's your silicon piece on the end so
what<00:02:04.830> we<00:02:04.950> need<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.190> do<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:06.140> stretch<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.350> stuff

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
what we need to do is stretch this stuff

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.550 
what we need to do is stretch this stuff
out<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> tiny<00:02:08.100> bit<00:02:08.220> because<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> may<00:02:09.179> have

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
out a tiny bit because it may have

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:25.200 
out a tiny bit because it may have
gotten<00:02:10.560> backed<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.040> here<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.489> there

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
next thing we got a lineup to say so and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.330 
next thing we got a lineup to say so and
we<00:03:17.480> take<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.750> whole<00:03:17.930> assembly<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.950> push<00:03:19.160> it

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
we take the whole assembly and push it

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.470 
we take the whole assembly and push it
into<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.640> tube<00:03:20.830> see<00:03:21.830> how<00:03:21.920> that's<00:03:22.130> done<00:03:22.480> well

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
into the tube see how that's done well

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.300 
into the tube see how that's done well
you<00:03:23.510> want<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.750> try<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.080> do<00:03:24.170> is<00:03:24.320> don't<00:03:24.950> squeeze

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
you want to try and do is don't squeeze

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.949 
you want to try and do is don't squeeze
the<00:03:25.580> aluminum<00:03:26.150> stuff<00:03:26.390> here<00:03:26.600> too<00:03:26.780> much<00:03:28.959> you're

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
the aluminum stuff here too much you're

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.420 
the aluminum stuff here too much you're
better<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.260> hold<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.650> together<00:03:30.800> at<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.220> top

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
better to hold it together at the top

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.840 
better to hold it together at the top
and<00:03:31.910> use<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.650> use<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.800> silicon<00:03:34.310> piece<00:03:34.580> here

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
and use the use the silicon piece here

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.400 
and use the use the silicon piece here
that<00:03:35.090> comes<00:03:35.570> with<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:38.150> just<00:03:38.390> gently<00:03:38.690> force

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
that comes with it and just gently force

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.630 
that comes with it and just gently force
that<00:03:39.650> in<00:03:39.800> there<00:03:40.450> that's<00:03:41.450> it

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
that in there that's it

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.590 
that in there that's it
now<00:03:43.640> we<00:03:43.700> have<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.060> repair<00:03:44.420> done<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.820> it's<00:03:47.209> as

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
now we have the repair done and it's as

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.470 
now we have the repair done and it's as
new<00:03:48.080> all<00:03:48.769> we<00:03:49.010> needed<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.280> do<00:03:49.489> was<00:03:49.730> buy<00:03:50.420> the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
new all we needed to do was buy the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.080 
new all we needed to do was buy the
replacement<00:03:50.720> pipe<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.769> those<00:03:51.980> are<00:03:52.190> quite

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
replacement pipe and those are quite

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.150 
replacement pipe and those are quite
cheap<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:56.420> in<00:03:56.540> case<00:03:56.750> of<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:57.230> hail<00:03:57.530> damage<00:03:57.560> or

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
cheap so in case of the hail damage or

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.000 
cheap so in case of the hail damage or
anything<00:03:58.340> like<00:03:58.519> that<00:03:58.580> you<00:03:59.000> can<00:03:59.180> always<00:04:00.010> save

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
anything like that you can always save

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.060 
anything like that you can always save
those<00:04:01.190> copper<00:04:01.670> heat<00:04:02.090> pipes<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:02.980> put<00:04:03.980> them

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
those copper heat pipes and put them

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.110 
those copper heat pipes and put them
back<00:04:04.250> into<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.700> new<00:04:05.030> glass<00:04:05.920> so<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.640> can<00:04:07.760> see<00:04:07.940> the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
back into a new glass so you can see the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.920 
back into a new glass so you can see the
carnage<00:04:08.750> there's

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.099 

broken<00:04:12.290> stuff<00:04:12.590> here<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:14.540> clear<00:04:14.810> is<00:04:14.989> the

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
broken stuff here the clear is the

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.969 
broken stuff here the clear is the
outside<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:17.049> Cody<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.259> one<00:04:18.380> is<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.680> inside

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
outside the Cody the one is the inside

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.379 
outside the Cody the one is the inside
glass<00:04:19.160> normally<00:04:19.789> there's<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.030> high<00:04:20.180> vacuum

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
glass normally there's a high vacuum

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.610 
glass normally there's a high vacuum
between<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.019> two<00:04:21.139> pieces<00:04:22.600> but<00:04:23.600> if<00:04:24.289> you<00:04:24.440> get<00:04:24.590> a

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620
