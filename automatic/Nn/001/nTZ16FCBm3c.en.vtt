and today our goal was to make it so
that<00:01:00.450> people<00:01:00.720> could<00:01:00.960> d<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.260> parkour

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
that people could d what parkour

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.350 
that people could d what parkour
actually<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.400> know<00:01:02.490> just<00:01:02.970> kind<00:01:03.150> of<00:01:03.210> to

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
actually is you know just kind of to

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.939 
actually is you know just kind of to
face<00:01:03.570> shots<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.930> parkour<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.379> parkour<00:01:04.799> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
face shots of parkour this parkour and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.800 
face shots of parkour this parkour and
this<00:01:05.070> free<00:01:05.369> running<00:01:05.579> parkour<00:01:05.759> is<00:01:06.180> defined<00:01:06.509> as

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
this free running parkour is defined as

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.600 
this free running parkour is defined as
getting<00:01:07.500> from<00:01:07.680> point<00:01:07.829> A<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:07.979> point<00:01:08.100> B<00:01:08.340> as

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
getting from point A to point B as

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
getting from point A to point B as
efficiently<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.119> possible<00:01:09.170> freerunning<00:01:10.170> is

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
efficiently as possible freerunning is

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.690 
efficiently as possible freerunning is
more<00:01:10.649> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> creative<00:01:11.130> aspect<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.579> if<00:01:11.640> we

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
more of the creative aspect so if we

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.069 
more of the creative aspect so if we
said<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.060> trying<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.780> somewhere<00:01:12.990> as

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
said if I'm trying to get somewhere as

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.660 
said if I'm trying to get somewhere as
fast<00:01:13.259> as<00:01:13.409> humanly<00:01:13.470> possible<00:01:13.710> apply<00:01:14.430> Makka

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
fast as humanly possible apply Makka

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.950 
fast as humanly possible apply Makka
through<00:01:14.850> all<00:01:14.909> these<00:01:15.000> weird<00:01:15.210> flips<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:15.840> if

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
through all these weird flips because if

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.180 
through all these weird flips because if
anything<00:01:16.200> will<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.409> slow<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.560> down<00:01:16.680> you

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
anything will just slow them down you

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.469 
anything will just slow them down you
really<00:01:17.370> not<00:01:17.520> competing<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.000> other<00:01:18.120> people

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
really not competing with other people

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.850 
really not competing with other people
you<00:01:18.630> could<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.870> any<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.320> yourself<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
you could be any going with yourself and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.469 
you could be any going with yourself and
so<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:20.760> not<00:01:20.909> about<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
so it's really not about we can do the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.610 
so it's really not about we can do the
best<00:01:21.600> flip<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.990> about<00:01:22.140> who<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.320> challenge

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
best flip it's about who can challenge

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.840 
best flip it's about who can challenge
themselves<00:01:22.830> more<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:23.340> push<00:01:23.490> themselves

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
themselves more and push themselves

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.910 
themselves more and push themselves
whether<00:01:24.270> you're<00:01:24.510> doing<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.960> huge<00:01:25.560> slip<00:01:25.770> out

parkour<00:01:35.880> Rhode<00:01:36.090> Island<00:01:36.470> we're<00:01:37.470> basically<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
parkour Rhode Island we're basically a

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.010 
parkour Rhode Island we're basically a
small<00:01:38.100> community<00:01:38.370> to<00:01:38.820> start<00:01:39.090> getting<00:01:39.960> our

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
small community to start getting our

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
small community to start getting our
feet<00:01:40.170> off<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.350> ground<00:01:40.470> there's<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> lot<00:01:41.010> of

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
feet off the ground there's a lot of

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.440 
feet off the ground there's a lot of
misconceptions<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.820> stuff<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.330> about

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
we're just good friends if the goal of

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.210 
we're just good friends if the goal of
parkour<00:02:18.020> is<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.290> get<00:02:18.440> from<00:02:18.620> point<00:02:18.830> A<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.040> point

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
parkour is to get from point A to point

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.540 
parkour is to get from point A to point
B<00:02:19.459> as<00:02:19.940> quickly<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.750> efficiently<00:02:20.840> as<00:02:21.230> possible

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
B as quickly and efficiently as possible

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.479 
B as quickly and efficiently as possible
then<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:23.599> can<00:02:23.780> kind<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:23.989> apply<00:02:24.319> that<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:25.069> non

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
then you can kind of apply that to non

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.820 
then you can kind of apply that to non
physical<00:02:25.760> situations<00:02:26.599> to<00:02:26.840> whatever<00:02:27.170> your
