00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
and I'm gonna start by just taking a

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.440

chunk<00:01:19.540> up<00:01:19.810> on<00:01:20.080> top<00:01:20.290> like<00:01:23.160> so<00:01:24.270> there's<00:01:25.270> not

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
chunk up on top like so there's not

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.080 
chunk up on top like so there's not
really<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.780> huge<00:01:26.470> rhyme<00:01:27.250> or<00:01:27.460> reason<00:01:27.550> to<00:01:27.820> this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
really a huge rhyme or reason to this

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.570 
really a huge rhyme or reason to this
but<00:01:28.810> this<00:01:28.930> is<00:01:29.110> gonna<00:01:29.260> be<00:01:29.320> your<00:01:30.010> curl<00:01:30.310> that's

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580

it's the top hairs so put a little bit
of<00:01:36.310> water<00:01:36.550> on<00:01:36.790> it<00:01:36.820> just<00:01:37.510> a<00:01:37.660> tiny<00:01:37.960> tiny<00:01:38.320> bit<00:01:38.470> take

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
of water on it just a tiny tiny bit take

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
of water on it just a tiny tiny bit take
a<00:01:39.340> sock<00:01:39.810> throw<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.930> sock<00:01:41.140> over<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.590> hair<00:01:41.800> and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
clear down to the scalp and there's a

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.840 
clear down to the scalp and there's a
lot<00:01:53.140> more<00:01:53.290> rags<00:01:53.680> involved<00:01:54.340> than<00:01:54.520> I'm<00:01:54.640> gonna

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
lot more rags involved than I'm gonna

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.690

use<00:01:55.090> socks<00:01:55.440> so<00:01:56.440> I<00:01:56.470> find<00:01:56.830> that<00:01:57.100> this<00:01:57.310> gives<00:01:57.580> you

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700

use socks so I find that this gives you
a<00:01:57.730> lot<00:01:58.030> looser<00:01:58.540> nicer<00:01:59.380> curl<00:01:59.680> then<00:02:00.250> rat<00:02:00.640> curls

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
a lot looser nicer curl then rat curls

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.060 
a lot looser nicer curl then rat curls

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.399 
knees have pretty much stayed in place
this<00:04:12.730> one's<00:04:13.000> dropped<00:04:13.299> just<00:04:13.599> a<00:04:13.780> little<00:04:13.989> bit<00:04:14.140> but

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
I think it'll be just fine so we're just

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.189
