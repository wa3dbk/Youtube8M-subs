Anjali<00:00:00.630> we've<00:00:00.870> got<00:00:01.050> we<00:00:01.410> bought<00:00:01.620> about<00:00:01.920> 300

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
Anjali we've got we bought about 300

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.180 
Anjali we've got we bought about 300
feet<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.090> fuse<00:00:03.389> and<00:00:03.720> some<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.620> it<00:00:04.710> slow<00:00:04.950> burning

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
feet of fuse and some of it slow burning

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.800 
feet of fuse and some of it slow burning
and<00:00:05.430> some<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.640> its<00:00:05.759> fast<00:00:05.970> burning<00:00:06.210> fuse<00:00:06.540> but

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
and some of its fast burning fuse but

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.220 
and some of its fast burning fuse but
you<00:00:07.259> can<00:00:07.379> tell<00:00:07.560> we've<00:00:08.570> spliced<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.929> every

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
you can tell we've spliced to every

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.930 
you can tell we've spliced to every
single<00:00:10.440> one<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:10.769> these<00:00:11.040> will<00:00:11.250> often<00:00:11.519> sequence

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
single one so these will often sequence

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.259 
single one so these will often sequence
and<00:00:12.150> these<00:00:12.660> just<00:00:12.960> burns<00:00:13.440> about<00:00:13.849> 30<00:00:14.849> seconds<00:00:15.179> of

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
and these just burns about 30 seconds of

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.689 
and these just burns about 30 seconds of
foot<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.500> very<00:00:16.529> slow<00:00:16.980> burning<00:00:17.279> fuse

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
foot so it's a very slow burning fuse

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.670 
foot so it's a very slow burning fuse
all<00:00:18.060> right<00:00:18.270> okay<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.750> we'll<00:00:19.199> light<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.380> will

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
all right okay so we'll light it will

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.920 
all right okay so we'll light it will
get<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> walk<00:00:20.070> away<00:00:20.400> 30<00:00:21.240> seconds<00:00:21.630> goes<00:00:21.750> by

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
get the walk away 30 seconds goes by

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.599 
get the walk away 30 seconds goes by
this<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.320> will<00:00:22.439> go<00:00:22.529> off<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.250> one's<00:00:23.460> got

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
this one will go off and this one's got

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
this one will go off and this one's got
16<00:00:24.000> shots<00:00:24.240> it'll<00:00:24.510> take<00:00:24.660> about<00:00:24.779> 30<00:00:25.140> seconds<00:00:25.529> for

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
16 shots it'll take about 30 seconds for

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.980 
16 shots it'll take about 30 seconds for
it<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> expire<00:00:26.460> gonna<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.910> pop<00:00:27.539> out<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.869> there

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
it to expire gonna like pop out of there

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.099 
it to expire gonna like pop out of there
correct<00:00:28.769> okay<00:00:29.400> correct<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.060> 16<00:00:30.570> shots<00:00:30.840> come

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
correct okay correct so 16 shots come

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.569 
correct okay correct so 16 shots come
out<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.679> as<00:00:31.859> those<00:00:32.040> are<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.340> off

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
out of this so as those are going off

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.180 
out of this so as those are going off
the<00:00:32.969> fuse<00:00:33.210> continues<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.719> burn<00:00:33.920> right<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.070> is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the fuse continues to burn right this is

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.190 
the fuse continues to burn right this is
still<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.489> off<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.149> idea<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:36.690> light

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
still going off and the idea one light

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.590 
still going off and the idea one light
this<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.710> 1<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.340> 1<00:00:38.460> light<00:00:38.700> okay<00:00:39.000> hey

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
this is 1 this is 1 light okay hey

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.510 
this is 1 this is 1 light okay hey
that's<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.020> ok<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.620> now<00:00:40.890> goes<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.460> trip

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
that's that ok so now goes for the trip

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.639 
that's that ok so now goes for the trip
of<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.120> secret<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.660> above<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.110> then<00:00:43.469> we

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
of a secret up above and then we

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.529 
of a secret up above and then we
connected<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> fast<00:00:44.700> view<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.210> when<00:00:45.329> this

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
connected to a fast view so when this

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.020 
connected to a fast view so when this
finishes<00:00:45.809> its<00:00:46.559> gonna<00:00:46.800> go<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.820> these<00:00:47.969> are

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
finishes its gonna go and these are

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.020 
finishes its gonna go and these are
going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.390> balloon<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> fun<00:00:50.280> side<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
going to go balloon so the fun side is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.569 
going to go balloon so the fun side is
slow<00:00:51.420> fuse<00:00:51.780> 1<00:00:52.649> 2<00:00:53.520> 3<00:00:53.760> 4<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.350> back<00:00:55.620> side<00:00:55.920> are<00:00:56.219> all

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
slow fuse 1 2 3 4 the back side are all

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.090 
slow fuse 1 2 3 4 the back side are all
fast<00:00:56.969> views<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.510> they're<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> go

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
fast views and they're going to go

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.740 
fast views and they're going to go
hopefully<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> same<00:00:59.969> time<00:01:00.210> so

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
hopefully all at the same time so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.640 
hopefully all at the same time so
they'll<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:00.989> up<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> go<00:01:02.760> boom

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
they'll be up and then is it go boom

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.560 
they'll be up and then is it go boom
maybe<00:01:04.650> every<00:01:04.920> two<00:01:04.949> seconds<00:01:05.519> or<00:01:05.790> four<00:01:06.090> seconds

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
maybe every two seconds or four seconds

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
maybe every two seconds or four seconds
or<00:01:06.659> whatever<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.990> amount<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.979> time<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.430> for

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
or whatever that amount of time is for

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.070 
or whatever that amount of time is for
them<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.880> burn<00:01:09.590> again<00:01:10.590> very<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.810> right<00:01:12.810> okay

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
them to burn again very very right okay

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380 
them to burn again very very right okay
very<00:01:13.500> works<00:01:13.710> great<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.189> then<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.180> same

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
very works great and then the same

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.929 
very works great and then the same
concept<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.710> slow<00:01:16.890> fuse<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.460> big

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
concept here so with a slow fuse a big

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969 
concept here so with a slow fuse a big
banger<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.630> left<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.500> bit<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.770> room

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
banger here left a little bit of room

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.700 
banger here left a little bit of room
okay<00:01:20.790> sequence<00:01:21.330> sequence<00:01:21.509> sequence<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
okay sequence sequence sequence this is

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.920 
okay sequence sequence sequence this is
a<00:01:22.740> 300<00:01:23.310> missile<00:01:23.640> battery<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.479> shoots<00:01:24.720> off

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
a 300 missile battery so this shoots off

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.620 
a 300 missile battery so this shoots off
fairly<00:01:25.590> quickly<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.549> does<00:01:26.790> color<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.390> does

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
fairly quickly this does color this does

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.230 
fairly quickly this does color this does
noise<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.320> kind<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.650> well<00:01:28.799> together

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
noise so they kind of go well together

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.810 
noise so they kind of go well together
single<00:01:30.240> donor<00:01:30.770> 12<00:01:31.770> shot<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.490> we've<00:01:32.790> got

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
single donor 12 shot and then we've got

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.230 
single donor 12 shot and then we've got
as<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.630> ends<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.470> slow<00:01:35.159> few<00:01:35.400> slow<00:01:35.700> fuse<00:01:35.909> down

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
as this ends up slow few slow fuse down

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.330 
as this ends up slow few slow fuse down
here<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> fast<00:01:37.020> fuse<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.500> there's<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.070> role

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
here to a fast fuse and there's a role

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.300 
here to a fast fuse and there's a role
of<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.549> thousand<00:01:39.000> firecrackers<00:01:39.829> to<00:01:40.829> finish<00:01:41.130> off

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
of a thousand firecrackers to finish off

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.810 
of a thousand firecrackers to finish off
so<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> thousand<00:01:43.159> that'll<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.220> nice<00:01:44.369> little

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so a thousand that'll be nice little

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.780 
so a thousand that'll be nice little
finale<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:46.049> we've<00:01:46.200> got<00:01:46.229> some<00:01:46.649> single<00:01:47.369> events

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
finale then we've got some single events

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.700 
finale then we've got some single events
over<00:01:48.210> here

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.190 
sequins sequins sequins back here we've
got<00:03:34.570> a<00:03:34.750> double<00:03:35.320> row<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:35.530> 300<00:03:36.690> each<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:37.989> we<00:03:38.019> get

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
got a double row of 300 each so we get

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.560 
got a double row of 300 each so we get
six<00:03:38.440> hundred<00:03:38.739> missiles<00:03:38.920> they're<00:03:39.579> on<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:40.329> fast

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
six hundred missiles they're on a fast

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.509 
six hundred missiles they're on a fast
fuse<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.019> then<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.769> finale<00:03:42.070> which

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
fuse and then this is the finale which

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:49.199 
fuse and then this is the finale which
is<00:03:43.230> 312<00:03:44.230> shots<00:03:44.590> itself<00:03:45.579> 1<00:03:46.470> 312<00:03:47.470> shot<00:03:47.769> event<00:03:48.579> it

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
is 312 shots itself 1 312 shot event it

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.390 
is 312 shots itself 1 312 shot event it
goes<00:03:49.510> off<00:03:49.720> all<00:03:49.959> at<00:03:50.109> once<00:03:50.320> no<00:03:50.650> it'll<00:03:51.070> it'll<00:03:51.250> go

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
goes off all at once no it'll it'll go

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.520 
goes off all at once no it'll it'll go
off<00:03:51.579> they'll<00:03:51.850> probably<00:03:51.880> shoot<00:03:52.299> off<00:03:52.510> 25

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.830 

and<00:03:56.530> then<00:03:56.650> we'll<00:03:56.800> slow<00:03:56.980> down<00:03:57.160> up<00:03:58.000> up<00:03:58.270> up<00:03:58.540> button

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
and then we'll slow down up up up button

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.559 
and then we'll slow down up up up button
and<00:03:58.959> I'll<00:03:59.020> pick<00:03:59.170> up<00:03:59.290> again<00:03:59.500> but<00:03:59.680> it<00:04:00.569> actually

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
and I'll pick up again but it actually

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.030 
and I'll pick up again but it actually
don't<00:04:01.840> know<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:01.959> never<00:04:02.080> one<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.500> those<00:04:02.650> off<00:04:02.830> yeah

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
don't know I never one of those off yeah

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.920 
don't know I never one of those off yeah
but<00:04:03.490> typically<00:04:03.850> what<00:04:04.000> reviewers<00:04:04.360> will<00:04:04.569> change

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
but typically what reviewers will change

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.800 
but typically what reviewers will change
the<00:04:05.170> timing<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.740> those<00:04:06.330> 312<00:04:07.330> they<00:04:07.450> won't<00:04:07.630> shoot

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
the timing of those 312 they won't shoot

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.980 
the timing of those 312 they won't shoot
off<00:04:07.990> all<00:04:08.590> 312<00:04:09.190> in<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.340> same<00:04:09.490> time<00:04:09.750> what<00:04:10.750> I'm

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
off all 312 in the same time what I'm

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.449 
off all 312 in the same time what I'm
saying<00:04:11.290> but<00:04:11.680> they<00:04:11.770> might<00:04:11.890> accelerate<00:04:12.160> yeah

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
saying but they might accelerate yeah

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
going just like the old days right

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.450 
going just like the old days right
hopefully<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.760> old<00:04:30.880> days<00:04:31.090> ah<00:04:32.340> these<00:04:33.340> are

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
hopefully the old days ah these are

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.630 
hopefully the old days ah these are
called<00:04:33.669> spinners<00:04:34.300> on<00:04:34.540> this<00:04:34.750> poll<00:04:34.990> right<00:04:35.260> here

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.380 

and<00:04:39.640> so<00:04:39.820> we've<00:04:39.970> got<00:04:40.240> this<00:04:41.110> whole<00:04:42.240> started<00:04:43.240> with

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
and so we've got this whole started with

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.760 
and so we've got this whole started with
a<00:04:43.419> fast<00:04:44.410> fuse<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.669> it'll<00:04:46.000> light<00:04:46.780> all<00:04:47.140> of<00:04:47.200> these

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
a fast fuse so it'll light all of these

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.090 
a fast fuse so it'll light all of these
at<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.040> same<00:04:48.160> time<00:04:48.669> and<00:04:49.030> they<00:04:49.840> spin<00:04:50.500> on<00:04:50.830> an

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
at the same time and they spin on an

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.580 
at the same time and they spin on an
axis<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:51.820> they<00:04:52.210> just<00:04:52.540> make<00:04:53.020> ground<00:04:53.290> alerts

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
axis and they just make ground alerts

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.580 
axis and they just make ground alerts
kind<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:53.950> thing<00:04:54.100> exactly<00:04:54.850> right<00:04:55.000> yeah<00:04:55.240> exactly

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
kind of thing exactly right yeah exactly

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.130 
kind of thing exactly right yeah exactly
so<00:04:56.590> these<00:04:57.490> aren't<00:04:57.820> exactly<00:04:58.360> great<00:04:58.750> working

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
so these aren't exactly great working

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.390 
so these aren't exactly great working
but<00:04:59.440> we'll<00:04:59.560> see<00:04:59.710> if<00:04:59.800> they<00:04:59.890> work<00:05:00.040> anyway<00:05:00.370> so

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
but we'll see if they work anyway so

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.390 
but we'll see if they work anyway so
they<00:05:00.610> all<00:05:00.760> spin<00:05:01.620> those<00:05:02.620> are<00:05:02.800> all<00:05:02.890> spinners<00:05:03.250> and

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
they all spin those are all spinners and

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.700 
they all spin those are all spinners and
then<00:05:04.090> midway<00:05:04.660> through<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.080> show<00:05:05.320> we're<00:05:05.590> gonna

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
then midway through the show we're gonna

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.710 
then midway through the show we're gonna
light<00:05:05.950> our<00:05:06.070> fountains<00:05:06.550> right<00:05:06.850> here<00:05:07.150> which<00:05:07.570> you

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
light our fountains right here which you

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.719 
light our fountains right here which you
can<00:05:07.870> see<00:05:07.900> on<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.260> lawn<00:05:08.470> and<00:05:08.800> these<00:05:09.490> don't

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
can see on the lawn and these don't

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.400 
can see on the lawn and these don't
create<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.120> lot<00:05:10.300> of<00:05:10.390> noise<00:05:10.660> but<00:05:10.690> they<00:05:11.110> create<00:05:11.380> a

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
create a lot of noise but they create a

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.830 
create a lot of noise but they create a
lot<00:05:11.560> of<00:05:11.620> color<00:05:12.010> so<00:05:12.850> these<00:05:12.970> are<00:05:13.060> very<00:05:13.390> nice<00:05:13.630> oh

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
lot of color so these are very nice oh

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.130 
lot of color so these are very nice oh
can<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.440> say<00:05:14.680> we<00:05:14.800> got<00:05:14.979> about<00:05:15.130> 50<00:05:15.850> fountains<00:05:16.450> 45

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
can you say we got about 50 fountains 45

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.350 
can you say we got about 50 fountains 45
fountains<00:05:17.590> hooked<00:05:18.130> up<00:05:18.310> to<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.490> fast<00:05:18.820> fuse<00:05:19.120> so

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
fountains hooked up to a fast fuse so

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.510 
fountains hooked up to a fast fuse so
they<00:05:19.479> should<00:05:19.690> go<00:05:19.810> off<00:05:19.990> within<00:05:20.800> four<00:05:21.310> or<00:05:21.340> five

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
they should go off within four or five

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.960 
they should go off within four or five
seconds<00:05:21.970> of<00:05:22.000> each<00:05:22.150> other<00:05:23.520> one<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.729> then<00:05:24.850> the

seconds of each other one and then the
two<00:05:25.090> big<00:05:25.300> ones<00:05:25.330> at<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.660> at<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.080> background<00:05:26.560> so

two big ones at the at the background so

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.120 
two big ones at the at the background so
that'll<00:05:27.580> be<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:27.700> nice<00:05:27.850> light<00:05:28.180> show<00:05:29.010> for<00:05:30.010> those

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
that'll be a nice light show for those
