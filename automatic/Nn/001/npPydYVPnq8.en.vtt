00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
but keep the factory stereo so you're

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.480 
but keep the factory stereo so you're
gonna<00:00:10.679> need<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.830> line<00:00:11.070> output<00:00:11.550> converter<00:00:11.730> and

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
gonna need a line output converter and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.510 
gonna need a line output converter and
do<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:15.080> you<00:00:16.080> got<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.289> connect<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.980> amp<00:00:17.190> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
do that you got to connect the amp to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.439 
do that you got to connect the amp to
the<00:00:17.760> speaker<00:00:18.119> wires<00:00:19.010> so<00:00:20.240> first<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.420> to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the speaker wires so first you have to

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.660 
the speaker wires so first you have to
take<00:00:21.600> off<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.960> b-pillar<00:00:22.740> here<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.519> do

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
take off the b-pillar here and to do

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.130 
take off the b-pillar here and to do
that<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.240> take<00:00:24.359> off<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.779> panel<00:00:25.050> that

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
that you have to take off the panel that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.650 
that you have to take off the panel that
runs<00:00:25.289> here<00:00:25.560> then<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> back<00:00:27.090> that

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
runs here then the one on the back that

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.210 
runs here then the one on the back that
runs<00:00:27.840> along<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> floor<00:00:28.410> board<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.949> then<00:00:29.099> you

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
runs along the floor board and then you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.030 
runs along the floor board and then you
just<00:00:29.429> think<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.760> pops<00:00:29.970> off<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:31.040> it

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
just think just pops off and it

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.620 
just think just pops off and it
separates<00:00:32.579> from<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.940> piece<00:00:33.149> pretty<00:00:33.329> easily

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
separates from this piece pretty easily

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.780 
separates from this piece pretty easily
and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.860> everything<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.250> covered<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.610> here

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
and then everything is covered up here

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.330 
and then everything is covered up here
with<00:00:35.910> wiring<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.570> pull<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:37.340> but

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
with wiring you just pull it out but

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.250 
with wiring you just pull it out but
when<00:00:38.489> you're<00:00:38.610> looking<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.750> right

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
when you're looking at this on the right

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.090 
when you're looking at this on the right
side<00:00:40.559> you've<00:00:40.800> got<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.010> gray<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:43.170> kind<00:00:43.950> of

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
side you've got a gray and a kind of

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.760 
side you've got a gray and a kind of
teal<00:00:44.280> green<00:00:44.489> wire<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:45.000> course<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.329> won't<00:00:45.390> focus

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
teal green wire of course it won't focus

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.900 
teal green wire of course it won't focus
anyways<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.489> how<00:00:47.579> they're<00:00:47.730> wrapped

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
anyways what you see how they're wrapped

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400 
anyways what you see how they're wrapped
around<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.989> kind<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.230> wrap<00:00:49.379> around

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
around to get the kind of wrap around

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.779 
around to get the kind of wrap around
are<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.829> only<00:00:49.950> two<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.190> sprawled<00:00:50.489> around

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
are the only two that sprawled around

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.000 
are the only two that sprawled around
each<00:00:50.910> other<00:00:51.350> those<00:00:52.350> two<00:00:52.379> are<00:00:52.649> your<00:00:52.770> speaker

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
each other those two are your speaker

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.010 
each other those two are your speaker
wires<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> other<00:00:54.420> side<00:00:54.690> which<00:00:54.870> I've

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
wires and on the other side which I've

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.920 
wires and on the other side which I've
already<00:00:55.170> done<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:55.800> put<00:00:55.980> back<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.930> it's

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
already done and then put back on it's

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.389 
already done and then put back on it's
the<00:00:58.050> same<00:00:58.079> thing<00:00:58.500> there's<00:00:58.770> two<00:00:58.920> wires<00:00:59.100> wrapped

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the same thing there's two wires wrapped

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.430 
the same thing there's two wires wrapped
around<00:00:59.550> each<00:00:59.820> other<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.570> kind<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
around each other but it's a kind of a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.030 
around each other but it's a kind of a
white<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.949> pink<00:01:02.190> red<00:01:02.430> wire<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.739> why<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.920> do

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
white and a pink red wire so why do I do

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.359 
white and a pink red wire so why do I do
is<00:01:05.339> clip<00:01:05.640> these<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.530> put<00:01:07.530> onto<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> amp<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
is clip these and put onto the amp and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.340 
is clip these and put onto the amp and
your<00:01:09.119> line<00:01:09.270> output<00:01:09.630> converter<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:12.350> this

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
your line output converter so this

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.580 
your line output converter so this
particular<00:01:13.530> came<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:15.350> basically<00:01:16.350> it's
