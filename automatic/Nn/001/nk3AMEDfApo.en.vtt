 sources black ninety seven 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.769
 centimeters you up moves to show and 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.420

 snapshots I pinch she also makes 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:31.620
 more serious that is to do everything the same 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.210
 as iphone so that's what it says here 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.940
