 sponsor of this video positive channel 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.569
 Defo d is a great guy who 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.940
 makes videos for a variety of games and 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.099
 he does it quite well alone 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.530
 problem subscribers a little in general 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.219
 support his friends and now let's 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.219
 watch video 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.260
 Hello friends with you Benders 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.720
 Today we have a very, very interesting 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.540
 mod that will add maycroft fucking 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.850
 tornado and it's not all friends of this mod 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.310
 which is totally just a hundred 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.190
 percent changes the weather in minecraft and 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.220
 there will be a gift and it is necessary and torrential rains 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.059
 and just a lot of things in general 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.700
 let's understand and so now I'm 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.830
 relatively clean fresh world where there is no 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.520
 nothing but a little 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.100
 breeze 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.170
 and it can be seen on the leaves which are now 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.720
 Maynkavt were added and now it was also 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.880
 fly around especially in the forest because 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.310
 in the forest many leaves not in the forest can 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.500
 be wind friends and that's cool enough 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.690
 here you see little leaves 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.060
 go there because it means the other side of us 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.060
 there are also small clouds here 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.369
 here in general, quietly, peacefully, but 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.530
 let's play a little bit with this 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.050
 the weather for this we have a special 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.820
 block called weida machines 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.040
 let's take strictly speaking about 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.200
 other blocks I will tell you later 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.030
 after i show all the weather 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.729
 which you now have minecraft 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.100
 overall let's pick a place wherever you are 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.540
 wanted to change the weather for example 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.580
 here is how much I remember this 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.010
 fungus can only be taken in creative 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.659
 mode but later we'll figure it out so take 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.380
 this block and right click on it 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.690
 mouse and now we have joined light 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.330
 thunderstorm as you can see really easy 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.180
 light thunderstorm around us 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.330
 weather let's say as you see 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.299
 darker overcast general thunderstorm clouds 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.799
 light rain we all know this weather as 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.630
 you understand all this weather will be 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.030
 occur minerafte randomly that is 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.049
 don't depend on you you can calmly 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.420
 dig in the mine 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.369
 and at the top for example there will be a hurricane okay 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.060
 let's look further now with us 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.790
 here 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.190
 hard wind is called hard when 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.870
 i we see that all the water drops are all 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.170
 leaves are flying a certain side 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.970
 because there really is enough 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.920
 difficult more precisely the opposite strong wind and 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.870
 here I pressed a strange button which is not 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.340
 should have clicked is not one of those 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.910
 mods about which I will tell you a little 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.400
 later 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.870
 okay let's move on from third 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.120
 faces actually i would like to now 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.799
 go out hide 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.810
 modes to check if the wind will be 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.659
 act on me let's check it out 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.280
 and as you can see the wind is upon us not human 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.200
 acts that is, he is strong but 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.450
 not strong enough to move us 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.519
 places okay right click again 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.920
 click and here we have 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.030
 friends begins the real 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.700
 tornado 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.069
 here is such a tornado she falls 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.150
 on top of how I understand yes he is already 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.959
 down on top 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.269
 drops to the ground I'm right am I right in 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.670
 general in theory I'm right or is it just 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.560
 swirl in the air honestly i'm bye 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.959
 did not understand what it is as you see drops 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.890
 the waters now also changed them they can be seen 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.030
 are falling and this is just as I understand it 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.480
 very strong wind or something like 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.359
 because they are friends of us 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.760
 I did not understand the real hail 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.530
 immediately this is our real hail and 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.120
 Here we fall from the sky the city limits 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.180
 Take Press again right 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.819
 mouse and here it is a tornado friends the gift is necessary 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.829
 the most that descends from heaven 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.169
 and as you see it now 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.389
 really just creates hard 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:39.690
 scary things as you see poor cows 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:42.090
 fly away and the most interesting thing that we, too 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.130
 susceptible to this chore blowing the knife can 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.530
 catch us can fly on it 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.419
 the most important thing is that if you hit the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.579
 tornado exactly these in already dead lord 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:53.310
 how many poor cows are there because 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.379
 tornado most likely you will die well here 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.000
 now here's no luck nola can you 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.340
 raise very high and throw away 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.780
 somewhere in a scary place for example here 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.099
 here is why faster creative mode 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.470
 not to die 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:07.169
 tornado it interacts not only with 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.949
 by you but from the ground where actually 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.169
 it started 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:13.530
 strange that at the moment we have not 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:15.690
 It began in terms of all sorts of blocks 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.410
 break in general in theory should break 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.299
 these blocks 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.250
 if you remember a long time ago I already told you 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.230
 talked about this fashion but much 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.410
 changed a lot 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.810
 okay let's change the weather and now 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.790
 masses of tornado cyclone let's see 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.280
 how does he look like i'm honestly a little bit 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.050
 I do not understand but apparently he has 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.730
 bigger radius much bigger radius 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.460
 tornado cyclone that is how you see 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.170
 tornado here is not even one type let's 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.180
 ka try to see how we will be in 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.880
 this tornado biccaia de in hell mode 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.850
 take me suffered incurred up 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.580
 my gosh it's just awesome mod 10 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.100
 out of 10 oh god let's look further 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.690
 what is there for weather and right 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.730
 click take and we now have on the 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.980
 the idea should be rain as you see the clouds 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.200
 completely physically we have here 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.930
 different types of clouds and now we have 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.230
 such a simple rain has gone and everything 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.630
 friends next we have lightning again 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.250
 Here is such a strong lightning itself 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.080
 These are friends like the weather on 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.470
 connection in this fashion and before i 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.980
 going to tell you about u cows 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.560
 died 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.120
 about the blocks that are in fashion, I would like to 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.920
 friends to like me under 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.590

 so friends i put everything that is in 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.730
 this sea ​​let's understand let's start 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.940
 perhaps here with these tricks this us 1 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.950
 thing and 2 is our friends so 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.080
 called 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.700
 we have an anemometer and that's just the thing 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.620
 which is due to the wind as you can see 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.270
 spinning to be honest in real life 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.790
 I do not know why it is needed 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.550
 because I honestly are far away at all 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.230
 not a meteorologist but if you understand something 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.150
 please write in the comments but 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.340
 what is this thing i know she just 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.620
 shows the wind direction like this 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.870
 here's a cockerel at my dacha so stood at 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.970
 parents on the roof cool thing 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.310
 let's now change the weather with 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.620
 known to us the block and now let us 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.210
 it will rain and here we have a blog 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.060
 the so-called weather god who 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.220
 shows all the weather data that is 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.710
 any data prophetic cipro 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.630
 amount of particles brother every speed 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.370
 This is a generally useful blog. 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.740
 at home to put in order to understand 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.139
 wagon 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.330
 Yoga friends and I understand from above us 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.699
 shows something like metrologically 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.800
 maps and here we can see where u 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.900
 us now what the weather but 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.310
 I think that's the way it works in me 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.949
 I can be wrong . 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.060
 In general, such things let's see more 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:53.720
 what we have here here and let's turn on 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.720
 for example sirens 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.190
 why should 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.620
 too countries and so 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.620
 Thomas 

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:26.219
 will warn you when the tornado starts 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:29.099
 very useful thing and actually these 

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:31.110
 two blocks they both work in general 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:32.909

 everything burned even smoke goes in general 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.849
 sadly enough it is here with us
