 invention cowboy saddle 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.230
 great strong it was made by 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.990
 the type of those used

 today the riders are still attached to the search and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.399
 saddle which unlike english 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.890
 more comfortable on the water can be kept 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.630
 with one hand and not giving 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.790
 contour two more clearer for larger 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.650
 comfort 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.670
 on this itself is a projection for 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.670
 wrapping mouth and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.559
 it all starts with a plywood frame 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.559
 covered with no sheepskin gun 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.260
 example slick cut floor saddles and others

 hydraulic press 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.780
 the seat is cut by hand special 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.820
 heads than a knife 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.010
 lilac and paid special attention so 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.010
 how is it done on a particular horse 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.150
 the edges of each pattern are grinded to 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.370
 it could exactly fit the skeleton 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.370
 this technique is called grinding off 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.980
 help the skin pattern for the trunk 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.890
 hand glue 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.110
 then he adjusts the pattern 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.080
 inside out 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.700
 he imposes a tip on experience and 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.700
 compresses the edge attributed 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.590
 then collects the bridge magnetized 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.119
 the end of the hammer to be and he is the skin 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.119
 hat right into the tree 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.080
 thick leather cutting and hides 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.080
 nailheads 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.880
 along the perimeter of the cut Canadian and 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.920
 make skin holes for layers 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.920
 skin was easier to sew among themselves 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.850
 master using 2 km and to 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:38.280
 fix poems

 neat look 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.000
 to finish the pen he cuts off the remnants 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.000
 skin special forked pressed 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.250
 Yes, and you need to cover certain areas 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.320
 skeletons of leather 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.660
 part of the skin is ground to improve 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.360
 format 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.800
 then puts a piece of tin covered in leather and 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.800
 nailed by his friends 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.489
 added in stiffness 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.890
 work continues 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.090
 the edges of the skin are ground again to prevent 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.090
 break the counter in yourself

 then everything is thoroughly polished 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.140
 then he nails a piece of skin around 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.120
 handles 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.120
 this place is called a wave 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.100
 then a piece of leather is attached behind this 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.580
 part is called 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.580
 Luke 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.330
 after removing excess leather artisan 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.540
 use this tool for 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.879
 edge alignment 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.349
 when aligning the saddle so she doesn't 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.370
 rubbed them on the sign 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.370
 not better 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.780
 Next time all night plunges case 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.330
 floated it makes skin soft and 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.330
 pliable allow to give iphone 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.590
 puts it on the frame and attracts 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.930
 Romans 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.930
 higher tussen freezes form frame 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.509
 it is molded in one hour of sitting and 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.509
 tightens the skin to dry 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.190
 then he sticks the seats to failure 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.590
 but much more needs to be done before 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.590
 what the saddle will be ready for and if
