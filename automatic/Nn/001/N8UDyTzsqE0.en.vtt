00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.530 

I've<00:00:06.160> made<00:00:06.430> this<00:00:06.640> video<00:00:06.850> to<00:00:07.180> show<00:00:07.390> the

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
I've made this video to show the

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.450 
I've made this video to show the
workings<00:00:07.990> of<00:00:08.170> the<00:00:08.290> suspension<00:00:08.860> components

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
workings of the suspension components

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.150 
workings of the suspension components
and<00:00:09.610> how<00:00:09.760> they<00:00:09.910> are<00:00:10.030> assembled<00:00:10.540> I<00:00:11.070> find<00:00:12.070> that

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
and how they are assembled I find that

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.410 
and how they are assembled I find that
once<00:00:12.340> I<00:00:12.520> understand<00:00:12.940> how<00:00:13.090> things<00:00:13.300> work

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
once I understand how things work

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.199 
once I understand how things work
dismantling<00:00:14.350> and<00:00:14.500> repair<00:00:14.769> is<00:00:14.920> easier<00:00:15.340> but<00:00:16.180> I

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
dismantling and repair is easier but I

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.330 
dismantling and repair is easier but I
found<00:00:16.510> reading<00:00:17.110> about<00:00:17.320> F<00:00:17.500> frame<00:00:17.740> forks<00:00:18.130> quite

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
found reading about F frame forks quite

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.339 
found reading about F frame forks quite
complicated<00:00:18.730> as<00:00:19.599> I<00:00:19.779> said<00:00:19.990> they're<00:00:20.140> quite

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
complicated as I said they're quite

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.589 
complicated as I said they're quite
simple<00:00:20.770> in<00:00:20.890> practice<00:00:21.369> they<00:00:22.029> are<00:00:22.180> probably<00:00:22.419> not

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
simple in practice they are probably not

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:23.970 
simple in practice they are probably not

panels are hammers to release the lower
bearing<00:03:19.480> retaining<00:03:20.110> cup<00:03:20.380> but<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.160> do<00:03:21.310> not

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
bearing retaining cup but I do not

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.340 
bearing retaining cup but I do not
remember<00:03:21.790> finding<00:03:22.360> them<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.630> be<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:22.990> tight

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
remember finding them to be that tight

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.800 
remember finding them to be that tight
by<00:03:24.130> clamping<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.760> steering<00:03:25.360> column<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.750> a

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
by clamping the steering column in a

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.010 
by clamping the steering column in a
workmate<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:27.040> grip<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.340> carpet<00:03:27.640> under<00:03:28.180> if<00:03:28.900> it

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
workmate can grip the carpet under if it

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.170 
workmate can grip the carpet under if it
was<00:03:29.200> tight<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.590> would<00:03:30.010> try<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.250> C<00:03:30.550> spanner<00:03:30.850> before

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
was tight I would try a C spanner before

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.610 
was tight I would try a C spanner before
hitting<00:03:31.330> with<00:03:31.600> anything<00:03:31.960> as<00:03:32.140> it's<00:03:32.320> only

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
hitting with anything as it's only

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:48.160 
hitting with anything as it's only
lightweight<00:03:32.890> aluminium

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.290 

now<00:03:48.710> the<00:03:48.770> steering<00:03:49.250> column<00:03:49.370> can<00:03:49.760> be<00:03:49.880> separated

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
now the steering column can be separated

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.020 
now the steering column can be separated
from<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.720> forks<00:03:51.130> note<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.400> lowest<00:03:52.760> serrated

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
from the forks note the lowest serrated

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.730 
from the forks note the lowest serrated
nylon<00:03:53.540> bearing<00:03:53.959> will<00:03:54.140> detach<00:03:54.470> from<00:03:54.709> a

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
nylon bearing will detach from a

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.140 
nylon bearing will detach from a
steering<00:03:55.069> column<00:03:55.220> when<00:03:55.520> it<00:03:55.610> catches<00:03:56.000> on<00:03:56.090> the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
steering column when it catches on the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.850 
steering column when it catches on the
top<00:03:56.450> nylon<00:03:56.840> bearing<00:03:57.200> has<00:03:57.350> you<00:03:57.470> slide<00:03:57.709> them

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
top nylon bearing has you slide them

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:10.030 
top nylon bearing has you slide them
apart

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.640 

here<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:11.000> can<00:04:11.180> see<00:04:11.420> how<00:04:11.569> the<00:04:11.629> serrated<00:04:12.049> nylon

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
here you can see how the serrated nylon

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.020 
here you can see how the serrated nylon
bearing<00:04:13.099> is<00:04:13.219> held<00:04:13.459> by<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.760> steering<00:04:14.209> column

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.539 

turns<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:19.019> technical<00:04:19.799> bearing<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.310> needs

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
turns the technical bearing that needs

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.830 
turns the technical bearing that needs
to<00:04:20.730> be<00:04:20.820> removed

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.150 

removing<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.930> top<00:04:28.139> nylon<00:04:28.590> bearing<00:04:28.949> can<00:04:29.129> be

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
removing the top nylon bearing can be

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.820 
removing the top nylon bearing can be
tricky<00:04:29.629> it's<00:04:30.629> important<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.349> clean<00:04:31.680> it

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
tricky it's important that you clean it

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.830 
tricky it's important that you clean it
up<00:04:31.949> as<00:04:32.129> much<00:04:32.340> as<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.550> can<00:04:32.849> so<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.240> can<00:04:33.539> find

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
up as much as you can so you can find
