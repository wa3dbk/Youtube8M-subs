obviously got some great players for the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.319 
obviously got some great players for the
season<00:01:34.400> think<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> player<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.850> maybe

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
season think of a player that maybe

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.660

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
recognized and we see you know I think

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030 
recognized and we see you know I think
any<00:01:45.240> player<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.899> any<00:01:46.049> level<00:01:46.290> who<00:01:46.590> has<00:01:46.829> gone

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
any player at any level who has gone

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.160 
any player at any level who has gone
from<00:01:47.250> being<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.610> forward<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> defender<00:01:48.960> it's

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
from being a forward to a defender it's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.950 
from being a forward to a defender it's
just<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.619> attacking<00:01:50.390> offensive<00:01:51.390> mindset

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
just that attacking offensive mindset

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.190 
just that attacking offensive mindset
but<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.439> an<00:01:52.649> outside<00:01:53.009> back<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.930> just

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
but as an outside back so you know just

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.929 
but as an outside back so you know just
anyone<00:01:55.619> who's<00:01:55.829> gone<00:01:56.040> through<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> just

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
anyone who's gone through that and just

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.230 
anyone who's gone through that and just
has<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:58.079> really<00:01:58.500> attacking<00:01:59.280> focus<00:01:59.939> but

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
has that that really attacking focus but

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.730 
has that that really attacking focus but
as<00:02:00.360> an<00:02:00.540> outside<00:02:00.840> back<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.469> mean<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> think

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
as an outside back and I mean I think

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.980 
as an outside back and I mean I think
Candace<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.850> an<00:02:03.119> awesome<00:02:03.420> example<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
Candace is is an awesome example of that

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.770 
Candace is is an awesome example of that
as<00:02:04.290> well<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.979> think<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.759> having<00:02:06.000> having

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
as well and I think just having having

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.760 
as well and I think just having having
her<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> wing<00:02:07.770> she's<00:02:08.069> had<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.340> extreme

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
her on the wing she's had that extreme

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.730 
her on the wing she's had that extreme
reigns<00:02:08.950> from<00:02:09.070> last<00:02:09.370> season<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:10.120> um<00:02:10.540> I<00:02:11.200> think

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
reigns from last season and um I think

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.550 
reigns from last season and um I think
it's<00:02:12.070> it's<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.520> good<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:13.150> good<00:02:13.660> formation<00:02:14.320> to

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
it's it's a good a good formation to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.680 
it's it's a good a good formation to
have<00:02:14.710> outside<00:02:15.220> backs<00:02:15.700> who<00:02:15.970> want<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.420> get<00:02:16.540> into

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
have outside backs who want to get into

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.090 
have outside backs who want to get into
the<00:02:16.960> attack<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.560> think<00:02:17.800> that's<00:02:17.950> something

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
the attack and I think that's something

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.800 
the attack and I think that's something
he's<00:02:18.430> playing<00:02:18.760> on<00:02:18.910> utilizing<00:02:19.210> you<00:02:19.540> both<00:02:19.660> have
