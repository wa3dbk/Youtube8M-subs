00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.260 
skin pretty much like this would do but
this<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.650> think<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.040> go<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.460> 99<00:01:41.909> or

this is the I think if you go to 99 or

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.210 
this is the I think if you go to 99 or
two<00:01:42.689> dollars<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:44.479> fifty<00:01:45.479> cents<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.950> get<00:01:47.100> it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
two dollars and fifty cents and I get it

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.980
