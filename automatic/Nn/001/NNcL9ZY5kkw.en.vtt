a<00:00:04.140> osa<00:00:04.500> institute<00:00:05.069> today<00:00:05.640> we're<00:00:05.940> going<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.089> be

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
a osa institute today we're going to be

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.820 
a osa institute today we're going to be
looking<00:00:06.299> at<00:00:06.540> how<00:00:06.600> x<00:00:07.080> two<00:00:07.440> numbers<00:00:07.710> together

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
looking at how x two numbers together

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.980 
looking at how x two numbers together
when<00:00:08.550> they're<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.880> their<00:00:09.000> teens<00:00:09.300> we're<00:00:09.870> going

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
when they're in their teens we're going

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.810 
when they're in their teens we're going
to<00:00:10.080> do<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.500> our<00:00:10.740> head<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.040> under<00:00:11.580> four

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
to do this in our head in under four

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.940 
to do this in our head in under four
seconds<00:00:12.269> now<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.690> promise<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.230> by<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.440> end<00:00:13.799> of

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
seconds now I promise you by the end of

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.829 
seconds now I promise you by the end of
the<00:00:14.099> short<00:00:14.400> video<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:15.240> will<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.389> able<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.660> do

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
the short video you will be able to do

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.609 
the short video you will be able to do
this<00:00:16.020> too<00:00:17.180> so<00:00:18.180> last<00:00:18.690> lesson<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.109> looked<00:00:19.289> at<00:00:19.500> how

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
this too so last lesson we looked at how

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.679 
this too so last lesson we looked at how
to<00:00:19.680> square<00:00:20.039> numbers<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.880> are<00:00:21.000> double<00:00:21.270> digit

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
to square numbers that are double digit

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.849 
to square numbers that are double digit
and<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.140> looked<00:00:22.320> at<00:00:22.410> how<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.590> could<00:00:22.830> possibly

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
and we looked at how we could possibly

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.880 
and we looked at how we could possibly
do<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.939> under<00:00:24.420> three<00:00:24.660> seconds<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.680> for

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
do that in under three seconds so for

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.490 
do that in under three seconds so for
example<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.310> covered<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> 85<00:00:27.390> 85<00:00:28.109> squared

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
example we covered the 85 85 squared

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.349 
example we covered the 85 85 squared
example<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.400> could<00:00:29.519> literally<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.240> in

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
example you could literally do this in

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.939 
example you could literally do this in
the<00:00:30.480> three<00:00:30.720> seconds<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.289> when<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.439> say<00:00:31.679> three

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the three seconds and when I say three

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.319 
the three seconds and when I say three
seconds<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.430> mean<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.880> actually<00:00:33.180> quite

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
seconds I mean that is actually quite

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.569 
seconds I mean that is actually quite
generous<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> time<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.460> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
generous with the time so if you want to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.850 
generous with the time so if you want to
learn<00:00:36.300> how<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.570> do<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.930> go<00:00:37.140> back<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.500> our<00:00:37.530> last

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
learn how to do that go back to our last

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
learn how to do that go back to our last
lesson<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.940> lesson<00:00:39.270> we're<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.660> be

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
lesson this lesson we're going to be

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.389 
lesson this lesson we're going to be
looking<00:00:39.899> at<00:00:40.260> how<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.410> multiply<00:00:40.739> numbers<00:00:40.980> in

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
looking at how to multiply numbers in

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.200 
looking at how to multiply numbers in
their<00:00:41.550> teams<00:00:41.850> such<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.540> 12<00:00:43.020> x<00:00:43.260> 17<00:00:43.829> or<00:00:44.040> 13<00:00:44.520> x<00:00:44.910> 19

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
their teams such as 12 x 17 or 13 x 19

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.569 
their teams such as 12 x 17 or 13 x 19
and<00:00:45.660> next<00:00:46.320> lesson<00:00:46.710> we're<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.430> be

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
and next lesson we're going to be

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.639 
and next lesson we're going to be
looking<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:48.120> numbers<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.379> specific

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
looking at numbers it's in a specific

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.040 
looking at numbers it's in a specific
case<00:00:50.100> where<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> first<00:00:51.239> digit<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> same

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
case where the first digit is the same

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.080 
case where the first digit is the same
in<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> last<00:00:52.500> digits<00:00:52.860> add<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.190> 10<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> could

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
in the last digits add to 10 so it could

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.430 
in the last digits add to 10 so it could
be<00:00:54.120> 72<00:00:55.050> x<00:00:55.440> 78<00:00:55.920> or<00:00:56.430> 81<00:00:57.059> times<00:00:57.329> 89<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.109> we're

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
be 72 x 78 or 81 times 89 and we're

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.660 
be 72 x 78 or 81 times 89 and we're
going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> look<00:00:58.710> at<00:00:58.800> how<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.460> in

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
going to look at how to do that in

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.459 
going to look at how to do that in
typically<00:01:00.090> around<00:01:00.390> three<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> five<00:01:00.989> seconds

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
typically around three to five seconds

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.700 
typically around three to five seconds
in<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:02.039> head<00:01:02.219> now<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.730> stuff<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.030> very<00:01:03.390> easy

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
in your head now this stuff is very easy

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.890 
in your head now this stuff is very easy
okay<00:01:04.710> very<00:01:05.339> easy<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> stick<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:06.750> me

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
okay very easy so if you stick with me

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.730 
okay very easy so if you stick with me
here<00:01:07.049> you're<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.710> learn<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.920> lot<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
here you're going to learn a lot so the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.520 
here you're going to learn a lot so the
first<00:01:11.010> step<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.939> cross<00:01:12.450> addition<00:01:12.930> now<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.290> want

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
first step is cross addition now I want

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.020 
first step is cross addition now I want
to<00:01:13.619> teach<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.100> through<00:01:14.400> an<00:01:14.490> example<00:01:14.580> as

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
to teach you this through an example as

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.359 
to teach you this through an example as
I<00:01:15.119> find<00:01:15.330> that's<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> best<00:01:15.810> way<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> learn<00:01:16.369> so

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
I find that's the best way to learn so

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.149 
I find that's the best way to learn so
we've<00:01:17.520> got<00:01:17.640> two<00:01:17.790> numbers<00:01:18.150> 13<00:01:18.540> x<00:01:19.049> 19<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.860> we're

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
we've got two numbers 13 x 19 and we're

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.609 
we've got two numbers 13 x 19 and we're
going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> cross<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.990> means<00:01:22.320> is

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
going to cross at and what this means is

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.649 
going to cross at and what this means is
we're<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.280> take<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.790> three<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.479> we're

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
we're going to take the three and we're

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.710 
we're going to take the three and we're
going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> add<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> 19

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
going to add it on to the 19

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.420 
going to add it on to the 19
alternatively<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.960> could<00:01:28.080> take<00:01:28.320> 49<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.159> add

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
alternatively you could take 49 and add

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.819 
alternatively you could take 49 and add
it<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> 13<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.960> either<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:31.530> you'll

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
it on to the 13 but either way you'll

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.170 
it on to the 13 but either way you'll
get<00:01:32.040> 22<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.479> 3<00:01:33.810> plus<00:01:33.990> 19<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.829> nine<00:01:35.220> plus<00:01:35.460> 13<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
get 22 so 3 plus 19 or nine plus 13 is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.480 
get 22 so 3 plus 19 or nine plus 13 is
22<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.860> will<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> start<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.430> your

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
22 so this will be the start of your

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.450 
22 so this will be the start of your
answer<00:01:38.939> 22<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.439> that's<00:01:40.590> step<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.220> there's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
answer 22 so that's step one and there's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.179 
answer 22 so that's step one and there's
only<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.790> more<00:01:41.970> step<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:43.110> multiply<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> last

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
only one more step you multiply the last

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.370 
only one more step you multiply the last
digits<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.659> add<00:01:45.810> them<00:01:46.079> onto<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
digits and then you add them onto the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.370 
digits and then you add them onto the
answer<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> 3<00:01:48.299> times<00:01:48.329> 9<00:01:48.990> which

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
answer so we know that 3 times 9 which

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.700 
answer so we know that 3 times 9 which
is<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.680> last<00:01:49.890> digits<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.430> both<00:01:50.700> these<00:01:51.030> numbers

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
is the last digits in both these numbers

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.880 
is the last digits in both these numbers
3<00:01:52.710> times<00:01:53.009> 9<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.340> 27<00:01:54.229> now<00:01:55.229> all<00:01:55.500> we're<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
3 times 9 is 27 now all we're going to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.539 
3 times 9 is 27 now all we're going to
do<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.159> add<00:01:56.310> 27<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> problem<00:01:58.310> see<00:01:59.310> there

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
do is add 27 on to the problem see there

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.639 
do is add 27 on to the problem see there
27<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.390> literally<00:02:00.930> laid<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.530> top<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.420> 22<00:02:03.810> with

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
27 is literally laid on top so 22 with

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.039 
27 is literally laid on top so 22 with
27<00:02:05.189> laid<00:02:05.340> onto<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> end<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> answer<00:02:06.630> we

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
27 laid onto the end of the answer we

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.720 
27 laid onto the end of the answer we
get<00:02:07.970> 247<00:02:09.110> okay<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.470> I'll<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.679> back<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> step<00:02:11.069> look

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
get 247 okay so I'll go back a step look

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.910 
get 247 okay so I'll go back a step look
at<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.000> too<00:02:12.270> at<00:02:12.450> how<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.780> carries<00:02:13.050> on

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
at that too at how it carries on

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.339 
at that too at how it carries on
and<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.670> seven<00:02:15.090> literally<00:02:15.569> carries<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.319> to

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
and that seven literally carries on to

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.010 
and that seven literally carries on to
nothing<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.190> just<00:02:17.340> becomes<00:02:17.730> seven<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.900> we

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
nothing so it just becomes seven so we

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.559 
nothing so it just becomes seven so we
get<00:02:19.200> 247<00:02:20.180> 247<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.190> answer<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.450> 247<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
get 247 247 so the answer is 247 and

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.720 
get 247 247 so the answer is 247 and
sazh<00:02:24.750> simple<00:02:25.050> as<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.200> now<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.950> want<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.310> have

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
sazh simple as that now I want you have

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.470 
sazh simple as that now I want you have
a<00:02:26.760> go<00:02:27.000> 12<00:02:27.930> x<00:02:28.349> 13<00:02:29.010> think<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.940> process<00:02:30.330> we

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
a go 12 x 13 think of the process we

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.960 
a go 12 x 13 think of the process we
just<00:02:30.660> went<00:02:30.810> through<00:02:30.900> step<00:02:31.470> one<00:02:31.739> we<00:02:32.340> cross<00:02:32.670> add

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
just went through step one we cross add

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.070 
just went through step one we cross add
step<00:02:33.930> two<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:35.160> multiply<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.180> last<00:02:36.480> digits<00:02:36.959> and

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
step two we multiply the last digits and

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.650 
step two we multiply the last digits and
add<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.530> on<00:02:37.680> I'll<00:02:38.040> give<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.610> go<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.209> go<00:02:39.390> for

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
add it on I'll give you a go you go for

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:50.930 
add it on I'll give you a go you go for
it<00:02:47.870> did<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.380> hope<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.069> did<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.819> we

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
it did you get it I hope you did so we

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.449 
it did you get it I hope you did so we
add<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.360> two<00:02:51.600> onto<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.989> 13<00:02:52.440> or<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.040> three

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
add the two onto the 13 or the three

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.240 
add the two onto the 13 or the three
onto<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.850> 12<00:02:54.120> that's<00:02:54.660> step<00:02:55.019> one<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:55.980> come

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
onto the 12 that's step one and we come

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.259 
onto the 12 that's step one and we come
up<00:02:56.400> with<00:02:56.580> 15<00:02:57.200> blank<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:59.220> 15<00:02:59.640> blank<00:02:59.970> would<00:03:00.150> be

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
up with 15 blank so 15 blank would be

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.660 
up with 15 blank so 15 blank would be
the<00:03:00.390> first<00:03:00.630> step<00:03:00.989> now<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.680> second<00:03:02.220> step<00:03:02.489> we

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
the first step now the second step we

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.880 
the first step now the second step we
get<00:03:02.850> multiplied<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.660> last<00:03:04.049> digits<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.680> add

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
get multiplied the last digits and add

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.550 
get multiplied the last digits and add
that<00:03:05.040> onto<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.400> end<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.060> answer<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:07.470> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
that onto the end of the answer so the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.320 
that onto the end of the answer so the
last<00:03:07.739> digits<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.250> two<00:03:08.400> times<00:03:08.670> three<00:03:09.120> and

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
last digits of two times three and

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.720 
last digits of two times three and
that's<00:03:09.989> six<00:03:10.260> we<00:03:10.680> check<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:10.980> six<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.640> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
that's six we check that six on to the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.400 
that's six we check that six on to the
end<00:03:11.880> we<00:03:12.360> end<00:03:12.510> up<00:03:12.630> with<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.810> hundred<00:03:13.260> and

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
end we end up with a hundred and

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.500 
end we end up with a hundred and
fifty-six<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.310> as<00:03:14.880> simple<00:03:15.120> as<00:03:15.450> that

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
fifty-six it's as simple as that

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.819 
fifty-six it's as simple as that
honestly<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.350> really<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.930> if<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.590> want<00:03:19.769> to

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
honestly it really is so if you want to

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.370 
honestly it really is so if you want to
relearn<00:03:20.220> what<00:03:20.280> we've<00:03:20.579> just<00:03:20.609> done<00:03:20.880> go<00:03:21.690> straight

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
relearn what we've just done go straight
