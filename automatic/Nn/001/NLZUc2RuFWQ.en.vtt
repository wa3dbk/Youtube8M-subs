what okay there we go I meant under beam
wow<00:04:51.440> I'm<00:04:51.919> a<00:04:52.190> walking<00:04:52.370> dead<00:04:52.669> on<00:04:52.879> check<00:04:53.949> Wow<00:04:55.210> Wow

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
wow I'm a walking dead on check Wow Wow

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.589 
wow I'm a walking dead on check Wow Wow
so<00:04:56.930> when<00:04:57.199> you<00:04:57.349> click<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:59.199> W<00:05:00.199> it<00:05:00.560> will<00:05:01.389> create<00:05:02.389> a

so when you click the W it will create a

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.300 
so when you click the W it will create a
latest<00:05:03.020> step<00:05:03.259> Waypoint

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
latest step Waypoint

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.059 
latest step Waypoint
when<00:05:04.430> you<00:05:04.550> click<00:05:04.819> it<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.509> will<00:05:05.569> show<00:05:06.199> a<00:05:06.229> Gy<00:05:06.919> of

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
arrow where you're less latest depth so

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:16.469 
arrow where you're less latest depth so
yeah<00:05:12.409> I'm<00:05:12.800> going<00:05:13.009> to<00:05:13.659> follow<00:05:14.659> the<00:05:14.900> arrow<00:05:15.139> and
