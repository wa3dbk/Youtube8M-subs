00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.589
 for a video presentation made 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.769
 what are you going to talk about 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.910
 of the 1.7 on the mineral servers in 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.630
 so that in recent days we have not 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.460
 badly worked on it 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.809
 and today it teaches me to propose 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.740
 a first approach a first beta 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.060
 so on his servers then for you what 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.180
 what to do is go to the site 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.800
 mineralaria point fr slash betar slash 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.680
 for to actually download the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.630
 launcher and you type mineraria 1 7 2 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.520
 points required at jarcy point is not 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.770
 under windows so then under this moment 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.870
 there you can download the launcher 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.160
 I already have them I'm going to open them 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.270
 mine herria make us take a little 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.230
 little time to get started first 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.399
 time is recovering a little more 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.559
 long as this kind all the sounds etc 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.689
 and support download bookstore it's 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.830
 it's a little less negative but it's 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.880
 like that even on the official version 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.310
 it feels much faster their 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.869
 right there you get on this menu which 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.180

 done if you click on one of the servers 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.060
 it works because servers under
