00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.279
 How are you, Professor Raúl Vega? 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.430
 muñoz I invite you to know my page 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.469
 of internet courses of algebra dotcom 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.529
 where you can take a full course 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:18.130
 of algebra totally free as well as what 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:20.770
 you hear this course consists of hundreds of 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.230
 solved exercises as well as several 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.220
 videos with simple explanations like 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.619
 the one you're about to see 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.949
 in this video I'll explain how 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.770
 solve the square root in a way 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.140
 very energized this video soon 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.570
 will solve the square roots of a 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.590
 as simple as never 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.810
 would have imagined 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.240
 let's start with a simple example 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.930
 they ask us what is the square root 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.110
 of 49 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.910
 the question actually means 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.050
 tell me a number that multiplied by itself 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:02.540
 same give us 49 and as we see 2 for 2 we 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:06.940
 gives 4 5 for 5 25 7 for 7 49 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.940
 then we conclude that 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:15.180
 the square root of 49 equals 7 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.370
 we are asked what is the square root 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.909
 of the 144 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.280
 it does not seem so simple anymore 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.100
 for this I will explain a method 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.250
 which is to work with the numbers 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.259
 cousins what are the prime numbers are 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.200
 a list of numbers that have 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.300
 only two divisors the one and they 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.890
 same 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.140
 concretely we are going to talk about the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.210
 next list the prime numbers treats 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:56.659
 to memorize the two three 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:58.790
 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 important that 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.810
 do not compute the prime numbers with the 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.369
 odd numbers 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.369
 the prime numbers 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.490
 they look like odd numbers but not 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.490
 they are the same 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.050
 in the odd there is no 2 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.260
 but so is the one 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.200
 in the odd until 9 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.950
 and there is the 15 that do not appear in the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.950
 Prime numbers 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.020
 the prime numbers are the numbers that 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.210
 can only be divided between 1 and between 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.310
 the same number on the list that you 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.410
 I will show a moment ago you can see that 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.260
 for example 5 can only be divided 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.340
 between 1 and between 5 11 can only be 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.769
 divide between 1 and between 11 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.120
 to solve the square root we're going to 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.069
 use a method that is called 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.349
 prime factorization that I'm going to 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.660
 explain then lends a lot 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.700
 attention is very simple is a method 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.550
 very similar to the common minimum 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.210
 multiple and the greatest common divisor that 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.700
 you can see in other of our videos 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:08.680
 observe this we have to get the root 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.480
 square of 144 we write here 144 and what 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.410
 we try to divide between the first 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.170
 prime number that is 2 144 between 2 that 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.959
 I put here in red gives us 72 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:26.000
 again we try to divide between the 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:30.770
 first prime number that is 272 among 236 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.360
 between two because you can also 18 18 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:37.610
 between 299 it can no longer be divided between 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.069
 two so we use the following 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.900
 prime number that is 3 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:48.970
 9 between 3 gives us three three in three 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.850
 because you can also give us 1 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.850
 When you finish in 1, the 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.980
 factoring process raw observes 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.610
 how many times does the number 2 appear in 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.319
 red color appears 4 times 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.730
 that is to say 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:10.350
 2 raised to the fourth power 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:16.389
 the 3 appears twice is to say 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:18.519
 3 to the second power or 3 to the square 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.389
 this leads us to say that the root 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.660
 square of 144 is equal to the root 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:31.280
 square 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:34.330
 from this number 2 to the 4 x this number 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.330
 3 squared 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.980
 to take the square root of this from 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.050
 the power 2 to the fourth takes the 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.630
 exponent the small number that is 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.360
 up here and divide it between two the 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.940
 half of 4 on 2 we have two left 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.810
 square the square root of 3 to 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.199
 square half of 2 is a serious 3 to 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.199
 the 1 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.740
 notice that the 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:02.580
 root symbol because this is the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.139
 result of this 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:10.289
 2 squared means 2 x 2 or 4 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.710
 and 3 to 123 simply as it is a 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:18.210
 multiplication is 4 times 3 gives us 12 the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:21.360
 square root of 144 is 12 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.240
 simple, well, let's practice what 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.530
 what do you think if you try to do this 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.050
 square root of 2.304 do it yourself 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.560
 following the procedure that you just 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.199
 see pause this video and try to perform 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.889
 this procedure by yourself we go 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.889
 going 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.070
 2,304 can be divided between the first 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.810
 prime number that is 2 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.460
 then 2,304 between 2 gives us 1,152 other 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.550
 we tried between the first number 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.890
 cousin let's keep trying until 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:03.500
 that this can no longer be done between 2 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:08.180
 gives us 576 between 2 gives us 288 between 2 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:12.020
 gives us 144 between 2 gives us 72 between two 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.690
 gives us 36 between 22 of 18 between 2 gives us 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:19.270
 9 you can not 'try now if 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:22.930
 with the 3 would be 9 between 3 3 3 between 3 1 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.930
 let's count them 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.569
 appears eight times the number two is 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:32.259
 say two to eight 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.929
 and number 3 appears twice ie 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:37.089
 3 to 2 

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:40.419
 in conclusion we have to root 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:44.499
 square of 2,304 is equal to the root 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:47.169
 square of this number is 2 to the 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:51.100
 8 x 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:53.680
 this number is 3 squared 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.830
 we solve the root in a simple way the 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.710
 half of 84 half of two is 1 no longer 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:03.430
 the symbol appears 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:06.400
 2 to 4 is equal to 16 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:10.300
 and 31 equals three 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:13.680
 finally we have that 16 by 3 is equal 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:17.770
 to 48 this is the result the root of 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:21.190
 2.304 equals 48 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:25.889
 if you have any doubt that 24 16 is for this 2 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:29.230
 to 4 2 by 2 x 2 by 2 16 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:31.630
 if this method has seemed simple 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.360
 I invite you to leave a comment on
