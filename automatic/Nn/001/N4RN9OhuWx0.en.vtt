00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 very good to everyone today we come to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.240
 talk a little about the electro program 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.130
 the group of engineers that when this 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.889
 theme is made up of the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.780
 next way it was made muñetón and thus 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.660
 health and my person ariel domínguez 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.240
 good first of all and the most basic 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.400
 is to define that the electro program in the 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.230
 muscle scan due to 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.779
 Weakness problems amount of 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.009
 force or also sensitive problems 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.349
 as the pains loss of sensitivity 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.200
 numbness cramps and among others 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.250
 problems caused in any area of ​​the 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.250
 body as only 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.579
 Well now let's talk about the graphic environment 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.280
 This is one of the techniques used to 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.010
 determine the problem the patient has 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.050
 to coat recipes 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.149
 this technique controls and maintains the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.030
 record of electrical activity 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.100
 muscular this one basically this 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.890
 energy produced by the cells 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.149
 muscles and in this way achieve 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.880
 detect any anomaly either in 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:10.000
 the neurons that is located in the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.190
 spinal cord 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.610
 how is the electromyogram good even 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.090
 in four relaxed and clear as we see 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.580
 here that when we have a limb or 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.190
 Body muscle without doing anything 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.250
 in position relaxation 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.259
 we say that there is no activity 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.320
 electrical or body order as 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.570
 we can call it sometimes 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.580
 as the only way it occurs 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.520
 some electrical activity during the 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.170
 process during electrography in this 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.810
 state of rest in which they arise 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.690
 damage to some muscle nerve is 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.150
 say when there is a damage in no 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.840
 nerve the muscle will have 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.930
 certain orders or if this activity 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.980
 electricity without having exercised any 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.510
 no force now we see what the 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.270
 electro program when the muscle is 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.610
 contracts when the muscle is contracted 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.530
 in electro program shows us how they are 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.680
 and at what levels are the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.040
 signals through the body as we see 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.710
 here the problem is detected when the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.520
 waves of the moscow signal generates the most 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.160
 low than normal 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.819
 this would detect muscle abnormality 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.769
 when this chin contracted 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.530
 what is the utility of the great electro 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.689
 good basically the utility of 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.609
 electro program clearer or it is 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:38.209
 clearer it can not be like what 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.909
 we are seeing at this time allow 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.120
 locate without the loss of forces that 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.819
 is in the motor unit nerves muscle 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.400
 or spinal cord given the information by 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.859
 this technique in doctors talk about the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.340
 activity and how bad it can get to 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.340
 be the problem to later be 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.340
 patient 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.719
 well we saw previously what happens to put 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.469
 a comment among prisoners contracted 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:07.959
 here in this present system the 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.129
 expected results when the muscle 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.519
 this relaxed that is that the activity 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.680
 electric be gym the only way to 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.560
 that is active is when in the process 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.930
 of initiation of the water there is a minimum 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.930
 electrical activity and nothing else 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.400
 and when the muscle is found 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.840
 contracted in electrical activities in 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.640
 the levels necessary to discard 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.640
 just some muscle problem 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.989
 well basically here we talk about the 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:43.379
 normal results what do you mean 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.629
 where some electrical activities are 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.190
 anomalies during the of 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.050
 electro grade 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.880
 here it says that everything about the 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.590
 normal results when he entered a 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.200
 hand will yield negative results 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.520
 it will be known that there are anomalies and 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.260
 depending on the results 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.120
 diagnose what kind of problem 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.519
 will have the patient 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.099
 Here we see some examples of some 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.730
 anomalies medical conditions 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:11.549
 denervation dermatomyositis myopathy 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.310
 neuropathy and poliomyelitis these are 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.639
 some of the most frequent 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.920
 problems that can be found 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.170
 through this technique of eternity 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.060
 Well, here we see a simple table 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.010
 of the techniques used for nancy 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.170
 muscular and nervous connect some 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.030
 outputs here see for example within 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.810
 neuro grams that are for blacks in 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.790
 this program that serve for the muscle 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.120
 and the motor plate for part d 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.660
 neuromuscular we are basically 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.120
 talking about the clear msp there are other 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.550
 techniques and much more for all 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.330
 adjustments and efficient all are valid 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:56.230
 to detect any type of problem 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:59.700
 each technique must can identify a 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.700
 specific problem 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.670
 well here the interpretation part of 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.220
 electromyogram here basically what 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:13.490
 we will see some graphs of 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.490
 of normal results with results 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.720
 animal anomalies in the part of the 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.240
 music analysis 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.250
 with the power of a motorboat the 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.610
 part minus the signal that is normal 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.790
 when there is no yellow and the 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.350
 myopathy that comes out of some problem in 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.580
 specific 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.230
 the applications of the electromyogram axis 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.900
 they are here as they say they are used 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.260
 practically in client applications 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.090
 biomedical 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.950
 since zac is a fundamental tool 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.430
 to practice diseases 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.680
 Neuromuscular zone builder 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.650
 It also tells us that not only for 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.390
 detect any anomaly during the 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.000
 core but also serves to 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.500
 develop prosthesis when a person 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.500
 is in this disability 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.330
 next we see the references 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.690
 when you vote find find 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.280
 much more advanced information or do 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.570
 a more in depth about this 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.699
 short but important issue that helps us 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.630
 in the learning process 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:24.610
 of the financing of the matter 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.500
 I hope you liked this brief and 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.900
 short explanation about the term gram 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.630
 of photography and the various subjects that 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.660
 can be found during the table 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.970
 Any doubt or concern we can 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.280
 solve in the loop of the classes of 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.150
 completion of the cut and semester 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.150
 thank you
