as<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:55.450> way<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:56.400> well<00:02:57.400> mostly<00:02:57.700> because<00:02:57.880> our

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
as a way of well mostly because our

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.520 
as a way of well mostly because our
plastics<00:02:58.390> only<00:02:58.570> twelve<00:02:58.780> feet<00:02:58.900> long<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.350> our

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
plastics only twelve feet long and our

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.050 
plastics only twelve feet long and our
roof<00:02:59.739> is<00:02:59.890> thirteen<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.549> half<00:03:00.579> feet<00:03:00.970> long

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
roof is thirteen and a half feet long

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.660 
roof is thirteen and a half feet long
and<00:03:03.180> that'll<00:03:04.180> give<00:03:04.329> us<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:05.079> flush<00:03:05.890> point<00:03:06.220> for

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
and that'll give us a flush point for

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.960 
and that'll give us a flush point for
the<00:03:06.850> plastic<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.930> mount<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.549> snow

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
the plastic to mount to so that the snow

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:19.289 
the plastic to mount to so that the snow
will<00:03:10.000> easily<00:03:10.329> slide<00:03:10.930> off<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.440> roof<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:18.299> our

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
will easily slide off of the roof so our

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.780 
will easily slide off of the roof so our
plan<00:03:19.570> here<00:03:19.959> is<00:03:20.320> that<00:03:21.040> we<00:03:21.250> are<00:03:21.660> going<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:23.790> put

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
plan here is that we are going to put

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.720 
plan here is that we are going to put
the<00:03:25.620> we<00:03:26.620> put<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:26.860> shingles<00:03:27.190> up<00:03:27.340> on<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.579> one

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
the we put the shingles up on the one

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.850 
the we put the shingles up on the one
side<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.180> roof<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.660> then<00:03:29.290> we'll<00:03:29.620> put<00:03:29.769> the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
side of the roof and then we'll put the

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.509 
side of the roof and then we'll put the
plastic<00:03:30.370> stuff<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.180> fold<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.019> over<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:32.519> do

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
plastic stuff and fold it over and do

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.390 
plastic stuff and fold it over and do
that<00:03:33.640> all<00:03:33.850> in<00:03:34.000> one<00:03:34.030> fell<00:03:34.989> swoop<00:03:35.049> on<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:36.160> other

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
that all in one fell swoop on the other

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.670 
that all in one fell swoop on the other
side<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:36.940> we<00:03:37.030> did<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.359> one<00:03:38.170> whole<00:03:38.380> side<00:03:38.650> of

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
side so we did the one whole side of

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.789 
side so we did the one whole side of
shingles<00:03:39.250> for<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.579> ridge<00:03:40.120> cab<00:03:40.359> and<00:03:40.799> then

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
shingles for the ridge cab and then

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.740 
shingles for the ridge cab and then
we'll<00:03:41.950> do<00:03:42.070> this<00:03:42.220> side<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.640> then<00:03:42.730> pound<00:03:42.970> those

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
we'll do this side and then pound those

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.220 
we'll do this side and then pound those
ones<00:03:44.019> down<00:03:44.260> at<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.500> same<00:03:44.680> time<00:03:45.300> so<00:03:46.300> we'll<00:03:47.110> let

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
ones down at the same time so we'll let

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.720 
ones down at the same time so we'll let
you<00:03:47.290> know<00:03:47.349> if<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.739> were<00:03:47.830> so<00:03:48.129> well<00:03:48.430> or<00:03:48.580> not

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.850 
we're gonna do is we're gonna fold over
the<00:04:16.209> top<00:04:16.390> first<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.140> then<00:04:17.260> slide<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:17.709> into

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
the top first and then slide it into

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.180 
the top first and then slide it into
place<00:04:18.130> into<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:19.090> channel<00:04:19.540> that's<00:04:19.660> already

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
place into a channel that's already

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.340 
place into a channel that's already
screwed<00:04:21.190> up<00:04:21.310> at<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.489> top<00:04:22.110> that<00:04:23.110> was<00:04:23.320> a

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
screwed up at the top that was a

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.690 
screwed up at the top that was a
horrible<00:04:23.680> mistake<00:04:24.570> don't<00:04:25.570> do<00:04:25.720> that<00:04:26.580> what<00:04:27.580> we

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
horrible mistake don't do that what we

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.810 
horrible mistake don't do that what we
in<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.810> problems<00:04:29.200> with<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:29.680> is<00:04:29.920> that<00:04:29.950> the

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
in the problems with that is that the

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.070 
in the problems with that is that the
panel's<00:04:31.180> were<00:04:31.360> really<00:04:31.600> hard<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:31.960> get

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
panel's were really hard to get

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.700 
panel's were really hard to get
underneath<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.620> shingles<00:04:32.980> and<00:04:34.320> in<00:04:35.320> addition

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
underneath the shingles and in addition

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.590 
underneath the shingles and in addition
to<00:04:35.740> that<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.220> panels<00:04:36.940> are<00:04:37.060> really<00:04:37.270> hard<00:04:37.450> to

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
to that the panels are really hard to

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.970 
to that the panels are really hard to
get<00:04:37.690> into<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.020> aluminum<00:04:38.260> end<00:04:38.710> caps<00:04:40.200> so<00:04:41.200> what

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
get into the aluminum end caps so what

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.730 
get into the aluminum end caps so what
we<00:04:42.100> ended<00:04:42.310> up<00:04:42.430> doing<00:04:42.490> is<00:04:42.880> we<00:04:43.030> ended<00:04:43.180> up<00:04:43.740> taking

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
we ended up doing is we ended up taking

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.600 
we ended up doing is we ended up taking
the<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:46.570> shingles<00:04:46.930> down<00:04:47.170> or<00:04:47.830> putting<00:04:48.490> the

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
the the shingles down or putting the

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.980 
the the shingles down or putting the
shingles<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.270> know<00:04:49.390> so<00:04:49.570> they<00:04:49.660> weren't<00:04:49.870> just

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
shingles you know so they weren't just

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.770 
shingles you know so they weren't just
nailed<00:04:50.890> down<00:04:51.010> anymore<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:52.000> then<00:04:52.360> we<00:04:52.450> put<00:04:52.630> the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
nailed down anymore and then we put the

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.980 
nailed down anymore and then we put the
metal<00:04:53.110> end<00:04:53.380> cap<00:04:53.650> on<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.280> ground<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:55.000> then

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
metal end cap on the ground and then

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.370 
metal end cap on the ground and then
screwed<00:04:56.890> it<00:04:57.010> in<00:04:57.130> from<00:04:57.970> above<00:04:58.300> well<00:04:58.810> while<00:04:59.230> the

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
screwed it in from above well while the

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.850 
screwed it in from above well while the
end<00:04:59.500> cap<00:04:59.650> was<00:04:59.800> already<00:05:00.070> on<00:05:00.630> so<00:05:01.630> here<00:05:02.470> I'll<00:05:02.740> show

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
end cap was already on so here I'll show

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.960 
end cap was already on so here I'll show
you<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.070> setup<00:05:03.280> that<00:05:03.460> we're<00:05:03.580> doing<00:05:05.790> at<00:05:06.790> the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
you the setup that we're doing at the

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.580 
you the setup that we're doing at the
top<00:05:07.150> we've<00:05:07.360> got<00:05:07.390> on<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.140> other<00:05:08.260> side<00:05:08.440> of<00:05:08.530> the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
just high enough to support our

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.630 
just high enough to support our
extension<00:05:17.169> ladder<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:18.480> then<00:05:19.480> in<00:05:19.630> the<00:05:19.720> bottom

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
extension ladder and then in the bottom

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.080 
extension ladder and then in the bottom
we<00:05:21.640> are<00:05:21.669> using<00:05:22.120> our<00:05:22.710> tractor<00:05:23.880> bucket<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:25.060> hold

the ladder and so that allows us we have
six<00:05:28.870> foot<00:05:29.020> panels<00:05:29.410> so<00:05:30.370> that<00:05:30.490> allows<00:05:30.700> us<00:05:30.730> to<00:05:30.970> do

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
six foot panels so that allows us to do

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.360
