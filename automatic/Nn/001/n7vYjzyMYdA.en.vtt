550 dollar mark that is very very cheap

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.860 
550 dollar mark that is very very cheap
that<00:04:20.230> is<00:04:20.380> like<00:04:20.590> near<00:04:20.890> GTX<00:04:21.370> 980<00:04:21.880> perform<00:04:22.360> more

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
that is like near GTX 980 perform more

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.950 
that is like near GTX 980 perform more
performance<00:04:23.290> pricing<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:23.919> it<00:04:24.960> performs

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
performance pricing and it performs

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.960 
performance pricing and it performs
better<00:04:26.200> than<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.620> 980<00:04:27.010> as<00:04:27.250> everyone<00:04:27.820> is

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
better than the 980 as everyone is

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.120 
better than the 980 as everyone is
saying<00:04:28.180> at<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.450> moment<00:04:28.810> so<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:29.740> is<00:04:29.890> going<00:04:30.070> to

market<00:05:16.870> who<00:05:17.200> knows<00:05:17.350> what<00:05:17.560> they're<00:05:17.680> going<00:05:17.770> to

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
market who knows what they're going to

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.670 
market who knows what they're going to
do<00:05:17.950> next<00:05:18.250> but<00:05:19.000> yeah<00:05:19.150> we've<00:05:19.300> got<00:05:19.480> that<00:05:19.750> moving

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
do next but yeah we've got that moving

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.380 
do next but yeah we've got that moving
on<00:05:20.980> we've<00:05:21.220> got<00:05:21.490> probably<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.210> most

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
on we've got probably the most

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.450 
on we've got probably the most
interesting<00:05:23.050> one<00:05:23.230> this<00:05:23.410> is<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:23.650> radeon<00:05:24.190> r9

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
interesting one this is the radeon r9

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.680 
interesting one this is the radeon r9
nano<00:05:25.420> now<00:05:25.810> md<00:05:26.440> is<00:05:26.470> quoting<00:05:27.100> that<00:05:27.250> this<00:05:27.700> has<00:05:27.970> two

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
nano now md is quoting that this has two

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.100 
nano now md is quoting that this has two
times<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.800> power<00:05:30.340> our<00:05:30.700> power<00:05:31.090> usage<00:05:31.300> of<00:05:31.630> TDP

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
times the power our power usage of TDP

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.170 
times the power our power usage of TDP

to perform power usage and TDP are

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.540 
to perform power usage and TDP are
necessarily<00:05:34.600> the<00:05:34.780> same<00:05:34.960> thing<00:05:35.260> but<00:05:35.440> for<00:05:35.770> the

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
necessarily the same thing but for the

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.280 
necessarily the same thing but for the
ease<00:05:36.880> of<00:05:36.940> this<00:05:37.270> video<00:05:37.540> I'll<00:05:37.660> just<00:05:37.840> say<00:05:38.050> in

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
ease of this video I'll just say in

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.220 
ease of this video I'll just say in
terms<00:05:38.890> of<00:05:39.160> power<00:05:39.670> usage<00:05:39.970> to<00:05:40.390> performance<00:05:40.990> it

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
terms of power usage to performance it

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.980 
terms of power usage to performance it
has<00:05:41.770> two<00:05:42.100> times<00:05:42.480> better<00:05:43.480> power<00:05:43.840> to

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
has two times better power to

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.700 
has two times better power to
performance<00:05:44.530> ratio<00:05:45.000> than<00:05:46.000> 290x<00:05:46.870> that<00:05:47.560> is

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
performance ratio than 290x that is

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.290 
performance ratio than 290x that is
amazing<00:05:48.040> this<00:05:48.400> thing<00:05:48.610> is<00:05:48.730> only<00:05:48.820> supposed<00:05:49.150> to

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
amazing this thing is only supposed to

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.350 
amazing this thing is only supposed to
have<00:05:49.480> a<00:05:50.580> 175<00:05:51.580> watt<00:05:52.000> TDP<00:05:52.690> that<00:05:53.110> is<00:05:53.230> versus<00:05:53.800> the

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
have a 175 watt TDP that is versus the

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.520 
have a 175 watt TDP that is versus the
275<00:05:55.360> wats<00:05:55.600> EDPs<00:05:56.140> of<00:05:56.350> the<00:05:56.590> other<00:05:56.740> two<00:05:56.950> cards<00:05:57.490> so

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
275 wats EDPs of the other two cards so

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.790 
275 wats EDPs of the other two cards so
yeah<00:05:59.530> and<00:05:59.800> since<00:06:00.490> online<00:06:01.210> fury<00:06:01.780> their<00:06:02.080> code<00:06:02.560> 1

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
yeah and since online fury their code 1

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.400 
yeah and since online fury their code 1
and<00:06:03.070> the<00:06:03.760> fury<00:06:04.000> X<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.570> world<00:06:04.750> good<00:06:04.990> one<00:06:05.140> seems

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.320 
and the fury X the world good one seems
to<00:06:05.500> have<00:06:05.590> the<00:06:05.740> same<00:06:05.950> TDP<00:06:06.580> that<00:06:07.030> makes<00:06:07.210> me

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
to have the same TDP that makes me

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.480 
to have the same TDP that makes me
believe<00:06:07.480> that<00:06:07.960> they<00:06:08.320> are<00:06:08.350> both<00:06:08.740> fully<00:06:09.130> fledged

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
believe that they are both fully fledged

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.120 
believe that they are both fully fledged
GPU<00:06:10.180> so<00:06:10.510> yeah<00:06:11.200> I<00:06:11.230> don't<00:06:11.530> know<00:06:11.590> we<00:06:11.710> just<00:06:11.860> have<00:06:12.040> to

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
GPU so yeah I don't know we just have to

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.220 
GPU so yeah I don't know we just have to
wait<00:06:12.250> and<00:06:12.280> see<00:06:12.460> by<00:06:13.060> continuing<00:06:13.360> on<00:06:13.750> this

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
wait and see by continuing on this

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.230 
wait and see by continuing on this
little<00:06:14.410> odd<00:06:14.680> 9<00:06:14.950> nano<00:06:15.220> it's<00:06:15.460> about<00:06:15.730> 15

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
little odd 9 nano it's about 15

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.000 
little odd 9 nano it's about 15
centimeters<00:06:16.510> long<00:06:17.110> since<00:06:17.350> about<00:06:17.530> that<00:06:17.770> big

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
centimeters long since about that big

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.890 
centimeters long since about that big
it's<00:06:18.220> pretty<00:06:18.430> fucking<00:06:18.700> small<00:06:19.150> and<00:06:19.419> it's<00:06:19.720> just

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
it's pretty fucking small and it's just

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.159 
it's pretty fucking small and it's just
being<00:06:20.050> cooled<00:06:20.350> by<00:06:20.500> 11<00:06:21.310> reasonably<00:06:22.270> big<00:06:22.600> fan<00:06:22.930> I

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
being cooled by 11 reasonably big fan I

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.800 
being cooled by 11 reasonably big fan I
mean<00:06:23.350> it<00:06:23.710> looks<00:06:24.220> tiny<00:06:24.580> but<00:06:24.940> the<00:06:25.390> power<00:06:25.630> usage

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
mean it looks tiny but the power usage

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.740 
mean it looks tiny but the power usage
is<00:06:26.110> low<00:06:26.640> 175<00:06:27.640> watts<00:06:27.970> I'm<00:06:28.180> pretty<00:06:28.390> sure<00:06:28.540> that's

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
is low 175 watts I'm pretty sure that's

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.310 
is low 175 watts I'm pretty sure that's
only<00:06:28.990> what<00:06:29.650> 25<00:06:30.100> watts<00:06:30.400> of<00:06:30.700> war<00:06:30.940> 25<00:06:31.690> watt<00:06:32.020> sorry

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
only what 25 watts of war 25 watt sorry

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.700 
only what 25 watts of war 25 watt sorry
more<00:06:32.950> than<00:06:33.130> my<00:06:33.390> 7870<00:06:34.390> so<00:06:34.660> don't<00:06:35.320> quote<00:06:35.530> me<00:06:35.680> on

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
more than my 7870 so don't quote me on

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.700 
more than my 7870 so don't quote me on
that<00:06:35.830> bump<00:06:36.250> pretty<00:06:36.640> sure<00:06:36.940> that<00:06:37.120> is<00:06:37.240> true<00:06:37.570> so<00:06:38.230> of

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
that bump pretty sure that is true so of

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.380 
that bump pretty sure that is true so of
course<00:06:38.950> we<00:06:39.190> don't<00:06:39.400> know<00:06:39.520> how<00:06:39.760> many<00:06:39.820> stream

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
course we don't know how many stream

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.360 
course we don't know how many stream
processors<00:06:40.810> this<00:06:41.110> will<00:06:41.290> have<00:06:41.440> everything<00:06:42.100> is

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
processors this will have everything is

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.060 
processors this will have everything is
TBA<00:06:42.790> TBA<00:06:42.910> TBA<00:06:43.470> so<00:06:44.470> we're<00:06:44.590> just<00:06:44.620> gonna<00:06:44.830> have<00:06:44.950> to

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
pricing of that card Eva so yeah that's

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.770 
pricing of that card Eva so yeah that's
pretty<00:06:51.130> much<00:06:51.370> it<00:06:51.430> the<00:06:51.730> big<00:06:51.940> four<00:06:52.240> we've<00:06:52.600> got

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
pretty much it the big four we've got

pretty much it the big four we've got
the<00:06:52.870> online<00:06:53.260> theory<00:06:53.710> the<00:06:54.160> fury<00:06:54.460> xt<00:06:55.060> or<00:06:55.240> the
