00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
did exactly the same thing for the first

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.420 
did exactly the same thing for the first
diesel<00:02:52.940> engined<00:02:53.300> r10<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.950> was<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> nice

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
diesel engined r10 and that was a nice

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.980 
diesel engined r10 and that was a nice
feeling<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:56.180> one<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.420> that's<00:02:56.780> it

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
feeling but this one just that's it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.930 
feeling but this one just that's it
there's<00:02:57.710> a<00:02:57.800> quite<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> special<00:02:58.640> one<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.820> was<00:02:58.910> a

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
there's a quite a special one it was a

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.120

good<00:02:59.120> lap<00:02:59.300> as<00:02:59.450> well<00:03:01.600> so<00:03:02.600> can<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.230> do<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.740> have<00:03:03.890> I

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
good lap as well so can you do it have I

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.830 
good lap as well so can you do it have I
asked<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.520> worth<00:03:04.670> question<00:03:05.240> actually<00:03:05.630> I
