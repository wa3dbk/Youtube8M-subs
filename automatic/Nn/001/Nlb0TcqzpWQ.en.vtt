the<00:00:46.079> other<00:00:46.230> way<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.090> an

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the other way to do it is to have an

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.920 
the other way to do it is to have an
honorific<00:00:48.510> or<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.890> example<00:00:49.950> or<00:00:50.520> bar<00:00:50.940> son<00:00:51.329> or

tall son or car son or GE son okay and
of<00:00:57.149> course<00:00:57.420> these<00:00:57.899> words<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.710> son

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
of course these words actually have son

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.389 
of course these words actually have son
after<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.850> which<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.680> always<00:01:01.680> used<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.129> people

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
after it which is always used for people

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.100 
after it which is always used for people
other<00:01:02.760> than<00:01:03.000> your<00:01:03.149> own<00:01:03.329> family<00:01:04.199> or<00:01:04.350> yourself

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
other than your own family or yourself

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.969 
other than your own family or yourself
when<00:01:07.110> you're<00:01:07.200> talking<00:01:07.439> about<00:01:07.560> your<00:01:07.799> own

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
when you're talking about your own

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.990 
when you're talking about your own
family<00:01:08.369> you're<00:01:08.939> being<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.420> more<00:01:09.689> modest

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
family you're being a lot more modest

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.850 
family you're being a lot more modest
and<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.600> language<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.380> slightly

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and so the language is slightly

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620 
and so the language is slightly
different<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:14.850> look<00:01:15.119> at<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.270> words<00:01:15.420> for

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
different if we look at the words for

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.149 
different if we look at the words for
father<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.170> mother<00:01:16.380> they're<00:01:16.680> completely

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
father and mother they're completely

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:17.539 
father and mother they're completely
different

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
different

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.179 
different
so<00:01:17.880> father<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.330> chichi<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:19.500> opposed<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.920> or

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
so father is chichi as opposed to or

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.980 
so father is chichi as opposed to or
taller<00:01:20.520> son<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:21.390> you're<00:01:21.600> talking<00:01:21.840> about
