00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
could do that would allow me enough

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.240 
could do that would allow me enough
means<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.689> do<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.990> things<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.409> really<00:01:19.740> want<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
do but now that I'm doing the thing that

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340 
do but now that I'm doing the thing that
provides<00:01:23.520> me<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.790> means<00:01:24.119> I'm<00:01:24.509> finding<00:01:25.229> that
