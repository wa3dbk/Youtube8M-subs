00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.449
 control panel 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.110
 if you need the control panel for the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.719

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.129
 category view 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.620
 to make the thicker package easy 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.780
 find we switch this to large or 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.190
 small icons 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.120

 save cup field in this example 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.830
 I opt for a DVD drive 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.080
 or for an external hard drive to it 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.820
 a backup 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.950
 You can also use a USB disk or other 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.460
 link external storage media to the beak u

 to make 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.070
 make sure the disk is selected and 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.070

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.940
 determine by windows or determine yourself 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.160
 if you turn off automatically on 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.010
 then a copy is made of the 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.520

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.889
 You can see the schedule that backups here 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.670
 every Sunday at 7 a.m. 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.950

 Here you get three options that you 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.930
 can indicate whether you do this daily 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.250
 want to do weekly or monthly 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.930
 which day of the week the backup 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.340

 from the backup it started right away 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.930
 make the backup 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.320
 backup you want a new backup immediately 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.570
 without waiting for the schedule 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.880
 then click on backup now and the 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.930
