real easy tutorial on how to do it but

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.089 
real easy tutorial on how to do it but
it<00:02:09.179> was<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.869> basically<00:02:10.259> took<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.890> 10

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
it was it basically took it like 10

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
megabyte download 536 I think don't

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.850 
megabyte download 536 I think don't
quote<00:02:18.630> me<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.200> around<00:02:19.470> there<00:02:19.710> it's

quote me on that it's around there it's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.300 
quote me on that it's around there it's
basically<00:02:20.700> half<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.210> gigabyte<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:22.310> storage

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
basically half a gigabyte of storage

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.010 
basically half a gigabyte of storage

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
the most realistic thing in the world

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.580 
the most realistic thing in the world
but<00:02:55.910> it's<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.209> pretty<00:02:57.750> game<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.170> know<00:02:58.290> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
nicer with the shadows and everything I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.729 
nicer with the shadows and everything I
do<00:03:05.670> notice<00:03:05.970> though<00:03:06.270> if<00:03:06.450> you're<00:03:07.110> playing<00:03:07.290> split

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
do notice though if you're playing split

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.350 
do notice though if you're playing split
screen<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.459> there's<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.730> lot<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.880> chaos<00:03:09.239> going

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
screen and there's a lot of chaos going

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.360 
screen and there's a lot of chaos going
on<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.410> does<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:11.070> will<00:03:11.370> lab<00:03:11.610> pretty<00:03:12.450> hard<00:03:13.370> once

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
on it does it will lab pretty hard once

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.790 
on it does it will lab pretty hard once
in<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.580> while<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:16.200> maybe<00:03:16.320> some<00:03:16.650> better

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
in a while so maybe some better

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.289 
in a while so maybe some better
performance<00:03:17.400> with<00:03:17.640> some<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.000> these<00:03:18.120> bigger

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
performance with some of these bigger

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.810 
performance with some of these bigger
maps<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:19.160> don't<00:03:20.160> know<00:03:20.250> if<00:03:20.340> that's<00:03:20.519> just<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
maps I don't know if that's just the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.310 
maps I don't know if that's just the
problem<00:03:20.970> they're<00:03:21.209> running<00:03:21.480> into<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.200> they

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
problem they're running into and they

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.440 
problem they're running into and they
either<00:03:22.530> trying<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.010> address<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.459> or<00:03:23.580> what<00:03:23.790> but

fucks your life up and if you're the

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.370 
fucks your life up and if you're the
driver<00:05:35.730> just<00:05:36.390> one<00:05:36.600> can<00:05:36.840> as<00:05:37.020> you<00:05:37.200> see<00:05:37.350> right

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
driver just one can as you see right

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.450 
driver just one can as you see right
there<00:05:37.770> so<00:05:38.730> I<00:05:39.950> don't<00:05:40.950> know<00:05:41.040> if<00:05:41.130> they're<00:05:41.310> doing

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
there so I don't know if they're doing

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.190 
there so I don't know if they're doing
that<00:05:41.610> on<00:05:42.180> purpose<00:05:42.630> but<00:05:44.090> it<00:05:45.090> seems<00:05:45.450> a<00:05:45.870> little

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
that on purpose but it seems a little

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.410 
that on purpose but it seems a little
unfair<00:05:46.680> for<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:47.670> driver<00:05:48.210> who<00:05:49.730> is<00:05:50.730> more
