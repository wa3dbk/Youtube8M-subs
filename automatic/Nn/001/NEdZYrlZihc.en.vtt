now that that's the problem is that the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.390 
now that that's the problem is that the
meat<00:00:28.199> just<00:00:28.560> needs<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.099> quickly

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
refrigerated and if we can just do that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.700 
refrigerated and if we can just do that
then<00:00:32.579> it'll<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.880> fine<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> late<00:00:34.110> 1950s
