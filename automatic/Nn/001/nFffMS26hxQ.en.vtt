00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
playing modern warfare 2 because I'm

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.050

pretty good at it as you can see most of

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.399 
pretty good at it as you can see most of
my<00:01:57.149> deaths<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.140> we're<00:01:58.290> just

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
my deaths like this one we're just

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.810 
my deaths like this one we're just
because<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.680> couldn't<00:01:58.979> hit<00:01:59.159> no<00:01:59.310> scopes<00:01:59.369> from

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820

like<00:01:59.969> two<00:02:00.210> feet<00:02:00.390> away<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:01.259> I'm<00:02:01.350> pretty<00:02:01.469> good

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
like two feet away but I'm pretty good

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.469 
like two feet away but I'm pretty good
at<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.829> game<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.670> I'm<00:02:02.790> not<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.210> good<00:02:03.420> at

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
at this game but I'm not really good at

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.070 
at this game but I'm not really good at
the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.100 
the
his<00:02:04.200> titles<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.360> don't<00:02:06.510> play<00:02:06.660> them<00:02:06.900> I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
his titles so I just don't play them I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.590 
his titles so I just don't play them I
typically<00:02:08.040> put<00:02:08.220> my<00:02:08.369> time<00:02:08.580> now<00:02:08.790> playing<00:02:09.300> games

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
typically put my time now playing games

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.580 
typically put my time now playing games
like<00:02:09.720> madden<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:11.760> Forza<00:02:12.330> which<00:02:12.590> really

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
like madden and like Forza which really

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.150 
like madden and like Forza which really
aren't<00:02:14.070> youtube<00:02:14.640> worthy<00:02:15.300> games<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:16.010> put<00:02:17.010> on

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
because people aren't gonna watch them I

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.610 
because people aren't gonna watch them I

understand I've already tried they get a

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.990 
understand I've already tried they get a
fraction<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.980> views<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.220> my<00:02:23.790> other
