hey<00:00:06.840> what's<00:00:07.080> up<00:00:07.200> everyone<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.740> welcome<00:00:07.859> to

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
hey what's up everyone and welcome to

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.820 
hey what's up everyone and welcome to
another<00:00:08.340> one<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.850> my<00:00:08.969> tutorials<00:00:09.270> and<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:10.620> one

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
another one of my tutorials and this one

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.799 
another one of my tutorials and this one
of<00:00:11.100> explaining<00:00:11.700> how<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:11.940> change<00:00:12.270> the<00:00:12.420> mouse

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
of explaining how to change the mouse

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.429 
of explaining how to change the mouse
speed<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.620> your<00:00:13.860> scripts<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:15.300> maybe<00:00:15.599> your

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
speed in your scripts so maybe your

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.280 
speed in your scripts so maybe your
current<00:00:16.980> now<00:00:17.099> speed<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.610> a<00:00:17.640> bit<00:00:17.820> too<00:00:17.970> slow

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
current now speed is a bit too slow

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.050 
current now speed is a bit too slow
maybe<00:00:19.290> it's<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> bit<00:00:19.590> too<00:00:19.770> fast<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.430> want

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
maybe it's a bit too fast and you want

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.870 
maybe it's a bit too fast and you want
to<00:00:21.180> be<00:00:21.390> able<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.750> change<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.369> so<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.520> more

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
to be able to change it so it's more

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.160 
to be able to change it so it's more
human-like<00:00:24.270> and<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:26.359> we'll<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.480> seeing<00:00:27.930> that

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
human-like and so we'll be seeing that

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.800 
human-like and so we'll be seeing that
in<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.529> tutorial<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:30.150> first<00:00:30.359> thing<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
in this tutorial and the first thing to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.500 
in this tutorial and the first thing to
see<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.859> current<00:00:32.160> mouse<00:00:32.369> speed<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.940> my

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
see is the current mouse speed in my

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.780 
see is the current mouse speed in my
script<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.769> we'll<00:00:34.980> change<00:00:35.220> it<00:00:35.400> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
script and then we'll change it to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.120 
script and then we'll change it to
compare<00:00:36.150> the<00:00:36.239> different<00:00:36.510> speeds<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.950> just

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
compare the different speeds so I just

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:47.030 
compare the different speeds so I just
log<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:43.190> I'll<00:00:44.190> run<00:00:44.550> my<00:00:44.760> script<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:46.040> see

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
log in here I'll run my script and see

00:00:47.040 --> 00:01:04.270 
log in here I'll run my script and see
what<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> mouse<00:00:47.550> speed<00:00:47.940> is

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.340 

as<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.119> may<00:01:05.269> see<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.659> mask<00:01:05.869> me<00:01:06.049> that's<00:01:06.200> not

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
as you may see the mask me that's not

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.960 
as you may see the mask me that's not
too<00:01:06.560> fast<00:01:07.210> but<00:01:08.210> it's<00:01:08.330> pretty<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:10.490> fact<00:01:10.729> quite

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
too fast but it's pretty in fact quite

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.999 
too fast but it's pretty in fact quite
slow<00:01:11.860> in<00:01:13.690> it's<00:01:14.690> not<00:01:14.810> really<00:01:15.049> human<00:01:15.320> like<00:01:15.619> it<00:01:15.890> i

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
slow in it's not really human like it i

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.859 
slow in it's not really human like it i
think<00:01:16.250> i<00:01:16.310> think<00:01:16.549> a<00:01:16.610> human<00:01:16.790> move<00:01:17.570> them<00:01:17.720> out<00:01:17.840> a

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
think i think a human move them out a

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.950 
think i think a human move them out a
bit<00:01:18.020> faster<00:01:18.530> between<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:18.890> rocks<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:22.960> so

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
bit faster between the rocks and so

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:40.090 
bit faster between the rocks and so
let's<00:01:24.229> change<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:28.520> let's<00:01:28.850> compare

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.130 

so<00:01:40.760> in<00:01:40.850> order<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.119> change<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.570> our<00:01:41.689> speed<00:01:42.729> and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
so in order to change of our speed and

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.530 
so in order to change of our speed and
the<00:01:45.140> first<00:01:45.320> thing<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:45.500> have<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.680> do<00:01:46.390> you<00:01:47.390> go

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
the first thing you have to do you go

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:56.380 
the first thing you have to do you go
and<00:01:47.689> look<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.170> API<00:01:53.140> go<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.440> index<00:01:55.240> here<00:01:56.240> we

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
and look the API go to the index here we

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.969 
and look the API go to the index here we
can<00:01:56.570> see<00:01:56.720> all<00:01:57.049> of<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.290> different<00:01:57.320> methods

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
can see all of the different methods

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.060 
can see all of the different methods
there<00:01:58.159> are<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:59.390> we'll<00:01:59.539> look<00:01:59.659> at<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.960> s4<00:02:00.830> set

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
there are so we'll look at the s4 set

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:09.130 
there are so we'll look at the s4 set
mouse<00:02:01.340> speed<00:02:02.560> see<00:02:03.560> if<00:02:03.680> it's<00:02:03.830> around<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:08.690> isn't

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
mouse speed see if it's around it isn't

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:17.130 
mouse speed see if it's around it isn't
so<00:02:09.500> we<00:02:09.649> can<00:02:09.830> look<00:02:09.979> at<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.220> M

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.640 

this<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.980> mouse<00:02:18.310> class<00:02:22.410> indeed<00:02:23.410> in<00:02:23.560> the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
this is the mouse class indeed in the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.770 
this is the mouse class indeed in the
mouse<00:02:23.830> class<00:02:24.130> there's<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.760> set<00:02:24.940> speed<00:02:25.270> method

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
mouse class there's a set speed method

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.780 
mouse class there's a set speed method
so<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.590> how<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.830> look<00:02:27.160> around<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.520> API

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
so this is how you look around the API

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.210 
so this is how you look around the API
you<00:02:28.330> first<00:02:28.600> look<00:02:28.840> for<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.050> method<00:02:29.290> index<00:02:29.800> and

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
you first look for the method index and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.680 
you first look for the method index and
I<00:02:30.280> think<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.550> can't<00:02:30.790> find<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.300> then<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.540> go

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
I think you can't find it then you go

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.890 
I think you can't find it then you go
and<00:02:31.720> look<00:02:31.900> for<00:02:31.959> this<00:02:32.170> Pacific<00:02:32.500> class<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:34.450> assume

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
and look for this Pacific class I assume

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.690 
and look for this Pacific class I assume
that<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.260> other<00:02:35.410> mouse<00:02:35.709> class<00:02:36.040> would<00:02:36.430> hold

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
that the other mouse class would hold

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.390 
that the other mouse class would hold
methods<00:02:37.180> for<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.510> mouse<00:02:37.780> itself<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:39.190> same

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
methods for the mouse itself the same

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.120 
methods for the mouse itself the same
way<00:02:39.640> as<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.209> RS<00:02:40.540> object<00:02:40.959> class<00:02:41.290> holds<00:02:41.830> method

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
way as the RS object class holds method

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.270 
way as the RS object class holds method
for<00:02:42.370> our<00:02:42.610> subjects<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:44.680> using<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:45.070> bit<00:02:45.190> of

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
for our subjects so just using a bit of

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.559 
for our subjects so just using a bit of
logic<00:02:45.459> there<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.880> can<00:02:46.000> find<00:02:46.030> your<00:02:46.270> methods

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
logic there you can find your methods

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:54.930 
logic there you can find your methods
easily<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.350> in<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.560> loop<00:02:53.739> we<00:02:54.580> can<00:02:54.760> say

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
easily so and in the loop we can say

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.590 
easily so and in the loop we can say
Mouse<00:02:55.269> set<00:02:56.260> speed<00:02:57.600> say<00:02:58.600> for<00:02:58.780> example<00:03:00.600> random

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
Mouse set speed say for example random

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.900 
Mouse set speed say for example random
between<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.930> four<00:03:02.110> five

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:40.610 

let's<00:03:06.510> save<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.440> try<00:03:07.740> again

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.350 

here's<00:03:41.620> worry<00:03:41.860> about<00:03:42.040> that<00:03:42.220> air<00:03:42.670> called<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.120> lot

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:04:08.700 

it<00:03:48.930> decides<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.710> start<00:03:50.010> up<00:03:50.900> there<00:03:51.900> we<00:03:51.990> go

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:23.750 

so<00:04:09.710> they<00:04:09.860> log<00:04:10.100> back<00:04:10.310> in<00:04:10.960> and

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:31.060 

now<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.480> can<00:04:24.750> see<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.080> speed<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.620> faster

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.680 

possibly<00:04:32.070> more<00:04:32.220> human-like<00:04:32.520> maybe<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.600> a

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
possibly more human-like maybe it's a

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.120 
possibly more human-like maybe it's a
bit<00:04:33.810> too<00:04:33.960> fast<00:04:34.140> now<00:04:34.470> so<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:34.770> may<00:04:34.890> want<00:04:35.070> to

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
bit too fast now so you may want to

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.770 
bit too fast now so you may want to
change<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.700> just<00:04:36.180> play<00:04:36.360> around<00:04:36.450> with<00:04:36.720> the

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
change it to just play around with the

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.150 
change it to just play around with the
numbers<00:04:37.430> know<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.060> higher<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.510> numbers

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
numbers know that the higher the numbers

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.700 
numbers know that the higher the numbers
the<00:04:41.160> slower<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.730> mouse<00:04:41.880> will<00:04:42.120> be<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:43.320> if<00:04:43.620> you

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
the slower the mouse will be so if you

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.230 
the slower the mouse will be so if you
put<00:04:43.830> very<00:04:44.070> low<00:04:44.280> values<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:44.820> mouse<00:04:44.970> would<00:04:45.090> be

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
put very low values the mouse would be

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.320 
put very low values the mouse would be
exceedingly<00:04:45.950> fast<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:47.730> if<00:04:47.820> it<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.060> numbers

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
exceedingly fast and if it the numbers

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.120 
exceedingly fast and if it the numbers
too<00:04:48.480> high<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:49.260> runners<00:04:49.530> will<00:04:49.650> be<00:04:49.680> too<00:04:49.920> slow

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
too high and runners will be too slow

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.920 
too high and runners will be too slow
I'd<00:04:50.700> suggest<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.210> valley<00:04:51.390> between<00:04:51.570> four<00:04:51.900> and

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
I'd suggest the valley between four and

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.400 
I'd suggest the valley between four and
six<00:04:52.200> that's<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:53.100> decent<00:04:53.580> speed<00:04:54.200> anything<00:04:55.200> over

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
six that's a decent speed anything over

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.800 
six that's a decent speed anything over
8<00:04:55.650> i'd<00:04:56.280> say<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.670> be<00:04:56.910> too<00:04:57.120> slow<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.360> anything

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
8 i'd say to be too slow and anything

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.620 
8 i'd say to be too slow and anything
under<00:04:58.080> 4<00:04:58.110> i'd<00:04:58.800> say<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.040> be<00:04:59.190> too<00:04:59.430> quick<00:04:59.670> but<00:05:00.330> it

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
under 4 i'd say to be too quick but it

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.960 
under 4 i'd say to be too quick but it
all<00:05:00.750> depends<00:05:01.050> on<00:05:01.200> your<00:05:01.290> gameplay<00:05:01.820> if<00:05:02.820> you

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
all depends on your gameplay if you

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.730 
all depends on your gameplay if you
usually<00:05:03.210> move<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.660> mouse<00:05:03.810> well<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.470> screen

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
usually move the mouse well the screen

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.650 
usually move the mouse well the screen
very<00:05:04.890> quickly<00:05:05.190> then<00:05:05.820> you<00:05:05.940> may<00:05:06.060> want<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.420> lower

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
very quickly then you may want a lower

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.230 
very quickly then you may want a lower
mouse<00:05:06.930> speed<00:05:07.260> or<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:08.340> may<00:05:08.460> even<00:05:08.610> want<00:05:08.760> to<00:05:09.060> let

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
mouse speed or you may even want to let

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.210 
mouse speed or you may even want to let
the<00:05:09.390> user<00:05:09.440> decide<00:05:10.440> on<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:10.770> mouse<00:05:10.920> speed

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
the user decide on the mouse speed

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.030 
the user decide on the mouse speed
himself<00:05:11.990> we've<00:05:12.990> got<00:05:13.170> a<00:05:13.200> user<00:05:13.470> input<00:05:13.800> in<00:05:13.980> a

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
himself we've got a user input in a

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.120 
himself we've got a user input in a
future<00:05:14.430> lesson<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:15.750> so<00:05:16.500> that's<00:05:16.650> pretty<00:05:17.010> much

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
future lesson and so that's pretty much

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.460 
future lesson and so that's pretty much
how<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.370> change<00:05:17.610> your<00:05:17.730> mouse<00:05:18.030> speed<00:05:18.330> I<00:05:18.540> hope

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
how to change your mouse speed I hope

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.870 
how to change your mouse speed I hope
you<00:05:19.620> enjoyed<00:05:19.890> it<00:05:19.920> you<00:05:20.100> learn<00:05:20.280> something<00:05:20.730> and
