million<00:01:14.430> steps<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.270> needed<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.869> access<00:01:16.049> that

million steps I needed to access that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.980 
million steps I needed to access that
sounds<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> huge<00:01:17.850> number<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.659> that's<00:01:18.840> what

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
sounds like a huge number so that's what

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.130 
sounds like a huge number so that's what
that<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.350> actual<00:01:19.619> distance<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.990> average

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that in actual distance the average

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.600 
that in actual distance the average
stride<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.770> person<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.520> 2.5<00:01:24.180> feet<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:25.110> are

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
stride of a person is 2.5 feet there are

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.420 
stride of a person is 2.5 feet there are
5,280<00:01:26.610> feet<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.720> mild<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.740> let's<00:01:28.920> take<00:01:29.130> 2.5

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
5,280 feet in a mild so let's take 2.5

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.910 
5,280 feet in a mild so let's take 2.5
and<00:01:30.240> multiply<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.720> by<00:01:30.869> 2<00:01:31.049> million<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.770> our

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and multiply that by 2 million and our

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.030 
and multiply that by 2 million and our
answer<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.340> 5<00:01:32.579> million<00:01:33.090> feet<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.530> defied<00:01:34.829> 5

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
answer is 5 million feet if we defied 5

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.620 
answer is 5 million feet if we defied 5
