00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
clipped my real hair out of the way and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
clipped my real hair out of the way and
I<00:00:58.890> braided<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.489> hair<00:01:00.410> like<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.430> big<00:01:03.329> brace

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
I braided the hair like so and big brace

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.700 
I braided the hair like so and big brace
and<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.199> cut<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> ends<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.369> them<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.049> I

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and then I cut the ends of them so and I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.560 
and then I cut the ends of them so and I
cut<00:01:07.950> them<00:01:08.100> kind<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.460> layered<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
cut them kind of layered like in a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.300 
cut them kind of layered like in a
layered<00:01:09.840> effect<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.979> back

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
layered effect like this is the back

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.560 
layered effect like this is the back
braid<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:13.250> this<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> middle<00:01:14.939> line<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
braid then this is the middle line and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.359 
braid then this is the middle line and
this<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.950> top<00:01:17.580> right<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
this is the top right so this was a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
this is the top right so this was a
little<00:01:20.790> bit<00:01:20.939> shorter<00:01:21.600> than<00:01:21.720> their<00:01:21.900> line<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
little bit shorter than their line and

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.140 
little bit shorter than their line and
that<00:01:22.860> was<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> little<00:01:23.220> shorter<00:01:23.640> than<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.939> one

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
that was a little shorter than that one

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
that was a little shorter than that one
so<00:01:24.720> hopefully<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.380> kind<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.070> being

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
so hopefully it be kind of being

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.910 
so hopefully it be kind of being
prettying<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.330> little<00:01:27.960> bit<00:01:28.080> later<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.770> did

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
prettying a little bit later and I did

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.580 
prettying a little bit later and I did
the<00:01:29.040> same<00:01:29.250> thing<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.880> side<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.470> on

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the same thing on this side and then on

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
the same thing on this side and then on
this<00:01:31.799> side<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.100> had<00:01:32.369> extra<00:01:32.850> breathing<00:01:33.000> ailments

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
this side I had extra breathing ailments

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.870 
this side I had extra breathing ailments
toast<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.020> little<00:01:34.049> bit<00:01:34.380> shorter<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.610> they'll

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
toast a little bit shorter then they'll

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.300 
toast a little bit shorter then they'll
in<00:01:36.090> there<00:01:36.590> cuz<00:01:37.590> there's<00:01:37.799> at<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> very<00:01:38.250> very

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
in there cuz there's at the very very

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.230 
in there cuz there's at the very very
top<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.140> look<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:41.240> just

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
top and this is what they look like just

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.480 
top and this is what they look like just
some<00:01:42.509> big<00:01:42.720> plants<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.720> what<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.750> used<00:01:46.049> was

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
some big plants and what I used was

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.200 
some big plants and what I used was
white<00:01:47.490> rain<00:01:48.560> volumizing<00:01:49.560> mousse<00:01:50.030> just<00:01:51.030> some

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
white rain volumizing mousse just some

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.160 
white rain volumizing mousse just some
cheap<00:01:51.450> moves<00:01:51.799> cost<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:53.240> 96<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.509> something

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
cheap moves cost like 96 or something

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.800 
cheap moves cost like 96 or something
$1<00:01:56.009> pretty<00:01:56.549> much<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.060> then<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.270> used<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.659> white

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
$1 pretty much and then I used the white

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.330 
$1 pretty much and then I used the white
range<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.740> maximum<00:01:59.430> hold<00:01:59.729> hairspray<00:02:01.340> and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
ends and then chopped off the excess

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.610 
ends and then chopped off the excess
that<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.810> didn't<00:02:48.110> want<00:02:49.390> yeah<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:50.960> I<00:02:51.020> alternated

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
that I didn't want yeah so I alternated

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.060 
that I didn't want yeah so I alternated
everything<00:02:52.340> breaks<00:02:52.640> between<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.270> mousse<00:02:53.450> and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
everything breaks between the mousse and

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.100 
everything breaks between the mousse and
the<00:02:55.070> olive<00:02:55.490> oil<00:02:55.670> hair<00:02:56.120> just<00:02:56.420> cream<00:02:56.720> because<00:02:57.020> I

the olive oil hair just cream because I

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.540 
the olive oil hair just cream because I
didn't<00:02:57.350> know<00:02:57.470> which<00:02:57.620> product<00:02:58.040> will<00:02:58.160> work<00:02:58.310> best

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550
