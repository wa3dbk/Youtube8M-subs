00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
kids to believe that all season long and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.610 
we just kind of have been rolling a
little<00:02:12.190> bit<00:02:12.310> at<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.519> end<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:13.440> hopefully<00:02:14.440> that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
little bit at the end and hopefully that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.130 
little bit at the end and hopefully that
carries<00:02:14.950> through<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.140> younger

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
carries through and that the younger

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.750 
carries through and that the younger
kids<00:02:17.440> take<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.519> next<00:02:18.700> year<00:02:19.000> with<00:02:19.600> us
