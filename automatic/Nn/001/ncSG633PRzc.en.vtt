00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.840

 Let's start recipe by mass 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.989
 Pancake unifying we will beat 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:52.180

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:53.769

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.989

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.110
 I chose the most suitable for the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.330
 Katarina grid insurance and figs to 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.520
 counting the fruit is very simple 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.590
 the fig for us to put in the middle 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.450
 nectarine and the ps that makes a pole 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.490
 on the whole side of it and gives a 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.409
 geladinha to separate the two parts 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.740
 and then we take seed I go 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.409
 already cut the two lemons that 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.990
 We'll use it to make the syrup that 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.880
 before cutting I'll take lemon zest 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.399
 if you had not peeler you 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.950
 can make the races with the knife even already 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.909
 I'm going to award the lemon to 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.909
 time to make the syrup 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.700
 for the syrup we will put water 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.260
 to boil with the lemon zest and a 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.510
 lemon juice the crime 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.320
 we'll boil to a point of 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.520
 syrup 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.620
 When it's ready, we'll go. 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.260
 put on the already cut fruits 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.030
 put a little rosemary and leave 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.480
 to be able to taste it as if it were 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.480
 a marinade 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.899
 to offer pancakes to use a pan 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.610
 shallow nonstick to be able to stay 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.990
 When are we going to put two spoons? 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.850

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.850
 Let's face pancake two sides 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.560
 to turn pancakes is very simple 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.600
 we just have to pull it from below 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:32.220
 and will if you prefer you can also 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.220
 try to turn her boyfriend like that 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.330
 I was disputing the pancake of time. 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.550
 enough of the fruits that were in 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.590
 marinade with syrup to absorb and all 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.380
 that flavor and now we're going to add 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.590
 the fruits on this cool grill a spoon 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.590

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.020

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.780
 Now let's stir the stuffed pancakes. 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.450
 with mascarpone cheese that is the cheese 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.160
 typically super-fine Italian serves 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.160
 both to receive salty and 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:25.350
 spend half the audience here cheese 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.350
 Let's play in the middle. 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.019
 We pass just a little bit more in the 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.019
 half of it and life to bend pedro gives 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.950
 So put the fruits now 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.670
 to finish and place tail 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.210
 and now to decorate red fruits 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.210
