just<00:00:43.770> one<00:00:44.010> update<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.420> massive<00:00:45.629> super

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
just one update like one massive super

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.110 
just one update like one massive super
bullet<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.680> deals<00:00:47.039> more<00:00:47.250> damage<00:00:47.309> any<00:00:47.789> weapon

bullet that deals more damage any weapon

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.600 
bullet that deals more damage any weapon
is<00:00:48.210> capable<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.750> also<00:00:49.590> thus<00:00:49.770> no<00:00:49.920> longer<00:00:49.950> happen

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
is capable of also thus no longer happen

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.000 
is capable of also thus no longer happen
so<00:00:51.420> these<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.960> fixes<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.500> will<00:00:52.710> improve

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
so these are the fixes that will improve

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.570 
it will actually be done exactly like
that<00:05:12.450> if<00:05:12.900> they<00:05:13.200> encounter<00:05:13.320> issues<00:05:13.800> are<00:05:14.250> even

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
that if they encounter issues are even

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.340 
that if they encounter issues are even
big<00:05:14.790> showstopper<00:05:15.090> problems<00:05:15.900> along<00:05:16.170> the<00:05:16.230> way

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
big showstopper problems along the way

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.740 
big showstopper problems along the way
then<00:05:17.070> this<00:05:17.340> can<00:05:17.520> significantly<00:05:17.790> delay<00:05:18.600> the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
then this can significantly delay the

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.990 
then this can significantly delay the
process<00:05:19.230> or<00:05:19.440> even<00:05:19.770> kill<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.190> whole<00:05:20.370> high

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
process or even kill the whole high

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.210 
process or even kill the whole high
