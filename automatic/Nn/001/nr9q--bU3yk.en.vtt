00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.929
 once said that I move the back 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.140
 wants to film again as you do 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.370
 can train 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.109
 latitude but flat as a flounder 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.619
 in the stamp you can still 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.779
 recall 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.810
 Now I'll give you a few exercises 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.329
 show where you can avoid that 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.919
 a half back gets a tight seal and 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.729
 also come to I would also 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.680
 recommend only with the poems 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:36.970
 go down and often for you it is very 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.370
 very good for complete body part it 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.200
 is a full-body exercise to that 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.900
 small with participate 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.780
 blame where it needs above all else 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.270
 The back should be the time for them 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.950
 Be the same as my belly 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.000
 constantly 12 when I go down 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.000
 For example 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.990
 that comes from being you when you are 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.510
 going down is going to have to breathe very deeply 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.120
 have you not been fooled by it is 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.220
 stop now look at it 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.910
 are different variants how to do that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.580
 can make 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.370
 I do the variant with dumbbells 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.920
 There are also doringer with a barbell 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.170
 position normal position blablabla 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.300
 position and do it the way it does 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.160
 best you can if you are not a beginner 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.340
 be advanced then you have 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.500
 a few techniques on it and that 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.970
 Here is our engineering center we invite 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.250
 is full then I hide myself 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.119
 somewhere in the corner just makes for 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.119
 me without a mirror 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.489
 in front 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.709
 seen ok 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.790
 if you just got it from the exact one 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.900
 have considered working there yet 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.060
 trapezoid muscles are right and poor ones when 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.879
 Her trousers are not that good 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.519
 have developed and the forearms before 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.319
 fail as the back muscles so it is 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.150
 at most then take a few 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:05.180
 to help and you can in bremen 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.580
 Bock comes to our shops and from me 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.739
 to be advised by my team 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.290
 then the technology could still times 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.900
 just grant questions 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.860
 and yes the things brought here with us 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.860
 that was it
