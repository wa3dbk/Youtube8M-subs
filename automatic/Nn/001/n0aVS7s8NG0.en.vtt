00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
in this video I want to do the part two

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.920 
in this video I want to do the part two
of<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.049> routing<00:00:04.259> tab<00:00:04.620> in<00:00:05.150> part<00:00:06.150> one<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:06.629> went

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
of the routing tab in part one we went

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.660 
of the routing tab in part one we went
over<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.429> input<00:00:08.429> routing<00:00:09.710> the<00:00:10.710> USB<00:00:11.250> returns

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
over the input routing the USB returns

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.020 
over the input routing the USB returns
and<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.990> USB<00:00:13.410> output<00:00:13.860> routing<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.880> had

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and the USB output routing we had

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.640 
and the USB output routing we had
somebody<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.660> forum<00:00:16.020> mentioned<00:00:16.590> that

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
somebody on the forum mentioned that

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.519 
somebody on the forum mentioned that
they<00:00:16.800> had<00:00:16.980> done<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.480> 16<00:00:18.480> track<00:00:18.690> recording<00:00:19.260> but

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
they had done a 16 track recording but

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.189 
they had done a 16 track recording but
all<00:00:19.710> tracks<00:00:20.070> got<00:00:20.460> nothing<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.240> kick<00:00:21.510> it

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
all tracks got nothing but kick it

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.080 
all tracks got nothing but kick it
actually<00:00:22.590> didn't<00:00:22.859> happen<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> XR<00:00:23.640> 18

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
actually didn't happen in the XR 18

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.820 
actually didn't happen in the XR 18
routing<00:00:24.570> tab<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.650> had

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
routing tab but what they had

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.460 
routing tab but what they had
inadvertently<00:00:26.310> done<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.420> DA<00:00:27.840> software

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
inadvertently done in the DA software

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.840 
inadvertently done in the DA software
was<00:00:29.220> had<00:00:29.490> channel<00:00:30.420> 1<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.619> device<00:00:32.160> which<00:00:32.730> in

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
was had channel 1 of the device which in

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.479 
was had channel 1 of the device which in
this<00:00:32.940> case<00:00:33.090> was<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> XR<00:00:33.690> 18<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.380> where<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this case was the XR 18 and where the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.290 
this case was the XR 18 and where the
kick<00:00:35.700> was<00:00:35.850> plugged<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:37.290> routed<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.670> every

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
kick was plugged in was routed to every

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.319 
kick was plugged in was routed to every
channel<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:40.110> USB<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.090> got<00:00:42.300> was

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
channel of USB and so all they got was

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.330 
channel of USB and so all they got was
kick<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.870> recording<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.010> keep<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.280> in

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
kick on the recording so keep that in

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.740 
kick on the recording so keep that in
mind<00:00:44.430> make<00:00:44.789> sure<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.030> realize<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
mind make sure you realize that the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
mind make sure you realize that the
default<00:00:46.170> setting<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.340> work<00:00:47.550> for

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
default setting is going to work for

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.299 
default setting is going to work for
most<00:00:48.000> things<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
most things if you want to do a one to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.000 
most things if you want to do a one to
one<00:00:50.340> recording<00:00:51.210> where<00:00:51.930> input<00:00:52.170> 1<00:00:52.559> goes<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.829> 1

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
one recording where input 1 goes to 1

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.670 
one recording where input 1 goes to 1
input<00:00:53.430> 2<00:00:53.670> goes<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> 2<00:00:54.239> etc<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.930> wish<00:00:55.410> there<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.620> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
input 2 goes to 2 etc I wish there was a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.350 
input 2 goes to 2 etc I wish there was a
default<00:00:56.010> button<00:00:56.370> over<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.149> when<00:00:57.270> we

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
default button over here so that when we

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.689 
default button over here so that when we
want<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.629> go<00:00:57.930> back<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.320> default<00:00:58.500> or<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.550> you've

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
want to go back to default or if you've

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
want to go back to default or if you've
got<00:00:59.730> things<00:01:00.090> messed<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.230> could<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.590> go

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
got things messed up you could just go

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.810 
got things messed up you could just go
back<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.000> automated<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.820> I'm

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
back and have this automated and I'm

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.060 
back and have this automated and I'm
also<00:01:06.119> I'm<00:01:06.330> gonna<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.840> again<00:01:07.070> all

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
also I'm gonna have to do that again all

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.620 
also I'm gonna have to do that again all
right<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.369> that's<00:01:08.460> our<00:01:08.640> default<00:01:08.820> back<00:01:09.360> there

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
right so that's our default back there

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.810 
right so that's our default back there
and<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.290> course<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.860> 2x2<00:01:11.250> mode<00:01:11.580> right<00:01:11.760> now

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
and of course I'm in 2x2 mode right now

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.630 
and of course I'm in 2x2 mode right now
with<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> left/right<00:01:13.049> being<00:01:13.950> recorded<00:01:14.460> out

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
with the left/right being recorded out

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.870 
with the left/right being recorded out
channels<00:01:15.119> 1<00:01:15.390> &amp;<00:01:15.570> 2<00:01:15.720> okay<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.400> big<00:01:17.610> thing<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
channels 1 &amp; 2 okay so the big thing I

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.160 
channels 1 &amp; 2 okay so the big thing I
want<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.119> point<00:01:18.240> out<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.869> something

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
want to point out and this is something

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.130 
want to point out and this is something
that<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.619> now<00:01:19.740> realizing<00:01:20.490> myself<00:01:21.140> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that I'm just now realizing myself and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.320 
that I'm just now realizing myself and
that's<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> power<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.460> ultra<00:01:23.909> net

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that's the power of the ultra net

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.160 
that's the power of the ultra net
we<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> USB<00:01:25.850> outputs<00:01:26.850> 18<00:01:27.659> channels

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
we know that the USB outputs 18 channels

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.590 
we know that the USB outputs 18 channels
to<00:01:29.070> add<00:01:29.189> all<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.579> recording<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.210> that's

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
to add all for recording and that's

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.929 
to add all for recording and that's
pretty<00:01:30.810> powerful<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.500> not<00:01:32.189> only<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.820> have

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
pretty powerful so not only do we have

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.499 
pretty powerful so not only do we have
the<00:01:33.509> six<00:01:34.170> XLR<00:01:34.799> busses<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.939> use<00:01:36.150> plus

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the six XLR busses that we can use plus

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.350 
the six XLR busses that we can use plus
the<00:01:36.720> left<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:37.950> eight<00:01:38.159> xlrs<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the left right so we have eight xlrs of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.749 
the left right so we have eight xlrs of
typical<00:01:40.170> output<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.220> would<00:01:41.340> expect<00:01:41.670> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
typical output that we would expect to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.630 
typical output that we would expect to
see<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.240> any<00:01:42.630> analog<00:01:43.259> mixer<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.280> course<00:01:44.520> we

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
see on any analog mixer of course we

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.450 
see on any analog mixer of course we
also<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> USB<00:01:45.450> output<00:01:46.130> which<00:01:47.130> gives<00:01:47.340> us

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
also have the USB output which gives us

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.910 
also have the USB output which gives us
the<00:01:47.610> 18<00:01:48.030> outputs<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:49.320> we're<00:01:49.470> more<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.860> more

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the 18 outputs that we're more and more

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
the 18 outputs that we're more and more
familiar<00:01:50.340> with<00:01:50.460> now<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.820> digital<00:01:51.420> consoles

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
familiar with now on digital consoles

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.899 
familiar with now on digital consoles
but<00:01:52.829> something<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.340> pretty<00:01:53.549> unique<00:01:53.880> to

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
but something that's pretty unique to

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.969

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
external device to implement this but

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.679 
external device to implement this but
what<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> does<00:02:01.950> could<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> lifesaver<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.509> a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
lot of bands out there we all know that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.300 
lot of bands out there we all know that
you<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.899> your<00:02:07.049> monitor<00:02:07.469> mixes<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:08.099> an

but it's pretty limited because you're

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.820 
but it's pretty limited because you're
using

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
using

it<00:02:19.530> might<00:02:19.740> be<00:02:19.770> actually<00:02:20.220> kind<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.400> complex<00:02:20.820> to

it might be actually kind of complex to

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
from this left tab so this makes the P

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
16 option really powerful and you do

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.240 
16 option really powerful and you do

have to again by one of their p 16 m/s
for<00:03:29.310> 249<00:03:29.970> but<00:03:30.630> for<00:03:30.840> 249<00:03:31.440> you're<00:03:32.130> getting<00:03:32.489> a

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
much better monitor mixing system that P

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.840

unpowered or headphones or in ears and
again<00:03:42.510> that's<00:03:42.660> gonna<00:03:42.750> allow<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.230> do

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
again that's gonna allow you to do

again that's gonna allow you to do
stereo<00:03:43.709> mixes<00:03:44.100> which<00:03:44.550> is<00:03:44.670> gonna<00:03:44.790> be<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:44.970> lot

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
stereo mixes which is gonna be a lot

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.320 
stereo mixes which is gonna be a lot
easier<00:03:45.540> than<00:03:45.980> grouping<00:03:46.980> two<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.820> auxes

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
easier than grouping two of the auxes

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.900 
easier than grouping two of the auxes
and<00:03:48.510> stereo<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.560> then<00:03:49.980> crying<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.370> mix<00:03:50.610> left

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
and stereo and then crying to mix left

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.960 
and stereo and then crying to mix left
right<00:03:51.180> stereo<00:03:51.500> sends<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.769> couple<00:03:53.489> pair<00:03:53.760> of

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
right stereo sends to a couple pair of

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.220 
right stereo sends to a couple pair of
the<00:03:54.300> XLR<00:03:54.750> outputs

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
the XLR outputs

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.890 
the XLR outputs
alright<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:57.060> next<00:03:57.209> tab<00:03:57.450> is<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.720> aux

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
alright in the the next tab is the aux

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.949 
alright in the the next tab is the aux
outputs<00:03:58.620> tab<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.160> that's<00:04:00.030> simply<00:04:00.330> asking

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
outputs tab and that's simply asking

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.310 
outputs tab and that's simply asking
where<00:04:01.410> do<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.709> want<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.430> six<00:04:02.730> xlrs<00:04:03.480> on<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
where do you want the six xlrs on the

where do you want the six xlrs on the

that's that's something that's gonna be

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.499 
that's that's something that's gonna be
very<00:04:40.719> useful<00:04:40.990> for<00:04:41.530> for<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.919> lot<00:04:42.069> of<00:04:42.189> people<00:04:42.509> so

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
very useful for for a lot of people so

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.510 
very useful for for a lot of people so
for<00:04:43.659> example<00:04:43.719> if<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:44.740> wanted<00:04:45.009> to<00:04:45.099> send<00:04:45.310> your

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
get the same mix that's going to your

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.830 
get the same mix that's going to your
left<00:05:08.199> right<00:05:08.409> and<00:05:08.889> the<00:05:09.879> last<00:05:10.120> tab<00:05:10.330> over<00:05:10.509> here<00:05:10.629> is

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
left right and the last tab over here is

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.290 
left right and the last tab over here is
pretty<00:05:10.960> simple<00:05:11.199> it's<00:05:11.830> just<00:05:12.039> asking<00:05:12.219> what<00:05:13.180> do

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
pretty simple it's just asking what do

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.969 
pretty simple it's just asking what do
you<00:05:13.419> want<00:05:13.599> to<00:05:13.690> send<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.050> your<00:05:14.289> left<00:05:14.740> right

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
you want to send to your left right

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.800 
you want to send to your left right
output<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.969> of<00:05:16.090> course<00:05:16.270> it's<00:05:16.419> gonna<00:05:16.509> be<00:05:16.599> your

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
output and of course it's gonna be your

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.890 
output and of course it's gonna be your
main<00:05:17.020> mix<00:05:17.379> typically<00:05:17.949> you<00:05:18.550> could<00:05:18.699> send<00:05:19.270> USB<00:05:19.690> 1

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
main mix typically you could send USB 1

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.119 
main mix typically you could send USB 1
&amp;<00:05:20.050> 2<00:05:20.169> so<00:05:20.379> if<00:05:20.469> you're<00:05:20.590> doing<00:05:20.710> a<00:05:20.860> two-track

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
&amp; 2 so if you're doing a two-track

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:22.980 
&amp; 2 so if you're doing a two-track
recording<00:05:21.669> and<00:05:21.879> you<00:05:22.300> want<00:05:22.479> to<00:05:22.569> monitor<00:05:22.719> that

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
recording and you want to monitor that

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.600 
recording and you want to monitor that
back<00:05:23.199> directly<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:23.979> could<00:05:24.159> just<00:05:24.370> go<00:05:24.490> ahead

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
back directly you could just go ahead

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.350 
back directly you could just go ahead
and<00:05:24.849> assign<00:05:25.779> that<00:05:25.840> there<00:05:26.259> and<00:05:26.409> then<00:05:26.830> your

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
and assign that there and then your

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.700 
and assign that there and then your
headphone<00:05:28.360> output<00:05:28.750> on<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:29.020> front<00:05:29.229> Jack<00:05:29.469> what

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
headphone output on the front Jack what

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.969 
headphone output on the front Jack what
do<00:05:29.800> you<00:05:29.889> want<00:05:30.129> to<00:05:30.310> send<00:05:31.150> to<00:05:31.270> that<00:05:31.349> now<00:05:32.349> if<00:05:32.620> you

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
do you want to send to that now if you

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
source if we select this so that when we

here<00:06:01.599> so<00:06:01.629> if<00:06:01.870> this<00:06:01.990> is<00:06:02.169> down<00:06:02.379> you<00:06:02.589> won't<00:06:02.710> get

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
here so if this is down you won't get

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.860 
here so if this is down you won't get
much<00:06:03.099> headphone<00:06:04.029> volume<00:06:04.060> so<00:06:04.509> I've<00:06:04.569> had<00:06:04.690> a<00:06:04.719> few

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
much headphone volume so I've had a few

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.379 
much headphone volume so I've had a few
people<00:06:05.110> have<00:06:05.680> this<00:06:05.860> turn<00:06:06.099> way<00:06:06.460> down<00:06:06.669> and<00:06:06.940> you

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
people have this turn way down and you

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.129 
people have this turn way down and you
can<00:06:07.509> also<00:06:08.279> monitor<00:06:09.279> in<00:06:09.460> mono<00:06:09.699> here<00:06:10.089> so<00:06:10.659> this

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
can also monitor in mono here so this

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.369 
can also monitor in mono here so this
right<00:06:11.349> here<00:06:11.409> selects<00:06:12.479> what<00:06:13.479> you're<00:06:13.719> going<00:06:14.259> to

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
hear in this position here alright so

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.909 
hear in this position here alright so
that's<00:06:18.789> the<00:06:18.849> basic<00:06:19.210> overview<00:06:19.330> of<00:06:19.990> p16

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
that's the basic overview of p16

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.279 
that's the basic overview of p16
your<00:06:21.490> aux<00:06:21.729> outputs<00:06:22.300> and<00:06:22.479> how<00:06:22.569> you<00:06:22.629> can<00:06:22.870> remap

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
your aux outputs and how you can remap

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.350 
your aux outputs and how you can remap
those<00:06:23.589> so<00:06:23.770> they<00:06:23.860> can<00:06:24.009> do<00:06:24.159> something<00:06:24.520> more<00:06:25.029> than

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
those so they can do something more than

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.559 
those so they can do something more than
just<00:06:25.389> your<00:06:25.810> monitors<00:06:26.680> and<00:06:26.889> bus<00:06:27.039> sends<00:06:27.669> and<00:06:28.150> of

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:28.569 
just your monitors and bus sends and of

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:31.260 
just your monitors and bus sends and of
course<00:06:28.750> the<00:06:28.960> main<00:06:29.529> output<00:06:29.919> is<00:06:30.129> gonna<00:06:30.610> be<00:06:30.759> real

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
course the main output is gonna be real

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.510 
course the main output is gonna be real
typical<00:06:31.719> default<00:06:32.229> just<00:06:32.800> like<00:06:32.979> this<00:06:33.219> and

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
typical default just like this and

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.269 
typical default just like this and
rarely<00:06:34.000> would<00:06:34.120> you<00:06:34.300> need<00:06:34.389> to<00:06:34.449> change<00:06:34.690> that<00:06:35.279> all

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:36.279 
rarely would you need to change that all
