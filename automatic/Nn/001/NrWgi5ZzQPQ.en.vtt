00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi my dear subscribers and not 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.440
 only in general, hello to everyone who looks 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.069
 this video and today's review will be 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.740
 is dedicated to 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.259
 toys from the animated series but I will not 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.540
 I'll show you right away and tell you first 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.650
 this cartoon and maybe you already 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.480
 guess what today there will be issues and 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.840
 so this is Russian material in which 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.199
 two main characters one character lives in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.059
 the forest is so very big and doesn't like noise 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.430
 and the second of the characters this girl is very 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.879
 mischievous and funny but maybe you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.030
 guess what i'm talking about if 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.910
 no, it's okay because Vlad 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.100
 our toy and this car because of 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.620
 Material Masha be such two figures 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.260
 video of the main characters from our beloved 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.420
 cartoon 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.600
 such a small package was right 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.420
 open nothing is missing by the way 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.770
 it is even convenient because often when 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.780
 Choosing and not turning circles 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.479
 attention to the packaging for which bad 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.590
 you can see what the market finds and here everything 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.840
 open can even touch 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.350
 behind the picture here are more accurate 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.909
 frames from one series of cartoons written 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.430
 will be with a healthy way and 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.009
 This series was called in which Masha 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.350
 video doctor treated bear 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.350
 but he did not hurt just pretending 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.340
 here is written below about the toy 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.340
 Here it is written what she did of 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.580
 plastisol is such a material in general 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.750
 to touch something like a rubber only 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.980
 for nicer and still want to pay attention 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.300
 the fact that before using the toy 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.370
 recommends washing the greens with soap 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.680
 In principle, it is logical as a toy 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.320
 become a store so it can be gathering dust 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.640
 but before giving it to a child for example 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.640
 Of course it is better to perform 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.760
 figurines 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.840
 boxes are attached like this wire 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:23.120
 so to get them you just need 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:27.200
 take the wire and cut it have 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.200
 the bear is not there yet 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:40.210
 bears we freed cars left 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.600
 notice the box background because 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.420
 that here is a bear house right in 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.620
 just like cartoons such a sofa 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.770
 samovar 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.540
 a table on which trouble we see not 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.350
 there is a jam 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.650
 raspberry is written a cup is such 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.810
 the pictures and the bear award but because 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.590
 how do we know the bear we had a circus 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.580
 before and he has a lot of awards 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:17.080
 different so he is an unusual bear and 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.900
 Here is such a figure, in principle, very 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.510
 unlike exactly made like from 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.180
 cartoon Masha, too, all the details 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.200
 traced 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.990
 eyes that is to say generally face clothes yes and 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.200
 even the size of course the bear is bigger 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.830
 than your immediately visible just as in 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.519
 cartoon look like they are figures 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.250
 bear made wool seems to me very 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.600
 believable it looks good 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.330
 due to the fact that the figure is made 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.380
 so many of these stripes here and us 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.380
 it seems that the wool is real now 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.110
 let's take a closer look at the smaller cars already 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.959
 figures when as I said in principle 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.010
 she is wearing her usual clothes in 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.090
 shawl dress 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.739
 but since in this series it is in the form 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.530
 the doctor 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:14.470
 so I have a hat here and such 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.299
 a special device that there are doctors 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.910
 and she keeps a very big thermometer in 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.150
 hand in general toys and really 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.750
 good everything is definitely good 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.670
 neatly made and painted impossible 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.580
 pay attention to their bright colors and on 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.090
 all the details like cartoons besides the steps and 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.250
 light and can be put on the table 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.130
 for example and they will stand not to fall 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:44.590
 forgot to show you everything here 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:47.620
 such tweeters so from a toy still publish 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.020
 sounds in my very cool hope 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.080

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.710

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.900
