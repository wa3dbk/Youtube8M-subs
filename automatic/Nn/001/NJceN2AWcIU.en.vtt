space<00:04:41.820> of<00:04:41.880> time<00:04:42.090> as<00:04:42.690> being<00:04:42.750> so<00:04:43.199> great<00:04:43.500> but<00:04:43.710> it's

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
space of time as being so great but it's

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.629 
space of time as being so great but it's
so<00:04:44.070> exciting<00:04:44.810> when<00:04:45.810> we<00:04:45.870> we<00:04:46.440> started<00:04:46.889> in

personally<00:06:00.800> but<00:06:01.190> actually<00:06:01.610> throwing<00:06:01.880> them<00:06:02.120> on

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
personally but actually throwing them on

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.470 
personally but actually throwing them on
board<00:06:02.480> and<00:06:02.960> finding<00:06:03.500> out<00:06:03.650> what<00:06:04.520> it<00:06:04.730> is<00:06:04.970> that

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
board and finding out what it is that

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.530 
board and finding out what it is that
that<00:06:05.900> they<00:06:06.290> were<00:06:06.350> unhappy<00:06:06.620> with<00:06:07.090> has<00:06:08.090> been<00:06:08.300> so

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
that they were unhappy with has been so

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.200 
that they were unhappy with has been so
positive<00:06:08.810> and<00:06:09.440> we<00:06:10.340> worked<00:06:10.820> really<00:06:11.090> well

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
positive and we worked really well

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.050 
positive and we worked really well
together<00:06:11.600> now<00:06:11.930> as<00:06:12.110> a<00:06:12.140> team<00:06:12.760> there's<00:06:13.760> lots<00:06:13.940> of

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
together now as a team there's lots of

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.460 
together now as a team there's lots of
parents<00:06:14.450> that<00:06:14.540> are<00:06:14.660> really<00:06:14.990> interested<00:06:15.380> in

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
parents that are really interested in

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.110 
parents that are really interested in
being<00:06:15.650> involved<00:06:16.070> and<00:06:16.520> I<00:06:16.610> think<00:06:16.880> it's

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
being involved and I think it's

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.870 
being involved and I think it's
important<00:06:17.780> that<00:06:17.840> parents<00:06:18.080> are<00:06:18.410> involved<00:06:18.880> you

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
important that parents are involved you

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.159 
important that parents are involved you
know<00:06:20.000> at<00:06:20.150> the<00:06:20.210> end<00:06:20.330> of<00:06:20.479> the<00:06:20.540> day<00:06:20.690> it's<00:06:20.870> where<00:06:21.050> it

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
know at the end of the day it's where it

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.320 
know at the end of the day it's where it
all<00:06:21.290> starts<00:06:21.800> and<00:06:21.860> championing<00:06:22.729> the<00:06:22.940> the

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
all starts and championing the the

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.350 
all starts and championing the the
system<00:06:23.750> and<00:06:23.930> they'll<00:06:24.229> it'll<00:06:24.919> work<00:06:25.100> so<00:06:25.790> I<00:06:26.060> think

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
system and they'll it'll work so I think

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.210 
system and they'll it'll work so I think
it's<00:06:26.720> really<00:06:26.900> important<00:06:27.380> for<00:06:27.560> parents<00:06:27.740> to<00:06:28.070> get

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
it's really important for parents to get

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.950 
it's really important for parents to get
involved<00:06:28.520> in<00:06:28.760> being<00:06:29.000> involved<00:06:29.300> if<00:06:29.479> they<00:06:29.720> want

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
involved in being involved if they want

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.380 
involved in being involved if they want
to<00:06:30.460> because<00:06:31.460> everyone's<00:06:31.820> got<00:06:31.910> a<00:06:31.940> voice<00:06:32.180> about

to because everyone's got a voice about
the<00:06:32.690> score<00:06:33.020> and<00:06:33.440> but<00:06:34.250> I<00:06:34.280> think<00:06:34.580> buyers<00:06:34.790> by

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
the score and but I think buyers by

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.969 
the score and but I think buyers by
parents<00:06:35.720> benefit<00:06:36.169> get<00:06:36.290> involved<00:06:36.470> and<00:06:36.650> do<00:06:36.800> this

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
parents benefit get involved and do this

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.700 
parents benefit get involved and do this
just<00:06:37.610> show<00:06:37.789> that<00:06:38.060> you<00:06:38.240> know<00:06:38.270> schools<00:06:38.990> are<00:06:39.289> open
