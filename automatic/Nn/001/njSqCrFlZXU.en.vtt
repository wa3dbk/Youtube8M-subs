adds to the funk and I'll show you what
I<00:02:55.510> mean<00:02:56.760> that's<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.940> little<00:02:58.329> trill<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.660> like<00:02:58.930> to

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
I mean that's a little trill I like to

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.920 
I mean that's a little trill I like to
use<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.260> lot<00:02:59.500> as<00:02:59.680> you<00:02:59.799> can<00:02:59.950> tell<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:03.750> stuff<00:03:04.750> like

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
use a lot as you can tell and stuff like

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:19.460 
use a lot as you can tell and stuff like
that<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:11.470> blues<00:03:11.680> scale

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.910 

so<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.560> basic<00:03:20.950> riff<00:03:21.990> now<00:03:22.990> it's<00:03:23.470> got<00:03:23.709> some

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
so the basic riff now it's got some

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.470 
so the basic riff now it's got some
rhythms<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.490> really<00:03:24.880> need<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.120> lock

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
rhythms that you really need to lock

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.840 
rhythms that you really need to lock
down<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:25.959> understand<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:27.340> first<00:03:27.520> one<00:03:27.730> is

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
down and understand the first one is

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.520 
down and understand the first one is
that<00:03:27.880> pickup<00:03:28.300> as<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.600> said<00:03:28.840> then<00:03:28.990> there's<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.260> big

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
that pickup as I said then there's a big

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.000 
that pickup as I said then there's a big
fat<00:03:29.830> eighth<00:03:30.160> note<00:03:30.580> down<00:03:30.940> up<00:03:31.739> doot-doot<00:03:32.739> up

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
fat eighth note down up doot-doot up

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.740 
fat eighth note down up doot-doot up
wood<00:03:33.310> right<00:03:33.790> we're<00:03:33.970> into<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> sixteenth<00:03:34.690> note

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
wood right we're into a sixteenth note

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.590 
wood right we're into a sixteenth note
pocket<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.560> lot<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.489> this<00:03:36.610> groove<00:03:36.910> but<00:03:37.420> that

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
pocket a lot of this groove but that

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.110 
pocket a lot of this groove but that
first<00:03:37.870> eighth<00:03:38.200> note<00:03:38.410> is<00:03:38.650> really<00:03:38.980> bad<00:03:39.190> right<00:03:39.520> as

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
first eighth note is really bad right as

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.680 
first eighth note is really bad right as
in<00:03:40.420> good<00:03:40.660> like<00:03:41.220> two<00:03:42.220> three<00:03:42.850> four

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
in good like two three four

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.710 
in good like two three four
those<00:03:44.530> are<00:03:44.739> straight<00:03:45.160> eighths<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.670> then<00:03:46.510> you

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
those are straight eighths and then you

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:56.610 
those are straight eighths and then you
get<00:03:46.870> into<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.230> sixteenth<00:03:47.680> note<00:03:47.890> stuff<00:03:55.620> that

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
get into the sixteenth note stuff that

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.620 
get into the sixteenth note stuff that
takes<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.100> long<00:03:57.340> time<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.970> get<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.239> together

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
takes a long time to get that together

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.870 
takes a long time to get that together
that<00:03:58.870> that's<00:03:59.080> some<00:03:59.350> really<00:03:59.800> deep<00:04:00.069> groove<00:04:00.459> kind

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
that that's some really deep groove kind

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.940 
that that's some really deep groove kind
