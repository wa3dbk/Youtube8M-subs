for me that's either the placement isn't

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.069 
for me that's either the placement isn't
working<00:02:38.120> properly<00:02:38.150> or<00:02:38.829> because<00:02:39.829> I<00:02:40.760> am<00:02:41.689> using<00:02:41.930> a

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
for that and some reason the peaceful

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.540 
for that and some reason the peaceful
trophies<00:05:01.139> are<00:05:01.349> really<00:05:01.590> quiet<00:05:01.919> when<00:05:02.039> they<00:05:02.279> pop

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
trophies are really quiet when they pop

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.730 
trophies are really quiet when they pop
so<00:05:03.300> just<00:05:03.509> be<00:05:03.659> really<00:05:03.900> careful<00:05:04.050> when<00:05:04.349> if<00:05:04.560> you

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
so just be really careful when if you

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.219 
so just be really careful when if you
make<00:05:05.340> sure<00:05:05.370> you<00:05:05.669> check<00:05:06.090> for<00:05:06.330> them<00:05:06.449> and<00:05:06.629> check

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
make sure you check for them and check

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.390 
make sure you check for them and check
they<00:05:07.379> actually<00:05:07.680> earn<00:05:07.830> them<00:05:08.039> and<00:05:08.219> stuff

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
they actually earn them and stuff

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.459 
they actually earn them and stuff
because<00:05:08.520> they<00:05:09.389> can<00:05:09.569> be<00:05:09.719> really<00:05:09.870> quiet<00:05:10.169> and

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:10.469 
because they can be really quiet and

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:12.019 
because they can be really quiet and
