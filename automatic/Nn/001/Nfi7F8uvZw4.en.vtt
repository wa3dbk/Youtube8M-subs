we<00:02:04.440> created<00:02:04.800> these<00:02:04.979> spacers<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.729> give<00:02:05.880> us<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
we created these spacers to give us a

some of the boards that are

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.050 
some of the boards that are
well<00:03:47.560> figured<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.069> as<00:03:48.159> you<00:03:48.280> can<00:03:48.400> see<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:48.939> has

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
well figured and as you can see this has

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.690 
well figured and as you can see this has
got<00:03:49.239> a<00:03:49.269> really<00:03:49.569> great<00:03:49.930> figure<00:03:50.650> pattern<00:03:51.129> so

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
got a really great figure pattern so

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.860 
got a really great figure pattern so
we're<00:03:51.819> putting<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.150> in<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.329> middle<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.599> floor
