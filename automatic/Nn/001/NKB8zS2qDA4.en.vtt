00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.879
 it's infinite combat and the new delivery 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.860
 of lepe of the aerial brand of the 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.990
 Bandai company Namco is now available 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.180
 since a few days ago in the store of 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.349
 playstation 3 for free under the 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.349
 free to play format and 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.840
 specifically the title follows the wake of 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.910
 other mythical franchises of this same 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.100
 company like tekken soul calibur o 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.110
 richard and be which also have 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.420
 the jump recently to the genre of 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.610
 free to play games a business model 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.960
 that seems to be sitting every time with 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.140
 more strength in the world of 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.140
 video game consoles 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.020
 going directly to comment your 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.910
 playability of this borrowed the 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.100
 most of the elements of the most 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.020
 recent installments of the saga scomba 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.020
 both in regards to mechanics 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.970
 as the graphic engine of the game we 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.770
 we will find an aerial arcade in 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.229
 every rule in which pilot we will do the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.210
 most powerful fighter planes giving themselves 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.160
 to choose between two styles of 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.260
 control the standard and the expert 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.240
 the first being able to direct the plane of 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.040
 the simplest way since it will suffice 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.750
 how about the analog stick for 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.000
 make it look in the desired direction 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.280
 while the expert configuration 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.440
 we can control with complete freedom the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.630
 tilt and pitch being this 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.100
 last the most recommended to play now 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.259
 that although something more is required of 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.720
 practice with it will be possible to perform 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.759
 much more precise maneuvers what 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.009
 it is fundamental in the persecutions 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.899
 air and especially when we try to 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.340
 get rid of an enemy missile 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.340
 that we have in queue 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.280
 regarding its possibilities the title 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.260
 offers us two main modes 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.730
 having on one side the campaign 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.740
 in the case of a solo modality 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.660
 which is only composed of six 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.400
 missions although its 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.710
 number is expanding in future 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.900
 updates can consider 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.850
 this way a lower face training 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.130
 to which we will find ourselves in that without 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.350
 Doubt is the main attraction of the game 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.350
 the cooperative missions online 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.600
 specifically in this mode support is given 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.610
 for multiplayer games of up to one 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.710
 maximum of 8 users being at the same 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.960
 time a cooperative modality and 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.000
 competitive since the players are 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.010
 will split into two teams that will have to 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.810
 complete the same vision fighting 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.730
 against enemies controlled by the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.590
 artificial intelligence without any 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.690
 moment in the players of a team and 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.820
 another can attack each other since 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.160
 all are allies proclaiming themselves victor 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.230
 from the game to the squad that gets 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.970
 add more points eliminating the biggest 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.970
 number of designated objectives 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.220
 besides playing in these missions 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.650
 cooperatives will make us get 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.170
 experience and other rewards that we 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.850
 will allow you to unlock more planes and 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.830
 also improve and customize the 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.950
 armament and the visual appearance of 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.140
 that we already have in our walk in this 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.390
 meaning you will have a 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.190
 f 4 phantom while the rest of the 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.709
 we will get them through 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.720
 of a research tree being able to 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.930
 this way we put ourselves at the controls of 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.870
 f-16 fight and al with the mic 21 the mirage 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.480
 2000d the 10 thunderbolt of its manager the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.910
 4 returns the f-22 raptor to quote 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.370
 some around 2 in all around 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.950
 of 30 devices for piloting divided into 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.050
 three categories the fighters which are 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.940
 ideals against aerial enemies the 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.920
 specialized attack aircraft without 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.050
 destroy land targets and the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.650
 polyvalent that can meet both 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.650
 functions 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.240
 also an important element to 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.220
 comment is that we also have a 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.320
 option called challenges in which 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.150
 will propose us a series of contracts with 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.010
 various challenges we have to overcome 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.169
 during the games and in case of 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.360
 meet them successfully we will get prizes 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:41.610
 quite interesting that will help us 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.610
 progress in the game more quickly 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.600
 although at this point you have to 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.979
 clarify that being a free to 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.020
 play in the game has some 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.940
 limitations when it comes to enjoying with 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.250
 him in an unlimited way since in each 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.110
 departure we are requested data we have a 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.270
 fuel letter which will go 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.160
 providing free of charge 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.650
 periodic although without we can never 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.419
 have more than three at a time if the 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.310
 exhausted will have to wait a 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.440
 few hours until the next load 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.120
 to return to play giving themselves also 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.340
 the option to acquire with real money 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.350
 stored fuel which in this 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.300
 case has no limit on the number of 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.300
 loads that we can get to accumulate 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:39.059
 finally in relation to its section 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.129
 graphic the game has left us a good 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:43.049
 taste because despite being a 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.669
 free to play visual quality is at 

00:05:43.049 --> 00:05:47.009
 height of what this delivery and we 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.749
 he's used to with very airplanes 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.969
 well modeled and that we can also 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:53.129
 pilot from three different cameras 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.869
 one in first person another from the 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.329
 interior of the cabin and one last 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:59.129
 located behind the plane being this 

00:05:57.329 --> 00:06:01.079
 science the most advisable to be able 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.349
 have a better vision of everything that 

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:03.349
 around us 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.920
 However, other technical aspects of 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.690
 title have convinced us too much already 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.070
 that as is the keynote in the games of 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.080
 aerial combat if we approach 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.390
 too much to the ground the level of 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.040
 textures decreases considerably to 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.530
 what must be added that the kinematics 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.110
 of campaign mode are quite simple and 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.940
 few numerous something that is extendable to 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.980
 the plot itself which 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.810
 will hardly manage to awaken the 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.560
 interest of the player for his lack of 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.560
 depth 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.410
 in conclusion we believe that it is combat 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.180
 infinite and have been brought with quite 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.740
 good success to the genre of free to 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.139
 play being a game that for sure 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.090
 any user of playstation 3 and in 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:04.520
 Special fans of the saga will receive 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.560
 with open arms while still its 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.660
 content is something scarce lying on 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.789
 missing a somewhat longer campaign is 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.830
 especially some new game mode that 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:15.050
 allow direct confrontations between 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.300
 two players taking advantage of this 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.900
 way more rivalry and fun 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.900
 of the title 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.760
 good
