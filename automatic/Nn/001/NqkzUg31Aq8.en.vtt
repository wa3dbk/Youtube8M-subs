 the company hp has created an ultrabook 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.410
 transformer which is her statement 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.340
 is the best combination of abundant 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.470
 sweat and tablet new hp envy x2 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.060
 designed standard for this type 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.960
 device form factor 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.759
 This is a tablet with a diagonal of 11.6 inches 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.220
 connectable docking station as a keyboard 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.619
 and typical intel-based configuration 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.199
 atom with windows 8 on board 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.789
 what is the difference and stands out our 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.780

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.780
 classmates 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.760
 the device looks very reliable 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.050
 monolithic solid despite 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.360
 folding design 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.520
 all external surfaces of the transformer 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.370
 plated like imposing 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.900
 type of attachment for the tablet 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.090
 similar thoroughness right there 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.650
 reflected on the mass device in full 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.370
 it weighs almost one and a half 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.890
 kilogram 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.890
 For an ultrabook, this is quite a lot 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.230
 the tablet itself weighs 700 grams what 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.879
 the whole structure is also not small 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.640
 looks a bit plump 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.830
 hp envy x2 made in style 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.649
 common to all models included in this 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.920
 premium ruler rounded corners 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.550
 smooth contours and traditional black with 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.970
 silver 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.399
 elegant noble on the case seems 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.560
 there is not a single sharp angle everything is smoothed 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.149
 even the power button is licked 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.850
 lock and rocker adjustment 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.070
 loudness made flush with the case 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.530
 only the bottom of the tablet is made 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.080
 exactly and for ease of installation in debt 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.679
 there we see the only ones on the tablet 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.030
 headphone jacks 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.250
 joining tablets docking stations 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.860
 proprietary connector and card slot 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.560
 micro sd on the front panel all 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.360
 Standard screen occupies almost 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.909
 the whole surface is quite wide 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.430
 frame around it is located under it 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.680
 touch key start and see from above 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.720
 pupil front camera sensors 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.670

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.350
 bottom with a thin stripe with 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.660
 decorative mesh settled down 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.280
 speaker system on 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.320
 the back side is placed a small 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.200

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.150
 centered company logo hinge using 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.430
 which mounts for tablet 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.100
 connected to the docking station enough 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.630
 tight and also does not allow to open 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.550
 laptop wide enough 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.370
 especially if you work with him on your lap 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.380
 In addition, in this mode of operation, the tablet 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.200
 often outweighs the base and the whole 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.690
 construction collapses when working for 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.400
 the table is different two rubber 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.740
 inserts on the mount securely hold 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.870
 the design and the keyboard rises 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.080
 above the surface doing work with text 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.400
 very comfortable tablet held in 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.020
 dock with lock 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.520
 but in order to remove it you need 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.620
 move special lever 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.520
 all very simple docking station hp envy x2 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.650

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.290
 keyboard and touchpad interface set 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.780
 the lack of connectors is felt on 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.840
 the tablet itself is placed on the left side 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.620

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.310

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.870
 to connect the charger 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.640
 manufacturers have long abandoned 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.900
 inventing under each taken separately 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.250

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.440
 unify them for individual linear 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.510
 this model is set to standard 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.360
 keyboard without number pad and 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.160
 highlighting a man with big hands she 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.519

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.670

 n and bluetooth 4.0 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.480
 system performance compared 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.910
 with ultrabooks of course much lower 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.770
 However, the main task of such devices 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.020
 provide an opportunity to travel 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.780

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.190
 other basic functions providing 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.200
 this high autonomy 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.600
 and with this the model copes on 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.890

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.350
 two batteries are installed in the tablet and 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.020
 docking station has a total capacity of 48 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.450
 watt hours 22 and 26 here are hours 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.070
 respectively in read mode with

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.350
 off wireless modules 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.330
 the transformer worked for almost 14 hours 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.150
 the tablet itself is able to withstand 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.950
 up to 7 hours of work without recharging 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.180
 same mode 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.800
 close to this result we observed 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.800
 only in lenovo tablet 2

 full hd video clips 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.430
 The pictures are quite good, but with 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.340
 There is a lack of sharpness in the approach 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:39.680
 will come down if you need something urgent to remove 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:41.870
 and the camera is not at hand; no kitchen lead 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.260

 display for all this fun of course 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.030
 have to pay 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.520
 This model is one of the most 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.520
 expensive devices in its class 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.200
 which lubricates the overall impression a bit 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.560
 but if you are ready to give a tidy 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:07.030
 the amount for quality comfort hp envy x2 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.030
 will be an excellent choice
