the same time I'm using that pass
through<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.399> then<00:00:35.579> feed<00:00:36.000> picture<00:00:36.420> into<00:00:37.050> my

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
monitor which is really cool but with

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
see what's happening we just had to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.499 
see what's happening we just had to
trust<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> Shogun's<00:01:50.579> exposure<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.299> focus

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
trust the Shogun's exposure and focus

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.139 
trust the Shogun's exposure and focus
tools<00:01:51.929> as<00:01:52.200> well<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.530> channel<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.039> force<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
tools as well as channel the force the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.880 
tools as well as channel the force the
custom<00:01:54.600> animus<00:01:54.960> Sun<00:01:55.140> hood<00:01:55.350> couldn't<00:01:55.679> come

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
custom animus Sun hood couldn't come

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.460 
custom animus Sun hood couldn't come
soon<00:01:56.130> enough<00:01:56.689> we<00:01:57.689> kept<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.020> crossing<00:01:58.380> our

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
soon enough we kept on crossing our

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.899 
soon enough we kept on crossing our
fingers<00:01:58.500> hoping<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.340> we'll<00:01:59.490> actually<00:01:59.700> see

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
fingers hoping that we'll actually see

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.550 
fingers hoping that we'll actually see
something<00:02:00.360> when<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.780> review<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> footage<00:02:01.289> at

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
something when we review the footage at

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.359 
something when we review the footage at
home<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.009> when<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.640> did<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.750> was<00:02:03.960> fine<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.590> tad

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
home and when we did it was fine a tad

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.330 
home and when we did it was fine a tad
bit<00:02:05.549> underexposed<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.509> looked<00:02:06.750> good<00:02:07.340> keeping

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
bit underexposed but looked good keeping

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.279 
bit underexposed but looked good keeping
our<00:02:08.459> aperture<00:02:08.789> close<00:02:09.149> down<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.509> f9<00:02:09.899> or<00:02:10.080> higher

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
our aperture close down to f9 or higher

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.500 
our aperture close down to f9 or higher
we<00:02:10.649> wanted<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.069> see<00:02:11.220> how<00:02:11.370> 4k<00:02:11.910> looked<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.390> all

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
we wanted to see how 4k looked in all

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.470 
we wanted to see how 4k looked in all
its<00:02:12.660> glory<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> 7<00:02:13.680> s<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.069> indeed<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.150> was

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
its glory on a 7 s and indeed it was

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.390 
its glory on a 7 s and indeed it was
glorious<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> we're<00:02:19.709> getting<00:02:19.860> good<00:02:19.980> stuff<00:02:20.220> so

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
glorious so we're getting good stuff so

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.460 
glorious so we're getting good stuff so
far<00:02:20.610> it's<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.299> um<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.900> glare<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
far it's just that um the glare and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.690 
far it's just that um the glare and
everything<00:02:22.769> in<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.920> fact<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.190> my<00:02:23.400> monitor

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
everything in the fact that my monitor

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.039 
everything in the fact that my monitor
isn't<00:02:23.790> working<00:02:24.120> down<00:02:24.269> there<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.630> making<00:02:24.959> it

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
isn't working down there is making it

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.020 
isn't working down there is making it
hard<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.410> do<00:02:25.530> Steadicam<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.549> when<00:02:26.700> we<00:02:26.790> switch

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
hard to do Steadicam so when we switch

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.150 
hard to do Steadicam so when we switch
to<00:02:27.180> 1080p<00:02:27.750> for<00:02:27.959> some<00:02:28.110> overcranking<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
to 1080p for some overcranking the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.000 
to 1080p for some overcranking the
Steadicam<00:02:29.489> monitor<00:02:29.970> finally<00:02:30.480> worked

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
Steadicam monitor finally worked

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.080 
Steadicam monitor finally worked
operating<00:02:32.010> was<00:02:32.160> then<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.459> way<00:02:32.579> it<00:02:32.760> should<00:02:33.060> be

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
operating was then the way it should be

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.750 
operating was then the way it should be
and<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:33.660> got<00:02:33.840> some<00:02:33.989> pretty<00:02:34.760> nice<00:02:35.840> shots<00:02:37.670> one<00:02:38.670> of

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
and we got some pretty nice shots one of

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.470 
and we got some pretty nice shots one of
the<00:02:38.849> things<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.120> we<00:02:39.180> were<00:02:39.269> kind<00:02:39.450> of

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
the things that we were kind of

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.640 
the things that we were kind of
struggling<00:02:39.690> with<00:02:39.840> was<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> touchscreen

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
struggling with was a touchscreen

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.620 
struggling with was a touchscreen
because<00:02:40.890> without<00:02:41.730> individual<00:02:42.150> buttons<00:02:42.359> for

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
because without individual buttons for

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.270 
because without individual buttons for
certain<00:02:42.959> settings<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.590> kind<00:02:43.829> of<00:02:43.889> slowed<00:02:44.160> us

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
certain settings that kind of slowed us

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.860 
certain settings that kind of slowed us
down<00:02:44.310> especially<00:02:44.730> we<00:02:45.120> were<00:02:45.299> chasing<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
down especially we were chasing the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.590 
down especially we were chasing the
light<00:02:46.489> we<00:02:47.489> shot<00:02:47.700> most<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.150> tests<00:02:48.480> with

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
light we shot most of the tests with

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.690 
light we shot most of the tests with
Cinna<00:02:48.870> for<00:02:49.139> gamma<00:02:49.500> instead<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.069> s<00:02:50.190> log2

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
Cinna for gamma instead of s log2

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.520 
Cinna for gamma instead of s log2
because<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.269> Shogun<00:02:51.630> didn't<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.049> lot<00:02:52.319> for

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
because the Shogun didn't have a lot for

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.500 
because the Shogun didn't have a lot for
it<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:52.829> yet<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.459> we<00:02:53.579> did<00:02:53.790> do<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> couple<00:02:54.209> of

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
it just yet but we did do a couple of

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.599 
it just yet but we did do a couple of
shots<00:02:54.690> using<00:02:54.989> s<00:02:55.200> log2<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:56.010> because<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> know

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
shots using s log2 just because I know

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.780 
shots using s log2 just because I know
all<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.000> guys<00:02:57.150> will<00:02:57.329> ask<00:02:57.510> about<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.790> just
