00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and so I said obviously target would

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.319 
and so I said obviously target would
probably<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> better<00:01:44.220> deal<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:45.030> they

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
probably be the better deal because they

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.859 
probably be the better deal because they
have<00:01:45.450> more<00:01:45.600> tracks<00:01:45.950> but<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.250> um<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:48.090> just

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
have more tracks but then um I just

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.389 
have more tracks but then um I just
couldn't<00:01:49.350> decide<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.040> yearbook

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
couldn't decide because the yearbook

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.149 
couldn't decide because the yearbook
edition<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.090> freaking<00:01:51.600> cute<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:53.009> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
cool I mean it just documents their

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.820 
cool I mean it just documents their
whole<00:02:18.270> two<00:02:18.510> years<00:02:18.540> as<00:02:19.080> one<00:02:19.260> direction<00:02:19.410> it's

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
whole two years as one direction it's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.220 
whole two years as one direction it's
been<00:02:20.010> two<00:02:20.250> years<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.120> thought<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.020> was

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
been two years so I thought that was

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.910 
been two years so I thought that was
pretty<00:02:22.380> awesome<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.360> also<00:02:25.110> wanted<00:02:25.860> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
pretty awesome and so I also wanted to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.230 
pretty awesome and so I also wanted to
get<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.250> target<00:02:26.520> addition<00:02:26.820> because<00:02:26.970> they

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
get the target addition because they

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.420 
get the target addition because they
have<00:02:27.450> different<00:02:27.660> songs<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.860> couldn't<00:02:29.250> just

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
