00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.380

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.619

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.710
 Carbonara namely one with the famous 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.450
 Frankfurter green sauce this through the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.790
 Expulsion of huguenots originally 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.280
 from france coming sauce is yes 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.199
 everything is widespread in hessian space 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.199
 and is made from seven herbs 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.600
 There are also variants here, for example 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.760
 with crushed hard-boiled eggs 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.790
 then more suitable for potatoes or 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.399
 without and then like to meatballs or 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.800
 especially table top we made 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.130
 our own variant the outstanding 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.170
 to the pasta basta we need for it 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:05.850

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:11.240

 Cream of eggs and Italian hard cheese 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.450
 For example, pecorino or pan says 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.890
 and the herbs and that said it 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.540
 there are areas 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.030
 there are these as herbs for 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.840
 frankfurter green sauce bundled directly 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.549
 offered 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.110
 So who lives in frankfurt will not be there 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.330
 but have problems in hamburg and berlin 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.250
 that looks quite different I have 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.320
 Anyhow my herbs on the balcony 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.130
 We start right there is there 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.979
 The chives take sorrel 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.390
 followed by criminal and what's up 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.390
 is pending score 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.950
 the smaller what I was such a ground 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.020
 beats class followed by the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 well known parsley and to 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.860
 conclusion is still borage to these 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.460
 noted that he is beautiful 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.570
 Blue flowers are also edible 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.340
 Excellent for decoration purposes 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.770
 can still be used an important 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.540
 Note to some while 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.470
 Ugly woman her cellphone my head 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.630
 will strike together 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.480
 but if you do not use these herbs 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.040
 will not want to have any desire 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.470
 corresponding pots of windows 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.360
 Imagine then I can there as well 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.300
 be easily varied is one looks 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.860
 anyway made it then sake 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.390
 or sometimes estragon what they are 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.090
 want to say is there too 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.380
 combinations of frozen herbs and 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.720
 they are almost everywhere 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.750
 and just might be just this 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.209
 take now we go and drive 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.310
 First the exhaust I take a bulette 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.450
 for it because we can only rubbed them 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.350
 use accordingly and 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.090
 function 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.180
 Now we turn to the herbs 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.550
 bigger leaves like here from porec 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.940
 we distribute roughly smaller leaves of 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.480
 the criminal we shrug off the style 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.709
 We also do the parsley 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.760
 the chive roughly into rolls 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.250
 distribute the leaves of sorrel 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.510
 We cut back to the size have 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.120
 because I have a lot to do that is already small 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.370
 enough and at the score we divide again 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.060
 leaves and stems in a suitable 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:22.550
 We give the eggs and add the eggs 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.030
 Add herbs as well as the cream 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.290
 and then everything is thoroughly stirred 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:33.010
 to hold up for a green liquid mass 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:37.190
 These are seasoned with salt and pepper 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.290
 Grated nutmeg stir everything 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.750
 Give half of the grated cheese 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.680
 Add and mix everything again 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:50.690
 Now we cut the onion thoroughly 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.510
 small and cook in parallel ever 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.980
 our spaghetti in plenty of salt water 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.950
 in a pan we give the diced 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.950
 ham bacon fry this briefly 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.420
 Give the small cut onion with 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.310
 We also thinned and thinned 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.380
 These are with the spaghetti 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.990
 now finished cooked and poured 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.400
 but still dripping wet, we give them in the 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:19.359
 pan in we stir everything 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.680
 These the green herbs cream over it 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.010
 and in a mild heat, mix with me 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.010
 everything 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.090
 only the second half of 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.970
 grated cheese over this stir 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.490
 and our spaghetti frankfurter 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.560
 Carbonara can be served 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.750

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.639
