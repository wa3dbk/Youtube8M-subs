they're<00:01:40.550> her<00:01:40.790> own<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.330> so<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.590> cichlid

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
they're her own and so the cichlid

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.620 
they're her own and so the cichlid
becomes<00:01:43.400> a<00:01:43.670> surrogate<00:01:44.030> mother<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.259> predator
