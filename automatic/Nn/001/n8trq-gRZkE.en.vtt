00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
first fueled crap episode and the reason

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.090 
first fueled crap episode and the reason
why<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> say<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.439> because<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.949> all

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
why I say that is because this is all

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.609 
why I say that is because this is all
about<00:00:23.250> hydration<00:00:23.460> okay<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:25.230> hydration

whatever gear you were carrying you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
whatever gear you were carrying you
can't<00:01:15.570> carry<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:16.020> everybody<00:01:16.470> else<00:01:16.650> has<00:01:16.830> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
can't carry now everybody else has to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.710 
can't carry now everybody else has to
carry<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.490> you're<00:01:18.150> out<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> training

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
carry it and you're out of training

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.620 
carry it and you're out of training
which<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.140> perhaps<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> worst<00:01:20.159> parts

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
which is perhaps one of the worst parts

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.670 
which is perhaps one of the worst parts
so<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.960> go<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.290> three<00:01:22.470> main

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
so I'm going to go with the three main

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.620 
so I'm going to go with the three main
ways<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.970> keep<00:01:24.090> yourself<00:01:24.240> hydrated

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
ways that you can keep yourself hydrated

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
ways that you can keep yourself hydrated
in<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.470> field<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.659> let<00:01:27.659> me<00:01:27.750> grab<00:01:28.229> something

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
in the field and let me grab something

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.160 
in the field and let me grab something
else<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> thought<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:33.619> all<00:01:34.619> right<00:01:34.740> got<00:01:35.280> it

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
else that I thought of all right got it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.340 
else that I thought of all right got it
okay<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.210> basically<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.840> our<00:01:39.990> three<00:01:40.170> main

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
okay so basically we have our three main

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.020 
okay so basically we have our three main
items<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.369> I'm<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.790> ahead<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
items here and I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.480 
items here and I'm going to go ahead and
put<00:01:42.210> my<00:01:42.329> water<00:01:42.570> purification<00:01:42.990> tablets<00:01:43.490> which

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
put my water purification tablets which

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.740 
put my water purification tablets which
I<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:44.790> everybody<00:01:45.119> should<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.720> their

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
I think everybody should have in their

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.160 
I think everybody should have in their
assault<00:01:46.079> pack<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.560> their<00:01:46.680> gear<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.880> case

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
assault pack or their gear just in case

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.990 
assault pack or their gear just in case
you<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.280> source<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you know you don't have a source of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.120 
you know you don't have a source of
potable<00:01:51.930> water<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.860> from<00:01:53.040> a

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
potable water you have to get from a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.959 
potable water you have to get from a
stream<00:01:54.229> then<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.500> make<00:01:55.619> your<00:01:55.799> own<00:01:55.969> all

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
stream then you can make your own all

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.300 
stream then you can make your own all
right<00:01:57.090> first<00:01:57.329> thing<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> left<00:01:58.310> obviously

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
right first thing to the left obviously

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.800 
right first thing to the left obviously
we've<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.549> grown<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.790> since<00:02:00.149> kids<00:02:00.450> knowing

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
we've all grown up since kids knowing

MREs and if you are in a fix you need to

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.830 
MREs and if you are in a fix you need to
carry<00:07:24.580> more<00:07:24.820> water<00:07:25.090> and<00:07:25.210> you<00:07:25.389> just<00:07:25.539> don't<00:07:25.720> have

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:28.180 
a way to carry it save these fill it up

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.029 
a way to carry it save these fill it up
with<00:07:28.240> water<00:07:28.360> use<00:07:29.139> that<00:07:29.320> duct<00:07:29.530> tape<00:07:29.740> and<00:07:29.889> tape

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 
with water use that duct tape and tape

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:33.540 
with water use that duct tape and tape
it<00:07:30.190> up<00:07:30.780> just<00:07:31.780> so<00:07:31.990> valuable<00:07:32.530> I<00:07:32.770> can't<00:07:33.039> even<00:07:33.190> just

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.550 
it up just so valuable I can't even just

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.909 
it up just so valuable I can't even just
state<00:07:34.539> how<00:07:34.750> value<00:07:35.110> about<00:07:35.260> it<00:07:35.320> is<00:07:35.440> so<00:07:35.590> I<00:07:35.650> have<00:07:35.770> my

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 
state how value about it is so I have my

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:40.320 
state how value about it is so I have my
four<00:07:36.159> methods<00:07:36.430> of<00:07:36.849> carrying<00:07:37.720> water<00:07:38.580> and<00:07:39.580> you
