ended<00:03:24.610> up<00:03:24.730> owning<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:26.349> likeness<00:03:26.859> for<00:03:27.099> the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
ended up owning the likeness for the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.089 
ended up owning the likeness for the
second<00:03:27.670> great<00:03:28.200> that's<00:03:29.200> how<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.680> mean<00:03:29.829> that<00:03:29.920> how

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
second great that's how I mean that how

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.500 
second great that's how I mean that how
it<00:03:30.160> works<00:03:30.310> if<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.579> own<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.879> license<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.390> get

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
it works if you own the license you get

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.740 
it works if you own the license you get
to<00:03:31.629> be<00:03:31.750> whatever<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.290> they<00:03:33.569> distributed<00:03:34.569> it

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
to be whatever and they distributed it

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.520 
to be whatever and they distributed it
and<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.609> second<00:03:36.970> rapist<00:03:37.299> was<00:03:37.690> legally

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
and so the second rapist was legally

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.119 
and so the second rapist was legally
their<00:03:38.739> tech<00:03:39.120> foundation<00:03:40.120> but<00:03:40.720> they<00:03:41.349> chose<00:03:41.680> to

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
their tech foundation but they chose to

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.690 
their tech foundation but they chose to
farm<00:03:42.519> out<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.879> dub<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.930> TV<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.859> all<00:03:45.040> the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
farm out the dub to a TV so that all the

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.449 
farm out the dub to a TV so that all the
usual<00:03:46.209> suspects<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.109> prevalence<00:03:47.769> associated

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
usual suspects and prevalence associated

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.759 
usual suspects and prevalence associated
with<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.060> was<00:03:49.209> for<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.690> same<00:03:49.930> although<00:03:50.440> some

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
with it was for the same although some

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.770 
with it was for the same although some
of<00:03:50.799> us<00:03:51.040> do<00:03:51.250> work<00:03:51.489> about<00:03:51.849> companies<00:03:52.269> I<00:03:52.420> imagine

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
of us do work about companies I imagine

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.259 
of us do work about companies I imagine
if<00:03:52.840> they<00:03:52.989> had<00:03:53.019> chosen<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.680> do<00:03:53.829> it<00:03:54.150> we<00:03:55.150> would

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
if they had chosen to do it we would

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.490 
if they had chosen to do it we would
have<00:03:55.390> got<00:03:55.540> pretty<00:03:55.750> much<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.959> same<00:03:56.109> product

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
have got pretty much the same product

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.140 
have got pretty much the same product
but<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:57.099> way<00:03:57.220> they<00:03:57.430> did<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.730> out<00:03:57.849> that<00:03:58.030> was

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
but the way they did it out that was

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.900 
but the way they did it out that was
incredibly<00:03:58.690> cool<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.669> after<00:04:00.669> I<00:04:00.760> know

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
incredibly cool and after I know
