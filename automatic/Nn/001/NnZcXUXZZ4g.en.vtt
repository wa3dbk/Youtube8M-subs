all the Portuguese Air Force and Army

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.480 
all the Portuguese Air Force and Army
guys<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:17.540> it's<00:01:17.690> it's<00:01:17.930> great<00:01:18.050> it's<00:01:18.320> fantastic

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
guys so it's it's great it's fantastic

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.730 
guys so it's it's great it's fantastic
but<00:01:19.490> I<00:01:19.580> can<00:01:19.760> tell<00:01:19.910> you<00:01:20.090> that<00:01:20.690> much<00:01:21.320> like<00:01:21.560> from

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
but I can tell you that much like from

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.950 
but I can tell you that much like from
year<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.040> year<00:01:22.070> day<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.640> day<00:01:22.880> here<00:01:23.270> we<00:01:23.630> see<00:01:23.840> that

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
year to year day to day here we see that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.040 
year to year day to day here we see that
there<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.200> an<00:01:24.440> increasing<00:01:25.119> complexity<00:01:26.119> and<00:01:26.479> as

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
there is an increasing complexity and as

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.650 
there is an increasing complexity and as
the<00:01:27.710> days<00:01:27.920> go<00:01:28.070> by<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.820> exercise<00:01:29.210> is<00:01:29.360> getting<00:01:29.600> a

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
the days go by the exercise is getting a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.140 
the days go by the exercise is getting a
little<00:01:29.869> more<00:01:30.020> robust<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:31.550> what<00:01:32.030> does<00:01:32.119> that

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
little more robust and so what does that

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.820 
little more robust and so what does that
mean<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:32.450> means<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.140> we're<00:01:33.590> challenging

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
mean that means so we're challenging

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.920 
mean that means so we're challenging
ourselves<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:35.060> we're<00:01:35.210> bringing<00:01:35.360> more<00:01:35.660> pieces

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
ourselves and we're bringing more pieces

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.080 
ourselves and we're bringing more pieces
and<00:01:36.110> parts<00:01:36.860> and<00:01:37.100> assets<00:01:37.430> into<00:01:37.700> each<00:01:37.850> one<00:01:38.030> of

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
and parts and assets into each one of

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.780 
and parts and assets into each one of
these<00:01:38.180> scenarios<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.500> yes<00:01:40.040> I<00:01:40.070> think<00:01:40.700> the

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
these scenarios and so yes I think the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.460 
these scenarios and so yes I think the
exercise<00:01:41.210> is<00:01:41.450> developing<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.080> is<00:01:42.140> becoming

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
exercise is developing and is becoming

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.889 
exercise is developing and is becoming
more<00:01:42.820> integrated<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.060> certainly<00:01:44.570> more

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
more integrated and certainly more

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.050 
more integrated and certainly more
complex<00:01:45.410> so<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.740> challenges<00:01:46.340> small<00:01:46.670> players

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
complex so the challenges small players

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.930 
complex so the challenges small players
which<00:01:47.960> again<00:01:48.290> is<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.710> great<00:01:49.070> opportunity<00:01:49.460> for

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
which again is a great opportunity for

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.249 
which again is a great opportunity for
us<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.330> a<00:01:50.360> great<00:01:50.390> opportunity<00:01:50.600> for<00:01:51.050> the

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
us and a great opportunity for the

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.250 
us and a great opportunity for the
Portuguese

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
Portuguese

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.310 
Portuguese
us<00:01:52.770> learn<00:01:53.610> from<00:01:53.850> each<00:01:54.000> other<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.510> had<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.200> be

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
us learn from each other I had to be

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.540 
us learn from each other I had to be
able<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.530> figure<00:01:55.680> out<00:01:55.860> how<00:01:56.010> we<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.400> things

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
able to figure out how we can do things

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.970 
able to figure out how we can do things
better<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.180> one<00:01:58.110> day<00:01:58.230> at<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> time<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.830> it's

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
better and one day at a time so it's

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.830 
better and one day at a time so it's
very<00:01:59.040> good<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.790> ranges<00:02:00.120> are<00:02:00.330> relatively

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
very good the ranges are relatively

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.200 
very good the ranges are relatively
close<00:02:01.250> of<00:02:02.250> course<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.760> everybody<00:02:03.060> here

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
close of course we have everybody here

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.210 
close of course we have everybody here
so<00:02:04.080> we<00:02:04.260> get<00:02:04.410> to<00:02:04.530> sit<00:02:04.710> down<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.010> talk

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
so we get to sit down and talk

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.180 
so we get to sit down and talk
face-to-face<00:02:05.640> brief<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:07.290> debrief<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.920> all

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
face-to-face brief and debrief with all

ability to sit and talk with everybody

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.330 
ability to sit and talk with everybody
and<00:02:15.660> then<00:02:15.810> go<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.260> relatively<00:02:16.950> short<00:02:17.190> distance

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and then go a relatively short distance

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.820 
and then go a relatively short distance
to<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.180> airspace<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.810> then<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> very<00:02:19.350> very

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
to the airspace and then a very very

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.910 
to the airspace and then a very very
robust<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.790> not<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.780> air<00:02:22.140> space<00:02:22.410> itself<00:02:22.740> but

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
robust and not just air space itself but

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.220 
robust and not just air space itself but
the<00:02:23.520> ground<00:02:24.030> facilities<00:02:24.600> whether<00:02:24.900> they're

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
the ground facilities whether they're

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.350 
the ground facilities whether they're
airfields<00:02:25.830> or<00:02:26.310> landing<00:02:26.880> zones<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
airfields or landing zones for the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.650 
airfields or landing zones for the
helicopters<00:02:27.990> convoys<00:02:28.890> with<00:02:29.670> multiple<00:02:30.540> air

helicopters convoys with multiple air

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.680 
helicopters convoys with multiple air
vehicles<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.850> bring<00:02:33.270> all<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.510> together

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
vehicles so to bring all that together

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.620 
vehicles so to bring all that together
in<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.200> pretty<00:02:34.470> small<00:02:34.770> area<00:02:35.330> with<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.360> lot<00:02:36.600> of

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
in a pretty small area with a lot of

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.770 
in a pretty small area with a lot of
room<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:36.870> work<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.820> about<00:02:38.820> as<00:02:39.150> real-world<00:02:39.600> as

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
room that work is about as real-world as

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.660 
room that work is about as real-world as
you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.020> get<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:40.830> what<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.100> have<00:02:41.280> here<00:02:41.580> is

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
you can get and so what we have here is

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.280 
you can get and so what we have here is
an<00:02:41.790> excellent<00:02:42.000> opportunity<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.630> train<00:02:42.990> like

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
an excellent opportunity to train like

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.080 
an excellent opportunity to train like
we<00:02:43.440> would<00:02:43.650> fight<00:02:43.890> which<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.580> always<00:02:44.790> what

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
we would fight which is always what

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.780 
we would fight which is always what
we're<00:02:45.240> trying<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.480> go<00:02:45.630> do<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:47.460> these<00:02:47.610> two

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
we're trying to go do so for these two

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.820 
we're trying to go do so for these two
weeks<00:02:48.000> that's<00:02:48.900> training<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.350> we<00:02:49.440> accomplish

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
weeks that's training that we accomplish

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.920 
weeks that's training that we accomplish
here<00:02:49.950> these<00:02:50.190> two<00:02:50.400> weeks<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:51.540> probably<00:02:51.840> going

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
here these two weeks it's probably going

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.850 
here these two weeks it's probably going
to<00:02:51.990> be<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.200> best<00:02:52.320> training<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.680> we're<00:02:52.770> going

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
to be the best training that we're going

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.760 
to be the best training that we're going
to<00:02:52.950> get<00:02:53.040> over<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.340> next<00:02:53.400> few<00:02:53.640> months
