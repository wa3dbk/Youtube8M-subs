 A) Yes 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.150
 of plants in rate and what we 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.370
 we call 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.590
 the possibility of spying 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.200
 sanctification is always able to access 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.280
 planes in the central and national 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.920
 where all the wine passes that this follows 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.920
 executing at the same time subscribing 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.950
 multiple 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:59.890
 breathe and keep going something behind avn 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.440
 - firm and loyal and this of this hub 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.850
 central message I have all my 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.850
 accounts bonuses 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.090
 I detest all my accounts all happens 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.409
 but not only is it to see an action 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.510
 what is not a news feel can I 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.090
 take a duration not answer a tweet 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.980
 directly if it stands out from the central 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.519
 of messages without having to open twitter 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.180
 by experience for another strong point 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.370
 it has to do with the balance of power 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.790
 protect the user and the company by 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.099
 Separate between personal and work 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.689
 felt the work everything is generated in 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.359
 this environment from the perimeter of 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:43.010
 work will be within what is 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:45.500
 a cooperative environment that is one day 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.099
 reference meditation and devices 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.480
 express only address for 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.760
 control the data that is generated 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.260
 within this period he lived all the 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.120
 exploration levels with which is very 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.459
 valuable as luckily 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.810
 for example I can in a room that 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.130
 is for the 'world sector 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.099
 applications that are only 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.160
 corporate at the same time I can 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.670
 open my personal environment of April of 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.720
 word and these applications coexist with 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.579
 other environments 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.380
 what is important is where the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.669
 information on the comparative topic 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.669
 the corporate remain 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.520
 that can quickly show us the 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.240
 keyboard 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.240
 on the other hand it has 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.379
 a mail temple 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.949
 it has awesome that is the way of 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:40.949
 predict or the for example the bryant 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.949
 copy 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.250
 first but I can say 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.930
 basically detects the language with the 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.849
 you're talking or writing and 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.960
 traditions and business have to define 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.970
 which or which are through effects or 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.169
 delete the word I can with the kind of 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.740
 keyboard 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:16.740
 they are not treated like the smart keyboard 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.499
 and is learning from the language of points 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.060
 can predict what will be removed for 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:21.810
 the choices of this is the same as 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.629
 forever 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.169
 Well more understanding the more or less 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.169
 Pressure actions 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:33.259
 selecting note put when you have 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.259
 profiles the actions 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.150
 but what is the reaction of those who 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.150
 they cut 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.580
 perfect terrific biting when 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.260
 we calculate one that would suffice the block 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.780
 of ripoll or less of Latin America in 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.490
 March will be colored li venezuela already 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.440
 from there start to throw yourself to the 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.970
 countries in the price region do not 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.350
 knows absolutely nothing yet true 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.350
 thank you very much for
