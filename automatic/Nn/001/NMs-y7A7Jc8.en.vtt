00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
not one you do a chromatic shape a

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.740 
not one you do a chromatic shape a
chromatic<00:01:48.580> shape<00:01:48.940> is<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.729> have<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.090> first

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
chromatic shape is a you have the first

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.359 
chromatic shape is a you have the first
fret<00:01:53.110> on<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.460> 2nd<00:01:54.460> 4th<00:01:54.729> strings<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.360> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
fret on the 2nd 4th strings and the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.890 
fret on the 2nd 4th strings and the
second<00:01:57.369> fret<00:01:57.610> on<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.880> first<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:58.690> third

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
second fret on the first and third

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.630 
second fret on the first and third
strings<00:01:59.259> so<00:01:59.770> you<00:01:59.860> can<00:02:00.009> kind<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.280> see<00:02:00.430> a<00:02:00.460> little

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
strings so you can kind of see a little

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.310 
strings so you can kind of see a little
pattern<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:03.490> not<00:02:03.670> very<00:02:03.790> pretty<00:02:04.060> very<00:02:04.900> often

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
pattern it's not very pretty very often

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.229 
pattern it's not very pretty very often
than<00:02:05.530> not<00:02:05.740> very<00:02:06.220> often<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.520> sound<00:02:06.880> pretty<00:02:07.060> so

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
than not very often to sound pretty so

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.960 
than not very often to sound pretty so
just<00:02:10.239> looking<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.509> for<00:02:10.660> now<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:12.190> once<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.880> hit

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
just looking it for now so once you hit

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.740 
just looking it for now so once you hit
that<00:02:14.310> that's<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:16.150> air<00:02:16.270> page<00:02:16.450> where<00:02:16.630> they<00:02:16.720> can

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
that that's the air page where they can

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.790 
that that's the air page where they can
be<00:02:16.900> doing<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.750> whole<00:02:20.110> shape<00:02:20.410> is<00:02:20.620> going

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
be doing and that whole shape is going

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.470 
be doing and that whole shape is going
to<00:02:20.860> shift<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:21.459> luckily<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.910> get<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.150> use<00:02:22.270> that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
to shift so luckily you get to use that

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.440 
to shift so luckily you get to use that
same<00:02:22.660> shape<00:02:23.140> for<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.500> next<00:02:23.800> few<00:02:24.550> climbing

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
same shape for the next few climbing

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.570 
same shape for the next few climbing
notes<00:02:25.630> where<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:25.959> go<00:02:26.110> way<00:02:26.320> up<00:02:26.350> there<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:27.340> if

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
notes where you go way up there so if

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.780 
notes where you go way up there so if
you<00:02:27.670> remember<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.090> baseline<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.600> gonna<00:02:28.750> be<00:02:32.790> so

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
you remember the baseline is gonna be so

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:44.130 
you remember the baseline is gonna be so
once<00:02:34.299> he<00:02:34.360> hit<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.630> first<00:02:34.900> enough<00:02:42.150> okay<00:02:43.150> so

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
once he hit that first enough okay so

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.320 
once he hit that first enough okay so
get<00:02:44.920> back<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.250> other<00:02:45.400> video<00:02:45.640> if<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.180> need

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
get back to the other video if you need

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.710 
get back to the other video if you need
the<00:02:46.420> baseline<00:02:46.840> again<00:02:48.360> okay<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:49.420> you're<00:02:49.660> using

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
the baseline again okay so you're using

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:58.280 
the baseline again okay so you're using
that<00:02:49.930> chromatic<00:02:50.500> for<00:02:50.769> one<00:02:51.100> more<00:02:55.920> okay

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
that chromatic for one more okay

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.750 
that chromatic for one more okay
let's<00:02:59.290> see<00:02:59.470> am<00:02:59.620> I<00:02:59.769> missing<00:02:59.920> anything<00:03:00.190> else

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
let's see am I missing anything else

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.960 
let's see am I missing anything else
from<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.060> part<00:03:02.220> note<00:03:03.220> then<00:03:03.459> not<00:03:03.670> three

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
from that part note then not three

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.460 
from that part note then not three
minutes<00:03:04.299> when<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.630> go<00:03:04.780> ahead<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.080> play<00:03:05.440> through

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
minutes when I go ahead and play through

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.710 
minutes when I go ahead and play through
it<00:03:05.769> again<00:03:05.890> one<00:03:06.280> more<00:03:06.400> time<00:03:06.459> for<00:03:06.910> clarification

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
it again one more time for clarification

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:23.270 
it again one more time for clarification
maybe<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.230> play<00:03:08.410> with<00:03:08.590> me<00:03:08.799> if<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.190> can

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.720 

okay<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:25.720> after<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.400> where<00:03:27.519> you<00:03:27.640> get

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
okay so after that this is where you get

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.280 
okay so after that this is where you get
your<00:03:27.819> break<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.090> get<00:03:28.450> some<00:03:28.870> pretty<00:03:29.080> easy

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
your break you get some pretty easy

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.899 
your break you get some pretty easy
stuff<00:03:29.409> to<00:03:29.739> play<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.840> you're<00:03:32.140> gonna<00:03:32.230> be<00:03:32.379> hitting

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
stuff to play so you're gonna be hitting

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.559 
stuff to play so you're gonna be hitting
immediately<00:03:33.909> after<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.269> you're<00:03:34.390> going<00:03:34.510> to

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
immediately after that you're going to

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.110 
immediately after that you're going to
