00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 or the girls and boys good in this video 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.639
 I'm going to show you how to make the box 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.300
 sticks that I made in which I used to 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.849
 make it from the original gift that is what 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.199
 of the pump people who do not know 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.880
 what is the tutorial I leave here the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.560
 link so they know what it is and from what 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 is what I'm talking about a lot of people 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.430
 they asked me what teaching to do 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.740
 little box so I'll teach it in this 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.250
 video what we need is a piece 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.800
 like this kind of cellophane paper that 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.489
 I will use it to be able to paste over 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.660
 of him and then he can separate it 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.579
 easily and that I do not stick 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.399
 surface to protect especially the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.640
 surface on which we will work 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:48.570
 we will need some tweezers of these ones 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.600
 white carpenter tail scissors that I 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.129
 I have it to pay for wood I have it 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.610
 in this little boat to make me more 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.610
 practical 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.530
 the transparent adhesive tape a cutter 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.620
 the most important thing are the sticks 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.490
 that this one I bought it a Chinese bazaar 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:13.030
 cost 90 cents and 350 but the most 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.070
 recommended is that you buy in 212 of 50 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.979
 because right now I do not know how many are 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.050
 sticks that we will need but yes 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.479
 what are you going to be about 50 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.190
 you place a little over 50 so buy 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.700
 two in case something and also will be left over 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.150
 for later and an acetate sheet these 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.880
 they buy them in the stationeries 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.120
 from this height I want the box 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.860
 so that's why I put 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.260
 7 chopsticks like this ones over 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.000
 of others if you want it higher 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.230
 because it would simply be adding more 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.580
 chopsticks up then we're going to have 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.909
 what to do 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.939
 6 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.789
 groups of seven chopsticks so this 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:04.770
 way here I already have my six groups of 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.659
 seven sticks we will start to paste these 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.629
 sticks just the same way as 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.430
 we put and one on top of another 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.580
 Well, we 're going to hit it trying 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.670
 are aligned as much as possible 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.130
 how they see I have already stuck them all 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.010
 they remain like this 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.670
 if you want and so that there is a 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.580
 little stronger they could throw him once 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.820
 that are glued on, put a layer of 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.610
 white tail above so they remain 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.490
 more resistant we will take two pieces and 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.740
 a stick and we'll put it this way 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.090
 in the middle of the two and we will mark in this 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.800
 part of here now with the cutter 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.980
 we will review several times for that brand 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.190
 what we have done and then with the clamp that 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.950
 we will be pressure to cut the piece 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.230
 we do not want how we are going to be 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.800
 splinters with a scissor we're going to 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.200
 cut them and so leave them smooth then with 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.140
 white tail we will stick that piece fit 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.570
 in the middle to paste the two 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.530
 rows of chopsticks you have to make another 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.530
 piece equal to this 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.560
 good as you see we are now depending 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.410
 as long as we have this we are going to 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.090
 make a row like this in this way 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.640
 more chopsticks will also depend on what 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.130
 long as the candies or what 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.470
 want to put inside the box now what 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.720
 what we will do is paste the whole row and 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.900
 once we have it stuck we are going to 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.660
 make two horizontal lines of this 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.870
 shape and then we will do the same as before 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.660
 with the cutter review the line then with 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.120
 the tapes remove the pieces that we 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.170
 subtract and finally remove the chips 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.170
 with scissors 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.930
 once we have the base we put 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.480
 our pieces in this way and we will do 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.480
 a few lines here and here 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.860
 by these lines we will do the same as 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.170
 before cutting the rest that we do not want to 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.049
 the same shape with the cutter we will mark 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.269
 the lines that we had already made then 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.090
 with the tongs we will remove the pieces that 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.150
 we do not want and that we want to cut and for 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.350
 last with the scissors we will remove the 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.350
 chips that remain 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.930
 then our two will take our 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.590
 two pieces that we were missing from seven 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.110
 chopsticks and we will make the last two faces 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.780
 of the box in the same way as 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.850
 we did before 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.580
 once we have all the faces the 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.870
 we will stick with white glue and finally 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.870
 we would have our little box 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.630
 to make the lid what we will do will be 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:01.520
 measure the faces of the box and we will make a 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.069
 pattern like this 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.599
 we will make the rectangle that would be the 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:08.810
 measurements of the box and then we will add 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:11.389
 strange three centimeters then with 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.800
 we will make the folds and with tape 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.530
 adhesive we will stick 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.500
 the tabs and so we will have our 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.810
 box with our stage I hope that you 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.460
 have liked the video and that it is of 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.030
 useful to girls who had it for me 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.870
 order is how my other box was 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.300
 and I'll use it to get my material 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:38.159
 we will see in the next video and if you 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:42.500
 Interested can go to the video tutorial of 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.500
