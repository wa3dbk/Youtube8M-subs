hello<00:00:05.310> everybody

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
hello everybody

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.419 
hello everybody
Flopsy<00:00:06.690> well<00:00:07.379> recently<00:00:07.620> have<00:00:07.980> stumbled<00:00:08.280> upon

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
Flopsy well recently have stumbled upon

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.000 
Flopsy well recently have stumbled upon
a<00:00:08.940> property<00:00:09.599> which<00:00:10.260> i<00:00:10.380> think<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.679> interesting

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
a property which i think is interesting

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.230 
a property which i think is interesting
about<00:00:11.820> even<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:12.750> odd<00:00:12.929> numbers<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:14.240> just

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
about even on odd numbers so just

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.939 
about even on odd numbers so just
thought<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.480> would<00:00:15.780> share<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.619> so

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
thought I would share that with you so

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.570 
thought I would share that with you so
first<00:00:17.910> about<00:00:18.720> odd<00:00:19.050> numbers<00:00:19.470> let's<00:00:20.100> take<00:00:20.430> an

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
first about odd numbers let's take an

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.570 
first about odd numbers let's take an
odd<00:00:20.670> number<00:00:21.060> say<00:00:21.420> 5<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.859> expressed<00:00:23.130> as

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
odd number say 5 it can be expressed as

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.300 
odd number say 5 it can be expressed as
sum<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.210> 2<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.930> 3<00:00:25.170> 2<00:00:25.590> 1<00:00:25.740> 3<00:00:25.769> both<00:00:26.130> are

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
sum of 2 and 3 2 1 3 both are

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.630 
sum of 2 and 3 2 1 3 both are
consecutive<00:00:27.590> numbers<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.220> let's<00:00:29.429> take

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
consecutive numbers so let's take

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.170 
consecutive numbers so let's take
another<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:30.029> maybe<00:00:30.599> 7<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.289> time<00:00:31.529> 3<00:00:32.099> &amp;<00:00:32.309> 4<00:00:32.579> next

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
another one maybe 7 this time 3 &amp; 4 next

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.840 
another one maybe 7 this time 3 &amp; 4 next
say<00:00:33.719> 15<00:00:34.309> 7<00:00:35.309> &amp;<00:00:35.430> 8<00:00:36.290> well<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.129> also<00:00:38.309> express

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
say 15 7 &amp; 8 well you can also express

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.060 
say 15 7 &amp; 8 well you can also express
this<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.710> 1<00:00:40.710> 2<00:00:41.640> 5<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> point<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.469> any

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
this as 1 2 5 so the point here is any

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.440 
this as 1 2 5 so the point here is any
odd<00:00:44.430> number<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.420> expressed<00:00:45.750> as<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:47.039> sum<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
odd number can be expressed as a sum of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.410 
odd number can be expressed as a sum of
consecutive<00:00:48.450> numbers<00:00:48.809> 5<00:00:49.559> 4<00:00:50.370> 5<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.090> there

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
consecutive numbers 5 4 5 that is there

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.010 
consecutive numbers 5 4 5 that is there
are<00:00:51.480> 2<00:00:51.690> &amp;<00:00:51.870> 3<00:00:51.930> 4<00:00:52.289> 15<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.850> either<00:00:54.000> 7<00:00:54.510> 8<00:00:54.719> or

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
are 2 &amp; 3 4 15 that can be either 7 8 or

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.490 
are 2 &amp; 3 4 15 that can be either 7 8 or
1<00:00:55.590> 2<00:00:55.739> 5<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.940> every<00:00:57.629> odd<00:00:57.750> number<00:00:58.109> has<00:00:58.289> this

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
1 2 5 so every odd number has this

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.860 
1 2 5 so every odd number has this
unique<00:00:58.890> property<00:00:59.160> well<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.570> unique

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
unique property well this is unique

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.590 
unique property well this is unique
because<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.890> even<00:01:02.399> numbers<00:01:02.489> doesn't<00:01:03.149> have

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
because all even numbers doesn't have

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.090 
because all even numbers doesn't have
this<00:01:03.840> property<00:01:04.229> let<00:01:04.530> me<00:01:04.559> show<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.070> I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this property let me show you what I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.750 
this property let me show you what I
mean<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.210> let's<00:01:06.990> take<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.860> even<00:01:08.460> number

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
mean so now let's take an even number

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.020 
mean so now let's take an even number
this<00:01:08.909> time<00:01:09.119> say<00:01:09.990> 6<00:01:10.350> well<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:12.000> be

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
this time say 6 well that can be

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.710 
this time say 6 well that can be
expressed<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:13.020> 2<00:01:13.710> plus<00:01:13.979> 4<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.390> further

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
expressed as 2 plus 4 and if you further

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.710 
expressed as 2 plus 4 and if you further
simplify<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.950> could<00:01:17.250> get<00:01:17.490> 1<00:01:18.090> plus<00:01:18.450> 2

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
simplify that you could get 1 plus 2

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.830 
simplify that you could get 1 plus 2
Plus<00:01:18.990> 3<00:01:19.020> sum<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.189> consecutive<00:01:21.060> numbers<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
Plus 3 sum of consecutive numbers and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.240 
Plus 3 sum of consecutive numbers and
similarly<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:23.070> 10<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.630> 1<00:01:25.530> plus<00:01:25.920> 2

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
similarly for 10 you can get 1 plus 2

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.140 
similarly for 10 you can get 1 plus 2
Plus<00:01:26.520> 3<00:01:26.549> plus<00:01:26.909> 4<00:01:27.659> because<00:01:28.110> 10<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.740> 6<00:01:29.220> plus<00:01:29.430> 4<00:01:29.640> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
Plus 3 plus 4 because 10 is 6 plus 4 so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.310 
Plus 3 plus 4 because 10 is 6 plus 4 so
even<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.920> express<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.939> sum<00:01:33.119> of

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
even then you can express it as a sum of

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.530 
even then you can express it as a sum of
consecutive<00:01:34.320> numbers<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.579> let's<00:01:35.759> try<00:01:36.329> that

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
consecutive numbers but let's try that

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.130 
consecutive numbers but let's try that
for<00:01:36.810> 8<00:01:37.020> well<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.280> try<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.880> forever<00:01:39.450> but

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
for 8 well you can try that forever but

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.010 
for 8 well you can try that forever but
you<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.409> never<00:01:40.700> expand<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.540> sum<00:01:42.840> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
you can never expand this as a sum of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.190 
you can never expand this as a sum of
first<00:01:43.350> two<00:01:43.590> numbers<00:01:43.829> right<00:01:44.579> well<00:01:45.119> here<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
first two numbers right well here is the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.679 
first two numbers right well here is the
reason<00:01:46.560> which<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.220> found<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.000> 8<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.659> be

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
reason which I have found so 8 can be

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.460 
reason which I have found so 8 can be
expressed

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
expressed

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.800 
expressed
if<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.950> factorize<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.210> express<00:01:51.509> it

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
if you factorize it you can express it

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.030 
if you factorize it you can express it
as<00:01:51.950> 2<00:01:52.950> times<00:01:53.310> 2<00:01:53.549> times<00:01:53.579> 2<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.840> take<00:01:55.439> 10

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
as 2 times 2 times 2 and if you take 10

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.440 
as 2 times 2 times 2 and if you take 10
here<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.600> express<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.229> as<00:01:58.759> 2<00:01:59.759> times<00:02:00.060> 5

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
here you can express that as 2 times 5

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.889 
here you can express that as 2 times 5
so<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:02.159> crazy<00:02:02.790> part<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.719> crazy

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
so the crazy part in the crazy

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.080 
so the crazy part in the crazy
difference<00:02:04.439> between<00:02:04.799> these<00:02:04.950> two<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.189> 10<00:02:05.820> has

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
difference between these two is 10 has

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.979 
difference between these two is 10 has
got<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.570> even<00:02:07.170> factor<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.280> 8<00:02:08.550> don't<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.750> that

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
got this even factor but 8 don't so that

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.680 
got this even factor but 8 don't so that
is<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.379> reason<00:02:10.530> 10<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.670> expressed<00:02:12.090> as<00:02:12.330> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
is the reason 10 can be expressed as a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.699 
is the reason 10 can be expressed as a
sum<00:02:12.930> of

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
sum of

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.720 
sum of
consecutive<00:02:14.310> numbers<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.879> eight<00:02:15.359> cannot<00:02:16.019> so

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
consecutive numbers and eight cannot so

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.000 
consecutive numbers and eight cannot so
from<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.969> you<00:02:18.180> can<00:02:18.510> even<00:02:18.959> for<00:02:19.530> six<00:02:19.799> if<00:02:19.980> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
from this you can even for six if you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.649 
from this you can even for six if you
see<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:21.090> express<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.900> as<00:02:21.959> 2<00:02:22.859> times<00:02:22.890> 3<00:02:23.659> so

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
see you can express that as 2 times 3 so

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.009 
see you can express that as 2 times 3 so
we<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.290> an<00:02:25.769> art<00:02:26.280> factor<00:02:27.000> here<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.420> that

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
we have an art factor here so that

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.129 
we have an art factor here so that
expand<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.069> as<00:02:29.219> a<00:02:29.670> sum<00:02:29.879> of<00:02:30.000> consecutive<00:02:30.599> number

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
expand it as a sum of consecutive number

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.699 
expand it as a sum of consecutive number
so<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:32.189> is<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.969> reason<00:02:33.389> which<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:34.079> believe<00:02:34.379> is

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
so that is the reason which I believe is

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.940 
so that is the reason which I believe is
why<00:02:35.280> we<00:02:35.519> can't<00:02:35.790> express<00:02:36.599> some<00:02:37.019> ordinance<00:02:37.680> some

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
why we can't express some ordinance some

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.160 
why we can't express some ordinance some
even<00:02:38.219> numbers<00:02:38.549> as<00:02:38.790> sum<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.269> continuous

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
even numbers as sum of continuous

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.929 
even numbers as sum of continuous
numbers<00:02:40.889> so<00:02:41.340> there<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.609> go

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
numbers so there you go

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.209 
numbers so there you go
that's<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:43.049> whole<00:02:43.230> idea<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.799> this<00:02:44.010> tutorial

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
that's the whole idea of this tutorial

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.220 
that's the whole idea of this tutorial
hope<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:44.969> guys<00:02:45.120> had<00:02:45.359> learn<00:02:45.569> something<00:02:46.049> new

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
hope you guys had learn something new

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.869 
hope you guys had learn something new
try<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.769> express<00:02:47.489> each<00:02:47.909> odd<00:02:48.750> number<00:02:49.319> as<00:02:49.849> sum<00:02:50.849> of

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
try to express each odd number as sum of

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.390 
try to express each odd number as sum of
consecutive<00:02:51.299> numbers<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.069> even<00:02:53.069> numbers

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
consecutive numbers and even numbers

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.899 
consecutive numbers and even numbers
which<00:02:54.000> satisfy<00:02:54.989> this<00:02:55.409> condition<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.069> having

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
which satisfy this condition of having

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.330 
which satisfy this condition of having
an<00:02:57.180> odd<00:02:57.299> factor<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:58.230> two<00:02:58.500> consecutive<00:02:58.859> numbers

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
an odd factor in two consecutive numbers

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.509 
an odd factor in two consecutive numbers
and<00:02:59.849> I'm<00:03:00.329> pretty<00:03:01.139> sure<00:03:01.560> you'll<00:03:01.889> have<00:03:02.129> fun

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
and I'm pretty sure you'll have fun

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.539 
and I'm pretty sure you'll have fun
doing<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.969> so<00:03:03.480> that's<00:03:04.109> for<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:04.379> tutorial

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
doing that so that's for this tutorial

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.549 
doing that so that's for this tutorial
