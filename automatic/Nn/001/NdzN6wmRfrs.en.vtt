00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.430 
it's it a very nice-looking car super
super<00:06:46.960> fast<00:06:48.120> but<00:06:49.120> again<00:06:49.659> I<00:06:49.690> think<00:06:49.810> it's<00:06:50.110> it's

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
super fast but again I think it's it's

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.240 
super fast but again I think it's it's
it's<00:06:50.650> more<00:06:51.090> like<00:06:52.090> a<00:06:52.120> sedan<00:06:52.720> with<00:06:53.500> power<00:06:53.770> I<00:06:54.099> mean

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
it's more like a sedan with power I mean

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.990 
it's more like a sedan with power I mean
I<00:06:54.460> had<00:06:54.789> a<00:06:54.819> Camry<00:06:55.270> before<00:06:55.569> this<00:06:55.720> and<00:06:56.819> you<00:06:57.819> know

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
I had a Camry before this and you know

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.330 
I had a Camry before this and you know
that<00:06:58.330> when<00:06:58.690> I<00:06:58.750> touched<00:06:58.960> over<00:06:59.229> drove<00:07:00.009> it

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
that when I touched over drove it

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.520 
that when I touched over drove it
I<00:07:00.370> actually<00:07:01.060> drove<00:07:01.300> it<00:07:01.960> at<00:07:02.050> the<00:07:02.139> STI<00:07:02.470> version

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
I actually drove it at the STI version

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.490 
I actually drove it at the STI version
of<00:07:02.949> it<00:07:03.069> but<00:07:03.220> when<00:07:04.180> I<00:07:04.240> test<00:07:04.479> drove<00:07:04.659> it

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.500 
of it but when I test drove it

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.680 
of it but when I test drove it
I<00:07:05.530> loved<00:07:06.280> the<00:07:06.370> power<00:07:06.550> of<00:07:06.789> it<00:07:06.940> the<00:07:07.240> handle<00:07:07.599> was

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
I loved the power of it the handle was

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.270 
I loved the power of it the handle was
okay<00:07:07.990> but<00:07:08.050> I<00:07:08.229> still<00:07:08.259> felt<00:07:08.800> like<00:07:08.889> I<00:07:09.129> was<00:07:09.340> in<00:07:09.639> a

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
okay but I still felt like I was in a

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:18.149 
okay but I still felt like I was in a
Camry<00:07:12.280> with<00:07:12.610> great<00:07:13.479> handling<00:07:14.020> and<00:07:16.349> and<00:07:17.349> a<00:07:17.919> lot
