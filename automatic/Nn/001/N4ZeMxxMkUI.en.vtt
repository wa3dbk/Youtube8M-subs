unexhausted groups to activate for my
next<00:07:27.040> turn<00:07:27.370> so<00:07:27.990> zambra<00:07:28.990> will<00:07:29.169> not<00:07:29.320> be<00:07:29.500> able<00:07:29.800> to

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:29.950 
next turn so zambra will not be able to

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.880 
next turn so zambra will not be able to
take<00:07:30.820> a<00:07:30.850> turn<00:07:31.090> again<00:07:31.419> and<00:07:31.660> so<00:07:32.200> bubbles<00:07:32.650> and

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:32.890 
take a turn again and so bubbles and

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.860 
take a turn again and so bubbles and
skitters<00:07:33.370> have<00:07:33.669> either<00:07:33.790> activated<00:07:34.480> or<00:07:34.690> are

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:34.870 
skitters have either activated or are

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.620 
skitters have either activated or are
dead<00:07:35.580> so<00:07:36.580> the<00:07:36.790> stern<00:07:37.030> I<00:07:37.060> would<00:07:37.360> choose<00:07:37.600> to

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:37.630 
dead so the stern I would choose to

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.560 
dead so the stern I would choose to
probably<00:07:38.140> activate<00:07:38.650> bubbles<00:07:39.330> but<00:07:40.330> you

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:40.570 
probably activate bubbles but you

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.630 
probably activate bubbles but you
basically<00:07:40.900> just<00:07:40.990> move<00:07:41.350> back<00:07:41.380> in<00:07:41.830> the<00:07:41.890> fourth

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:42.640 
basically just move back in the fourth

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.690 
basically just move back in the fourth
each<00:07:43.210> player<00:07:43.510> choosing<00:07:43.900> to<00:07:43.990> go<00:07:44.700> activating

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:45.700 
each player choosing to go activating

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.730 
each player choosing to go activating
him<00:07:45.850> playing<00:07:46.450> any<00:07:46.690> cards<00:07:47.050> that<00:07:47.140> he<00:07:47.320> chooses

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:47.740 
him playing any cards that he chooses

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.580 
him playing any cards that he chooses
and<00:07:47.919> then<00:07:48.550> making<00:07:49.120> a<00:07:49.360> tactical<00:07:49.900> action<00:07:50.320> to

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:50.590 
and then making a tactical action to

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.120 
and then making a tactical action to
move<00:07:51.400> grow<00:07:52.210> attack<00:07:52.930> or<00:07:53.230> resurrect<00:07:54.010> a<00:07:54.100> dead

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.130 
move grow attack or resurrect a dead

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.640 
move grow attack or resurrect a dead
goat<00:07:54.520> and<00:07:54.760> you<00:07:55.570> follow<00:07:55.810> that<00:07:55.960> cycle<00:07:56.320> bouncing

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:56.650 
goat and you follow that cycle bouncing

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.200 
goat and you follow that cycle bouncing
back<00:07:56.860> and<00:07:57.070> forth<00:07:57.400> I<00:07:57.460> think<00:07:57.640> crazier<00:07:58.090> and

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.210 
back and forth I think crazier and

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.150 
back and forth I think crazier and
crazier<00:07:58.270> and<00:07:58.870> stronger<00:07:59.350> and<00:07:59.500> stronger<00:07:59.740> buddy

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.160

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.510 
crazier and stronger and stronger buddy
goats<00:08:00.400> and<00:08:00.669> so<00:08:01.390> somebody<00:08:02.050> wins<00:08:02.770> destroying

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520
