00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
this then enters a heat exchanger and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.770 
this then enters a heat exchanger and
we're<00:01:59.549> told<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.970> outlet<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.630> is

estimate<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:06.260> warning<00:05:06.590> tells<00:05:06.800> us<00:05:07.010> which

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.590 
stream exiting the tower and in this
case<00:05:09.890> should<00:05:10.220> say<00:05:10.490> it's<00:05:10.730> a<00:05:10.850> pump<00:05:11.060> around<00:05:11.270> duty

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.540 
case should say it's a pump around duty
estimate<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:12.470> we<00:05:12.590> should<00:05:12.770> select<00:05:12.950> pump<00:05:13.340> around
