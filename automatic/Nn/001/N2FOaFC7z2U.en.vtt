and weird it is here all these little

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.230 
and weird it is here all these little
random<00:01:10.530> blocks<00:01:10.860> missing<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.939> kind<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
random blocks missing it's kind of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.910 
random blocks missing it's kind of
strange<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.590> come<00:01:13.740> right<00:01:13.890> over

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
here and it's like super clean flatland

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740 
here and it's like super clean flatland
it<00:01:16.979> gets<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.340> weird<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.689> just

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
changes so fast like look how much of a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.700 
changes so fast like look how much of a
mess<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> sudden<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.439> clean

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
mess that is all of a sudden it's clean

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.440 
mess that is all of a sudden it's clean
and<00:01:23.130> what's<00:01:23.369> nice<00:01:23.490> about<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.939> area<00:01:24.150> though

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
and what's nice about this area though

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910 
and what's nice about this area though
is<00:01:24.659> because<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> holes<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.890> are

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
is because all the holes that are

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
is because all the holes that are
already<00:01:26.280> built<00:01:26.580> through<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.540> mountain<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
already built through that mountain and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.260 
already built through that mountain and
the<00:01:28.500> access<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.009> trees<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> perfect

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the access to trees this is a perfect

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
the access to trees this is a perfect
starting<00:01:30.659> point<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:31.110> many<00:01:31.350> people<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.920> right

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
starting point for many people and right

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.920 
starting point for many people and right
over<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:32.850> you're<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> find<00:01:33.360> many

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
over here you're going to find many

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.270 
over here you're going to find many
places<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.380> go<00:01:34.530> mine<00:01:34.740> you've<00:01:34.920> got<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> couple

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
places to go mine you've got a couple

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.590 
places to go mine you've got a couple
holes<00:01:35.490> right<00:01:35.610> there<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.909> start<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.299> course

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
holes right there to start of course

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.390 
holes right there to start of course
you've<00:01:36.990> got<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.560> right<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.220> you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you've got this one right here that you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.460 
you've got this one right here that you
can<00:01:38.490> already<00:01:38.700> begin<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.689> search<00:01:39.930> around<00:01:40.110> for

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
can already begin to search around for

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.530 
can already begin to search around for
different<00:01:41.040> resources<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.299> know<00:01:42.390> there's

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
different resources so you know there's

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.850 
different resources so you know there's
many<00:01:42.659> purposes<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.259> course<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.649> kind

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
many purposes of course with this kind

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.100 
many purposes of course with this kind
of<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.979> seed<00:01:44.360> this<00:01:45.360> one's<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:45.689> geared<00:01:45.990> at

sometimes<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.259> starter<00:01:49.259> seeds

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
sometimes we do like starter seeds

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.100 
sometimes we do like starter seeds
diamond<00:01:50.430> seeds<00:01:50.729> would<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:51.990> know

diamond seeds would see do you know

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.060 
diamond seeds would see do you know
there's<00:01:52.290> there's<00:01:52.439> all<00:01:52.590> sorts<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> different

types of seeds you might actually do

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.410 
types of seeds you might actually do

a bizarre looking thing with these

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.539 
a bizarre looking thing with these
floating<00:02:04.380> mini<00:02:04.680> islands<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.159> then<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.340> has

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
floating mini islands and then this has

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.700 
floating mini islands and then this has
like<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> huge<00:02:06.149> gaping<00:02:06.450> hole<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.469> bunch<00:02:07.649> of

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
like a huge gaping hole and a bunch of

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.949 
like a huge gaping hole and a bunch of
many<00:02:07.950> tunnels<00:02:08.310> throughout<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.239> actual<00:02:09.690> core

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
many tunnels throughout the actual core

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.930 
many tunnels throughout the actual core
of<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.349> huge<00:02:10.950> mountain<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.610> funny<00:02:11.790> is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
of this huge mountain and it's funny is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.309 
of this huge mountain and it's funny is
it's<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.239> down<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> middle<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.690> nowhere<00:02:13.080> you

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
it's just down the middle of nowhere you

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.500 
it's just down the middle of nowhere you
sometimes<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.859> see<00:02:14.099> big<00:02:14.760> mountainous<00:02:15.120> areas

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
sometimes you see big mountainous areas

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.239 
sometimes you see big mountainous areas
this<00:02:15.689> is<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:15.959> one<00:02:16.109> of<00:02:16.140> those<00:02:16.379> because<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:17.159> go

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:17.249 
this is not one of those because you go

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:19.489 
this is not one of those because you go
out<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.609> here<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.659> like<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.139> have<00:02:19.319> the

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:19.499 
out of here and it's like you have the

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.250 
out of here and it's like you have the
huge<00:02:19.859> huge<00:02:20.519> they'll<00:02:20.819> just<00:02:21.150> random<00:02:21.629> thing<00:02:21.930> here

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
huge huge they'll just random thing here

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.050 
huge huge they'll just random thing here
and<00:02:22.469> then<00:02:22.920> outside<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.459> their<00:02:23.639> everything's

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
and then outside of their everything's

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.149 
and then outside of their everything's
back<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.389> normal<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.989> know<00:02:25.109> it's<00:02:25.709> all<00:02:25.829> kind<00:02:26.069> of

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
back to normal you know it's all kind of

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.750 
back to normal you know it's all kind of
just<00:02:26.840> mass<00:02:27.840> birch<00:02:28.439> trees<00:02:28.799> I<00:02:28.829> guess<00:02:29.189> over<00:02:29.519> here

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
just mass birch trees I guess over here

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.309 
just mass birch trees I guess over here
I<00:02:29.790> mean<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.299> what<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.599> what<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:30.989> likes<00:02:31.200> to

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
I mean this is what it what it likes to

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.410 
I mean this is what it what it likes to
be<00:02:31.409> I<00:02:31.439> guess<00:02:31.650> for<00:02:31.889> the<00:02:32.010> seed<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:33.060> got<00:02:33.180> mini

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
be I guess for the seed you got mini

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.119 
be I guess for the seed you got mini
sand<00:02:33.719> area<00:02:33.900> right<00:02:34.200> here<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.680> can<00:02:34.799> get<00:02:34.920> some

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
sand area right here so you can get some

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.339 
sand area right here so you can get some
awesome<00:02:35.879> resources<00:02:36.870> as<00:02:36.989> far<00:02:37.109> as<00:02:37.170> glass

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
awesome resources as far as glass

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.780 
awesome resources as far as glass
because<00:02:37.560> now<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.829> course<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.159> only<00:02:38.579> mini

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
because now of course it's only mini

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.220 
because now of course it's only mini
right<00:02:39.000> here<00:02:39.239> actually<00:02:39.510> extends<00:02:39.959> over<00:02:40.109> to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
right here actually extends over to

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.409 
right here actually extends over to
there<00:02:40.379> that's<00:02:40.590> got<00:02:40.709> quite<00:02:41.609> an<00:02:41.819> interesting

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:42.419 
there that's got quite an interesting

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.089 
there that's got quite an interesting
desert<00:02:42.959> thing<00:02:43.139> going<00:02:43.439> on<00:02:43.560> over<00:02:43.859> there<00:02:43.980> of

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
desert thing going on over there of

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.920 
desert thing going on over there of
course<00:02:44.310> but<00:02:44.430> overall<00:02:45.299> though<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.569> think<00:02:45.719> it's<00:02:45.900> a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
course but overall though I think it's a

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.030 
course but overall though I think it's a
very<00:02:46.019> balanced<00:02:46.379> tea<00:02:46.560> because<00:02:46.769> you've<00:02:46.919> got

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
very balanced tea because you've got

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.800 
very balanced tea because you've got
access<00:02:47.189> to<00:02:47.430> all<00:02:47.609> sorts<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.939> things<00:02:48.000> right<00:02:48.629> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
access to all sorts of things right the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.869 
access to all sorts of things right the
condensed<00:02:49.079> area<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.560> right<00:02:49.980> here<00:02:50.310> look<00:02:50.760> at

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
condensed area and right here look at

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.849 
condensed area and right here look at
the<00:02:51.000> way<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.329> sand<00:02:51.569> just<00:02:51.780> kind<00:02:52.079> of<00:02:52.139> grows<00:02:52.530> up

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
the way the sand just kind of grows up

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.709
