00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 World War II gave a lot of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.220
 to talk about in this time of war and 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.560
 many events occurred 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.809
 important and some interesting in 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.639
 almost everything there were many advances in the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.650
 science in war and apparatus 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.299
 electronic devices and many countries achieve 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.580
 make alliances that to this day 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.529
 they exist but it was also a time 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.600
 important for the animation since 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.640
 during this time many appeared 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.710
 cartoons that nowadays are super 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.599
 recognized among these the very famous 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.699
 series of looney tunes or the books 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.650
 band and their friends but during this 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.390
 era the warner brothers created some 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.489
 chapters that you could never say 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.500
 they went on air or were in a certain way 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.989
 prohibited or never again showed by 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.879
 different reasons but the chapters 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.950
 that appeared in this era were 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.840
 shot and erased without a doubt 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.579
 they were the ones that in addition to that appeared 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.370
 in the Second World War they had 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.989
 references of these sounds somewhat difficult 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 to believe but the truth is many 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.280
 companies and television series of that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.170
 then they came to have the theme of 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.940
 the second world war and today they 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.620
 I bring one of the chapters that was 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.600
 banned because he not only did 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.909
 references to the Second World War 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.659
 but to characters in this chapter 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.060

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.450
 we see a German with a shotgun in the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.399
 forest which is hunting this 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.109
 hunter is nothing more and nothing less than 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.179
 Mr. Herman Gohring one of the 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.369
 more powerful and great commanders of 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.439

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.629

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:55.229
 being in a germany forest 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.299

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.039

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.109

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.459
 distracts and starts to throw a tantrum 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.409

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.549
 take some ink from the soil and this one 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.440

 when brother sees this one stays 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.170

 scenes of trickery and cheating on the part 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.080

 a long time and never appeared in cartoon 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.780
 network this was to avoid problems 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.120
 because of the jokes and references to the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.250
