00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.840
 is that again such a great league game 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.240
 definitely not looking for seasonal startup i 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.730
 Both are certainly very very nervous 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.100
 and both on the three points and 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.430
 hope the opponent big problems 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.430
 to prepare 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.250
 umpire takes the meetings 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.140
 and I think we are all happy 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.710
 referee decides immediately 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.710
 corner 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.030
 very far away from the gate 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.030
 that's enough for him 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.350
 and we see a free kick 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.350
 even so you can free yourself 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.620
 that looks good 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.680
 there may be something developing 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.550
 great as he has solved the problem 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.600
 the motto is safety first 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.210
 and now he is with you 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.430
 he has a great time with him 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.740
 that must say clearly also in 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.049
 this situation made outstanding 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.920
 format radio where she wants to go to the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.920
 partie thoughts 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.540
 Great as he is ahead of the situation 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.010
 has come to guess so now will be the same 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.010
 changed at the expenses 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.769
 yes, there comes something to us 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.629
 yes there is the goalkeeper with him 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.010
 Thank you for not choosing this 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.010
 gave that he has made great 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.970
 everything still open in this encounter there 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.140
 play his 100 this is his now 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.980
 chance 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.980
 there will be quite 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.260
 must give a throw 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.520
 Now you can score your good goal 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.590
 yes that is dangerous 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.590
 He just explained that 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.790
 he has the right situation 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.299
 estimated 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.299
 trojan 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.659
 there's a game on ground it could be 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.659
 that he pulled himself 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.540
 beautiful dream combination 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.230
 yes that could be something 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.230
 The possibility takes the head 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.100
 That was a nice goal 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.530
 how can I be quite surprised yes 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.390
 because the perpetrator so far outstanding 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.220
 has shown performance maybe he was 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.140
 very briefly unfocused no idea 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.250
 and now I'm curious if he is 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.250
 that some form 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.570
 this signal is unique it is the 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.570
 circuit whistled 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.569
 That's the secret they play 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.789
 just until the final whistle through and 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:30.560
 then it works simply still the 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.560
 will was deciding here
