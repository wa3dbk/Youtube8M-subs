00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.390
 but 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.390
 it takes 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.550
 ayew everyone is giggs hd 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.620
 how are you listening to me it's going 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.600
 really super good so today the 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.480
 gloves are found on the call of duty 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.489
 ghost again sorry guys in 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.430
 frankly right now I'm doing enough 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.600
 a lot it's normal because good 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.730
 I appreciate this game so why not read 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.830
 not played frankly it would be a little 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.860
 beast on my part our gameplay gt 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.970
 equipped with the mts as well as the lifting of 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.620
 26 to kembo 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.050
 that's why my class at the same 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.140
 time was in infect so that was the 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.330
 directly predefined classes and I have 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.750
 managed to achieve my very first that 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.390
 m 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.130
 to infect it by affecting a step 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.140
 in modes confused way I think that 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.850
 you know now but maybe not 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.530
 if I was going to a little over 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.229
 a few chains like the ter like the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.270
 pure gaming bale who lives the coast cf 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.740
 and then the good plan of the geek so thank you to 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.510
 these community channels siem the little 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.549
 that would make me really happy 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.850
 so we're going directly started with the 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.530
 about this video which is such that 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.510
 the infected on mp3 it was better before or 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.210
 the infected it was better before because you 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.330
 know very well that the infected with ea was 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.010
 appeared on modern warfare 3 and not to 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.500
 black ops a blackhawk two models 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.030
 lighthouses of that on modern warfare 3 and 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.620
 I'll tell you a little bit 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.050
 why he was for me he was 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.150
 better before just play 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.830
 directly started already the maps I 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.780
 find they were really more 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.330
 little on flagship model 3 so we made 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.240
 much more on average in Kiel 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.840
 affect on my model painter a 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.820
 far away 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.220
 i say that on god of war iii have 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.379
 does about 15 to 20 that he in 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.879
 affected if we manage well face we manage 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.230
 well what if we do not relocate in any amap 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.340
 as there you will see that I'm going 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.110
 stay that in the tunnel where does that 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.360
 it's very well connected we camp like 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.700
 big bipeds I'm not going to say the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.410
 word anyway it would be a little bit 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.670
 disgusting for the video finally short 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.019
 you are very good that we camp a little 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.769
 to affect where we stay in a small 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.180
 perimeter 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.239
 look there the little one at home with 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.610
 we all quietly you know very 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.370
 although we delay a lot in 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.270
 small perimeters and that's why on 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.540
 a gain of 3-0 more kiel shot than on 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.370
 ghost simply because we 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.950
 there were many but many weapons 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.239
 on my hunger 3 in infected mode like fmg 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:54.019
 9 akimbo the way he was called 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.489
 this one the p90 his hands the t25 of 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.319
 stryker alas these weapons there was 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.239
 really enough shit and so that socke 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.420
 of duty ghost good we will not hide 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.090
 the weapons are really very bad 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.980
 as could say like the bulldog 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.260
 frankly it's a good son to pump 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.819
 but we will say that he is a little near 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.219
 same as the striker fayard seems a 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.680
 little mts is really the shotgun 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.569
 who stinks of shit like could say he 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.099
 is really bad enough to pump 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.260
 me personally if you play in 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.430
 online with his daughters ah good I do not you 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.250
 do not recommend it I advise you 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.239
 rather bulldog or mt 6 I am 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.019
 more is good like that 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.849
 finally we do not care the msb if there is 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.650
 as sure as you see that it's 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.900
 weapons really finally we do not see 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.239
 a lot partly classified from the camp 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.739
 online it's true that model finally 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.959
 three frankly I liked him for his 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.250
 diversity of weapons frankly there 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.200
 had a lot of weapons especially he got you to 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.659
 tired but suddenly we were not 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.560
 a great pleasure to play with me 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:53.000
 remember maps arcade and home 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.500
 I do not remember anymore how is called the 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.299
 map in the snow in the state does not hurt 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.780
 in affected I also had the bar is 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.169
 50 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.479
 while the tooth may on ghost we have that 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.750
 the link if I'm wrong that is not 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:07.729
 bac and the for me was the sniper the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.139
 less used of the community is good 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:12.639
 he vomits he must what they want 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:16.810
 I would have preferred to see dessert or 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:21.169
 leu and 118 that would have been much more 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.769
 much more likely to be used by 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.530
 the community 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.510
 Well, I think it's definitely 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.710
 my opinion after it's up to you to judge him 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.050
 guys but I prefer to see these 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.949
 snipers kla that the i the links that 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.280
 nobody plays with 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:37.130
 finally short to the sternum for you 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.470
 say that on global so 3 does not affect 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.150
 it was better before because we know 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.400
 very much of course when I was a kid 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.040
 did it they put the zone mode 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.020
 drop 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.120
 and yes they put the monk zone 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.880
 of arguin and I too have preferred 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.930
 week so 3 zone dredging mode 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.970
 why down simply because I 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.480
 think it is my business here 3 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.770
 it was more how to say 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.110
 it was better what end was it all 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.170
 early that was where the community is 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.880
 arrived here is the community 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.590
 how to say that they rot the game 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.700
 we're going to say that like that since I did not 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.740
 not want to say insults when 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.050
 even that's really where the community 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.010
 and come rotten the game while before 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.620
 it is true that it is my child three 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.910
 years weary it was the game where all when 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.160
 everything starts and with its terraces 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.870
 so really but really well 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.370
 had first currency the end of 2009 between 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.720
 modern warfare 2 was no game 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.070
 how to act to have fun 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.680
 relax without taking your head 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.290
 after there were blackhawks 2 we know very 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.580
 although there was still a beautiful 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.840
 charge and there was no infected 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.210
 it's really a shame I would have 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.740
 liked seeing a little affected on black 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.380
 ops 2 but unfortunately he did not have 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.480
 that was not the case there is also black 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.630
 like that then there were also some 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.800
 game modes like the multi has finally 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.390
 when we make one change you 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.510
 of weapons etc that could really be 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.790
 interesting but unfortunately on 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.140
 ghosts to face that was the case but hey 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.180
 the community now is how 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.800
 she is the weapons really are not 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.720
 well call of duty developers 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.540
 kids have not really done their job 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.260
 it's really not very good 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.060
 weapons and so on 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.700
 but hey you really take 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.900
 pleasure for example to the akimbo like the 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.280
 jeanne do it you saw that I 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.830
 does the majority of the kills 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.200
 with the p of 26 to kim ok really a 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.970
 super gun in akimbo cost or 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.290
 tactical or in normal pistol 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.820
 frankly it's really a super 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.160
 gun including cloud and passengers of 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.840
 blue khaimah kml they are worth exploded 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.000
 down right now I'm going to finish getting 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.470
 turn 8.07 party will end 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.680
 I hope you have understood a 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.210
 little 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.340
