this composite aluminum and plastic
protector<00:01:32.140> really<00:01:32.530> did<00:01:32.680> its<00:01:32.799> job

protector really did its job

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.710 
protector really did its job
remember<00:01:33.549> they<00:01:33.670> use<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.030> aluminum<00:01:34.360> insert

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
remember they use the aluminum insert

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.480 
remember they use the aluminum insert
for<00:01:35.290> a<00:01:35.320> number<00:01:35.619> of<00:01:35.650> reasons<00:01:35.770> one<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.369> which

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
for a number of reasons one of which

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.240 
for a number of reasons one of which
being<00:01:36.909> it<00:01:37.570> has<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.810> real<00:01:38.140> low<00:01:38.440> coefficient<00:01:38.830> of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
being it has a real low coefficient of

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.910 
being it has a real low coefficient of
friction<00:01:39.310> which<00:01:39.880> means<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.420> slides<00:01:40.840> easy<00:01:41.290> the

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
friction which means it slides easy the

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.359 
friction which means it slides easy the
idea<00:01:42.280> behind<00:01:42.430> that<00:01:42.729> is<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:44.619> contacts<00:01:45.190> the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
idea behind that is this contacts the

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.500 
idea behind that is this contacts the
ground<00:01:45.610> instead<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:45.970> hook<00:01:46.180> it<00:01:46.299> up<00:01:46.420> and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
ground instead of hook it up and

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.899 
ground instead of hook it up and
possibly<00:01:46.990> send<00:01:47.229> you<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.650> tumble<00:01:48.070> it<00:01:48.729> can

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
possibly send you to a tumble it can

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.640 
possibly send you to a tumble it can
slide<00:01:49.270> off<00:01:49.479> Monday<00:01:49.840> just<00:01:49.990> kind<00:01:50.260> of<00:01:50.320> get<00:01:50.439> you<00:01:50.590> on

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
slide off Monday just kind of get you on

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.649 
slide off Monday just kind of get you on
your<00:01:50.680> back<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.250> just<00:01:51.340> get<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.640> slide<00:01:51.939> the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
your back and just get you slide the

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.380 
your back and just get you slide the
goal<00:01:52.869> is<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.650> tumble<00:01:54.040> as<00:01:54.159> little<00:01:54.549> as<00:01:54.640> possible
