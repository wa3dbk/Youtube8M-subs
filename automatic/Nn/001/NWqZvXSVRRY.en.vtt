a gamer i'ma show you guys how to

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.740 
a gamer i'ma show you guys how to
basically<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:05.100> guess<00:00:05.160> get<00:00:05.819> unlimited<00:00:06.540> money

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
basically I guess get unlimited money

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.720 
basically I guess get unlimited money
now<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.350> haven't<00:00:07.740> tested<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.280> with<00:00:08.490> other

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
now I haven't tested this with other

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.790 
now I haven't tested this with other
characters<00:00:09.090> but<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:09.929> been<00:00:10.230> reported<00:00:10.590> that

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
characters but it's been reported that

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.230 
characters but it's been reported that
basically<00:00:11.280> if<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.490> do<00:00:11.670> switch<00:00:11.940> characters

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
basically if you do switch characters

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.079 
basically if you do switch characters
you<00:00:12.599> can<00:00:12.750> get<00:00:12.960> more<00:00:13.200> money<00:00:13.580> so<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.700> want<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.000> go

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
you can get more money so you want to go

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.849 
you can get more money so you want to go
to<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.269> spot<00:00:15.690> right<00:00:15.719> here<00:00:15.990> now<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.379> can<00:00:16.650> jump

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
to this spot right here now you can jump

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.680 
to this spot right here now you can jump
off<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.820> something<00:00:17.970> fun<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.539> do

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
off this this is something fun to do

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.689 
off this this is something fun to do
right<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> nice<00:00:20.220> little<00:00:20.369> jump

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
right here so it's a nice little jump

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.540 
right here so it's a nice little jump
spot<00:00:21.060> especially<00:00:21.359> if<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> sport<00:00:22.320> bike

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
spot especially if you have a sport bike

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.620 
spot especially if you have a sport bike
but<00:00:23.550> basically<00:00:23.760> you're<00:00:24.029> going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.449> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
but basically you're going to have to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.650 
but basically you're going to have to
increase<00:00:25.080> your<00:00:25.140> lung<00:00:25.680> capacity<00:00:26.210> i'd<00:00:27.210> say<00:00:27.539> at

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
increase your lung capacity i'd say at

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.710 
increase your lung capacity i'd say at
least<00:00:27.689> almost<00:00:28.439> halfway<00:00:29.060> it<00:00:30.060> was<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:30.390> close

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
least almost halfway it was really close

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.080 
least almost halfway it was really close
for<00:00:31.050> me<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.500> I'd<00:00:31.740> say<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:32.969> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
for me so I'd say if you can get it to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.770 
for me so I'd say if you can get it to
like<00:00:33.270> halfway<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:34.170> sixty<00:00:35.070> percent<00:00:35.660> you'll<00:00:36.660> be

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
like halfway or sixty percent you'll be

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.360 
like halfway or sixty percent you'll be
fine<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.469> definitely<00:00:37.680> need<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.100> increase

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
fine but you definitely need to increase

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.150 
fine but you definitely need to increase
your<00:00:38.430> lung<00:00:38.760> capacity<00:00:38.790> or<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.930> think<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.980> can

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
your lung capacity or I think if you can

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.040 
your lung capacity or I think if you can
get<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.489> scuba<00:00:42.030> gear<00:00:42.210> you'll<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.600> fine<00:00:42.870> as

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
get the scuba gear you'll be fine as

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.139 
get the scuba gear you'll be fine as
well<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.680> keep<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.489> mind<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:45.120> I

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
well so just keep that in mind now I

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.910 
well so just keep that in mind now I
show<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> map<00:00:45.809> exactly<00:00:46.230> where<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.829> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
show you on the map exactly where it is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.910 
show you on the map exactly where it is
so<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.149> northwest<00:00:48.930> side<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> map

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
so this is the northwest side of the map

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
so this is the northwest side of the map
here<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.059> little<00:00:51.449> like

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
here and you can see that little like

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.439 
here and you can see that little like
ledge<00:00:52.710> right<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.340> where<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.210> actually

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
ledge right there where you actually

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.170 
ledge right there where you actually
jump<00:00:55.140> off<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.680> that's<00:00:55.980> that's<00:00:56.340> an<00:00:56.579> actual<00:00:56.789> good

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
jump off so that's that's an actual good

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880 
jump off so that's that's an actual good
indication<00:00:57.960> right<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:58.350> where<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.680> need<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
indication right there where you need to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.939 
indication right there where you need to
be<00:00:59.149> there<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.329> actually<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> hospital<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.829> if

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
be there is actually a hospital so if

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.070 
be there is actually a hospital so if
you<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.190> die<00:01:02.430> you'll<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.910> actually<00:01:03.329> sent<00:01:03.989> to

going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> need<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.619> your<00:01:40.829> air<00:01:41.100> you're

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
going to need all of your air you're

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.859 
going to need all of your air you're
going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> need<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.060> oxygen<00:01:42.600> unless

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
going to need all of your oxygen unless

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.319 
going to need all of your oxygen unless
you<00:01:42.960> had<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> scuba<00:01:43.500> gear<00:01:43.820> but<00:01:44.820> basically<00:01:45.119> we

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
you had a scuba gear but basically we

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.999 
you had a scuba gear but basically we
just<00:01:45.360> swim<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.409> know<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> top<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
just swim to that you know the top a

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.130 
just swim to that you know the top a
little<00:01:47.220> bit<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.759> then<00:01:47.850> once<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
little bit and then once you get to the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.510 
little bit and then once you get to the
plane<00:01:49.470> wreckage<00:01:49.799> you're<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> actually

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
plane wreckage you're going to actually

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.760 
plane wreckage you're going to actually
see<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.360> actually<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> middle<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
see like actually the middle of the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.649 
see like actually the middle of the
plane<00:01:53.340> itself<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.450> broken

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
plane itself and it's going to be broken

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.840 
plane itself and it's going to be broken
in<00:01:54.930> half<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.740> you'll<00:01:56.009> see<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> wing<00:01:56.549> end

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
in half and you'll see the wing end

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.600 
in half and you'll see the wing end
right<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.469> right<00:01:58.860> actually<00:01:59.460> in

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
right here so it's right actually in

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.609 
right here so it's right actually in
front<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.570> you're<00:02:01.170> going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> swim

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
front of that and you're going to swim

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.920 
front of that and you're going to swim
all<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> way<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.579> bottom<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.149> you'll<00:02:03.780> be

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
all the way to the bottom and you'll be

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.630 
all the way to the bottom and you'll be
able<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.170> actually<00:02:04.409> pick<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.430> now

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
able to actually pick it up now

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.310 
able to actually pick it up now
supposedly<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.509> actually<00:02:06.750> do<00:02:07.079> this

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
supposedly you can actually do this

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.729 
supposedly you can actually do this
multiple<00:02:08.310> times<00:02:08.780> unlimited<00:02:09.780> times<00:02:10.050> with

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
multiple times unlimited times with

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.800 
multiple times unlimited times with
other<00:02:11.190> characters<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.360> switch<00:02:12.780> your

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
other characters so you switch your

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.670 
other characters so you switch your
character<00:02:13.379> out

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
character out

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.130 
character out
you<00:02:13.859> go<00:02:14.040> back<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.670> same<00:02:14.879> location<00:02:15.140> make

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
you go back to the same location make

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.839 
you go back to the same location make
sure<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.409> got<00:02:16.469> good<00:02:16.799> lung<00:02:17.069> capacity<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
sure you got good lung capacity and

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.229 
sure you got good lung capacity and
you're<00:02:17.969> good<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:18.299> so<00:02:19.079> you<00:02:19.170> do<00:02:19.409> get<00:02:19.590> twelve

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
you're good to go so you do get twelve

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.369 
you're good to go so you do get twelve
thousand<00:02:21.239> dollars<00:02:21.599> right<00:02:21.810> here<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.019> think<00:02:22.290> I

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
thousand dollars right here I think I

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.910 
thousand dollars right here I think I
pick<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.680> up<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:24.420> yeah<00:02:24.659> I<00:02:24.689> get<00:02:24.989> twelve<00:02:25.319> thousand

pick it up so yeah I get twelve thousand

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.800 
pick it up so yeah I get twelve thousand
dollars<00:02:26.280> now<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.549> can<00:02:26.819> do<00:02:26.939> this<00:02:27.090> suppose<00:02:27.599> we

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
dollars now you can do this suppose we

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.720 
dollars now you can do this suppose we
repeatedly<00:02:28.319> over<00:02:28.439> and<00:02:28.739> over<00:02:28.980> again<00:02:29.189> I'm<00:02:29.579> not

repeatedly over and over again I'm not

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.369 
repeatedly over and over again I'm not
really<00:02:29.939> for<00:02:30.150> sure<00:02:30.209> if<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.629> is<00:02:30.689> an<00:02:31.170> actual

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
really for sure if this is an actual

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.069 
really for sure if this is an actual
glitch<00:02:31.799> or<00:02:32.040> an<00:02:32.189> exploit<00:02:32.840> whatever<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.049> want

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
that location swim around for about 10

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.619 
that location swim around for about 10
minutes<00:02:46.919> I'd<00:02:47.220> say<00:02:47.459> 10-15<00:02:48.090> minutes<00:02:48.389> to<00:02:48.510> get

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
minutes I'd say 10-15 minutes to get

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.750 
minutes I'd say 10-15 minutes to get
your<00:02:48.750> lung<00:02:48.959> capacity<00:02:48.989> up<00:02:49.799> that's<00:02:50.010> about<00:02:50.280> how

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
your lung capacity up that's about how

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.670 
your lung capacity up that's about how
long<00:02:50.819> it<00:02:51.030> took<00:02:51.329> me<00:02:51.389> to<00:02:51.540> do<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.079> show<00:02:52.620> you
