the<00:00:45.580> rs3<00:00:46.180> it's<00:00:46.900> got<00:00:47.110> good<00:00:47.260> power<00:00:48.150> I'm<00:00:49.150> not<00:00:49.300> sure

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
the rs3 it's got good power I'm not sure

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.200 
the rs3 it's got good power I'm not sure
if<00:00:49.600> it's<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.840> brakes<00:00:50.380> or<00:00:51.220> the<00:00:51.430> oversteer<00:00:52.180> and

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
if it's the brakes or the oversteer and

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.570 
if it's the brakes or the oversteer and
they<00:00:52.390> handling<00:00:52.810> but<00:00:53.140> on<00:00:53.440> some<00:00:53.860> of<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.310> first

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
they handling but on some of the first

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.140 
they handling but on some of the first
turn<00:00:54.910> especially<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.690> first<00:00:56.020> ones<00:00:56.320> I<00:00:57.060> kind<00:00:58.060> of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
turn especially the first ones I kind of

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.510 
turn especially the first ones I kind of
got<00:00:58.330> off<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.690> map<00:00:58.900> if<00:00:59.860> you'll<00:01:00.160> see<00:01:00.370> in<00:01:00.430> a

handling<00:01:03.340> the<00:01:03.550> brakes<00:01:03.760> felt<00:01:04.000> fine<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.390> me<00:01:05.400> but

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
handling the brakes felt fine to me but

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.690 
handling the brakes felt fine to me but
I<00:01:06.430> was<00:01:06.870> needing<00:01:07.870> to<00:01:07.900> break<00:01:08.260> earlier<00:01:09.010> than<00:01:09.250> what

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700

I was needing to break earlier than what
I'm<00:01:09.820> normally<00:01:10.180> used<00:01:10.420> for<00:01:10.540> in<00:01:10.750> these<00:01:10.840> types<00:01:11.140> of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
I'm normally used for in these types of

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.249 
I'm normally used for in these types of

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
if you could fight like the army engine

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.720 
if you could fight like the army engine
or<00:02:46.420> something<00:02:46.750> ridiculous<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.700> made<00:02:48.700> me

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
or something ridiculous and it made me

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.979 
or something ridiculous and it made me
feel<00:02:48.970> pretty<00:02:49.000> fast<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:51.390> next<00:02:52.390> up<00:02:52.540> after<00:02:52.870> this

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989
