00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.099
 even though you are watching youtube channel 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.330
 Letsplay in Russian and in this video we 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.330
 look at the toy called 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.990
 very cool game that came out 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.310
 25th anniversary of mega exchange 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.279
 and I can now be absolutely free 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.289
 Download our page as a reference capcom 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.480
 you will find in the description of this video so 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.019
 that you can swing one weight somewhere 30 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.840
 megabyte 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.180
 swing it is cool to play 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.250
 toy so let's see it with us 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.090
 classic modem i play now with 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.550
 the controller that was strange that is not 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.680
 There were explanations where what buttons and when 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.710
 for example, she asks to click on start this 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.379
 he wants me to press the left wand 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.719
 on the right wand as it was somehow 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.879
 strange to understand a short time on 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.379
 the button controller is enough as with 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.420
 the keyboard that is, I for the keyboard 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.030
 sat down a couple of times and that is management 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
 normal but also found all the buttons that is 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.140
 this you will have again 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.390
 look like this is classic again 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.189
 the moment we have 8 enemies these 8 enemies 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.790
 need to win some special 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.150
 okay 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.220
 was getting from every enemy their weapons and 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.189
 defeat the next enemy with this weapon 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.390
 and the next and so on and so forth 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.720
 the only thing you need to remember is the first 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.090
 this game is not saved ie it is like 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.240
 the most classic denzel ns 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.280
 we have no savings and if you are still 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.710
 decided to sit down and now this time to go 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 Do not press the game completely. 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.840
 to escape 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.450
 on the keyboard because it's completely 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.170
 closes the game and so we'll go see 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.829
 on ru-land this honestly i don't remember him from 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.280
 street fighter a rifle dalsima bar and 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.189
 how do i remember to enter rose and gurin this 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.100
 new avatar ribbon they are in new street 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.590
 fighter not old not 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.340
 I do not remember, he he seemed to me that this 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.350
 a bison can it be a bison but he 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.830
 just somehow differently called well 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.479
 it doesn't matter let's click and let's go why I 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.000
 I chose it because it seems to me that 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.280
 this is the first enemy that will need 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.020
 to win because here too 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.560
 relatively simple level in which i 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.720
 no longer understanding and whose enemy 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.440
 I can win and that is, I have it once 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.980
 won 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.319
 Of course, he himself was surprised that 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.950
 limit but still I got oh 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:34.370
 oh oh oh oh oh so and what will he say this 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.870
 my first time when i play kicks on i 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.970
 I understand that this is of course sad but 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.769
 know even if this is my first time i 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.110
 I get pleasure from it because 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.480
 toy cool done management 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.870
 clear jumping clear I always know where 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.760
 my hero goes what do i kiss and if i 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.370
 I submit if a bumping into enemies 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.830
 that's all i always know it's my fault a 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.000
 not the fault of the game because she decided me 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.370
 No, it's not fair to see everything. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.709
 These grenades can go if you jump into 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.549
 time let's put life in us 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.190
 help you figure out a better way 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.520
 here we run run run 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.840
 We're friends, that's great, you need to remember 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.660
 remember what you 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.069
 leaving we say so from the screen and that is, we 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.129
 we can leave played if now 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.920
 for example, go left and go back to the right 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:32.310
 enemies will reappear on this again this 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.080
 old jokes fun consoles old 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.049
 which could not be saved and remembered 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:44.700
 what happened but on the other hand it 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:45.870
 again this does not apply this is 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.930
 the core 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.590
 the game of the game in the megamen that is all 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.599
 you can always here and for example farm 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.870
 enemies and that is, they sometimes throw 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.610
 health and they can be this way 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.970
 farm and that is, we move to the right 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.709
 then left and they appear back we 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.200
 we can restore for example 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.950
 the health of some special place is 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.260
 it is can be used to be you 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.739
 should do it now they do it 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.930
 because it's kind of kicking on and 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.660
 without this, megamen will no longer be megamen 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.020
 so let's go then we 'll get to 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.150
 By them, this mini boss is not even a mini boss 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.580
 because the mini boss is usually one 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.669
 the enemy is just such a place in the game 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.690
 where we have a bunch of enemies eating them 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:39.330
 just need to dodge during and 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:43.530
 survive survive so fly to the top 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.620
 for good not complete health nothing 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.680
 fearfully 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.229
 we somehow 1 first life rather 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.080
 just spend the boss to see 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:59.110
 remember what he does and so let's 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:01.330
 let's go ah yes still very very cool 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:06.130
 Music in the game that is for musichka 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:10.120
 lovers of eight-bit music is the soul 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:15.639
 everyone will sing and rest 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:18.669
 level oh oh oh oh oh oh so and yet I 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:22.300
 now that's praised the music you need to say 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.860
 that every enemy has a new street 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.590
 fighter 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.660
 there is a beam of super strike and that is, you see 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.419
 he has a green shell of life 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.669
 which falls and the red beam is super 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.889
 the blow that grows every time we 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.940
 every enemy falls into it 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.370
 your super blow 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.680
 and from every super blow from need somehow 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.139
 in their own way to return if you want at all 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.300
 come back and so I usually start it 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:52.120
 yours with the fact that i just shoot him 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:55.870
 because depending on how lucky and 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:59.020
 depending on where he can be removed from him 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:03.510
 a lot of health can be just 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:08.620
 you tank so good again that is 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:11.080
 This is the easiest boss boss and they can 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.540
 be true to name by sum this is the most 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.560
 simple posture 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.360
 action 7 more enemies and I hope more 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.950
 continuation because usually we are instantly 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:26.010
 7 robots fail and in continuation 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:31.950
 there is the main villain 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:36.300
 Well, so and so, and I, I, and so, we are leaving him 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:38.730
 garnet are very difficult levels in which we 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.380
 again we meet with all the advantages with 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:46.560
 that met but then already on 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:48.300
 level i wanted to go through this recording this 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.140
 I think this is our last life 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.660
 let's see yes life is possible 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.090
 still collect her tanks and that is and and 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.360
 Banks that you see I have a 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.690
 it is flashing e and i have it there 0 it is us 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.950
 restores health during a fight 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.230
 put a pause to keep yourself healthy 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.280
 good thing on i'm on this level somehow 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.010
 found none 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.530
 so if we have to fight with 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.980
 this boss just let's try 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.980
 again 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.870
 die die please come on let's see 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.700
 that is, if 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.270
 lucky you can just get into it 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:29.430
 shoot and then his health falls 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:33.900
 less than us but now gave things and 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:38.760
 decided to pinch in the corner so from the grenades we 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:41.730
 we leave her well i also i'm not even 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.460
 dodged i just jumped into him the food 

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:48.030
 good old continue 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:50.640
 let's continue from this screen already 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:53.250
 then I think that's enough for that 

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.740
 there is just download it get 

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:58.290
 great fun free 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:01.830
 cool done interesting levels 

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:03.870
 cool cool music just old 

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:07.840
 kind feeling that you are sitting at the dandy 

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:11.260
 and I want to break the screen 

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.080
 its controllers because not always 

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.400
 it turns out to pass 

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.350
 I then say many thanks for 

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.350
 attention and we'll see you in the next video
