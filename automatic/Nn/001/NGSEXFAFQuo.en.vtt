00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.060
 welcome back via tv and we are 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.230
 still on the subject of photography and us 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.990
 now have something for you where you say 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.309
 I'm not a product photographer 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.019
 I do not really want to 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.370
 somehow I really need it 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.619
 just want my wife and children 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.180
 but take a picture now 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.100
 Let's take a case example 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.529
 clear your attic or cellar 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 and find so little treasures then 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.740
 there is an electronic platform 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.960
 his auction house where you are usually very 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.699
 I have to be able to put photos in them 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 if you say things nice 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.300
 photographed and really good 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.980
 photographed then comes mostly there too 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.540
 more money at out and there we have ourselves 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.160
 thought there are people to the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.600
 For example, for once, so cars 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 small model cars collect the matchbox 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.360
 cars that I say so what's there 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.710
 what else about small vases and such 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.210
 on and on and on, of course 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.710
 of which would like to have photos 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.050
 and we thought we would pass 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.120
 We build something and let it build 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.449
 and that's what we offer him and talk about 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.829
 is absolutely from our great photobox 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.930
 really dear spectators they see it 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.579
 now really bright and we lit up 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.530
 can also put something in order for them 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.390
 can imagine that better because 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.729
 I think it's important that you do everything yourself 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.979
 pictorially better imagine 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.470
 you see we have two reflector walls 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.170
 with a possibility that the photo 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.270
 everything lights up well and now 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.490
 We have set the manual here 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.750
 and there we can see that is coming 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.820
 now really good in scene 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.130
 right now we are in the chamber 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 just like that and now I stand with the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.880
 camera before that of course I have the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.740
 Camera worries about poor people 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.000
 here we have everything in the prop 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.880
 so and now just the right tripod 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.409
 take a picture and get ready and 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.299
 Of course, the product looks alot much 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.430
 much better off and when to go to 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.950
 Example I'll say a photo album 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.689
 your favorite hobby collection for 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.020
 want to create an example then that is 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.670
 Great 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.500
 we just have our colleagues 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.720
 breakfast be asked to photograph 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 namely his favorite apple and that has 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.920
 he made and the whole looks right 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.690
 good because it has suddenly right 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.830
 professional level 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.440
 and i can tell you if you only 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.820
 two three things somehow in one 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.450
 electronic department store offer so 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.890
 action house then makes 47 eur 41 already 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.930
 meaning something professional for her 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.880
 looks the better it is we have 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.860
 The white box from the white background 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.000
 and of course the blue background there 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.350
 then, for example, can be wonderful 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.820
 free and make the apple easy 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.400
 back to where does it come from? 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.140
 on the tree amazing what you have today 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.340
 can do everything but dear audience 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.780
 Of course you can do that too 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.150
 by otherwise using them 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.100
 example say they take quite different 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.080
 background picture so maybe say 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.750
 not necessarily a tree but something 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.700
 completely absurd, maybe even 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.980
 just a star or something and 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.780
 project something into something else 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.610
 Actually , not at all, so you want to 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.100
 In all things there, they really have many 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.170
 possibilities this little box is 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.490
 really a miracle because I show 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.470
 that's one of them again 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.450
 our smartphones what we already have 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.100
 have offered and look like 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.050
 Great that looks like you can now 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.880
 play completely with the light reflections 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.860
 that means depending on how they light 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.600
 how to move the good piece 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.950
 See how great that looks either 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.930
 very classic or light 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.060
 light reflections on it that is completely 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.980
 very far ahead and I say 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.230
 times so easy to fix and fix 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.700
 finished is a product that you know 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.200
 from a professional studio like that 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.459
 the photos are taken from the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.230
 Products where you for example in 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.000
 I say supermarket in the advertising 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.650
 I definitely want to see that is 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.090
 dull hall and that's where we are 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.820
 thought we have to just that 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.800
 Matching product for have 179 euro 90 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.030
 would be the normal price we thought 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.380
 Come on, let's get started today 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.420
 Today, let's turn the price screw today 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.750
 right through is yes monday and young 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.310
 is fastnose comes on and off 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.300
 50 euros we said and im 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.330
 end effect with the pointed pencil 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.340
 and counted 47 eur 41 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.290
 For example, maybe you too 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.090
 get some flowers as a present 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.830
 example and you want the photographs 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.480
 because the withered so pretty fast 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.769
 and to be really nice in the scene too 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.140
 put love spectators you can 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.840
 Of course, give a short in our box 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.720
 and these hold my photo as example 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.900
 j.mp now I can not mister or wife 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.150
 say from wuppertal 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.680
 the monorail is awesome it mini 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.390
 photo studio to small objects good 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.650
 illuminate or with blue 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.819
 screen easily 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.650
 That's where we put the apple back on 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.909
 hanged the tree handy carry 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.170
 suitcase that is the good piece is 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.280
 at most the size of a briefcase 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.739
 when fold up 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.539
 Overall, a great tool then 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.220
