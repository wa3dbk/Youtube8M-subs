00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
so once I get the code I will show you
guys<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.320> after<00:01:08.740> you<00:01:08.950> purchase<00:01:09.370> it<00:01:09.550> you<00:01:09.850> will

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.510 
receive an email in about 15 minutes and
that<00:01:13.780> is<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.990> code<00:01:14.229> will<00:01:14.740> not<00:01:14.770> do<00:01:15.100> not<00:01:15.310> try

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
that is the code will not do not try

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.640 
that is the code will not do not try
copying<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:16.000> code<00:01:16.180> because<00:01:16.630> every<00:01:17.170> code<00:01:17.500> is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
copying the code because every code is

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.620 
copying the code because every code is
different<00:01:18.160> so<00:01:18.370> you<00:01:18.430> would<00:01:18.640> just<00:01:18.850> unlock<00:01:19.420> your
