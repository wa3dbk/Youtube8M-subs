00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
eight you could look at it as if it's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.160 
eight you could look at it as if it's
thirty<00:00:59.010> two<00:00:59.250> chances<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> affect<00:01:00.420> your<00:01:00.870> form

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
so don't overlook volume work and don't

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.750 
so don't overlook volume work and don't
just<00:01:04.290> try<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.470> blast<00:01:04.769> through<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.129> really

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
