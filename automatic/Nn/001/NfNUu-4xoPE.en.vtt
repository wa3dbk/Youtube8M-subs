00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.309
 How do you remember last week? 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.039
 doctor mateus was present in our 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.930
 doctor participating studio zoom him 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.779
 talking a little about his specialty 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.520
 that's how he commented to us about 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.380
 I found a lot of birds 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.849
 interesting we see here for the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.109
 stone conference 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.720
 I 'm not going to tell us what you want to see. 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.339
 You're hospitalized here today at the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.740
 time to have more people is with a 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.300
 Parrot was admitted to a known 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.920
 that she is hospitalized 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.700
 in fact even coincidentally the two 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.950
 with the same problem is for a 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.930
 wrong feed and yes but it's over 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.850
 having a problem is not with yeast that 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.320
 is a microorganism that is the 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.290
 her treatment 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.370
 the treatment consists of endless is 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.580
 combating this yeast through 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.810
 medicines give the support is nutritional 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.490
 for animals that are not normally 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.710
 feeding well what I want 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.870
 implement poorly decreases feed 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.910
 of animals can not lose weight is very 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.390
 difficult to recover these animals are 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.460
 treating the problem and treating it is also a 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.890
 nutritional support 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.359
 it is in this case could have been 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.399
 avoided 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:16.270
 could be more had a 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.560
 adequate feed from cub 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.049
 during their lives there could have been 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.229
 hospitalization is definitely avoided. 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.229
 option in these cases is the only solution 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.670
 in the case of having the only solution 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.560
 we can not prescribe a 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.299
 home remedy for the power client 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.670
 administer this medicine to prouni 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.350
 it is bad because it used normally 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.030
 accept manipulation do not accept 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.829
 prison administration in most 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.659
 times more than the measurement are made 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.789
 injectables have to be hospitalized 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.729
 and the birds are visited by the 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.749
 owners any of them daily 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.579
 by appointment 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:51.020
 we even have to control in 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.149
 what times with staff 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.009
 stay all day here with them for you 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.469
 commented that some birds have 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.370
 difficulties in adapting sites as 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:03.030
 What is it to stay in? 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.220
 how they are sick it seems they are in 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.650
 another world so it's strange to talk 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.450
 this animal but apparently they do not 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.220
 feel the owner's lack even because 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.050
 the two come to visit but do not feel so 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.850
 I miss those old one has not even a 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.940
 little or eat, then the more you stay 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.500
 With the owner playing with names, they look good. 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.510
 so I'll let you close with a 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.830
 Message to who has the vision for who 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.240
 I would like to 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.200
 I think it's a very cool animal must 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.380
 be seeking help from a professional 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.790
 to guide not following everything you read 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.620
 take a little care of the internet 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.150
 I tell my clients to listen to 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.710
 interview and already spent with me in 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.120
 consultation will remind you that it was 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.740
 with the internet careful with the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.730
 information is sought that always 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.680
 help on the professional 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.960
 they are wonderful animals that are animals that 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.960
