like that

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.940 
like that
now<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:04.910> find<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.480> side<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.470> dollar<00:02:06.710> bill

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950

now you find the side of the dollar bill
which<00:02:07.220> has<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.640> widest<00:02:08.210> margin<00:02:08.450> which<00:02:09.380> is

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
which has the widest margin which is

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.290 
which has the widest margin which is
this<00:02:09.740> side<00:02:09.950> on<00:02:10.130> this<00:02:10.250> one<00:02:10.310> here<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.470> we

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
this side on this one here so we

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.200 
this side on this one here so we
look<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.810> dollar<00:02:14.020> bill<00:02:14.260> in<00:02:14.320> there

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.110 

and<00:02:17.480> then<00:02:17.840> we'll<00:02:17.990> go<00:02:18.170> down<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.770> end<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.340> at

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
and then we'll go down to the end and at

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.260 
and then we'll go down to the end and at
the<00:02:20.240> end<00:02:20.420> we'll<00:02:20.720> fold<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.380> just<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:22.790> little

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
the end we'll fold it in just a little

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.350 
the end we'll fold it in just a little
bit<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.840> more<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.200> an<00:02:24.290> angle<00:02:24.820> not<00:02:25.820> enough

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
bit of a more of an angle not enough

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.210 
bit of a more of an angle not enough
