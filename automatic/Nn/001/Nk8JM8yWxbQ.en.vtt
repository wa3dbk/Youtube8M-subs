in that scream earless there are good
combination<00:00:16.840> were<00:00:17.020> together<00:00:17.790> so<00:00:19.050> what<00:00:20.050> I'm

combination were together so what I'm
about<00:00:20.230> to<00:00:20.380> do<00:00:20.650> hopefully<00:00:21.369> it's<00:00:22.060> to<00:00:22.210> build<00:00:22.449> up<00:00:22.539> a

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
about to do hopefully it's to build up a

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.529 
about to do hopefully it's to build up a
cool<00:00:23.550> what's<00:00:24.550> gonna<00:00:24.699> be<00:00:24.789> hot<00:00:25.060> enough<00:00:25.150> to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
cool what's gonna be hot enough to

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.640 
cool what's gonna be hot enough to
become<00:00:26.289> a<00:00:26.320> member<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:28.060> I'm<00:00:28.330> just<00:00:31.379> so<00:00:32.379> I'm<00:00:32.470> just

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
become a member so I'm just so I'm just

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.340 
become a member so I'm just so I'm just
building<00:00:32.890> up<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.160> cool<00:00:33.629> just<00:00:34.629> nice<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:34.870> slowly

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
building up a cool just nice and slowly

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.560 
building up a cool just nice and slowly
at<00:00:35.559> the<00:00:35.590> minute<00:00:35.890> I'm<00:00:36.760> not<00:00:36.820> going<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.329> try<00:00:37.480> to

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
at the minute I'm not going to try to

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.060 
at the minute I'm not going to try to
get<00:00:37.780> in<00:00:37.899> there<00:00:38.020> might<00:00:38.230> a<00:00:38.260> minute<00:00:38.590> it's<00:00:38.829> just

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
get in there might a minute it's just

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:48.630 
get in there might a minute it's just
gradually<00:00:40.020> burn<00:00:41.020> it<00:00:41.230> up

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.360 

I<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.960> smell<00:00:50.260> it<00:00:50.320> can<00:00:50.829> you<00:00:50.920> smell<00:00:51.100> it<00:00:51.160> already

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
I can smell it can you smell it already

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.740 
I can smell it can you smell it already
all<00:00:51.880> right<00:00:52.090> well<00:00:52.480> that's<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.690> good<00:00:52.870> saying<00:00:53.110> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
all right well that's a good saying it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.450 
all right well that's a good saying it
so<00:00:55.750> i'll<00:00:55.840> just<00:00:55.870> see<00:00:56.650> it<00:00:56.710> that<00:00:56.829> nice<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.250> easy

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
so i'll just see it that nice and easy

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.630 
so i'll just see it that nice and easy
to<00:00:57.670> spin<00:00:57.970> in<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.230> spindle<00:00:59.230> till<00:01:00.160> I<00:01:00.220> got<00:01:00.399> other

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
to spin in the spindle till I got other

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
to spin in the spindle till I got other
cool<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.910> chamber<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:07.150> is<00:01:07.300> called<00:01:07.570> the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
cool in the chamber this is called the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.310 
cool in the chamber this is called the
fluid<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.530> flute<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:08.770> technique<00:01:10.020> I'm<00:01:11.020> still

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
fluid the flute and technique I'm still

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.050 
fluid the flute and technique I'm still
not<00:01:11.440> putting<00:01:11.770> downward<00:01:11.950> pressure<00:01:12.130> on<00:01:12.490> yet<00:01:12.850> not

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
not putting downward pressure on yet not

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.540 
not putting downward pressure on yet not
Norwich<00:01:13.390> anyways<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.860> it's<00:01:15.070> gotta<00:01:15.280> reach

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
Norwich anyways and it's gotta reach

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.870 
Norwich anyways and it's gotta reach
there<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.390> about<00:01:16.690> 800<00:01:17.020> degrees<00:01:17.880> Fahrenheit

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
there to about 800 degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.830 
there to about 800 degrees Fahrenheit
before<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:19.720> saw<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.020> ignite<00:01:20.940> so<00:01:21.940> it's<00:01:22.509> been<00:01:22.690> up

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
before you saw to ignite so it's been up

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.060 
before you saw to ignite so it's been up
there<00:01:22.990> nicely<00:01:23.259> now<00:01:28.020> later<00:01:29.020> I'm<00:01:29.320> giving<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.009> a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
there nicely now later I'm giving it a

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.469 
there nicely now later I'm giving it a
bit<00:01:30.220> more<00:01:30.250> downward<00:01:30.640> pressure<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.990> try<00:01:32.259> and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
bit more downward pressure to try and

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.859 
bit more downward pressure to try and
get<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.600> cool<00:01:34.810> turn<00:01:35.679> into<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:35.979> number<00:01:36.869> plate

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
get the cool turn into a number plate

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.550 
get the cool turn into a number plate
think<00:01:38.560> we've<00:01:38.830> got<00:01:39.009> her<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.310> mother<00:01:42.000> okay<00:01:43.560> so

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
think we've got her and mother okay so

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.889 
think we've got her and mother okay so
hopefully<00:01:45.090> I'm<00:01:46.090> going<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.330> transfer<00:01:46.720> this

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
hopefully I'm going to transfer this

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.700 
hopefully I'm going to transfer this
know<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.580> bird's<00:01:48.820> nest<00:01:49.179> and<00:01:49.960> roughly

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
know to the bird's nest and roughly

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.630 
know to the bird's nest and roughly
fluid<00:01:51.700> enough<00:01:51.910> Liam<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.250> idea<00:01:54.579> anyway

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
fluid enough Liam that's the idea anyway

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:06.660 
fluid enough Liam that's the idea anyway
or<00:01:54.939> sewer

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:19.020 

okay<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.450> know<00:02:07.479> what<00:02:12.390> nope

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.600 

we'll<00:02:20.030> never<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:20.390> for<00:02:20.599> him<00:02:21.189> that's<00:02:22.189> fire<00:02:22.400> by

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
we'll never have for him that's fire by

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.640 
we'll never have for him that's fire by
friction<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:29.959> would<00:02:30.079> just<00:02:30.110> add<00:02:30.379> on

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
friction and you would just add on

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.289 
friction and you would just add on
obviously<00:02:31.159> Kinlan<00:02:31.579> you<00:02:31.730> little<00:02:31.909> better<00:02:32.060> kill

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
obviously Kinlan you little better kill

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.780 
obviously Kinlan you little better kill
into<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.689> and<00:02:32.780> we<00:02:33.470> were<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.220> that's<00:02:34.340> fire<00:02:34.610> by

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
into it and we were and that's fire by

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.600 
into it and we were and that's fire by
friction<00:02:36.069> very<00:02:37.069> quick<00:02:38.829> quick<00:02:39.829> not<00:02:40.099> didn't

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
friction very quick quick not didn't

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.460 
friction very quick quick not didn't
take<00:02:40.760> too<00:02:41.150> long<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.540> know<00:02:41.569> I've<00:02:42.079> been<00:02:42.110> doing

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
take too long you know I've been doing

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.190 
take too long you know I've been doing
it<00:02:42.530> for<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.680> few<00:02:42.890> year<00:02:43.159> now<00:02:43.340> you're<00:02:43.579> not<00:02:43.700> sure<00:02:44.200> so

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
it for a few year now you're not sure so

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.550 
it for a few year now you're not sure so
does<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.739> take<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.359> certain<00:02:47.359> way<00:02:48.049> of<00:02:48.260> pressuring

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
does it take a certain way of pressuring

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.240 
does it take a certain way of pressuring
who<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.220> wouldn't<00:02:49.549> be<00:02:49.640> able<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:50.060> satisfy<00:02:50.959> her

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
who I wouldn't be able to satisfy her

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.559 
who I wouldn't be able to satisfy her
well<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.340> could<00:02:52.549> I<00:02:52.760> mean<00:02:52.940> it's<00:02:53.239> just<00:02:53.299> a

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
well you could I mean it's just a

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.149 
well you could I mean it's just a
technique<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.049> know<00:02:54.170> it's<00:02:54.680> like<00:02:54.799> everything

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
technique you know it's like everything
