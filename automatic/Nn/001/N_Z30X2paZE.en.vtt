of<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.269> difference<00:03:36.660> there<00:03:37.500> might<00:03:37.680> be<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.860> little

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
of a difference there might be a little

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.120 
of a difference there might be a little
bit<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.340> stay<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.550> stability<00:03:39.540> here<00:03:39.890> in<00:03:40.890> there

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
bit of stay of stability here in there

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.060 
bit of stay of stability here in there
but<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.790> don't<00:03:42.030> recommend<00:03:42.420> um<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:43.170> recommend

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
but I don't recommend um I recommend

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.620 
but I don't recommend um I recommend
using<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.459> because<00:03:44.730> just<00:03:44.910> because<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.450> makes

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
using it because just because it makes

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.110 
using it because just because it makes
it<00:03:45.780> just<00:03:45.900> extremely<00:03:46.650> awesome<00:03:47.000> that's<00:03:48.000> the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
it just extremely awesome that's the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.090 
it just extremely awesome that's the
only<00:03:48.330> real<00:03:48.570> thing<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.080> recommend<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.860> don't

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
only real thing I recommend I don't

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.039 
only real thing I recommend I don't
think<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.310> gives<00:03:50.400> any<00:03:50.700> other<00:03:51.030> use<00:03:51.600> other<00:03:51.959> than

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
think it gives any other use other than
