00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.790
 we do not like many that windows emit 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.310
 sounds for some reason of form 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.130
 default windows has the sounds 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.139
 activated but we can disable them or 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.780
 even change them for other sounds 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.430
 different and this does it too 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.789
 interesting because many people 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.980
 they add their own voice as sounds or 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.109
 also lots of songs though 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.930
 this is not so simple because windows 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.470
 only accepts audio files in format 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.509
 web therefore if you have songs in 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.329
 mp3 what you have to do is convert 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.389
 those songs in web format and in addition 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.879
 cut a portion of audio because I think 

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:43.699
 has limited the time that can last 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.879
 a sound on the home screen let's 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.039
 to write the word sounds and we're going to 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.269
 go into configuration we see that 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.690
 an option appears that says change 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.579
 system sounds we enter it and 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.579
 this little window is the one that goes to 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.440
 make the sounds change here 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.649
 the sounds we have appear 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.049
 currently in our windows we see 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.950
 as above it appears combination of 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.409
 sounds 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.630
 windows default this is the one that 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.640
 it comes by default 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.130
 precisely if we click is going to 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.009
 appear another option that is without sounds 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.159
 with this option if we save it so that 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.250
 no longer hear the sounds of windows 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.799
 do not confuse this with the sounds by 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.610
 example of music or videos that you are 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.860
 watching on the internet is something independent 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.520
 they are only sounds that will be heard 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.380
 when you do something related to windows 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.689
 that by the way everything has its name 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.049
 for example when a program is opened 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.689
 when the battery is low when the 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.849
 level is already practically at zero a 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.340
 calendar notice when closing a 

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:54.860
 program and so on you will see many 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.959
 different options and many of the 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.209
 which already have their own sounds 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:02.479
 as you can see here the icon of the 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:05.090
 horn will indicate that option 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.789
 has sound for example to open 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.709
 programs does not have any sound 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.049
 we could select this option and 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.910
 select a sound from this list that 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.560
 by the way when selecting it 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.260
 this button is enabled that says try 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.410
 pressing it will listen to the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.410
 sound 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.390
 each sound is different from those 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.520
 appear on this list and are the ones 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.950
 you can select are those that windows 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.770
 it comes from the factory but I told you 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.030
 we can also add sounds 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.910
 personalized with this button 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.660
 examine we can locate a file in 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.160
 web format 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.710
 I have a video on my channel about 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.200
 program audacity which is an editor of 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.650
 free audio, I'll show you how to create 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.750
 a tone for cell phone or mobile and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.840
 if you see it you can learn techniques for 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.820
 cut audio tracks and save them in 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.100
 web format that is the one that supports 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.459
 windows in this way I could add 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.380
 custom sounds when windows gets 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.150
 start we can also make it 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.390
 play a sound with this option that 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.850
 it says here play start sound of 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.760
 windows all this sounds is already going to 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.430
 be each one's decision to me not me 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.490
 really like that windows have 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.440
 sounds mostly because it interferes 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.750
 some things when I'm recording for 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.650
 example may I suddenly heard a 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.220
 noise that I do not want to be recorded so 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.650
 and for me it would be to deactivate them once 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.409
 that we select without sounds or 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.269
 we change the sounds of the different 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.569
 options for which windows can 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:44.260
 make a sound press the button 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.079
 OK , and now all 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.109
 sounds will be configured the way 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.000
 that you did or there will no longer be 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.909
 sounds in case you have 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.909
 selected an option without sounds
