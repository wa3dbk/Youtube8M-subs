way they all focus one minute and

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.199 
way they all focus one minute and
actually<00:02:15.989> push<00:02:16.349> for<00:02:16.739> him<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.610> can<00:02:17.819> deny<00:02:18.030> him

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
actually push for him so I can deny him

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
minions that way and I ended up just out

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.500 
minions that way and I ended up just out
of<00:02:22.050> muscle<00:02:22.620> memory<00:02:22.830> hitting<00:02:23.430> my<00:02:23.610> Tom<00:02:23.879> button<00:02:24.269> I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
of muscle memory hitting my Tom button I

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.690 
of muscle memory hitting my Tom button I
think<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.900> was<00:02:24.959> two<00:02:25.590> or<00:02:25.800> three<00:02:26.129> times<00:02:26.370> they

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
think it was two or three times they

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.910 
think it was two or three times they
said<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.209> minion<00:02:28.170> wave<00:02:28.319> Talan<00:02:28.709> wasn't

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
said on the minion wave Talan wasn't

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.830 
said on the minion wave Talan wasn't
even<00:02:29.190> near<00:02:29.310> by<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.819> they<00:02:30.300> paused<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.810> game

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
even near by and they paused the game

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.390 
even near by and they paused the game
and<00:02:31.140> reported<00:02:31.560> before<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.099> we<00:02:32.160> ended<00:02:32.310> up

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
and reported before and we ended up

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.009 
and reported before and we ended up
losing<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.910> game<00:02:33.030> because<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:33.870> i'll

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
losing the game because of that so i'll
