00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.990
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.550
 after our game against the first fc 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.929
 Of course, I welcome the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.880
 opposing coach uwe neuhaus in 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.410
 our head coach kosta runjaic already 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.949
 bitter a new one for his comment to the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.109
 game 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.810
 yes thank you i think it's hard 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.660
 is to rate this game too 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.710
 judge 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.109
 I can not give my team a big one 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.230
 I can reproach her 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.000
 that at first they are not 1 0 in 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 leadership goes in the two against one 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.540
 the other way around, I come to a sensible conclusion 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.649
 plays I can also reproach that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.430
 she did not achieve the 1 1 mattuschka 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.820
 maybe a bit surprised 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.950
 completely free to appear in front of the gate and 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.250
 motivated by everything else, they absolve them 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:58.260
 has a great great discipline at the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.309
 tag then yes implemented system so 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.129
 that Kaiserslautern until 10 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.409
 no chance had been disciplined 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.030
 disciplined worked forward 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.350
 we would certainly have one or 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.960
 need to make others better is 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.409
 no question 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.930
 yes i believe in the rest i hold 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.820
 I'd rather be thanked for many 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.900
 google newer costa wallstein commentary 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.020
 please he the berliner have it today 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.210
 of them had made very difficult 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.960
 They had a defensive house 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.600
 for a defensive concept 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.430
 decided that is too prevalent 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.780
 They also succeeded well and far from 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.340
 to hold her gate 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.050
 but we also have in the first one 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.630
 had a lot of ball possession, though 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.810
 this ball possession not played out so 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.080
 how is it going to be like us? 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.659
 discussed the positions have the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.240
 positional play was not good the ball 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:03.490
 is a bit too slow in your own 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:08.019
 been played and then it was 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.459
 also relatively easy for union us of 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.459
 to keep her gate away
