00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:09.769
 hi youtube today i'm going to you 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.690
 talk about a bird trap another 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.849
 so this bird bias is a trap 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.310
 that works on the scheme of a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.699
 mouse pad 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.740
 nothing more simple is a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.410
 huge mouse pads with a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:31.590
 wire mesh that serves as a support and the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.980
 outline of the wire that should serve 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.340
 to kill the mouse of course is connected to a 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:45.050
 net that will take all the surface 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:50.300
 all the empty surface of this film 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:53.250
 so we can see here a perch 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.600
 the bird such as the pigeon the api of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.480
 crows lemoine or the house ger bat 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.890
 all the forms of birds that I 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.350
 know in the regions will come to 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.510
 ask because the birds often before 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.000
 eat while eating a well-being perched 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.860
 to be able to see a little bit 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.799
 at the job so it's not a perch 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.720
 extremely high but it's already some 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.360
 thing that birds and where the birds 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.430
 like to sit down and rest 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.690
 therefore also false So here it is 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.790
 this trap 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.940
 this is the grid floor there is an axis in 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.540
 To solidify the center and 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.310
 point of gravity 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.170
 here we can not see the springs 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.800
 who could we see on the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.430
 mouse traps 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:51.910
 good a little bigger here we are here 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.200
 has a hold we will say that we will call 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.450
 it's holding back a girl leaves a small 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.720
 hook that avoids that when the bird beats 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.530
 wings trying to fly off the net 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.220
 do not lift themselves 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.340
 because their iron jumps will come to stall 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.340
 below as dirty attack when lauzon 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.370
 future arises is so quickly a 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.230
 little demonstration the bird he goes 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.560
 get here he'll start to taste a 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.940
 little bit this trap it works well because 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.280
 the birds are not obliged to return 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.180
 in a cage or anything they 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.330
 will come directly to land on 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.480
 and will directly eat the step so who 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.860
 works like this folks will come 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.370
 to ask that triggers the fag and 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.810
 found trapped in the net 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.260
 so that's the trap we can also 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.260
 made by hand 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.230
 but it's something pretty 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.790
 complicated here is so here we raise the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:57.910
 net the little rod is that will serve 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.830
 trigger will come to stall 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.140
 here there is a notch there at this place 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.230
 come stall in the notch so we go 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.910
 adjust the sensitivity according to the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.240
 surface that will be taken in the notch this 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.430
 if only a little closer 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.430
 so here we see the hook anti-return 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.190
 so here's the notch here the trap and 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.090
 rule extremely significantly because already 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:36.910
 there is the weight of the wooden bar 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:39.010
 the weight of the kz doing it and of course 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.560
 well, since he has a little bit of 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:48.220
 before the weight of the earthly attraction 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:51.790
 so that's what will make that the 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:59.430
 well will be triggered on this axis here 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:04:03.780
 here are the big spring and the hell arch 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.780
 so that's the end of the hardest 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.740
 There it is, thanks
