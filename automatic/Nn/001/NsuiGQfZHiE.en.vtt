00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.450 
buying fishes to make sure that fish is
not<00:05:13.210> bruised<00:05:13.570> underneath<00:05:14.160> how<00:05:15.160> would<00:05:15.310> it<00:05:15.340> look

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
not bruised underneath how would it look

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.159 
not bruised underneath how would it look
if<00:05:15.789> it<00:05:15.910> were<00:05:16.060> me<00:05:16.090> it'd<00:05:16.570> be<00:05:16.720> red

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
if it were me it'd be red

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.430 
if it were me it'd be red
it'd<00:05:17.500> be<00:05:17.620> bruised<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:18.930> that<00:05:19.930> basically<00:05:20.320> means

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
it'd be bruised and that basically means

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.409 
it'd be bruised and that basically means
that<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.830> fish<00:05:20.949> hasn't<00:05:21.310> been<00:05:21.430> bled<00:05:21.669> properly

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.140 

so<00:05:25.419> many<00:05:25.630> people<00:05:26.080> get<00:05:26.410> fish<00:05:27.250> wrong<00:05:27.610> when<00:05:28.000> they

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
so many people get fish wrong when they
