00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.390
 in this episode I'm going to talk about 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.039
 adventurers to 3 Europe 1912 here to the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.380
 left we have the letters that come 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.849
 with the base game to the right are 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.279
 the new letters that come with the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.260
 expansion plus warehouse expansion 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.450
 and garages that can be used with 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.870
 any adventure game the train does not 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.270
 only with the European version 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.390
 then the main features 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.149
 of this expansion is that they replace 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.670
 letters in a certain way of destinations and 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.589
 replaced by many more letters already 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.440
 they include an expansion for 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.710
 any game let's see what it consists of 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.719
 each one of these expansions 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.000
 let's start talking about the new 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.040
 destinations all destinations that were 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.860
 in the base game are also included 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.140
 in the expansion well although the letters of 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.060
 you can be a little low that 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.840
 you will not notice when you have the expansion already 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.179
 that will have replacements for all of them 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.100
 this expansion unlike the usa 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:21.619
 do not have with the wagon letters 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.450
 There are three suggestions of how 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.040
 use these letters although the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.430
 players can use any 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.620
 combination they want 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.570
 before explaining the mixtures of 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.340
 goals that you can use I want them 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.120
 explain a little how the letters look 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.710
 new 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.990
 all these letters are from those of 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.050
 replacement there are letters that says in 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.420
 1912 and others that the edition is not this and 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.210
 that these letters are included in the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.340
 base game instead these are 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.650
 absolutely new turn the letters 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.900
 whether from the base game or from the expansion 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.570
 can have the concept of large 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.369
 cities or not basically means that 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.500
 come to one of the big cities of 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.980
 Europe then now let's look at the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.050
 variants 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.230
 the first variant for the use of 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.450
 objectives is called 1912 in this 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.970
 variant will be used only the tickets 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.250
 normal agreed with 1912 does not 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.310
 will use the blue tickets or 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.860
 long the second variant is called 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.140
 mega europe during the preparation it 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.540
 will shuffle the twelve long runs and 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.710
 two will be given to each player on 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.480
 player may keep from them 0 or 1 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.370
 then the normal bills are shuffled and 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.380
 of big cities and how I mentioned them 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.220
 are all those who come in this March 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.010
 Here it is distributed to the drawer 5 of these 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.170
 tickets at the end of all this the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.360
 Player must keep at least 3 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.840
 destinations including the blue ones that 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.850
 I keep like this for example if I keep 02 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.750
 blue shades will have the obligation of 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.620
 keep at least three of these coffees 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.320
 finally in the third variant 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.680
 suggested is called large cities of 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.260
 Europe 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.970
 in this absolute case , the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.520
 letters marked with large cities 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.830
 then all the letters will be withdrawn 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.780
 blue of the game and in addition to the brown mallet 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.280
 we will only keep the ones that say big 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.770
 cities 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.540
 each I can then receive five destinations 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.510
 of which you must keep at least 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.950
 two during the game unlike the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.840
 game causes players to steal 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.370
 four destinations when they want to steal and 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.739
 they will keep at least one 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.989
 as you will have noticed in all the 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.120
 variants the original destinations do not 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.769
 they use they must be taken out of 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.970
 game because otherwise we would be 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.160
 duplicating destinations 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.810
 the differences in the preparation when 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.970
 this expansion is used are the 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.340
 following first each game 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.600
 you will receive a warehouse and a set of five 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.910
 garage of the same color 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.710
 among them I say among them because 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.510
 some versions of adventure in pan 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.400
 they come with the wagons among others 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.740
 colors such as those of martÃ­n or 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.870
 from non-rich countries then what 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.160
 important will be the color of the warehouse with 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.720
 the garages coincide but not 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.330
 must necessarily coincide with the 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.100
 colors of the wagons of the players 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.290
 then starting with the last player and 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.330
 then in the opposite direction champion 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.880
 will place one of its garages in a 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.160
 passive city of the board can be 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.920
 any city while you do not have a 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.799
 garage in her the differences during 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.030
 the game are the following the first 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.790
 difference occurs when a player 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.680
 you want to steal wagon letters when 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.630
 happen before stealing your letters the 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.669
 player must take the top card and 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.340
 without looking at it, place it inside a 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.800
 store either your own or any 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.540
 another player the second difference 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.490
 occurs when a player claims a 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.270
 route that in one of its two extremes 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.730
 have 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.470
 a coastal in it in this case the 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.680
 blue player has returned from route with 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.730
 a green garage at one end 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.890
 when that happens the player who 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.750
 built the route you can take all the 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.840
 letters that are in the warehouse of the 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.120
 garage of the same color then in this 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.490
 case the blue player could take all 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.500
 these wagon letters that are here the 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.420
 cost of doing so will be to pay a garage 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.560
 that still have their power and get it out of 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.940
 game 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.950
 suppose we talk about every action that a 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.680
 player builds a route that connects 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.270
 with two garages in this case it is 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.370
 of a red garage and the 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.140
 coastal black 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.700
 the player who built the route that in 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.070
 our example is the yellow player 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.380
 will have the option to take the letters that 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.520
 there is in both warehouses or in one 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.620
 single 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.420
 the cost of taking the cards will be a 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.430
 garage that still has its play area 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.560
 for each store that you want to take out 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.980
 again the coastal ones 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.690
 used are taken out of the game, notice 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.790
 that before making the decision to take 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.800
 the letters of a store is allowed 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.129
 Let the players count how many cards 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.349
 It is in the 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.909
 when players use this 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.369
 expansion in addition to the options 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:51.039
 normal during your shift will have a 

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:53.289
 new option for actions in other 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:56.019
 words if we focus on the version 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:58.419
 of Europe the players instead of 

00:05:56.019 --> 00:06:00.699
 steal car letters or try destinations 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.129
 new or claim a route or 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.319
 placing a train station could 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.089
 choose to place one or more of the 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:09.279
 coastal areas that they still have in their area 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:11.439
 games on the board to do it 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:13.089
 they just take them and put them in 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:15.069
 any city ââthat is empty in the 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:17.740
 board does not need to be 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.809
 connecting with one of its routes we 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.179
 we refer to empty cities because a 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:24.879
 garage can not share a city anymore 

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:27.490
 be it with a train station or with 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:29.409
 another garage plus a carport that one 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.289
 Once it has been placed it can not be 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.599
 moved or removed if it happens is the case 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.240
 in which both the mallet and the stack 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:39.089
 discards have been exhausted and at least one 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.469
 sane has run out of parking spaces 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:44.340
 then it is going to close all the 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:46.050
 warehouses to form a new mallet 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.449
 at the end of the game the player who 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.310
 have more garages in your play area 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.280
 You will get a bonus of 10 points 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.430
 victory in case of a tie like this both 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.520
 games will receive the bonus 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:03.050
 and that's what the expansion of 1912
