 pencil or pencil glue scissors and a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.680
 rule have your book cover owner in

 the first sheet mark one centimeter and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.129
 distance from each edge of the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.740
 do this in the four corners with assistance 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.110
 from the ruler she took a pencil and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.710
 make the markings from where we will remember 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.710
 with a stylus 

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:19.179
 remembering that it takes a lot of 

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:19.179
 Care to use the stylus 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.550
 remember the leaves very calmly until 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.550
 you see that the depth is already good 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.830
 after the pages are 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.230
 cut out and glue on the sheets 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.690
 outside the book do not forget to 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.280
 also pass in the inner part where you 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.260
 trimmed does not need to save on glue 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.979
 Because everything needs to be done a lot. 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.290
 caution 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.660
 remembering that after she dries it 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.060
 will be transparent 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.340
 you can put some weight on top of the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.090
 book in order to check that the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.180
 leaves stick together after it has 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.640
 is very dry take tissue and cut 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.739

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.770
