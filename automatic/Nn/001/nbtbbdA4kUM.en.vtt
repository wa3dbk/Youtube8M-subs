00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
different styles of animation but I

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.650 
different styles of animation but I
never<00:02:14.489> would<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.760> done<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.209> way<00:02:15.239> if<00:02:15.540> I

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
never would have done it that way if I

I<00:02:56.739> think<00:02:57.700> there<00:02:57.849> are<00:02:57.909> two<00:02:58.060> kinds<00:02:58.450> of<00:02:58.480> animation

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
I think there are two kinds of animation

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.440 
I think there are two kinds of animation
alright<00:02:59.530> there's<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.549> first<00:03:00.790> thing<00:03:01.030> any<00:03:01.180> any

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
alright there's the first thing any any

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.589 
alright there's the first thing any any
student<00:03:02.110> does<00:03:02.349> or<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:03.519> draw<00:03:03.760> as<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.090> kid<00:03:04.420> in

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
student does or you draw as a kid in

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.410 
student does or you draw as a kid in
your<00:03:04.629> school<00:03:04.780> book<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.819> math<00:03:07.030> book<00:03:07.269> or

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
your school book in the math book or

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.800 
your school book in the math book or
something<00:03:08.129> you<00:03:09.129> animate<00:03:09.670> little<00:03:09.939> figures<00:03:10.659> in

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
something you animate little figures in

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.630 
something you animate little figures in
the<00:03:10.900> bottom<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.319> change<00:03:11.709> tend<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.430> change

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
the bottom and you change tend to change

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.729 
the bottom and you change tend to change
one<00:03:12.909> thing<00:03:13.180> into<00:03:13.390> another<00:03:13.530> isn't<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.590> you

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
one thing into another isn't it you

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.210 
one thing into another isn't it you
morph<00:03:15.390> from<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.689> mean<00:03:16.930> or<00:03:17.079> any<00:03:17.439> student<00:03:17.799> film

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
morph from I mean or any student film

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.729 
morph from I mean or any student film
they<00:03:18.489> have<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.060> tree<00:03:19.359> turn<00:03:19.629> into<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> frog<00:03:20.260> into<00:03:20.590> a

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
they have a tree turn into a frog into a

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.619 
they have a tree turn into a frog into a
woman<00:03:21.159> into<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> car<00:03:21.790> into<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.859> airplane<00:03:23.859> into

woman into a car into a airplane into

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.440

whatever<00:03:26.069> all<00:03:27.069> animations<00:03:27.730> based<00:03:27.909> on<00:03:28.120> change

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
whatever all animations based on change

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.690 
whatever all animations based on change
I<00:03:28.690> think<00:03:29.049> so<00:03:29.859> you're<00:03:30.069> changing<00:03:30.310> one<00:03:30.670> thing

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
I think so you're changing one thing

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.059 
I think so you're changing one thing
into<00:03:31.090> another<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.659> that<00:03:32.290> lasts<00:03:32.650> about<00:03:32.739> five

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
into another and that lasts about five

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.129 
into another and that lasts about five
minutes<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:34.239> then<00:03:34.389> you<00:03:34.480> can't<00:03:34.690> stand<00:03:34.989> it

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
minutes and then you can't stand it

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.619 
minutes and then you can't stand it
anymore<00:03:35.409> however<00:03:36.129> interesting<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.790> is<00:03:36.940> you

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
anymore however interesting it is you

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.940 
anymore however interesting it is you
just<00:03:37.659> unplug<00:03:38.430> after<00:03:39.430> five<00:03:39.819> minutes<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.829> the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
just unplug after five minutes and the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.740 
just unplug after five minutes and the
other<00:03:42.099> kind<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.430> animation<00:03:42.939> is<00:03:43.030> drawings<00:03:43.480> or

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
other kind of animation is drawings or

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.379 
other kind of animation is drawings or
images<00:03:44.650> computer<00:03:45.489> images<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:46.030> walk<00:03:46.209> and

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
images computer images that walk and

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.099 
images computer images that walk and
talk<00:03:46.829> which<00:03:47.829> that<00:03:48.159> will<00:03:48.370> sustain<00:03:48.609> for<00:03:49.150> for<00:03:50.079> a

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
talk which that will sustain for for a

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.619 
talk which that will sustain for for a
hundred<00:03:50.409> minutes<00:03:50.819> 72<00:03:51.819> minutes<00:03:52.000> if<00:03:52.329> the<00:03:52.420> kids

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
hundred minutes 72 minutes if the kids

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.929 
hundred minutes 72 minutes if the kids
have<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.900> have<00:03:52.989> a<00:03:53.049> pee<00:03:53.430> isn't<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.489> that's<00:03:54.730> the

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
have to have a pee isn't it that's the

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.300 
have to have a pee isn't it that's the
sort<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.239> rule<00:03:55.510> so<00:03:56.319> obviously<00:03:56.920> we're<00:03:57.129> going<00:03:57.220> to

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
sort of rule so obviously we're going to

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.080 
sort of rule so obviously we're going to
change<00:03:57.579> we're<00:03:57.849> going<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.030> choose<00:03:59.940> images<00:04:00.940> of

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
change we're going to choose images of

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.879

these methods
I'll<00:04:13.030> show<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:14.730> limbering<00:04:15.730> things<00:04:16.060> up<00:04:16.329> is

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
I'll show you of limbering things up is

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.080 
I'll show you of limbering things up is
what<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.650> do<00:04:17.889> is<00:04:17.979> you<00:04:18.070> get<00:04:18.220> more<00:04:18.400> bang<00:04:18.729> for<00:04:19.000> the

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
what you do is you get more bang for the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.839 
what you do is you get more bang for the
buck<00:04:19.470> within<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.620> movement<00:04:20.829> you're<00:04:21.609> going<00:04:21.669> to

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
buck within the movement you're going to

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.510 
buck within the movement you're going to
have<00:04:21.970> more<00:04:22.150> change<00:04:22.599> and<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.979> can<00:04:24.159> use<00:04:24.310> these

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
have more change and you can use these

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.029 
have more change and you can use these
things<00:04:24.789> in<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.120> most<00:04:25.300> crude<00:04:25.659> way<00:04:25.930> or<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:26.919> can

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
things in the most crude way or you can

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.640 
things in the most crude way or you can
use<00:04:27.099> them<00:04:27.400> in<00:04:27.520> extremely<00:04:28.090> subtle<00:04:28.330> way<00:04:28.659> and<00:04:28.930> for

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
use them in extremely subtle way and for

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.920 
use them in extremely subtle way and for
the<00:04:29.710> computer<00:04:30.159> animation<00:04:30.760> as<00:04:30.970> as<00:04:31.389> far<00:04:31.690> as<00:04:31.810> I

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
the computer animation as as far as I

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.649 
the computer animation as as far as I
can<00:04:32.110> see<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:33.570> great<00:04:34.570> thing<00:04:34.960> about<00:04:34.990> computer

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
can see the great thing about computer

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:40.230 
can see the great thing about computer
animation<00:04:37.659> is<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:38.409> you<00:04:38.680> can<00:04:38.860> be<00:04:39.520> incredibly

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
animation is that you can be incredibly

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.420 
animation is that you can be incredibly
subtle<00:04:40.479> you<00:04:41.289> can<00:04:41.440> do<00:04:41.560> tiny<00:04:41.949> moves<00:04:42.900> so<00:04:44.220> this<00:04:45.220> is

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
subtle you can do tiny moves so this is

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.510 
subtle you can do tiny moves so this is
you<00:04:45.940> use<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.270> same<00:04:46.449> method<00:04:46.510> but<00:04:46.960> use<00:04:47.260> it

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
you use the same method but use it

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.740 
you use the same method but use it
incrementally<00:04:48.520> tiny<00:04:48.909> or<00:04:49.240> you<00:04:49.479> can<00:04:49.570> use<00:04:49.690> it

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
incrementally tiny or you can use it

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.649 
incrementally tiny or you can use it
very<00:04:49.960> broadly<00:04:50.229> I<00:04:50.590> learned<00:04:51.490> what<00:04:51.729> I<00:04:51.760> know<00:04:51.940> from

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
very broadly I learned what I know from

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.089 
very broadly I learned what I know from
some<00:04:52.840> of<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.020> great<00:04:53.229> animators<00:04:53.680> of<00:04:54.010> the

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
some of the great animators of the

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.790 
some of the great animators of the
Golden<00:04:54.430> Age<00:04:54.550> of<00:04:54.729> animation<00:04:55.289> they<00:04:56.289> invented

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
Golden Age of animation they invented

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.649 
Golden Age of animation they invented
the<00:04:56.949> systems<00:04:57.370> and<00:04:57.639> methods<00:04:57.820> that<00:04:58.360> we're<00:04:58.510> going

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
the systems and methods that we're going

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.189 
the systems and methods that we're going
to<00:04:58.720> study<00:04:58.960> in<00:04:59.139> these<00:04:59.320> 16<00:04:59.680> DVDs<00:05:01.199> unfortunately

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
to study in these 16 DVDs unfortunately

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.350 
to study in these 16 DVDs unfortunately
for<00:05:02.409> me<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.830> had<00:05:03.490> to<00:05:03.639> learn<00:05:03.789> it<00:05:03.849> the<00:05:03.970> hard<00:05:04.270> way

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
for me I had to learn it the hard way

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.769 
for me I had to learn it the hard way
over<00:05:05.020> years<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.560> years<00:05:05.650> I<00:05:06.690> ended<00:05:07.690> up

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:07.779 
over years and years I ended up

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.990 
over years and years I ended up
employing<00:05:08.260> some<00:05:08.680> of<00:05:08.800> my<00:05:08.950> teachers

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
employing some of my teachers

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.570 
employing some of my teachers
in<00:05:10.060> order<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.450> learn<00:05:10.600> from<00:05:10.840> them<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.580> others

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
in order to learn from them and others

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.240 
in order to learn from them and others
were<00:05:12.700> just<00:05:12.880> friends<00:05:13.450> like<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.200> genius<00:05:14.680> Milt

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
were just friends like the genius Milt

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.920 
were just friends like the genius Milt

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
Kahl Milt um he was so good that he was

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.350

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
faced with an awful lot of envy and he

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.210 
faced with an awful lot of envy and he
just<00:05:22.570> made<00:05:22.720> it<00:05:22.750> worse<00:05:23.080> by<00:05:23.530> being<00:05:23.740> utterly

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
just made it worse by being utterly

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.880 
just made it worse by being utterly
honest<00:05:24.760> he<00:05:25.630> was<00:05:25.780> honest<00:05:26.140> like<00:05:26.290> a<00:05:26.320> child<00:05:26.680> is

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890

honest he was honest like a child is
honest<00:05:27.250> which<00:05:28.240> was<00:05:28.420> terrifying<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:29.280> mean<00:05:30.280> he

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
honest which was terrifying I mean he

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.130 
honest which was terrifying I mean he
would<00:05:30.580> he<00:05:30.880> would<00:05:31.000> say<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.510> can't<00:05:31.750> draw<00:05:31.930> your

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
would he would say you can't draw your

everything I've ever done and I was

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.080 
everything I've ever done and I was
considered<00:06:28.570> an<00:06:28.720> innovator<00:06:29.669> for<00:06:30.669> a<00:06:30.729> lot<00:06:30.910> of<00:06:31.000> the

considered an innovator for a lot of the
time<00:06:31.330> it<00:06:32.020> was<00:06:32.140> all<00:06:32.350> based<00:06:32.620> on<00:06:32.830> the<00:06:32.950> basics<00:06:33.400> and

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
time it was all based on the basics and

time it was all based on the basics and
the<00:06:34.240> more<00:06:34.450> I<00:06:34.479> learned<00:06:35.229> about<00:06:35.440> the<00:06:35.680> basics<00:06:36.160> from

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
the more I learned about the basics from

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.490 
the more I learned about the basics from
these<00:06:36.669> old<00:06:36.910> birds<00:06:37.150> and<00:06:37.510> understood<00:06:38.320> them

these old birds and understood them

on<00:06:44.830> the<00:06:44.950> basics<00:06:45.370> I<00:06:45.520> really<00:06:46.120> don't<00:06:46.300> think<00:06:46.360> there

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
on the basics I really don't think there

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.830 
on the basics I really don't think there
is<00:06:46.690> any<00:06:46.960> more<00:06:47.200> in<00:06:48.160> these<00:06:48.610> sessions<00:06:48.940> we're

pill<00:07:27.410> start<00:07:28.410> from<00:07:28.590> the<00:07:28.740> basics<00:07:29.220> and<00:07:29.460> then<00:07:30.150> move

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:30.420 
pill start from the basics and then move

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.520 
pill start from the basics and then move
on<00:07:30.630> layer<00:07:30.930> by<00:07:31.530> layer<00:07:31.730> through<00:07:32.730> to<00:07:33.330> the

on layer by layer through to the
sophisticated<00:07:34.530> use<00:07:34.740> of<00:07:34.800> the<00:07:35.010> basics<00:07:35.630> we'll<00:07:36.630> be

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:36.750 
sophisticated use of the basics we'll be

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.470 
sophisticated use of the basics we'll be
showing<00:07:37.140> how<00:07:37.290> to<00:07:37.320> think<00:07:37.740> about<00:07:37.860> animation<00:07:38.610> by

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:39.480 
showing how to think about animation by

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.750 
showing how to think about animation by
showing<00:07:39.750> pose<00:07:40.080> positions<00:07:40.650> and<00:07:40.890> then<00:07:41.430> full

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:41.760 
showing pose positions and then full

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:50.470 
showing pose positions and then full
animation<00:07:48.140> will<00:07:49.140> show<00:07:49.170> how<00:07:49.380> to<00:07:49.620> animate<00:07:49.980> and

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:50.480 
animation will show how to animate and

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.600 
animation will show how to animate and
also<00:07:51.480> how<00:07:51.630> not<00:07:51.840> to<00:07:53.690> what<00:07:54.690> this<00:07:54.870> is<00:07:55.110> is<00:07:55.460> to<00:07:56.460> get

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:56.610 
also how not to what this is is to get

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.420 
also how not to what this is is to get
limber<00:07:57.060> this<00:07:57.540> you<00:07:57.750> get<00:07:57.930> this<00:07:58.140> to<00:07:58.440> get<00:07:58.620> snap<00:07:59.130> you
