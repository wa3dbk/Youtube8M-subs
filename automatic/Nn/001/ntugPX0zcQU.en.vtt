00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
it as we have done here simply by using

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.570 
it as we have done here simply by using
the<00:04:49.170> dividing<00:04:49.590> sheet<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.100> middle<00:04:50.340> and

the dividing sheet in the middle and

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.820 
the dividing sheet in the middle and
zipping<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:51.630> closed<00:04:51.900> you'll<00:04:52.380> create<00:04:52.590> two

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
that's fine what we can do is just

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.940
