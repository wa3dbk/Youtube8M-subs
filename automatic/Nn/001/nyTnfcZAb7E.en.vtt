00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.880 
done so what do they do they're getting
either<00:01:33.600> run<00:01:33.869> away<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:34.320> they're<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.829> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
either run away or they're going to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.249 
either run away or they're going to
shield<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.180> lead<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.720> more

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
shield and that can lead some more

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.929 
shield and that can lead some more
opportunities<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.070> there's<00:01:38.820> an

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
opportunities for you there's an

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.399 
opportunities for you there's an
interesting<00:01:39.119> dynamic<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.170> between

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
interesting dynamic right now between

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.230 
interesting dynamic right now between
these<00:01:40.770> two<00:01:40.920> players<00:01:41.250> I'm<00:01:41.579> noticing<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
these two players I'm noticing that the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.210 
these two players I'm noticing that the
not<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.509> shy<00:01:42.720> guy<00:01:42.899> he<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.320> wants<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> take

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
not so shy guy he really wants to take

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.889 
not so shy guy he really wants to take
control<00:01:44.340> center<00:01:44.790> stage<00:01:45.000> which<00:01:45.420> makes<00:01:45.659> sense

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
control center stage which makes sense

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.170 
control center stage which makes sense
if<00:01:46.140> he's<00:01:46.619> near<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.369> edges<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.759> stage<00:01:47.970> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
if he's near the edges of the stage that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.520 
if he's near the edges of the stage that
makes<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.600> much<00:01:48.750> easier<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.290> him<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> get

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
makes it that much easier for him to get

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.080 
makes it that much easier for him to get
pushed<00:01:49.770> off<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> stage<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.790> he's<00:01:50.939> often

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
pushed off the stage and if he's often

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.340 
pushed off the stage and if he's often
say<00:01:51.299> she's<00:01:51.479> probably<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:51.930> gonna<00:01:52.020> make<00:01:52.229> it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
say she's probably not gonna make it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.679 
say she's probably not gonna make it
back<00:01:52.470> oh<00:01:52.710> ro<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> other<00:01:53.759> hand<00:01:53.850> he<00:01:54.149> really

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
back oh ro on the other hand he really

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.120 
back oh ro on the other hand he really
wants<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> fake<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.590> shy<00:01:55.770> guy<00:01:55.920> in

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
wants to fake the not so shy guy in

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.469 
wants to fake the not so shy guy in
that's<00:01:56.579> what<00:01:56.670> he's<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:56.939> waiting<00:01:57.060> towards

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
that's what he's just waiting towards

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.850 
that's what he's just waiting towards
the<00:01:57.540> edges<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> stage<00:01:58.229> trying<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> maybe

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the edges of the stage trying to maybe

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.950 
the edges of the stage trying to maybe

that's exactly what I was gonna say the
tornado<00:02:18.480> uppercut<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:18.870> was<00:02:19.109> beautiful

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
moment where it's I get neutral you can

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:26.990 
moment where it's I get neutral you can
count<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.159> Little<00:02:26.400> Mac<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.640> come<00:02:26.790> dashing

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
favorite stage of playing I'll be real

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.720 
favorite stage of playing I'll be real
cuz<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.049> keeps<00:02:49.200> wobbling<00:02:49.530> back<00:02:49.859> at<00:02:50.159> boards<00:02:50.549> too

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
cuz it keeps wobbling back at boards too

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.250 
cuz it keeps wobbling back at boards too
much<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.180> sometimes<00:02:51.389> that<00:02:51.689> tilting<00:02:52.079> stage
