here<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:29.190> may<00:02:29.550> says<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.940> lot<00:02:30.150> more<00:02:30.390> fit<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.840> he

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
here in may says a lot more fit that he

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.360 
here in may says a lot more fit that he
did<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> year<00:02:31.349> ago<00:02:31.410> when<00:02:31.739> he<00:02:31.830> made<00:02:32.010> his<00:02:32.040> comeback

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
did a year ago when he made his comeback

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.890 
did a year ago when he made his comeback
he's<00:02:32.790> look<00:02:33.060> sharp<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.690> practice<00:02:35.540> long<00:02:36.540> pool

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
he's look sharp in practice long pool

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.259 
he's look sharp in practice long pool
five<00:02:37.230> weeks<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.860> out<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.489> two<00:02:38.640> training<00:02:39.090> back

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
five weeks it out the two training back

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.259 
five weeks it out the two training back
in<00:02:39.450> February<00:02:40.430> doesn't<00:02:41.430> still<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:42.030> that

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
in February doesn't still have that

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.110 
in February doesn't still have that
great<00:02:42.569> speed<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.350> get<00:02:43.620> out<00:02:43.830> but<00:02:44.819> this<00:02:44.940> is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
great speed to get out but this is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.910 
great speed to get out but this is
exactly<00:02:45.360> what<00:02:45.840> he<00:02:45.900> did<00:02:46.019> in<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.200> prelims<00:02:46.500> he

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
exactly what he did in the prelims he

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920 
exactly what he did in the prelims he
hit<00:02:47.130> his<00:02:47.340> wall<00:02:47.549> there<00:02:47.970> much<00:02:48.390> better<00:02:48.720> day<00:02:48.900> than

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
hit his wall there much better day than

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.750 
hit his wall there much better day than
the<00:02:49.230> prelims<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.920> that's<00:02:50.190> what<00:02:50.370> he<00:02:50.489> talked

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the prelims and that's what he talked

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.059 
the prelims and that's what he talked
about<00:02:51.060> he<00:02:51.180> wanted<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.600> hit<00:02:51.750> his<00:02:51.900> wall<00:02:52.140> on<00:02:52.799> this

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
about he wanted to hit his wall on this

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.190 
about he wanted to hit his wall on this
51<00:02:53.610> he<00:02:53.760> can't<00:02:54.060> complain<00:02:54.390> about<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.049> was

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
51 he can't complain about that that was

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.110 
51 he can't complain about that that was
just<00:02:55.470> about<00:02:55.709> perfect<00:02:55.769> coming<00:02:56.549> into<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:56.760> turn

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
just about perfect coming into that turn

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.710 
just about perfect coming into that turn
that<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.660> 4/10<00:02:58.470> faster<00:02:59.010> 24/7<00:02:59.970> going<00:03:00.299> out<00:03:00.450> for

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
that is 4/10 faster 24/7 going out for

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.410 
that is 4/10 faster 24/7 going out for
Phelps<00:03:00.989> Negus<00:03:01.799> morning<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.310> think<00:03:02.670> if<00:03:02.819> he's<00:03:03.000> 50

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
Phelps Negus morning I think if he's 50

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.770 
Phelps Negus morning I think if he's 50
200<00:03:03.720> 51<00:03:04.709> high<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.459> think<00:03:05.910> that's<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.390> good<00:03:06.510> shot

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
200 51 high I think that's a good shot

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.290 
200 51 high I think that's a good shot
I'm<00:03:06.900> not<00:03:07.049> sure<00:03:07.260> if<00:03:07.349> that's<00:03:07.410> gonna<00:03:07.620> make<00:03:07.830> him

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
I'm not sure if that's gonna make him

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.270 
I'm not sure if that's gonna make him
but<00:03:08.660> it's<00:03:08.810> going<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.320> be<00:03:09.380> good<00:03:09.530> enough

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
but it's going to be good enough

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.680 
but it's going to be good enough
pretty<00:03:10.880> good<00:03:11.470> Michael<00:03:12.470> Phelps<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:14.090> pool<00:03:14.390> it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
pretty good Michael Phelps the pool it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.590 
pretty good Michael Phelps the pool it
takes<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.290> 100<00:03:15.860> fly<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.160> takes<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.760> by<00:03:17.569> a

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
takes the 100 fly it takes it by a

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.360 
takes the 100 fly it takes it by a
fairly<00:03:18.560> good<00:03:18.830> measure<00:03:20.440> 52:38<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.800> wins<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.220> by

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
fairly good measure 52:38 and wins it by

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.410 
fairly good measure 52:38 and wins it by
over<00:03:22.940> 7/10<00:03:25.720> 52:38<00:03:26.720> as<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.200> time<00:03:28.130> not<00:03:28.550> in<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.209> top

2 the world is your Odyssey where do you
think<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:35.720> said<00:03:36.020> after<00:03:36.200> his<00:03:36.410> prelim<00:03:36.830> time<00:03:37.100> he'd

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
think I said after his prelim time he'd

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.570 
think I said after his prelim time he'd
go<00:03:37.459> 52<00:03:38.030> low<00:03:38.209> maybe<00:03:38.510> 51<00:03:39.200> 5<00:03:39.440> maybe<00:03:40.250> he<00:03:40.430> had<00:03:40.520> a

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
go 52 low maybe 51 5 maybe he had a

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.820 
go 52 low maybe 51 5 maybe he had a
chance<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:41.060> break<00:03:41.209> 52<00:03:41.720> he<00:03:41.870> had<00:03:41.959> a<00:03:41.989> good<00:03:42.290> turn<00:03:42.590> I

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
chance to break 52 he had a good turn I

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.100 
chance to break 52 he had a good turn I
mean<00:03:43.190> there's<00:03:43.820> no<00:03:44.090> complaining<00:03:44.750> about<00:03:44.840> the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
mean there's no complaining about the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.470 
mean there's no complaining about the
term<00:03:45.320> but<00:03:45.530> here's<00:03:45.830> Phelps<00:03:46.340> right<00:03:47.030> there<00:03:47.239> watch

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
term but here's Phelps right there watch

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.509 
term but here's Phelps right there watch
when<00:03:47.810> he<00:03:47.900> comes<00:03:48.170> off<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.380> block<00:03:48.769> again<00:03:49.130> he

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
when he comes off that block again he

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.600 
when he comes off that block again he
doesn't<00:03:50.060> have<00:03:50.330> that<00:03:50.360> great<00:03:51.100> strength<00:03:52.100> as<00:03:52.400> far

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
doesn't have that great strength as far

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.830 
doesn't have that great strength as far
as<00:03:52.700> coming<00:03:53.000> off<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.180> buck<00:03:53.330> and<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.510> thought<00:03:53.720> he

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
as coming off the buck and I thought he

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.990 
as coming off the buck and I thought he
was<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:53.989> little<00:03:54.260> low<00:03:54.470> on<00:03:54.830> his<00:03:55.340> hips<00:03:55.640> as<00:03:55.850> they

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
was a little low on his hips as they

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.910 
was a little low on his hips as they
dropped<00:03:56.300> just<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.750> touch<00:03:56.989> he<00:03:57.290> didn't<00:03:57.530> come<00:03:57.739> up

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
dropped just a touch he didn't come up

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.520 
dropped just a touch he didn't come up
very<00:03:58.160> good<00:03:58.430> but<00:03:58.970> again<00:03:59.209> he's<00:03:59.660> just<00:03:59.690> so<00:04:00.140> good<00:04:00.380> at

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
very good but again he's just so good at

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.680 
very good but again he's just so good at
building<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.280> race<00:04:01.459> you<00:04:01.760> know<00:04:01.880> building<00:04:02.480> into
