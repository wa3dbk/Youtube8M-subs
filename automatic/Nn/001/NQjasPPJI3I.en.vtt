00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello everyone i hope you 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.450
 be well 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.059
 so in this video I'm going to 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.920
 present an example of care kits 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.839
 for beginners so if you come from 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.190
 do your big shots and you do not know 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.390
 not what product bought my talent and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.039
 not where to start 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.689
 watch this video then in my 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.619
 family recently there is a person who 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.480
 cut his hair 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.160
 so it's my mother who has big shots 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.710
 and I went shopping for 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.170
 she so I thought it could be 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.840
 interesting to show you the products 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.710
 I chose and here I think it 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.120
 can give you ideas 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.950
 she and we start right away 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.910
 so the first shampoo I have 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.950
 chosen for ncl oil shampoo 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.420
 crem of nature 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.780
 so it's a sulphate-free shampoo 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.000
 which is pretty sweet on the hair I 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.550
 have tried them too so I kind 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.199
 a bottle for me and I love them 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.890
 a lot it's my second shampoo 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.449
 prefect after the misfits high what is 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.340
 well with this shampoo what is not 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.350
 very dear miss miss me cost in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.939
 the 15 euros it seems to me then that these 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.400
 pounds cost less than 10 euros so 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.869
 here it is easy to find in France 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.869
 he feels pretty good 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.810
 so the strong point is that it is this 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.560
 we sulfates and do not let 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.509
 dry hair 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.490
 he even leaves a little movie where 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.009
 the attention of the hair he makes he is 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.310
 really disentangling after so here I am 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.420
 screw is taken this shampoo killed in October 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.770
 so the second product that I have 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.049
 chosen for it misses it's a 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.240
 conditioner and that's the mark 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.939
 herbal essences so it's hilo 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.560
 heidrich own so here it is 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.900
 conditioner that is fine that there is 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.400
 a lot of slippery jeans like that 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.700
 so it really makes disentangling easier 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.159
 they are super good they and will preside 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.920
 time and it does not cost much at all so 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.360
 here I recommend it too 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.710
 so in terms of livin conditioner 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.430
 Julia is taken so the living room 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.159
 argane conditioners at the hand of kant or 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.850
 this one I have not tried yet 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.409
 try the shea butter but 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.869
 I said I'm going I'm going 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.280
 test I took two boxes so one 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.349
 box for my mother is a box for 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.789
 I still have not tried so 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.750
 10.3 in comment is what you 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.930
 want a video 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.370
 first impressions on this product 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.799
 in any case it seems to me that he is well 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.110
 anyway I already know you g 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.580
 I love the Canton brand is one of 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.799
 my favorite brands for hair 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.440
 so good I think I will not be disappointed 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.120
 by this product so for that and 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.250
 hydration I chose him so 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.660
 the coconut oil you know 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.140
 already I wanted to present in several 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.970
 videos 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.980
 so it's less of a coconut smell 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.930
 super good so there are dummies of cooking 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.780
 cock that do not smell anything that allows 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.370
 so also to cook and to 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.920
 apply it on the body on the hair 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.299
 and this is the one here they are the 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.099
 coconut which I do not know if we can 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.359
 to cook with me anyway I 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.340
 have not taken for that I pray them for 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.890
 the hair and so the fact that it 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.060
 leaves a very very pleasant smell on 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.250
 the hair is just awesome 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.930
 so we can use it daily 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.329
 in small amounts to seal the 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.670
 swimming where we can use it also in 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.079
 deep care so the last product that 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.880
 I chose so it's fantastic 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.769
 wave ii activi languages 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.910
 so what's good with this product 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.950
 has several things you can do 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.730
 with this particular product we can do 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.169
 oil baths 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.760
 so I think for a beginner 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.709
 it's great because she will not have 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.519
 bought several oils to do this 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.500
 his oil bath 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.329
 she just buys a single project like 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.849
 which therefore contains avocado oil 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.060
 olive oil from coconut oil 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.410
 oil of 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.870
 the soil of castor oil from the oil of 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.840
 jojoba so here are several oils this 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.720
 product is 98% of natural origin 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.190
 so it seems to me without paraben without 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.480
 silicone without a great mineral 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.220
 so really for a beginner it's 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.319
 a very good product to do ena 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.940
 oil and also for that and 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.620
 hydration really puts in small 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:59.220
 quantities the smell we talk about it smells 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.230
 Too good it smells like candy 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.640
 feels too so that's it for this product 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.069
 so long as I did not buy him 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.530
 of mask because I think she 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.900
 can use this product there so this 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.260
 conditioners who will reside time in 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.880
 mass that just need it adds 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.400
 honey for example or oil 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.940
 coconut for a care of 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.460
 deep 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.650
 so that's all it cost me pretty much 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.800
 55 euros so really not a beginner 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.660
 I think it is 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.340
 it's very reasonable knowing that these 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.220
 products you from the withdrawal hear him the 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.479
 shampoo it can do you everything if 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.460
 you just did your bichonne 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.260
 did not have a lot of hair so I 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.410
 think that this shampoo can easily 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.270
 do six months coconut oil also 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.150
 and then the conditioning is all 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.070
 these products tell you an eternity for 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.580
 55 euros I really think for a 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.950
 debutante 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.940
 you have what it takes you do not have 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.380
 need more than that and 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.510
 here we are doing very well like that 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.400
 So here is the yoyo is finished I 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.740
 think it will have been short but I 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.520
 think she will want served too 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.050

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.700
 comment is so you will see 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.950

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.090
 after 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.050
 time 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.050
