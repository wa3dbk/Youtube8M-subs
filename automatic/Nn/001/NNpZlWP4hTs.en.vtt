Android it works on the samsung galaxy
note<00:01:02.350> 2<00:01:02.590> so<00:01:02.620> it<00:01:02.860> works<00:01:03.039> on<00:01:03.160> any<00:01:03.219> under<00:01:03.730> any<00:01:04.600> ways

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
note 2 so it works on any under any ways

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.380 
note 2 so it works on any under any ways
on<00:01:06.670> Android<00:01:07.090> 4.3<00:01:07.450> go<00:01:07.869> to<00:01:08.190> more<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.460> security

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
on Android 4.3 go to more and security

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.040 
on Android 4.3 go to more and security
I'm<00:01:10.899> not<00:01:11.319> sure<00:01:11.619> how<00:01:11.920> it<00:01:12.130> looks<00:01:12.340> like<00:01:12.550> on<00:01:13.050> 4.1.2

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.740 
I'm not sure how it looks like on 4.1.2
I<00:01:14.259> think<00:01:14.800> it's<00:01:14.950> just<00:01:15.250> security<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.450> scroll

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
I think it's just security you scroll

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.900 
I think it's just security you scroll
down<00:01:16.929> to<00:01:17.140> security<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:18.160> here<00:01:18.550> you<00:01:18.729> should

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
down to security and here you should

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.760 
down to security and here you should
find<00:01:19.119> unknown<00:01:19.390> sources<00:01:19.959> you<00:01:20.140> you<00:01:20.590> should
