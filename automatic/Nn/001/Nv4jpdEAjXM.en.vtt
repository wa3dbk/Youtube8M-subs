electricity this here is a steer mat
that<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.829> brought<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.250> me<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.809> there<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.840> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that I brought with me and there is a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.389 
that I brought with me and there is a
power<00:00:46.890> cord<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.850> would<00:00:48.090> connect<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:49.399> one

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
power cord that you would connect to one

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.229 
power cord that you would connect to one
edge<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:51.300> end<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.870> stair<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.710> this

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
edge one end of this stair like this

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.700 
edge one end of this stair like this
it's<00:00:54.239> very<00:00:54.329> smartness<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.199> completely

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it's very smartness a completely

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.920 
it's very smartness a completely
watertight<00:00:56.250> connection<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.510> Mac

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
watertight connection and then the Mac

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.920 
watertight connection and then the Mac
is<00:00:58.109> heated<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.039> snow<00:00:59.280> falls<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.059> falls<00:01:00.449> all

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
is heated the snow falls it falls all

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.959 
is heated the snow falls it falls all
around<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> mat<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.980> doesn't<00:01:02.430> stick<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
around the mat but it doesn't stick to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.850 
around the mat but it doesn't stick to
the<00:01:03.000> mat<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:03.750> mat<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.229> heated<00:01:04.589> very

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the mat because if mat is heated very

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.020 
the mat because if mat is heated very
very<00:01:05.100> smart<00:01:05.339> that's<00:01:05.519> exactly<00:01:05.850> right

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
very smart that's exactly right

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.640 
very smart that's exactly right
now<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.840> dangerous<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.500> I'm

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
now is it dangerous at all because I'm

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.500 
now is it dangerous at all because I'm
seeing<00:01:07.890> electricity<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:08.820> seeing<00:01:09.090> snow

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
seeing electricity and I'm seeing snow

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.570 
seeing electricity and I'm seeing snow
and<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> combination<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:11.070> scary

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and the combination is a little scary

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.520 
and the combination is a little scary
should<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:12.119> nervous<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.080> good<00:01:13.200> question

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
should I be nervous it's a good question

you should not be nervous okay
the<00:01:15.060> Mets<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.659> been<00:01:15.900> designed<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> be

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the Mets have been designed to be

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.310 
the Mets have been designed to be
completely<00:01:17.310> watertight<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.900> addition<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
completely watertight and in addition to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.820 
completely watertight and in addition to
that<00:01:19.470> these<00:01:20.430> mats<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> plug<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that these mats have a plug that have a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
that these mats have a plug that have a
switch<00:01:23.700> very<00:01:24.210> similar<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> outlet<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
switch very similar to the outlet that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.840 
switch very similar to the outlet that
you<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:25.860> bathroom<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.640> safety

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you have in your bathroom it's a safety

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.819 
you have in your bathroom it's a safety
switch<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.840> around<00:01:27.990> water<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.650> want

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
switch because it's around water we want

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:29.990 
switch because it's around water we want
to<00:01:28.890> take<00:01:28.979> extra<00:01:29.189> precaution<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.909> going

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
to take extra precaution that it's going

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
to take extra precaution that it's going
to<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.150> safe<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.869> also<00:01:31.140> noticed<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.710> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
to be safe now I also noticed that it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.520 
to be safe now I also noticed that it
has<00:01:32.159> traction<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.820> well<00:01:33.360> which<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.810> very<00:01:34.290> smart

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
has traction as well which is very smart

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.690 
has traction as well which is very smart
because<00:01:34.770> there's<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> little<00:01:35.430> precipitation

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
because there's a little precipitation

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.569 
because there's a little precipitation
that<00:01:36.299> gets<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.650> mat<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.310> gets<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that gets on the mat and it gets a

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.609 
that gets on the mat and it gets a
little<00:01:38.729> bit<00:01:38.939> wet<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.350> traction

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
little bit wet but you have the traction

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.770 
little bit wet but you have the traction
so<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.220> you're<00:01:41.340> walking<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:42.329> feel<00:01:42.540> safe

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
so if you're walking you feel safe

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.670 
so if you're walking you feel safe
that's<00:01:43.259> correct

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that's correct

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.249 
that's correct
you<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.700> melt<00:01:44.909> snow<00:01:45.259> there

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you know when you do melt snow there

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.289 
you know when you do melt snow there

and<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:51.119> want<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.329> make<00:01:51.420> sure<00:01:51.450> no<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.720> slips<00:01:51.840> on

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.600 
and we want to make sure no one slips on
that<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.560> designed<00:01:52.890> these<00:01:53.009> mats<00:01:53.310> with

treads here and these treads basically

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.749 
treads here and these treads basically
