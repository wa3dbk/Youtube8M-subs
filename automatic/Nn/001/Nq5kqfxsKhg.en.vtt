00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:35.479 

oh<00:03:30.180> yeah<00:03:31.180> how<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.840> practice<00:03:32.319> that<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:33.510> get<00:03:34.510> a

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
oh yeah how I practice that is I get a

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:43.290 
oh yeah how I practice that is I get a
metronome<00:03:36.489> I<00:03:39.780> like<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.050> drum<00:03:41.350> beat<00:03:42.300> you

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
metronome I like it on the drum beat you

00:03:43.300 --> 00:04:00.449 
metronome I like it on the drum beat you
might<00:03:43.450> want<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.690> start<00:03:43.870> out<00:03:43.989> with<00:03:44.020> slower<00:03:59.459> so

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
might want to start out with slower so

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.030 
might want to start out with slower so
what<00:04:00.610> I<00:04:00.640> do<00:04:00.730> is<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:01.239> play<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.540> half<00:04:01.720> speed<00:04:02.050> the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
what I do is I play it half speed the

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.340 
what I do is I play it half speed the
first<00:04:03.280> time<00:04:03.519> all<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:04.030> way<00:04:04.120> through<00:04:04.360> so<00:04:05.050> i<00:04:05.080> can

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
first time all the way through so i can

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.430 
first time all the way through so i can
get<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.590> picking<00:04:05.980> technique<00:04:06.400> down<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.930> like<00:04:08.230> I

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
get the picking technique down so like I

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.370 
get the picking technique down so like I
know<00:04:09.030> exactly<00:04:10.030> my<00:04:10.420> muscles<00:04:10.660> will<00:04:11.080> get<00:04:11.200> that

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
know exactly my muscles will get that

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.000 
know exactly my muscles will get that
muscle<00:04:11.620> memory<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:12.160> build<00:04:12.370> up<00:04:12.550> where<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:14.860> know

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
muscle memory to build up where you know

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.370 
muscle memory to build up where you know
how<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.570> with<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.660> picking<00:04:16.959> will<00:04:17.079> be<00:04:17.200> like

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
how the with the picking will be like

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.800 
how the with the picking will be like
perfect<00:04:17.680> like<00:04:18.070> down<00:04:18.459> perfectly<00:04:19.000> so<00:04:19.570> that<00:04:19.600> when

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
perfect like down perfectly so that when

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.980 
perfect like down perfectly so that when
you<00:04:19.870> play<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.049> faster<00:04:20.500> it'll<00:04:20.769> just<00:04:21.150> be<00:04:22.150> smooth

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
you play it faster it'll just be smooth

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.409 
you play it faster it'll just be smooth
and<00:04:23.260> then<00:04:24.100> yeah<00:04:24.370> you<00:04:24.430> just<00:04:24.640> play<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:24.850> second

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
and then yeah you just play it second

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.719 
and then yeah you just play it second
time<00:04:25.570> through<00:04:25.740> normal<00:04:26.740> speed<00:04:27.010> just<00:04:27.550> let<00:04:27.700> me

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
time through normal speed just let me

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:53.300 
time through normal speed just let me
show<00:04:27.940> you<00:04:27.970> what<00:04:28.240> that's<00:04:28.360> like

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.370 

then<00:04:54.310> when<00:04:54.520> you're<00:04:54.730> getting<00:04:55.330> better<00:04:55.540> you

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
then when you're getting better you

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.520 
then when you're getting better you
gradually<00:04:56.830> increase<00:04:57.310> tempo<00:04:57.700> I<00:04:57.910> go<00:04:58.750> up<00:04:58.840> in<00:04:58.960> five

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:33.999 
yeah and now that's how you increase

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.109 
yeah and now that's how you increase
speed<00:05:34.299> it'll<00:05:34.659> be<00:05:34.869> a<00:05:35.049> lot<00:05:35.829> easier<00:05:36.099> for<00:05:36.609> you<00:05:36.729> like

I<00:05:37.569> started<00:05:38.259> doing<00:05:38.529> that<00:05:38.799> and<00:05:39.099> I<00:05:39.399> could<00:05:39.639> tell

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
I started doing that and I could tell

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.569 
I started doing that and I could tell
the<00:05:39.909> difference<00:05:39.939> within<00:05:40.689> that<00:05:41.649> hour<00:05:41.949> that<00:05:42.399> I

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:42.579 
the difference within that hour that I

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:45.509 
the difference within that hour that I
practiced<00:05:43.149> and<00:05:43.919> you<00:05:44.919> know<00:05:45.039> you<00:05:45.129> have<00:05:45.369> to

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:45.519 
practiced and you know you have to

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:48.839 
practiced and you know you have to
practice<00:05:45.969> on<00:05:46.299> a<00:05:46.329> daily<00:05:46.509> basis<00:05:47.079> to<00:05:47.519> be<00:05:48.519> able<00:05:48.729> to

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
practice on a daily basis to be able to

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.619 
practice on a daily basis to be able to
sustain<00:05:49.659> the<00:05:50.519> playing<00:05:51.519> level<00:05:51.729> and<00:05:52.089> to

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629 
sustain the playing level and to

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:54.989 
sustain the playing level and to
increase<00:05:52.959> you<00:05:53.409> know<00:05:53.529> every<00:05:53.829> day<00:05:53.859> because<00:05:54.789> that

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:54.999 
increase you know every day because that

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:58.139 
increase you know every day because that
if<00:05:55.359> you<00:05:55.779> play<00:05:56.049> it<00:05:56.079> slower<00:05:56.609> you<00:05:57.609> notice<00:05:57.939> that

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:58.149 
if you play it slower you notice that

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:04.409 
if you play it slower you notice that
you<00:05:58.539> practice<00:05:58.749> the<00:05:59.439> alternate<00:05:59.889> picking<00:06:03.419> your

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
you practice the alternate picking your

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.849 
you practice the alternate picking your
muscles<00:06:05.109> remember<00:06:05.409> how<00:06:05.919> they<00:06:06.429> picked<00:06:06.789> exactly

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:07.859 
muscles remember how they picked exactly

00:06:07.859 --> 00:06:13.159 
muscles remember how they picked exactly
every<00:06:08.859> time<00:06:10.889> so<00:06:11.889> you<00:06:11.979> can<00:06:12.039> play<00:06:12.219> it<00:06:12.249> faster<00:06:12.819> and

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
every time so you can play it faster and

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.369 
every time so you can play it faster and
have<00:06:14.169> it<00:06:14.349> just<00:06:14.649> be<00:06:15.629> you<00:06:16.629> know<00:06:16.719> a<00:06:16.749> spot<00:06:17.019> on<00:06:17.079> and

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
have it just be you know a spot on and

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.539 
have it just be you know a spot on and
smooth<00:06:18.309> so<00:06:18.819> that's<00:06:19.749> how<00:06:19.959> I<00:06:20.279> increase<00:06:21.279> speed

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:21.549 
smooth so that's how I increase speed

00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:23.849 
smooth so that's how I increase speed
especially<00:06:22.089> on<00:06:22.419> that<00:06:22.599> riff<00:06:22.839> I<00:06:23.109> need<00:06:23.769> to
