you can do the video doesn't cover that
in<00:01:13.110> much<00:01:13.439> detail<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.369> least<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.670> a

as<00:02:15.629> great<00:02:15.930> as<00:02:16.080> an<00:02:16.379> addition<00:02:16.830> as<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.340> it

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
as great as an addition as it is it

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.270 
as great as an addition as it is it
doesn't<00:02:18.120> seem<00:02:18.510> ideal<00:02:18.989> especially<00:02:19.709> for<00:02:20.040> a

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
doesn't seem ideal especially for a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.949 
doesn't seem ideal especially for a
dungeon<00:02:20.940> run<00:02:21.120> with<00:02:21.330> multiple<00:02:21.780> people

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
dungeon run with multiple people

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.410 
dungeon run with multiple people
fighting<00:02:22.860> against<00:02:23.190> multiple<00:02:23.519> enemies<00:02:24.120> and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
fighting against multiple enemies and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.479 
fighting against multiple enemies and
then<00:02:24.810> also<00:02:24.959> it's<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.409> fairly<00:02:25.799> new<00:02:26.069> addition

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
then also it's a fairly new addition

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.949 
then also it's a fairly new addition
that's<00:02:26.670> something<00:02:26.940> they<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.090> added<00:02:27.510> this

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
that's something they just added this

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.960 
that's something they just added this
year<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.709> so<00:02:29.069> it's<00:02:29.250> not<00:02:29.370> quite<00:02:29.610> as<00:02:29.760> polished

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
year and so it's not quite as polished

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.850 
year and so it's not quite as polished
as<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.329> third<00:02:30.690> person<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:31.620> another

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
as the third person I think another

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.589 
as the third person I think another
problem<00:02:32.280> though<00:02:32.459> with<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.670> presentation<00:02:33.420> and

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
problem though with a presentation and

problem though with a presentation and
what<00:02:34.140> occurred<00:02:34.829> was<00:02:35.129> there's<00:02:35.760> actually<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.239> lot

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
what occurred was there's actually a lot

what occurred was there's actually a lot

going on in the combat but to the
uninitiated<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:40.500> looks<00:02:40.799> like<00:02:41.040> spamming<00:02:41.519> if

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
uninitiated it looks like spamming if

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.460 
uninitiated it looks like spamming if
it's<00:02:41.940> not<00:02:42.120> being<00:02:42.390> explained<00:02:42.930> there's<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.319> lot

dodging or avoiding red areas now the
combat<00:03:15.780> again<00:03:16.079> it's<00:03:16.379> much<00:03:16.709> more<00:03:16.919> reactive

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
combat again it's much more reactive

combat again it's much more reactive
it's<00:03:17.549> sort<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.849> mix<00:03:18.000> between<00:03:18.209> heavy<00:03:18.750> action

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.030 
and it's pretty engaging I can tell you
from<00:03:23.730> prior<00:03:24.060> play<00:03:24.389> experience<00:03:25.019> at<00:03:25.290> an<00:03:25.739> event

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
from prior play experience at an event

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.520 
from prior play experience at an event
like<00:03:26.310> pax<00:03:26.639> east<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.870> combat<00:03:28.230> can<00:03:28.410> be

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
like pax east that the combat can be

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.409 
like pax east that the combat can be
very<00:03:28.739> engaging<00:03:29.160> but<00:03:29.519> in<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.910> presentation

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
very engaging but in the presentation

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.479 
very engaging but in the presentation
that<00:03:30.750> they<00:03:30.870> have<00:03:31.079> it<00:03:31.709> really<00:03:32.129> wasn't

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
that they have it really wasn't

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.819 
that they have it really wasn't
explained<00:03:33.000> what<00:03:33.269> was<00:03:33.299> going<00:03:33.510> on<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.319> think

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
explained what was going on and I think

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.050 
explained what was going on and I think
for<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.040> reason<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.549> lot<00:03:35.579> of<00:03:35.730> people<00:03:36.030> just

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
for that reason a lot of people just

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.879 
for that reason a lot of people just
looked<00:03:36.419> at<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.780> thought<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:37.079> was<00:03:37.260> spam<00:03:37.680> me

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
looked at it and thought it was spam me

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.500 
looked at it and thought it was spam me
now<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.430> good<00:03:38.639> thing<00:03:38.879> is<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.090> eventually

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
now the good thing is that eventually

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.839 
now the good thing is that eventually
once<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.260> beta<00:03:40.470> continues<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.160> roll<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.549> and

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
once the beta continues to roll on and

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.909 
once the beta continues to roll on and
hopefully<00:03:42.419> we<00:03:42.720> get<00:03:42.840> into<00:03:43.079> open<00:03:43.440> beta<00:03:43.470> before

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
hopefully we get into open beta before

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.280 
hopefully we get into open beta before
release<00:03:44.519> people<00:03:45.239> actually<00:03:45.629> get<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.870> play<00:03:46.109> the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
release people actually get to play the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.780 
release people actually get to play the
game<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.769> then<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.160> think<00:03:47.340> they'll<00:03:47.489> realize

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
game and then I think they'll realize

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.939 
game and then I think they'll realize
the<00:03:48.030> combat<00:03:48.449> as<00:03:48.599> less<00:03:48.870> spammy<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.650> actually

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
the combat as less spammy and actually

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.339 
the combat as less spammy and actually
does<00:03:50.099> require<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.639> to<00:03:50.760> pay<00:03:50.879> attention<00:03:51.419> and<00:03:51.569> as

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
does require you to pay attention and as

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.140 
does require you to pay attention and as
such<00:03:52.769> makes<00:03:53.099> it<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.459> little<00:03:53.609> more<00:03:53.699> interesting

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
such makes it a little more interesting

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.659 
such makes it a little more interesting
so<00:03:54.900> yes<00:03:55.109> once<00:03:55.379> again<00:03:55.620> there<00:03:55.799> is<00:03:55.949> about<00:03:56.190> 20

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
so yes once again there is about 20

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.220 
so yes once again there is about 20

you<00:04:21.720> choose<00:04:22.079> what<00:04:23.009> three<00:04:23.280> spells<00:04:23.580> would<00:04:23.759> I

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
you choose what three spells would I

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.610 
you choose what three spells would I
choose<00:04:24.120> well<00:04:24.449> I<00:04:24.479> don't<00:04:24.690> know<00:04:24.870> if<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.199> catacomb

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
choose well I don't know if the catacomb

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.230 
choose well I don't know if the catacomb
is<00:04:25.770> going<00:04:25.949> to<00:04:26.039> be<00:04:26.100> too<00:04:26.280> dark<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.729> see<00:04:26.759> so<00:04:27.210> i

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
is going to be too dark to see so i

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.350 
is going to be too dark to see so i
guess<00:04:27.479> i'd<00:04:27.660> use<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.440> luminary<00:04:29.220> spell<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:29.940> i

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
guess i'd use the luminary spell and i

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.570 
guess i'd use the luminary spell and i
probably<00:04:30.690> do<00:04:30.930> something<00:04:31.380> simple<00:04:31.650> like<00:04:31.860> fire

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
probably do something simple like fire

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.240 
probably do something simple like fire
and<00:04:32.970> healing<00:04:33.470> kind<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.530> boring<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.070> pretty

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
and healing kind of boring and pretty

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.920 
and healing kind of boring and pretty
basic<00:04:35.490> but<00:04:35.699> honestly<00:04:36.180> if<00:04:36.330> i<00:04:36.419> was<00:04:36.509> going<00:04:36.660> into<00:04:36.870> a

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
basic but honestly if i was going into a

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.420 
basic but honestly if i was going into a
nearby<00:04:37.080> catacomb<00:04:37.620> not<00:04:37.830> knowing<00:04:38.190> what<00:04:38.310> to
