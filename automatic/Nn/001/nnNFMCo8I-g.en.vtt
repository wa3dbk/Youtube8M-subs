00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.360
 I think 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:43.550
 10 people in a row are stroked by a person 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:46.890
 Especially in the early stages of the stroke including the catch , individuality comes out, but the appropriate position of each 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.870
 What you need to find

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:28.960
 At that time was a catch 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.290
