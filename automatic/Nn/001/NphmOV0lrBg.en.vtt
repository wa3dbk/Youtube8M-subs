computer particular laptop computer has

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.140 
computer particular laptop computer has
a<00:00:11.670> problem<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:12.629> tracking<00:00:13.080> faces<00:00:13.799> when<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
a problem with tracking faces when the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.120 
a problem with tracking faces when the
skin<00:00:15.419> is<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.870> particularly<00:00:16.440> light<00:00:16.860> tone

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
skin is not a particularly light tone

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.490 
skin is not a particularly light tone
and<00:00:17.430> there's<00:00:18.390> some<00:00:18.510> implications<00:00:19.110> that<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
and there's some implications that the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.920 
and there's some implications that the
YouTube<00:00:19.830> video<00:00:20.160> makes<00:00:20.460> there<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.600> want<00:00:21.810> to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
YouTube video makes there we want to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.290 
YouTube video makes there we want to
check<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.260> out<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.470> ourselves<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.700> we<00:00:24.090> set

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
check this out for ourselves so we set

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.720 
check this out for ourselves so we set
up<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.840> similar<00:00:25.170> computer<00:00:25.770> that<00:00:26.220> has<00:00:26.370> face

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
up a similar computer that has face

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.430 
up a similar computer that has face
tracking<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:28.940> determine<00:00:29.940> that<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.510> it's

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.440 
tracking and determine that that it's

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.229 
tracking and determine that that it's
not<00:00:31.710> exactly<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.429> you<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.000> video

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
not exactly what you see on the video

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.720 
not exactly what you see on the video
that's<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.629> on<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.550> me

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that's going on as you can see with me

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.869 
that's going on as you can see with me
the<00:00:36.269> the<00:00:36.660> face<00:00:37.050> tracking<00:00:37.469> works<00:00:37.649> fine<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.699> this

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the the face tracking works fine in this

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.419 
the the face tracking works fine in this

with it in these lighting conditions
which<00:00:46.409> are<00:00:46.620> not<00:00:46.859> very<00:00:47.070> good<00:00:47.309> ones

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
which are not very good ones

it's<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.920> webcam<00:00:50.339> is<00:00:50.489> not<00:00:50.640> capturing<00:00:51.179> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
it's the webcam is not capturing the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.079 
it's the webcam is not capturing the
subject<00:00:51.629> properly<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:53.579> tracking

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
subject properly it's just not tracking

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.569 
subject properly it's just not tracking
the<00:00:54.149> face<00:00:54.359> at<00:00:54.569> all<00:00:54.629> but<00:00:55.499> if<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.980> now<00:00:56.129> add<00:00:56.339> some

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the face at all but if we now add some

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.689 
the face at all but if we now add some
light<00:00:57.079> some<00:00:58.079> light<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.800> front<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> face<00:00:59.399> as

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
light some light in front of the face as

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.719 
light some light in front of the face as
you<00:00:59.909> would<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.179> a<00:01:00.269> typical<00:01:00.629> room<00:01:01.489> rather<00:01:02.489> than

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
you would in a typical room rather than

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.520 
you would in a typical room rather than
having<00:01:02.909> to<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.600> all<00:01:03.780> behind<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.260> face

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
having to like be all behind the face

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.890 
having to like be all behind the face
and<00:01:05.520> just<00:01:05.670> move<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> little<00:01:06.150> bit

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.670 

it's<00:01:12.210> capturing<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:16.330> should<00:01:16.510> do<00:01:16.600> this<00:01:16.750> that's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
it's capturing we should do this that's

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.770 
it's capturing we should do this that's
gonna<00:01:17.920> do<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.250> yeah<00:01:18.700> that's<00:01:19.420> gonna<00:01:19.570> do<00:01:19.750> it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
gonna do it yeah that's gonna do it

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
gonna do it yeah that's gonna do it
that's<00:01:20.140> gonna<00:01:20.320> do

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
that's gonna do

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.340 
that's gonna do
so<00:01:21.730> obviously<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.480> the<00:01:22.510> system<00:01:23.020> is<00:01:23.110> very

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
so obviously the the system is very

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.020 
so obviously the the system is very
sensitive<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:24.010> the<00:01:24.190> lighting<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.760> amount<00:01:24.970> of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
sensitive to the lighting the amount of

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.970 
sensitive to the lighting the amount of
light<00:01:25.210> on<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.420> face<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.870> it's<00:01:26.860> a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
light on the face and it's a

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.860 
light on the face and it's a
technological<00:01:27.340> limitation<00:01:28.210> there<00:01:28.630> needs<00:01:28.780> to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
technological limitation there needs to

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.940 
technological limitation there needs to
be<00:01:28.960> enough<00:01:29.260> light<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.740> capture<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:31.030> color<00:01:31.330> of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
be enough light to capture the color of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.660 
be enough light to capture the color of
the<00:01:32.950> tracked<00:01:33.340> object<00:01:34.620> not<00:01:35.620> it's<00:01:36.430> not<00:01:36.640> a

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
the tracked object not it's not a

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.220 
the tracked object not it's not a
built-in<00:01:37.270> discrimination<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.170> the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
built-in discrimination and the

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.590 
built-in discrimination and the
technology<00:01:38.710> needs<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.190> be<00:01:39.310> improved<00:01:39.730> so<00:01:40.450> that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
technology needs to be improved so that

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.150 
technology needs to be improved so that
it<00:01:40.690> can<00:01:40.840> determine<00:01:41.080> color<00:01:41.440> with<00:01:41.680> lower<00:01:41.860> light

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
it can determine color with lower light

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.990 
it can determine color with lower light
or<00:01:42.880> an<00:01:43.090> adequate<00:01:43.420> light<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.280> what<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.790> looks

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
or an adequate light so what it looks

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.360 
or an adequate light so what it looks
like<00:01:46.210> is<00:01:46.510> that<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:47.290> lighting<00:01:47.500> conditions<00:01:48.100> are

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
like is that the lighting conditions are

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.980 
like is that the lighting conditions are
very<00:01:48.610> critical<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:49.210> whether<00:01:49.390> or<00:01:49.510> not<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.780> face

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
very critical to whether or not the face

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.940 
very critical to whether or not the face
tracking<00:01:50.500> can<00:01:51.370> lock<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:51.880> on<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.660> face<00:01:52.960> that<00:01:53.800> has

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
tracking can lock in on a face that has

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.250 
tracking can lock in on a face that has
darker<00:01:54.340> stick<00:01:54.550> skin<00:01:54.820> tones<00:01:55.090> versus<00:01:56.050> later

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
darker stick skin tones versus later

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.010 
darker stick skin tones versus later
ones<00:01:56.530> it's<00:01:57.040> not<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.360> discrimination<00:01:58.360> that's

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
ones it's not a discrimination that's

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.540 
ones it's not a discrimination that's
built<00:01:59.290> into<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.620> system<00:01:59.980> it's<00:02:00.190> just<00:02:00.280> a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
built into the system it's just a

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.130 
built into the system it's just a
technological<00:02:01.180> limitation<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:01.840> they<00:02:01.960> need

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
technological limitation that they need

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.680 
technological limitation that they need
to<00:02:02.230> improve<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.610> we<00:02:03.760> would<00:02:03.880> say<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:04.300> anybody

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
to improve but we would say that anybody

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.390 
to improve but we would say that anybody
as<00:02:05.110> long<00:02:05.260> as<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.470> lighting<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.860> adequate<00:02:06.250> the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
as long as the lighting is adequate the

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.220 
as long as the lighting is adequate the
face<00:02:06.610> tracking<00:02:07.030> is<00:02:07.120> going<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.330> work<00:02:07.480> with<00:02:07.660> with

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
face tracking is going to work with with
