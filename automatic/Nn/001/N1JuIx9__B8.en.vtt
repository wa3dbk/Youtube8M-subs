00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 he had provoked since you even in 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.049
 this chronicle you say here I'm going 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.940
 speak israel's politics is 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.400
 necessarily behind including on 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.750
 internet I triggered a flood of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.030
 criwa yeah but I was convinced 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.770
 to have just defuse the bomb and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.630
 I could not imagine a little 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.060
 bunch of fools either enough be 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.820
 surrendered and paranoid to stick me 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.189
 hateful and do not come back and do not 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.869
 paranoid fragile psychiatrically 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.269
 I want to say there is a real true 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.949
 real problem on full solins with 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.059
 full of topics from elsewhere in any 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.010
 case I can tell you that this is a subject 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.690
 taboo today of conceptual paris and 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.920
 to criticize the policy not very light 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.140
 for all Jews 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.820
 Moreover, it is obviously necessary to 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.489
 to do too much honor to those who have 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.410
 bothering in role by talking about the jews 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.629
 no no there are people who are killing it have 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.100
 that that understood I was indignant 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.110
 I simply said what I said 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.250
 only to make a movie about a subject 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.350
 as serious as the choice needed 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.000
 have a little bit of talent and I have 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.739
 wanted to joke about it it's not very 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.329
 antisemitic that may think it's a 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.309
 subject too serious to be up for the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.260
 see this power to help thousands the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.229
 terrans scene I would say opportunistic and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.939
 sometimes it was bad to take it 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.140
 not very antisemitic so this is after 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.110
 they send me pictures of the shoah 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.600
 saying that's what makes you laugh 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.689
 in my mailbox that finds the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.500
 Internet messaging and especially here 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.210
 I still have a childhood friend 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.350
 that I had not had in years 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.979
 called me saying you disappointed me and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.500
 who hung up 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.759
 as long as there is one and then after there is 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.650
 the high schools mean there are the good ones 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.990
 that good people who reassures you and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.070
 who reminds you that this is 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.509
 we can laugh at everything we can laugh 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.520
 of everything and I even want to say we 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.659
 can laugh at anything with anyone 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.979
 because this sentence of desproges that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.689
 everyone is swinging she is a little 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.880
 connes because frankly if we 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.490
 had to ask for the intellectual cv 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.799
 ideological of the seven million people 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.079
 who are going to watch such a 600 miles 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.759
 who are you going to listen this midi etc 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.200
 we did not leave the hostel so he 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.520
 must I think I prefer 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.509
 think of people who understand me that at this 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.560
 that fills me is today from the east 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.869
 subject a little taboo 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.549
 ah yes that for example or even 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.470
 Islam is what we can laugh at Islam 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.930
 TV on France 2 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.730
 I will try no but no but my 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.950
 purpose what's not all of a sudden and 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.890
 look for the provoc I'm not marc 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.720
 Edward Nabe or I do not know what I 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.070
 would say a hair scratch France inter 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.570
 I wanted to say that because 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.040
 it had come down to interviews that 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.560
 shocked me when I see this 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.000
 woman there roselyne bosch shortly after the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.080
 denial maybe she's right but 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.200
 who says that those who have not cried 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.890
 before the roundup are hitler in 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.980
 power that shocks me when I see a 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.480
 number of I will go blackmail to 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.220
 the mayor I listen to the mask and the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.030
 pen of your confreres of Sunday evening 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.270
 who are still critics 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.740
 absolutely for some great for 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.880
 others these deputies finally yaya ago 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.959
 still a little intelligence and 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.220
 the mind when I hear them do not 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.520
 to be able to talk about the movie she was called 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.350
 sarah 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.760
 because they are too afraid of 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.440
 consequences of their words that can 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.490
 more cinematographically judged a movie 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.920
 I do not care about the chips they 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.480
 were going taboo subject yes it was mostly 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.300
 censorship where we end up tends on 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.790
 wii if I was not so I would say a 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.300
 a little bit crazy a bit a bit unconscious 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.980
 a little bit arrogant 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.060
 I think I'm closing my mouth for 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.570
 a good time because it sucks 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.570
 tokens anyway
