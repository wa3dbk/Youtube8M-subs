00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.510
 what a dollar this world game 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.849
 open you will control the hacker 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.190
 consortium gpa the direct competitor gta 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.309
 I think it's the most anticipated game 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.110
 the next moment they said ok 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.600
 easy released snow will be released 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.580
 briefly until some software released a 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.439
 very good training explaining about the 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.289
 game does not know who is almost ready 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.269
 beauty now the game's producer said 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.659
 that they held some things to 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.519
 released in a sequence of $ 92 per 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.550
 example who said that was there is the 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:39.769
 reynald who is creative vice president 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.719
 according to him with that 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.269
 the advance they have had on this 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.809
 extra time but at least six months of 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.429
 delay is dupont dogs many ideas that 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.019
 were not initially planned 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.449
 cuts have been implemented and that 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.940
 other great ideas can be 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.519
 used in the future game series 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.649
 he said he always has things that have 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.179
 to save for the next game is that 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.339
 they are very pleased that the 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.689
 game will present to the players 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.700
 very soon 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.770
 he said he has some ideas for 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.109
 their sequence some ideas that they 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.009
 could not put in that game some 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:15.829
 things that would not make so much difference 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.640
 but others that were emerging 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.439
 naturally and were glaring differences 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.679
 which could totally change the 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.329
 gameplay watchdogs now man I do not 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.679
 I agree very much with this, I do not think 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.840
 It's so if you have an idea. 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.969
 sensational a guard was after only 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.979
 now because the process of creating the 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:37.369
 close to 2 may have other ideas is 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.259
 now dude you have to record your 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.509
 competitors now that hot dog has to 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.429
 prove that it might be better then 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.380
 the concord in this business get together 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.929
 holding something to be a version 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.240
 because who knows neither has a second 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.649
 version will be the first national force 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.659
 but I 'm posting here dollars I think 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.149
 that for six months there 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.670
 analyzing the market and tuning 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.889
 refining and refining in this 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.899
 I think the game can be who knows 

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.899
 even more fun than gta 4 itself
