00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.539
 hello to all and all ammunition goods and honors for a whole 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.599
 new far start then this time here and we end up on playstation 3 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.060
 in our favorite lombax friend's boots a poor one for 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:31.480
 presentation of the continuation of his adventures% and on the console of sony 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.030
 is always exclusive 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.390
 for sure this one besides so in an episode that came out this week 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.030
 the crack a size with regards to its subtitling 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.829
 and that is still developed by athena sonia guaini any way one 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.300
 do not change a team of dell 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.519
 kiffer she is also for me such a good job 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.550
 indeed we will not keep the suspense for 10 minutes 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.300
 the game is a real success and one that is the graphic techniques 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.589
 you see similar beautiful colorful 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:00:59.980
 with monsters 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.420
 quite original in e 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.390
 rather well thought out and brief for 100 th 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.470
 a universe of men in which one enters easily and with especially with 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.850
 a lot of pleasure 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.710
 the story of cracking size is the direct following already the two episodes 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.250
 previous ones so 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.210
 the blow is in operation destruction finally operation destruction 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.140
 first 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.860
 the more we give it, which is always available 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.140
 sure the people and its chains to netto sharks 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.410
 and percent and so that the game take for 100 th directly begins 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.150
 directly at the end of the previous to know that the doctor rené barrieu 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.740
 rising learning lifted 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.750
 our friend of clans investigates to be able to extract 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.659
 a secret and this secret is that of the location 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:42.810
 of the big clock 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.299
 so the big clock is a little cornerstone of the scenario it's 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.250
 the focus 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.270
 a kind of machine complex rigor that is to be placed at the heart of the system 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.920
 solar in the center of the solar system in the solar system of the galaxy 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.860
 in any case the isère of our heroes 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.030
 and percent and time this big clock there is the possibility of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.960
 master the power of time that is to say that whoever master the 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.910
 big clock 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.620
 and able he is well 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.810
 2 simply 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.599
 this role 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.629
 ball musette two changed the course of time on the planets back up the 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.909
 time forward this one and so you imagine the magnets what a villain 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:16.920
 could do 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.009
 she with such power 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.369
 the adventurer has to split into two parts 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:25.169
 it's a party with the end-game buy that will alternate hanvon 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:27.399
 cutting the ratchet on one side 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.950
 then throughout my team so from the other 1 and 2 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.170
 both parties are going to be 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.479
 we feel good summer and will alternate the one on one side we will play chopsticks 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:38.799
 in a menu in a part a little bit you see on the screen the afp 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.260
 to be real action oriented 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.230
 and at the platform the clans on the other side for a part certainly 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.340
 also platform but also in reflection since they 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.170
 to our clan friend is going to be endowed with certain powers and power of time 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.779
 who will allow it and well% and 2% 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.089
 go to tell you a little bit and will allow him and well two by 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:01.070
 example 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.799
 to exchange 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.110
 to fix temporal anomalies on a planet 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.880
 or to split to be able to solve enigmas activate 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.290
 switches and that it was rare 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.560
 also return enemy projectiles with stops at the scepter 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.799
 time 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.799
 we are in another gameplay with 36 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.510
 complete with whole lampard completely redesigned and that makes it 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.159
 good because it's with the phases with the clan in the previous 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.810
 episodes 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.619
 was not frankly 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.769
 very exciting when we were alone it was not especially so the 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.539
 special underwriting you remember 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.229
 for them it was not really really 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:38.569
 the excitants get bored a little bit badly to pass it's decided the team of 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.539
 American speed are said for mayotte we stop that 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:47.239
 and we give a real acl place in class we really give him a chance in the 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.120
 Easy life 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.990
 gameplay that are clean and that are his own 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.469
 with particular purpose different from that of ratchet 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.590
 at ratchet level etc you can see it's as usual 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.180
 that is to say that it is still as happy as fast as violent armed 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.809
 of his faithful adjustable wrench 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.900
 and always picks up bolts so you can 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.509
 even and better improve his weapons buy new armor 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.509
 arm which, moreover, could improve automatically gains levels 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.720
 when you use them you'll see it account I'll use in a few 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.019
 seconds a weapon 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.719
 see in v5 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.789
 landed at the top left and who therefore a level diploma 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:28.239
 of use and so the more you use the higher level goes up and the more you earn in 

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:29.889
 power or 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.319
 in% m 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.490
 well their mission 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.660
 or in precision 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.360
 in short, it does not change 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.479
 what does not change is the possibility to go up 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.350
 experience for your hero 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.920
 and on the other hand by chomsky new game just dropped but it does not matter I 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.080
 continues to see it go from the beginning of the exam to paws 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.210
 esquirol what mean on the other hand it is the others their boots 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.219
 that julien floor at the moment 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.739
 and that allow like a sonic to actually perform several actions 

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:58.059
 like that of moving 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:01.190
 at full speed to take ramps yet accelerated 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.980
 for your green day moves is actually on track as I have you 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.060
 showed them theirs and jump two obstacles in obstacle what is 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.509
 also possible 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.940
 gege day give an example just now 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.500
 so we ended up with a lot of wacky gadgets 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.030
 as for example the lonely breakers that people outside the 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.800
 toads 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.780
 cairote you have to wait so it's a sound from his breast the body is well 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.440
 inflated 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.800
 to be able to performed 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.889
 well 1 per 100 m 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.409
 a much more powerful role and destroy as well 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.409
 more% and faster way the opponents 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.430
 also connie borough 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.480
 the country we you the territory 7 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.970
 the opportunity now to truly travel in space and say 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.229
 that they pushed the concept 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.289
 I introduced drivers much further 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.190
 by allowing raclette parties to travel like a galaxy mario 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.400
 did you find yourself in space in phases of platforms that 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.360
 sank in the phases of platforms the phases of driving 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.150
 vessel 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.010
 those who are not necessarily 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.640
 for the very successful ones but who for cons to allow you to 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.379
 to walk from planet to planet 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:06.969
 to actually recover on this planet 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:10.360
 women women forgiveness sony fate who are the friends it is this people 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.759
 pride of energetic 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.900
 who the goods when you lock them in some kind of catalyst for you 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.139
 to improve your ship but also to give it 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.129
 energy or to pass some dams on some planets so we 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.619
 ends up with the property several gameplay styles several phases of 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:30.379
 gameplay with different 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:32.129
 who he comes to fit in 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:36.349
 and gives a gaming experience that will vary completely at all ie 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:40.240
 we're never here it's because the game really varies% when it 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.919
 must 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.580
 from one character to another in the world 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.639
 from one approach to another ie there five minutes ago I was 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.919
 more in a in a phase in space after 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.630
 I found myself in a vast platform to arrive 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.749
 Justice 

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:56.819
 and now I find myself in a much more blatant phase so I 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:58.580
 must he come knocking 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.229
 opponents who throw themselves who oppose me and of course 

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:06.100
 actually break a little bit of the boss since this is 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.000
 these few words of some kind of 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 pose of very high level at the days of the degumming like that 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:12.710
 It's over 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.520
 so buy a stash 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.009
 to have for all fans of the series that was to redo it 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:19.990
 really need 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.990
 really really get on it if you liked both episodes 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.790
 previous 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.010
 it's a safe bet in rotation would take mandanda really for his 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.180
 money the game is very complete 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.660
 long enough the main adventure ends in about twenty hours 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.320
 who 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.370
 rather not bad 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.479
 much more if you ever want to explore all the planets 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:40.810
 collect all the items improve all the weapons and collectors 

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:44.159
 really lacking for their money and especially 

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:48.389
 for having sacred time package that's okay listen I think we made e the 

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:51.869
 turn of this episode redeems part time which is once again 

00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:53.470
 a good surprise 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.940
 and we are looking forward to a new start 

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.949
 see you soon obama and m
