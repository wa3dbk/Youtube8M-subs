00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
again yeah I'm not really bothered about

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.730

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
not only that i don't have the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.359 
not only that i don't have the
activators<00:01:45.630> Cliffjumper<00:01:46.380> i<00:01:46.530> really<00:01:47.130> wish<00:01:47.250> i

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
activators Cliffjumper i really wish i

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.160 
activators Cliffjumper i really wish i
did<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> activators<00:01:48.420> Cliffjumper<00:01:49.049> it

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
did have the activators Cliffjumper it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.109 
did have the activators Cliffjumper it
never<00:01:49.560> came<00:01:49.799> now<00:01:50.040> over<00:01:50.399> here<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:51.689> area<00:01:53.840> yeah

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
never came now over here in my area yeah

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.819 
never came now over here in my area yeah
but<00:01:57.119> anyway<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.170> did<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
but anyway that's what I did with the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.740 
but anyway that's what I did with the
bumblebee<00:02:00.649> it<00:02:01.649> does<00:02:02.040> transform<00:02:02.579> but<00:02:03.210> because

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
bumblebee it does transform but because

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.260 
bumblebee it does transform but because
the<00:02:03.930> paint<00:02:04.229> has<00:02:04.469> dried<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:05.340> them<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the paint has dried in them and the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.940 
the paint has dried in them and the
thickness<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.680> plastic<00:02:08.190> has<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:08.520> changed

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
thickness of the plastic has now changed

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.860 
thickness of the plastic has now changed
it<00:02:10.950> doesn't<00:02:11.490> really<00:02:11.640> fit<00:02:11.970> together<00:02:12.300> together

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it doesn't really fit together together

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.460 
it doesn't really fit together together
very<00:02:13.770> well<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:15.330> dimensions<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> figure

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
very well the dimensions on the figure

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.850 
very well the dimensions on the figure
has<00:02:16.650> changed<00:02:17.250> because<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.700> paint<00:02:17.970> has

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
has changed because the paint has

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.380 
has changed because the paint has
changed<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> thickness<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.610> plastic<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
changed the thickness of the plastic and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.840 
changed the thickness of the plastic and
has<00:02:21.990> altered<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.890> way<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> figure<00:02:23.670> goes

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
has altered the way that the figure goes

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.680 
has altered the way that the figure goes
together<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.540> some<00:02:25.380> panels<00:02:25.950> are<00:02:26.070> morph<00:02:26.280> I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
together and some panels are morph I

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
together and some panels are morph I
painted<00:02:27.690> thicker<00:02:27.930> than<00:02:28.080> others<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:28.560> it

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
painted thicker than others so it

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.100 
painted thicker than others so it
doesn't<00:02:29.070> really<00:02:29.700> go<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> get<00:02:30.300> together<00:02:30.630> very

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
doesn't really go to get together very

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.260 
doesn't really go to get together very
well<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:33.060> as<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.480> can<00:02:33.570> see<00:02:34.940> I've<00:02:35.940> just

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
well but as you can see I've just

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.790 
well but as you can see I've just
painted<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> Cliffjumper<00:02:37.440> colors

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
painted it in the Cliffjumper colors

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.780 
painted it in the Cliffjumper colors
with<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.100> gray<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.370> red<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.740> that's<00:02:40.790> really

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
with the gray and red and that's really

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:50.030 
with the gray and red and that's really
it<00:02:44.690> that's<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.510> anyway<00:02:49.080> that's<00:02:49.800> it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
it that's just it so anyway that's it

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.620 
it that's just it so anyway that's it
