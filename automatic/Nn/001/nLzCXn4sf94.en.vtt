space above that line that was the hopes
anyways<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:41.280> looking<00:00:41.550> pretty<00:00:41.579> good<00:00:42.410> as

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
you can see I've got it hooked up to an

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.330 
you can see I've got it hooked up to an
old<00:00:45.420> camelback<00:00:45.960> bag<00:00:46.170> which<00:00:46.440> I'd<00:00:46.860> quit<00:00:47.129> using

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
for a long time because I really don't

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.840

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
these quick disconnects on it if you

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.130 
these quick disconnects on it if you

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.100 
lose it it'll pour freely out of there
and<00:01:31.020> i'm<00:01:31.650> not<00:01:31.829> sure<00:01:32.299> if<00:01:33.299> it'll<00:01:33.509> make<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.900> looser

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and i'm not sure if it'll make it looser

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
and i'm not sure if it'll make it looser
over<00:01:34.470> time<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:34.950> we'll<00:01:35.310> see<00:01:35.460> how<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.579> works

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
over time but we'll see how that works

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.600 
over time but we'll see how that works
but<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.390> far<00:01:36.540> works<00:01:36.780> fine<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.430> filter<00:01:38.430> does

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
but so far works fine the filter does

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.850 
but so far works fine the filter does
feed<00:01:38.880> fast<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.900> three<00:01:40.200> liter<00:01:40.409> bag<00:01:40.619> will

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
feed fast that three liter bag will

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.950 
feed fast that three liter bag will
impede<00:01:41.130> into<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.369> thing<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.850> probably<00:01:42.750> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
impede into that thing and probably a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.210 
impede into that thing and probably a
minute<00:01:43.259> maybe<00:01:43.470> less<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:46.619> wouldn't<00:01:47.040> matter

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
minute maybe less and it wouldn't matter

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.830 
minute maybe less and it wouldn't matter
anyways<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.970> good<00:01:48.060> enough<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.360> me<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
anyways it's good enough for me the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.510 
anyways it's good enough for me the
product<00:01:49.439> idea<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:49.950> being<00:01:50.280> able<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> just

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

mines<00:02:08.700> got<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.879> really<00:02:09.060> good<00:02:09.179> MSR<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:09.929> that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
mines got a really good MSR one that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.730 
mines got a really good MSR one that
we've<00:02:10.200> used<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.590> lot<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:12.480> only<00:02:12.690> downfall<00:02:12.930> of

we've used a lot the only downfall of
these<00:02:14.190> water<00:02:14.430> filters<00:02:14.820> are<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.390> about<00:02:15.720> any

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
these water filters are just about any

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.820 
these water filters are just about any
water<00:02:16.380> filter<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.120> one<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.750> doesn't<00:02:19.380> fight

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
water filter is one it doesn't fight

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.220 
water filter is one it doesn't fight
against<00:02:20.070> viruses<00:02:20.460> but<00:02:20.910> my<00:02:21.480> area<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:21.930> anywhere

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230

that<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.440> go<00:02:22.680> viruses<00:02:23.430> aren't<00:02:23.610> particularly<00:02:24.390> a

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
that I go viruses aren't particularly a

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.070 
that I go viruses aren't particularly a
problem<00:02:24.620> if<00:02:25.620> they<00:02:25.710> were<00:02:25.920> I've<00:02:26.190> always<00:02:26.400> got<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
problem if they were I've always got the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.510 
problem if they were I've always got the
water<00:02:28.080> purification<00:02:28.530> tablets<00:02:28.860> i<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:29.370> use

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
water purification tablets i can use

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.120 
water purification tablets i can use
overnight<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:31.170> i<00:02:31.200> could<00:02:31.440> filter<00:02:31.680> through<00:02:31.980> this

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
overnight so i could filter through this

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.180 
overnight so i could filter through this
and<00:02:32.340> then<00:02:32.460> filter<00:02:32.850> through<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:34.410> then

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
and then filter through that and then

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.730 
and then filter through that and then
freezing<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.030> problem<00:02:36.570> that's<00:02:37.230> probably<00:02:37.500> my

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
freezing is a problem that's probably my

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.220 
freezing is a problem that's probably my
biggest<00:02:37.950> concern<00:02:38.490> where<00:02:38.730> I'm<00:02:38.880> at<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:39.990> in<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
biggest concern where I'm at but in the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.630 
biggest concern where I'm at but in the
wintertime<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.740> generally<00:02:41.190> don't<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.490> too

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
wintertime I generally don't have too

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.930 
wintertime I generally don't have too
much<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.030> problem<00:02:42.950> melting<00:02:43.950> snow<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.460> could

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
much of a problem melting snow I could

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.360 
much of a problem melting snow I could
just<00:02:45.120> take<00:02:45.390> more<00:02:45.690> fuel<00:02:45.990> if<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.260> had<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.710> or<00:02:46.980> at

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
just take more fuel if I had to or at

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.750 
just take more fuel if I had to or at
night<00:02:47.550> i'm<00:02:47.820> usually<00:02:48.030> building<00:02:48.630> fires<00:02:49.520> so<00:02:50.520> for

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
night i'm usually building fires so for

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.460 
night i'm usually building fires so for
me<00:02:50.940> it's<00:02:51.180> not<00:02:51.240> too<00:02:51.480> much<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.780> problem<00:02:51.930> i<00:02:52.290> can

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
me it's not too much of a problem i can

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.860 
me it's not too much of a problem i can
boil<00:02:52.770> lots<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.460> water<00:02:53.670> because<00:02:53.970> i'm<00:02:54.450> building

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
boil lots of water because i'm building

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
boil lots of water because i'm building
a<00:02:55.050> fire<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.970> anyways<00:02:56.970> there<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.450> go<00:02:57.770> so<00:02:58.770> your

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
a fire so anyways there you go so your

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.280 
a fire so anyways there you go so your
water<00:02:59.010> filter<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.700> think<00:03:00.240> it's<00:03:00.390> certainly<00:03:01.050> a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
water filter I think it's certainly a

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.900 
water filter I think it's certainly a
good<00:03:01.470> Preppers<00:03:01.920> tool<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.370> think<00:03:02.640> it's<00:03:02.790> an

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
good Preppers tool I think it's an

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.270 
good Preppers tool I think it's an
excellent<00:03:03.060> backpacking<00:03:03.870> device<00:03:04.190> but<00:03:05.190> yeah

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
