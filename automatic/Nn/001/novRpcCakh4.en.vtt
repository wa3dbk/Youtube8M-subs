 above his head with both hands 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.020
 obstruction in the verb alignment it's 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.240
 the impression of giving 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.680
 bend backwards pressing a 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.630

 an opponent in the lineup 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.100
 referee uses both his hands as 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.100
 to push a player in front of him 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.480
 and here are other obstruction gestures 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.040
 in the running game cross arms in front 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.949

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.050
 scissors open out of play on rock or maul 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.180
 shoulders parallel the sideline 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.370
 bratton pointing his finger down 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.830
 hand making a half circle is not a 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.650
 said the referee shows the number 10 with 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.210
 his fingers plating referee time in 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.210
 forearm and directs him to his account 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.270

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.430

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.860
 flattened ball into the goal 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.539
 the referee shows a space between his two 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.289
 arm to mean that the ball has 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.289
 not touched the ground 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.210

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.979
 other episodes planned for the moment 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.110
