00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.960
 Hi, people today. I'm here at home. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.099

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960
 because she invited me to take a 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.789
 Afternoon coffee is clear when I say I see 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.470
 here to prepare a coffee and also a 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.960
 very special recipe since the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.449
 movies do not suit is a lemon cookie 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 amazing that it gets super cute continuous 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.969
 and hodel procurator 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:35.430
 come on let's go 150 grams of customers 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:39.500
 half a cup of butter tea a 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.210
 cup of sugar crystal tea an egg 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.640
 shavings of 2 million 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.030
 two cups of wheat flour 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.000
 and half a teaspoon of baking powder 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.250
 so of course the first thing is to use that 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.870
 the butter already at room temperature 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.660
 Are you leaving, she talks about the refrigerator? 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.719
 corinthians then we will put 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.700
 this whole quartz package that goes 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.450
 make this cook a lot nicer 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.450
 different. 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:20.640
 I do not know if it's never caused it is 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.640
 different from that traditional 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.460
 sugar to know more of the link is more hard 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.340
 He's cute, he melts in his mouth here to 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.619
 people be a cookie but the American 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.340
 cook is the same thing inclusive 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.250
 American 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.750
 now that it's just fine to turn a 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.020
 briefcase ready have seen the boy had 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.710
 Right now pass me by and hiss and solo 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.710
 This can play in here. 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.600
 now here is just mixing to incorporate 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.600
 good 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.909
 I did not love sugar and it came back to me. 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.680
 notify crystal because it leaves what 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.580
 more delicious but you want it can be 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.580
 refined also throw it all away 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.370
 Do you want to be a little bit longer? 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.560
 natural can use the legal massago sugar 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.810
 he served brown sugar he will give a 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.000
 I like sugarcane more and what's going to stay 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.980
 a little bit dark but also in the but already 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.629
 I talked to her a lot. 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:34.970
 so it hits a red 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:44.870
 I take a new line overcoming the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:44.870
 poet's experience the cake in hand the grandmother 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:51.989
 neither son 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:55.079
 Let's put in a lemon shaving 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.489
 of light lemon andrÃ©s is that race 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.159
 a lot because you can not pick up the white 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.159
 is not giving a shave so strong for 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.840
 so if you want you can also do 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.599
 with an angled air, or only the vanilla knows the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.629
 everything make is the flavor of the year you me 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.720
 so choose you shave or white 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:21.230
 bitter sells understood when to do 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.230
 anything 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.450
 now here 's the smell of lemon 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.400
 awesome awesome grandson 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.080
 now I'm going to add that the flour 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.680
 wheat slowly 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.680
 mix 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.810
 our navels and 12 of Israel also do not 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.569
 have patience but with what is legal of 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.750
 you know but then you leave that 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.970
 Smell or the house will be ours here I 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.830
 I 'll add the baking powder 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.330
 it will give a big girl in the ass that 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.550
 I'll leave the son, too. 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.190
 Enjoy and join the chocolate 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.120
 chocolate you are optional its use if 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.540
 you want 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.050
 ok if you want to put the queue is nuts 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:09.150
 chestnut and the chocolate will is just 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.150
 to make it more delicious, huh? 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:25.030
 the recipe to mix by summarizing the team 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:28.630
 owner received and if you want you can 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.210
 freezing is legal and can not freeze the 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.400
 Cookies already ready one day and you can not 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.720
 freeze tells if you want you can roll 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.720
 can not frozen film 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:44.330
 the wolf not what do we people do 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.310
 connect with the salt thing and there in the 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.230
 dossier gives you a broken tooth so the 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.050
 sugar and we also 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.550
 amount of butter tended to remain 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.770
 much lighter 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.720
 so I'm still going to add a 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.490
 bit of green dye but it is 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.980
 optional if you do not want to put 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.450
 Angels need and now we will 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.050
 mixing the dye does not have a 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.860
 just put amount going feeling 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.860
 to see if the thing is going to get 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.650
 This way it will get prettier but it will not 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.200
 will not affect taste in adapting if not 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.460
 you have at home does not have 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.930
 problem 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.090
 It's a delight in the same way without 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.310
 dye with dye 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.940
 so now that you're green is just the 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.590
 We roll c'mon c'mon sound okay 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.860
 with butter or we do when it goes 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.660
 to do party brigadeiro was with a 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:44.660
 butter to be able to make 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:49.190
 the balls are careful to make some 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:56.690
 balls not too large because they do not 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:59.600
 had a great package give a 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.220
 Just a little bit so he can not stay 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.740
 much to the team as yeast and goes 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.540
 grow still so if you let him 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.020
 too high and will turn a cookie and 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:14.330
 link they know I think it's great 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:16.310
 one thing is the way it was before 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.640
 so that's why I do not have 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.190
 I will do more if you do not have one 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.440
 Typhoon into flour or use parchment paper 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.960
 so now just take the oven to 180 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.240
 degrees and plus or minus 20 or 30 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.730
 minutes gives a peek if the fund're 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.550
 golden gold when it is time to get there 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.280
 let it cool to be able to eat more 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.420
 With me, son, will you have a legend? 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.420
 It's chilling a little love. 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:59.520
 I do not know where my start melts in the bag 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.759
