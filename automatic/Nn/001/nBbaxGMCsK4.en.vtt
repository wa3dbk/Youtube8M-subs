00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.800
 Processor 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.249
 the 1.2 gigahertz quadcore processor 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.899
 the A1 810 does its job well and even 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.370
 he does it completely graphically 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.710
 not so bad 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.819
 internally there is 16 gigabytes of storage space 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.680

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.290
 real one can be expanded by 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.259
 using a micro sd card

 everything is displayed on a 7.9 inch 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:17.110
 eps panel with a resolution that something 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.000
 on the lower side there is 1024 at 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.430
 768 pixels 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.439
 it runs on the latest version of 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.420
 Android namely four point two point 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.009
 two and here are a number 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.350
 adjustments made 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.759
 however, these are at least the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.740
 notification bar in example two 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.659
 different functions and there are one 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.149
 number of widgets an app by default 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.829

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.179
 number of useful gestures 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.829
 for example you can put five fingers on it 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.380
 put the screen down so that the tablet 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.929
 automatically comes out of the standby mode, there 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.149
 is a 5 megapixel camera present where 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.369
 you should not expect too much from it 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.530
 nice to take a quick snapshot 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.149
 under good light conditions 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.030

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.429

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.340
 from the device itself 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.100
 The A1 810 is really meant as one 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.260
 all-round compact tablet 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.480
