I've<00:00:10.110> got<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.349> few<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.830> see<00:00:11.040> it's<00:00:11.190> got<00:00:11.309> bits<00:00:11.550> of

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
I've got a few you see it's got bits of

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.419 
I've got a few you see it's got bits of
algae<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.389> at<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.509> moment<00:00:12.690> see<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.530> I

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
algae on it at the moment see that and I

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.039 
algae on it at the moment see that and I
will<00:00:14.610> have<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:15.030> hope<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.540> blow<00:00:15.809> that

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
will have to hope you just blow that

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.550 
will have to hope you just blow that
clean<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.770> said<00:00:17.279> as<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:18.180> try<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.140> know<00:00:19.170> solve

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
clean I said as I try and you know solve

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.679 
clean I said as I try and you know solve
this<00:00:19.710> problem<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.340> nitrates<00:00:20.789> are<00:00:20.910> back<00:00:21.359> down

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
this problem the nitrates are back down

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.109 
this problem the nitrates are back down
now<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.080> about<00:00:22.260> I'm<00:00:22.949> really<00:00:23.670> naught<00:00:23.880> point

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
now to about I'm really naught point

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.950 
now to about I'm really naught point
funny<00:00:25.340> which<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:27.060> really<00:00:27.359> good<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.810> know<00:00:27.930> I

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
funny which it's really good you know I

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.820 
funny which it's really good you know I
fed<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.500> fish<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> little<00:00:29.070> bit<00:00:29.189> less<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:31.590> I

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
fed the fish a little bit less and I

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650 
fed the fish a little bit less and I
think<00:00:32.070> because<00:00:32.219> whatever<00:00:32.610> was<00:00:32.969> decomposing

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
think because whatever was decomposing

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.200 
think because whatever was decomposing
possibly<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> anemone<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:35.579> how<00:00:35.760> has<00:00:36.000> now

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
possibly the anemone and see how has now

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.880 
possibly the anemone and see how has now
probably<00:00:36.750> decomposed<00:00:39.500> it's<00:00:40.500> there's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
probably decomposed it's there's

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.350 
probably decomposed it's there's
naturally<00:00:41.430> lowering<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> did<00:00:42.210> do

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
naturally lowering but I did do

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.690 
naturally lowering but I did do
something<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.960> sort<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.980> I'll<00:00:44.129> show<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.520> in

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
something to sort that I'll show you in

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.580 
something to sort that I'll show you in
a<00:00:44.789> second<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.579> yeah<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.440> everything<00:00:49.440> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
a second but and yeah so everything you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.560 
a second but and yeah so everything you
know<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.160> guess<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.210> trials

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
know it's just a guess this is trials

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.060 
know it's just a guess this is trials
and<00:00:51.690> tribulations<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.500> running<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> reef<00:00:53.039> tank

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and tribulations of running a reef tank

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.880 
and tribulations of running a reef tank
really<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.840> guess<00:00:55.410> you're<00:00:55.559> always<00:00:55.649> gonna

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
really and I guess you're always gonna

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.700 
really and I guess you're always gonna
come<00:00:56.100> across<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.610> from<00:00:56.820> green<00:00:57.090> hair<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
come across this from green hair and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.100 
come across this from green hair and
been<00:00:58.710> bugging<00:00:59.039> me<00:00:59.270> but<00:01:00.500> yeah<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:02.280> basically<00:01:03.110> be

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
been bugging me but yeah to basically be

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.810 
been bugging me but yeah to basically be
on<00:01:04.140> top<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.250> future

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
on top of this now for the future

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.850 
on top of this now for the future
and<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.659> make<00:01:06.840> sure<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.200> even<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.590> something

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and to make sure that even if something

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.170 
and to make sure that even if something
because<00:01:08.250> yeah<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> think<00:01:08.880> you're<00:01:08.970> gonna<00:01:09.090> have

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
because yeah I think you're gonna have

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.969 
because yeah I think you're gonna have
deaths<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.659> time<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.110> time<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> tank<00:01:10.830> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
deaths from time to time in the tank you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.550 
deaths from time to time in the tank you
know<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.600> can't<00:01:12.869> get<00:01:13.020> them<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.260> which

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
know and if you can't get them out which

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.240 
know and if you can't get them out which
I<00:01:13.830> struggle<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.610> as<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.810> my<00:01:16.250> lipsticks

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
I struggle to as you see my lipsticks

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.950 
I struggle to as you see my lipsticks
doing<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.729> nice<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:18.600> she's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
doing really nice there as well she's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.039 
doing really nice there as well she's
she's<00:01:19.229> really<00:01:19.860> happy<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.600> know<00:01:21.750> if

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
she's really happy so if you you know if

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.510 
she's really happy so if you you know if
you<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.350> these<00:01:22.530> deaths<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.070> gone<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you have these deaths I have gone and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:36.859 
you have these deaths I have gone and
installed<00:01:24.890> it's<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:34.700> palace<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.540> tiny

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
installed it's just a palace but tiny

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.969 
installed it's just a palace but tiny
amount<00:01:37.350> into<00:01:37.710> star<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.509> see<00:01:39.509> how<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.720> goes

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
amount into star just to see how it goes

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.819 
amount into star just to see how it goes
and<00:01:40.979> I've<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.369> pretty<00:01:41.579> huge<00:01:42.829> phosphate

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
and I've got this pretty huge phosphate

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.030 
and I've got this pretty huge phosphate
reactor<00:01:44.840> running<00:01:45.840> there<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.590> cleaning<00:01:46.950> up

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
reactor running there just cleaning up

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.460 
reactor running there just cleaning up
the<00:01:47.189> phosphates<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.630> that's<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> action<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the phosphates so that's the action I

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.240 
the phosphates so that's the action I
take<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:51.200> noticed<00:01:52.200> also<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.530> my<00:01:52.770> calcium

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
take it I noticed also that my calcium

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.460 
take it I noticed also that my calcium
levels<00:01:53.579> were<00:01:53.670> dropping<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.119> bet<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:55.200> dosing

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
levels were dropping a bet I was dosing

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.130 
levels were dropping a bet I was dosing
this<00:01:55.770> pH<00:01:56.130> buffer<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.000> I've<00:01:57.090> decided<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.780> stop

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
this pH buffer and I've decided to stop

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.399 
this pH buffer and I've decided to stop
dosing<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.750> I'm<00:02:00.869> gonna<00:02:01.049> start

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
dosing that and I'm gonna start

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.810 
dosing that and I'm gonna start
basically<00:02:02.689> dosing<00:02:04.189> some<00:02:05.189> kind<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.399> kalkwasser

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
basically dosing some kind of kalkwasser

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.730 
basically dosing some kind of kalkwasser
instead<00:02:06.450> I'm<00:02:06.600> gonna<00:02:06.719> get<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.320> Saturday

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
instead I'm gonna get on this Saturday

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.889 
instead I'm gonna get on this Saturday
which<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.610> keep<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.940> calcium<00:02:09.330> levels<00:02:09.660> topped

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
which to keep the calcium levels topped

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.850 
which to keep the calcium levels topped
off

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
off

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.020 
off
because<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.130> went<00:02:11.280> down<00:02:11.460> they<00:02:11.610> went<00:02:11.760> down<00:02:11.880> to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
because it went down they went down to

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.750 
because it went down they went down to
250<00:02:14.780> which<00:02:15.780> basically<00:02:16.500> had<00:02:17.340> things<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.640> little

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
250 which basically had things a little

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.430 
250 which basically had things a little
bit<00:02:17.970> low<00:02:18.180> really<00:02:19.190> think<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:21.660> dosing<00:02:22.320> of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
bit low really think the that dosing of

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.520 
bit low really think the that dosing of
the<00:02:22.700> pH<00:02:23.700> buffer<00:02:23.970> was<00:02:24.270> screwing<00:02:25.230> with<00:02:25.350> my

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
the pH buffer was screwing with my

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.410 
the pH buffer was screwing with my
balance<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.040> little<00:02:26.280> bit<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.550> tank<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.090> I'm

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
balance a little bit in the tank so I'm

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.830 
balance a little bit in the tank so I'm
going<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.630> try<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:29.300> dosing<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.360> tiny<00:02:30.570> bit<00:02:30.750> of

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
going to try just dosing a tiny bit of

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.800 
going to try just dosing a tiny bit of
kalkwasser<00:02:31.230> every<00:02:32.220> day<00:02:32.430> or<00:02:32.640> multiple<00:02:32.910> 200<00:02:33.690> a

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
kalkwasser every day or multiple 200 a

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.230 
kalkwasser every day or multiple 200 a
tiny<00:02:34.170> bit<00:02:34.410> just<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:35.340> see<00:02:35.520> if<00:02:35.610> that's<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.030> best

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
tiny bit just to see if that's the best

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.510 
tiny bit just to see if that's the best
way<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.420> maintain<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:38.630> 400<00:02:39.630> levels<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.520> so

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
way to maintain it and 400 levels and so

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.840 
way to maintain it and 400 levels and so
yeah<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:42.860> I'm<00:02:43.860> not<00:02:43.920> tired<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.459> do<00:02:44.580> one<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.760> my

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
yeah just I'm not tired to do one of my

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.990 
yeah just I'm not tired to do one of my
normal<00:02:45.240> videos<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.370> as<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.520> could<00:02:47.640> see<00:02:47.700> this

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
normal videos and as you could see this

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.150 
normal videos and as you could see this
brown<00:02:48.300> stuff<00:02:48.330> there<00:02:49.970> over<00:02:50.970> here<00:02:51.739> on<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.920> rocks

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
brown stuff there over here on the rocks

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.030 
brown stuff there over here on the rocks
and<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.580> burn<00:02:54.000> everywhere<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.810> next<00:02:55.590> up<00:02:55.800> there

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
and a burn everywhere so next up there

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.820 
and a burn everywhere so next up there
do<00:02:56.310> hopefully<00:02:56.850> there<00:02:57.090> will<00:02:57.180> be<00:02:57.239> none<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.570> that

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
do hopefully there will be none of that

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.250 
do hopefully there will be none of that
I<00:02:58.860> believe<00:02:59.550> these<00:02:59.730> bio<00:03:00.270> pellets<00:03:00.720> kick<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.110> and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
I believe these bio pellets kick in and

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.890 
I believe these bio pellets kick in and
really<00:03:01.620> take<00:03:01.890> care<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.280> any<00:03:02.850> excess<00:03:03.330> nitrates

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
really take care of any excess nitrates

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.840 
really take care of any excess nitrates
should<00:03:04.080> they<00:03:04.230> occur<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.430> phosphate

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
should they occur and the phosphate

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.610 
should they occur and the phosphate
reactor<00:03:06.209> as<00:03:06.330> well<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.170> don't<00:03:07.380> see<00:03:07.500> any

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
reactor as well and I don't see any

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.040 
reactor as well and I don't see any
reason<00:03:07.890> why<00:03:08.420> shouldn't<00:03:09.420> be<00:03:09.540> back<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:09.959> the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
reason why shouldn't be back on the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.840 
reason why shouldn't be back on the
straight<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.470> narrow<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.950> thank<00:03:11.550> God<00:03:11.730> have

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
straight and narrow and thank God have

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.449 
straight and narrow and thank God have
not<00:03:12.030> really<00:03:12.300> had<00:03:12.450> any<00:03:12.800> major<00:03:13.800> problems<00:03:14.340> with

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
not really had any major problems with

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.870 
not really had any major problems with
the<00:03:14.580> corals<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.390> they're<00:03:15.690> all<00:03:16.880> looking

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
the corals so they're all looking

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.640 
the corals so they're all looking
alright<00:03:18.150> Outland<00:03:18.540> still<00:03:18.810> got<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:18.989> nice<00:03:19.260> color

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
