been baked no not really any specifics

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.970 
been baked no not really any specifics
here<00:00:21.330> I'll<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:21.930> run<00:00:22.170> them<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.439> oven<00:00:22.680> at

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
here I'll just run them in the oven at

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.540 
here I'll just run them in the oven at
maybe<00:00:23.250> 350<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.619> 20-30<00:00:25.619> minutes<00:00:25.830> maybe<00:00:26.340> turn

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
maybe 350 for 20-30 minutes maybe turn

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.390 
maybe 350 for 20-30 minutes maybe turn
it<00:00:26.609> down<00:00:26.730> let<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.090> run<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> little<00:00:27.330> hard<00:00:27.630> longer

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
it down let it run a little hard longer

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.890 
it down let it run a little hard longer
the<00:00:29.400> goal<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.789> kill<00:00:30.359> anything<00:00:30.750> that's

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
the goal is to kill anything that's

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.250 
the goal is to kill anything that's
alive<00:00:31.369> any<00:00:32.369> bacteria<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.600> also<00:00:33.719> makes<00:00:33.989> them<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
alive any bacteria it also makes them a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.250 
alive any bacteria it also makes them a
lot<00:00:34.350> more<00:00:34.410> brittle<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.730> as<00:00:36.510> they're<00:00:36.780> cooling

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
lot more brittle and as they're cooling

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.780 
lot more brittle and as they're cooling
off<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:37.980> smash<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.460> little<00:00:38.670> bit

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
off you can just smash them a little bit

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.180 
off you can just smash them a little bit
on<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> pan<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.290> I've<00:00:40.410> had<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.710> sit<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
on the pan so I've had this sit in the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.100 
on the pan so I've had this sit in the
side<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> while<00:00:41.850> because<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.600> baked<00:00:42.899> them<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
side for a while because I baked them a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
side for a while because I baked them a
while<00:00:43.290> ago<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:43.950> never<00:00:44.100> got<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.460> doing

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
while ago and just never got to doing

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:54.399 
while ago and just never got to doing
this<00:00:44.820> part<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:00.590 

so<00:00:55.409> all<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.589> need<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.769> do<00:00:58.429> put<00:00:59.429> in<00:00:59.550> maybe<00:00:59.760> about

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
so all you need to do put in maybe about

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.700 
so all you need to do put in maybe about
a<00:01:00.769> cup<00:01:01.769> or<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:06.290> put<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> coffee<00:01:07.649> grinder

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
a cup or so put it in the coffee grinder

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.450 
a cup or so put it in the coffee grinder
and<00:01:08.159> as<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.299> grinding<00:01:09.509> you<00:01:09.930> want<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.460> work

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and as it's grinding you want to work

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.249 
and as it's grinding you want to work
with<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.970> want<00:01:12.149> to<00:01:12.270> move<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.539> around<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
with it you want to move it around and

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.200 
with it you want to move it around and
try<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.649> get<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.009> finest<00:01:14.399> powder<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
try to get the finest powder that you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:43.359 
try to get the finest powder that you
can<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.190 

this<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.610> messy<00:01:45.000> thing<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.170> of

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
this is a messy thing to do with one of

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.380 
this is a messy thing to do with one of
these<00:01:47.060> but<00:01:49.399> that's<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:50.549> end<00:01:50.700> result<00:01:53.390> you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
these but that's your end result you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.840 
these but that's your end result you
have<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> bunch<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.110> dust<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.700> air

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
have a bunch of dust going in the air

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.029 
have a bunch of dust going in the air
but<00:01:57.810> you've<00:01:58.049> got<00:01:58.170> your<00:01:58.320> fine<00:01:58.500> powder<00:01:58.770> left

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
but you've got your fine powder left

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.389 
but you've got your fine powder left
behind<00:01:59.280> which<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.360> use<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.979> feed<00:02:01.979> all

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
behind which you can use to feed all

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:53.210 
behind which you can use to feed all
sorts<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.939> critters

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.160 

the<00:02:54.220> powder<00:02:54.459> it's<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.329> everywhere<00:02:55.659> I<00:02:55.900> can't

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
the powder it's in everywhere I can't

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:22.240 
the powder it's in everywhere I can't
even<00:02:56.230> pull<00:02:56.439> this<00:02:56.500> off<00:02:56.680> with<00:02:56.829> one<00:02:56.980> hand

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.610 

my<00:03:23.250> jar<00:03:23.490> is<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> little<00:03:24.090> more<00:03:24.240> than<00:03:24.330> half-full

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
my jar is a little more than half-full

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.170 
my jar is a little more than half-full
and<00:03:25.620> I've<00:03:25.770> used<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.220> lot<00:03:26.340> more<00:03:26.400> than<00:03:26.790> half<00:03:27.000> of

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
and I've used a lot more than half of

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.200 
and I've used a lot more than half of
what<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.390> had<00:03:28.550> interesting<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.640> see<00:03:29.820> if<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.030> can

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
what I had interesting to see if I can

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.900 
what I had interesting to see if I can
manage<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.720> put<00:03:31.020> all<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.590> this<00:03:31.860> in<00:03:32.310> there<00:03:32.550> and

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.590 

there<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:35.940> go<00:03:36.410> my<00:03:38.120> had<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.240> thing<00:03:39.420> pretty

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
there you go my had this thing pretty

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.530 
there you go my had this thing pretty
filled<00:03:39.900> up<00:03:40.080> at<00:03:40.380> least<00:03:40.560> halfway<00:03:41.540> with

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
filled up at least halfway with

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.710 
filled up at least halfway with
eggshells<00:03:43.130> yeah<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.730> filled<00:03:45.360> up<00:03:45.450> one<00:03:45.630> of

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
eggshells yeah and it filled up one of

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.920 
eggshells yeah and it filled up one of
these<00:03:45.840> little<00:03:46.230> testy<00:03:47.100> toes<00:03:47.280> drivers<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.120> then

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
these little testy toes drivers and then

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.850 
these little testy toes drivers and then
I<00:03:49.020> had<00:03:49.200> maybe<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.130> don't<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.540> just<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.860> little

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
I had maybe I don't know just a little

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.000 
I had maybe I don't know just a little
bit<00:03:52.980> left<00:03:53.160> this<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.270> jar<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.570> I<00:03:54.780> had<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:55.680> I

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
bit left this is a jar that I had and I

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.170 
bit left this is a jar that I had and I
just<00:03:56.190> topped<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.520> off<00:03:56.640> so<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:58.459> basically<00:03:59.459> all

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
just topped it off so you basically all

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.690 
just topped it off so you basically all
of<00:04:00.390> this<00:04:00.540> fit<00:04:01.440> into<00:04:01.650> one<00:04:01.860> tiny<00:04:02.130> little<00:04:02.280> thing

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
of this fit into one tiny little thing

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.810 
of this fit into one tiny little thing
it<00:04:03.300> really<00:04:03.830> really<00:04:04.830> compresses<00:04:05.160> down<00:04:05.310> once

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
it really really compresses down once

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.310
