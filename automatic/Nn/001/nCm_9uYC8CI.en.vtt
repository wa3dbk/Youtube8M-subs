glow which I like so I'm wearing it
right<00:01:51.030> now<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.630> could<00:01:51.810> probably<00:01:52.290> tell

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
right now if you could probably tell

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.149 
right now if you could probably tell
because<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.340> did<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.640> demo<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:55.159> love

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
because I just did the demo and I love

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.219 
because I just did the demo and I love
the<00:01:56.399> fact<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.939> makes<00:01:57.390> my<00:01:57.600> skin<00:01:57.659> look<00:01:57.899> so

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the fact that it makes my skin look so

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.050 
the fact that it makes my skin look so
healthy<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.799> glowing<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.820> very

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
healthy and glowing and it's very

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.730 
healthy and glowing and it's very
different<00:02:00.270> from<00:02:00.540> my<00:02:00.750> normal<00:02:00.780> color<00:02:01.409> stee

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
different from my normal color stee

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740 
different from my normal color stee
whipped<00:02:02.310> cream<00:02:02.640> foundation<00:02:03.210> which<00:02:03.360> gives<00:02:03.570> my

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
whipped cream foundation which gives my

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.450 
whipped cream foundation which gives my
face<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.079> more<00:02:04.259> matte<00:02:04.439> finish<00:02:04.860> this

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
face a more matte finish this

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310 
face a more matte finish this
that<00:02:05.580> reminds<00:02:06.000> me<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.330> Lummi<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:07.140> thing

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
that reminds me of the Lummi one thing

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.139 
that reminds me of the Lummi one thing
that<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.500> don't<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:08.100> about<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.819> it

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
that I don't like about this is that it

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.590 
that I don't like about this is that it
has<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.979> clean<00:02:10.979> smell<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.420> a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
has this clean smell as in it's like a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.660 
has this clean smell as in it's like a
methanol<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.560> smell<00:02:13.860> which<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.220> know<00:02:14.280> some

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
methanol kind of smell which I know some

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.400 
methanol kind of smell which I know some
people<00:02:14.790> like<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.360> don't<00:02:15.600> really<00:02:15.750> fancy<00:02:16.020> it

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
people like but I don't really fancy it

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.080 
people like but I don't really fancy it
but<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:16.650> when<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.920> goes<00:02:17.130> onto<00:02:17.370> your<00:02:17.610> face<00:02:17.819> it

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
but but when it goes onto your face it

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.780 
but but when it goes onto your face it
looks<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.110> beautiful<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.920> glowing<00:02:20.490> and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
looks so beautiful and glowing and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.640 
looks so beautiful and glowing and
healthy<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.390> luminous<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.440> very

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
healthy and luminous it's a very

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.280 
healthy and luminous it's a very
lightweight<00:02:23.120> foundation<00:02:24.120> if<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.050> could<00:02:25.200> have

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
lightweight foundation if you could have

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.690 
lightweight foundation if you could have
guessed<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.650> right<00:02:25.950> now<00:02:26.130> because<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.610> just

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
guessed that right now because it's just

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.210 
guessed that right now because it's just
meant<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.239> really<00:02:27.690> refine<00:02:28.560> your<00:02:28.709> face<00:02:28.980> and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
meant to really refine your face and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.460 
meant to really refine your face and
make<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.489> look<00:02:29.610> naturally<00:02:30.180> beautiful<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:31.319> if

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
make it look naturally beautiful but if

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.290 
make it look naturally beautiful but if
you<00:02:31.620> don't<00:02:31.830> think<00:02:32.069> it's<00:02:32.250> enough<00:02:32.730> when<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.060> put

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
you don't think it's enough when you put

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.870 
you don't think it's enough when you put
one<00:02:33.810> side<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.950> foundation<00:02:35.520> then<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.760> can

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
one side of foundation then you can

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.270 
one side of foundation then you can
always<00:02:36.030> go<00:02:36.150> ahead<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.690> put<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> second<00:02:37.410> coat<00:02:37.560> of

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
always go ahead and put a second coat of

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.770 
always go ahead and put a second coat of
foundation<00:02:38.850> if<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.120> makes<00:02:39.330> sense<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.720> that

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
foundation if that makes sense and that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.720 
foundation if that makes sense and that
is<00:02:39.870> what<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.140> did<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.130> doesn't<00:02:41.430> feel

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
is what I did like it doesn't feel

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.120 
is what I did like it doesn't feel
heavier<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.480> any<00:02:42.750> way<00:02:43.260> I'm<00:02:43.500> actually<00:02:43.739> wearing

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
heavier in any way I'm actually wearing

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.920 
heavier in any way I'm actually wearing
it<00:02:44.310> right<00:02:44.400> now<00:02:44.580> my<00:02:45.060> skin<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.360> feels<00:02:45.630> so

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
it right now my skin just feels so

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.810 
it right now my skin just feels so
breathable<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.739> just<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.130> myself<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.790> I

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
breathable and just like myself so I
