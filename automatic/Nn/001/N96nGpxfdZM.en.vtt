00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
and finally which is probably the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.509 
and finally which is probably the
hardest<00:03:14.720> one<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.500> i<00:03:15.560> was<00:03:15.590> put<00:03:15.919> on<00:03:16.010> hold<00:03:16.040> that's

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.379 
hardest one and i was put on hold that's
great<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.079> finally<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.949> remaining<00:03:19.639> piece<00:03:20.090> is

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
great and finally the remaining piece is

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:29.110 
great and finally the remaining piece is
the<00:03:21.230> guns<00:03:22.599> which<00:03:23.599> I<00:03:25.750> can<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:26.840> see<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:28.120> all

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
right I hate how that looks so i'm going

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.290 
right I hate how that looks so i'm going
to<00:03:30.859> change<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.540> how<00:03:32.540> i<00:03:33.849> change<00:03:34.849> it

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.440

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
the far like that all right I guess I

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.190 
the far like that all right I guess I
like<00:03:43.600> that<00:03:43.780> kind<00:03:44.710> of<00:03:44.830> simultaneous

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
like that kind of simultaneous

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.559
