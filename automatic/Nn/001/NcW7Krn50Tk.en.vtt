part series or two part series and what

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.460 
part series or two part series and what
I've<00:03:45.950> found<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.459> that<00:03:46.490> people<00:03:47.260> have<00:03:48.260> the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
I've found is that people have the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.740 
I've found is that people have the
attention<00:03:48.740> span<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.459> gnat<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:51.500> at<00:03:51.890> about

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
attention span of a gnat so at about

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.820 
attention span of a gnat so at about
