00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
what to do with it I often will suggest

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
what to do with it I often will suggest
adding<00:00:47.610> some<00:00:47.910> color<00:00:48.150> to<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.420> hair<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.900> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
adding some color to the hair just to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.229 
adding some color to the hair just to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
make it more interesting and I always

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.030 
make it more interesting and I always
believe<00:00:51.720> that<00:00:51.750> layering<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.470> hair<00:00:52.650> will<00:00:52.830> keep

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
believe that layering the hair will keep

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.399 
believe that layering the hair will keep
movement<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.790> hair<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.269> that's<00:00:54.449> always<00:00:55.080> a

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
movement in the hair and that's always a

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.009 
movement in the hair and that's always a
good<00:00:55.559> idea<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:56.250> you've<00:00:57.180> grown<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.479> hair<00:00:57.659> long
