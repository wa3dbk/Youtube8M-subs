00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.489 
finish to make this and the thermo-pile
is<00:00:45.789> to<00:00:46.789> bleed<00:00:46.999> away<00:00:47.179> firs<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:48.170> blue<00:00:48.320> a<00:00:48.350> low

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:48.499 
is to bleed away firs the blue a low

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.410 
is to bleed away firs the blue a low
ingot<00:00:48.949> and<00:00:49.129> then<00:00:49.519> a<00:00:49.550> bit<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:49.820> copper<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:50.239> tin

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
ingot and then a bit of copper and tin

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.470 
ingot and then a bit of copper and tin
around<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:51.070> I'll<00:00:52.070> give<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:52.339> a<00:00:52.489> thermo-pile<00:00:53.179> so

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
around it I'll give you a thermo-pile so

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.290 
around it I'll give you a thermo-pile so
they're<00:00:53.659> both<00:00:54.760> going<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:55.850> be<00:00:55.940> using<00:00:56.179> up<00:00:56.269> your

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
they're both going to be using up your

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.660 
they're both going to be using up your
neckline<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.469> gray<00:00:57.679> is<00:00:57.949> used<00:00:58.249> in<00:00:58.429> pretty

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
neckline and the gray is used in pretty

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.239 
neckline and the gray is used in pretty
much<00:00:58.730> everything<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.539> do<00:00:59.780> with<00:00:59.809> blue<00:01:00.249> blue

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
much everything to do with blue blue

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
much everything to do with blue blue
electric<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.780> you'll<00:01:03.769> find<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:04.190> through<00:01:05.059> it

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
electric and you'll find you through it

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.330 
electric and you'll find you through it
quite<00:01:05.750> quickly<00:01:05.960> once<00:01:06.470> you<00:01:06.620> start<00:01:06.920> using<00:01:07.070> it

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
quite quickly once you start using it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.370 
quite quickly once you start using it
now<00:01:11.440> over<00:01:12.440> here<00:01:13.120> the<00:01:14.120> solar<00:01:14.390> panel<00:01:14.780> obviously

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
now over here the solar panel obviously

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.970 
now over here the solar panel obviously
as<00:01:15.860> with<00:01:16.490> most<00:01:16.670> solar<00:01:16.970> panels<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.630> needs<00:01:17.980> a

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
as with most solar panels it needs a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.700 
as with most solar panels it needs a
decent<00:01:19.850> amount<00:01:19.910> of<00:01:20.180> light<00:01:20.450> on<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.590> it

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
decent amount of light on it so that it

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.140 
decent amount of light on it so that it
will<00:01:21.860> work<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:23.980> if<00:01:24.980> we<00:01:25.400> have<00:01:25.760> a<00:01:25.790> look<00:01:25.940> at<00:01:26.060> this

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
will work and if we have a look at this

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.210 
will work and if we have a look at this
with<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.540> voltmeter<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.320> voltmeter<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:28.010> red

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
with the voltmeter the voltmeter is red

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.400 
with the voltmeter the voltmeter is red
powers<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:30.350> electric<00:01:30.770> measuring<00:01:31.280> tool<00:01:32.410> you

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
powers the electric measuring tool you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.180 
powers the electric measuring tool you
can<00:01:33.590> see<00:01:33.890> here<00:01:34.190> that<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:35.620> solar<00:01:36.620> panel<00:01:36.710> has<00:01:37.160> a

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
can see here that this solar panel has a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.250 
can see here that this solar panel has a
hundred<00:01:37.640> volts<00:01:38.000> stored<00:01:38.750> in<00:01:38.900> there<00:01:39.050> at<00:01:39.170> the

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
hundred volts stored in there at the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.140 
hundred volts stored in there at the
moment<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.770> it's<00:01:40.280> not<00:01:40.520> generating<00:01:41.060> any

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
moment and it's not generating any

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.540 
moment and it's not generating any
current<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.620> reason<00:01:42.950> for<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.490> that

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
current and the reason for that is that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.000 
current and the reason for that is that
once<00:01:44.150> it<00:01:44.330> fills<00:01:44.540> up<00:01:44.840> it's<00:01:45.440> got<00:01:45.590> nowhere<00:01:45.800> for

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
once it fills up it's got nowhere for

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.530 
once it fills up it's got nowhere for
the<00:01:46.070> power<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.460> go<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:46.880> if<00:01:46.970> we<00:01:47.060> put<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.300> battery

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
the power to go so if we put a battery

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.920 
the power to go so if we put a battery
next<00:01:48.050> to<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:48.760> we<00:01:49.760> should<00:01:49.820> see<00:01:50.210> this<00:01:50.480> battery

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
next to it we should see this battery

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.870 
next to it we should see this battery
start<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:53.170> increase<00:01:54.170> its<00:01:54.440> charge<00:01:54.800> and<00:01:55.520> if<00:01:55.700> we

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
start to increase its charge and if we

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.810 
start to increase its charge and if we
test<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.720> solar<00:01:57.020> panel<00:01:57.320> now<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:58.400> can<00:01:58.610> see

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
test the solar panel now you can see

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.440 
test the solar panel now you can see
there<00:01:59.060> we've<00:01:59.990> got<00:02:00.020> per<00:02:00.910> 1.9<00:02:01.910> amps<00:02:04.240> that<00:02:05.240> it's

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
there we've got per 1.9 amps that it's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.389 
there we've got per 1.9 amps that it's
generating<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:08.200> about<00:02:09.200> 1<00:02:09.470> amp<00:02:09.649> is<00:02:09.860> going<00:02:10.160> over

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
generating and about 1 amp is going over

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.170 
generating and about 1 amp is going over
to<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.700> battery<00:02:11.330> box<00:02:11.950> so

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.369 

that's<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.110> solar<00:02:16.349> panel<00:02:17.900> over<00:02:18.900> here<00:02:19.079> we

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
that's the the solar panel over here we

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.170 
that's the the solar panel over here we
have<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.650> thermo-pile<00:02:20.220> now<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.519> thermo-pile

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
have the thermo-pile now the thermo-pile

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.470 
have the thermo-pile now the thermo-pile
works<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.780> temperature<00:02:22.439> differences<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.879> here

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
works on temperature differences so here

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.259 
works on temperature differences so here
I<00:02:24.720> have<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:25.409> think<00:02:25.470> what<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.250> considered<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:27.090> be

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
I have I think what is considered to be

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.410 
I have I think what is considered to be
one<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.689> most<00:02:27.930> efficient<00:02:28.970> setups<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.299> it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
one of the most efficient setups for it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.229 
one of the most efficient setups for it
you<00:02:31.409> have<00:02:31.560> one<00:02:31.590> block<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.189> lava<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.819> four

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
you have one block of lava and four

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.649 
you have one block of lava and four
blocks<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.659> water<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.790> if<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:35.939> throw<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.359> volt

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
blocks of water and if we throw the volt

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.009 
blocks of water and if we throw the volt
meter<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:37.140> there<00:02:38.180> again<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.480> storing<00:02:39.930> a

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
meter on there again it's storing a

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.240 
meter on there again it's storing a
hundred<00:02:40.349> volts<00:02:40.680> right<00:02:40.890> now<00:02:41.099> so<00:02:42.049> let's<00:02:43.099> throw<00:02:44.099> a

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
hundred volts right now so let's throw a

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.240 
hundred volts right now so let's throw a
battery<00:02:44.609> box<00:02:44.819> on<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.150> top<00:02:45.420> -<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:46.739> drain<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> bit

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
battery box on the top - to drain a bit

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.770 
battery box on the top - to drain a bit
of<00:02:47.340> power<00:02:47.609> give<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.879> power<00:02:48.120> somewhere<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.629> go

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
of power give the power somewhere to go

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.520 
of power give the power somewhere to go
if<00:02:49.560> we<00:02:49.769> test<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.250> vole<00:02:50.400> meat<00:02:50.639> and<00:02:50.879> the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
if we test the vole meat and the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.399 
if we test the vole meat and the
thermo-pile<00:02:52.530> now<00:02:52.940> we're<00:02:53.940> getting<00:02:54.180> burned<00:02:54.599> 0.5

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
thermo-pile now we're getting burned 0.5

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:03.140 
thermo-pile now we're getting burned 0.5
amps<00:02:55.829> so<00:03:00.709> that's<00:03:01.709> about<00:03:01.980> half<00:03:02.340> what<00:03:02.879> we<00:03:03.060> were

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
amps so that's about half what we were

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.410 
amps so that's about half what we were
getting<00:03:03.620> always<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> quarter<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.970> what<00:03:06.209> we<00:03:06.329> were

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
getting always a quarter of what we were

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.379 
getting always a quarter of what we were
gained<00:03:06.689> from<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.639> solar<00:03:08.639> panel<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.180> you'd

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
gained from the solar panel so you'd

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.869 
gained from the solar panel so you'd
need<00:03:09.599> four<00:03:09.959> thermopiles<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.980> match<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
need four thermopiles to match the

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.179 
need four thermopiles to match the
output<00:03:12.239> from<00:03:12.389> one<00:03:12.450> solar<00:03:12.900> panel<00:03:13.290> but

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
output from one solar panel but

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.910 
output from one solar panel but
obviously<00:03:14.720> because<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.260> thermo-pile

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
obviously because the thermo-pile

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.009 
obviously because the thermo-pile
doesn't<00:03:17.340> need<00:03:17.519> sight<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.659> the<00:03:18.930> sky<00:03:19.260> or<00:03:19.859> any

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
doesn't need sight of the the sky or any

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.110 
doesn't need sight of the the sky or any
specific<00:03:22.019> lighting<00:03:22.949> requirements<00:03:23.129> you<00:03:24.090> can

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
specific lighting requirements you can

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.860 
specific lighting requirements you can
stack<00:03:24.690> them<00:03:24.840> up<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:28.699> basically<00:03:29.699> have<00:03:30.690> an

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
stack them up and basically have an

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.619 
stack them up and basically have an
underground<00:03:31.319> power<00:03:31.680> generation<00:03:32.209> as<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.419> you

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
underground power generation as this you

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.909 
underground power generation as this you
really<00:03:33.840> need<00:03:33.930> it's<00:03:34.919> like<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.430> guide<00:03:35.760> for<00:03:36.060> it

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
really need it's like this guide for it

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.830 
really need it's like this guide for it
and<00:03:38.629> so<00:03:39.629> that<00:03:39.659> is<00:03:40.250> blue<00:03:41.250> electric<00:03:41.639> power<00:03:41.879> there

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
and so that is blue electric power there

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.569 
and so that is blue electric power there
is<00:03:42.989> these<00:03:43.199> battery<00:03:43.620> boxes<00:03:43.979> which<00:03:44.159> I'll<00:03:44.400> go

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
is these battery boxes which I'll go

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.670 
is these battery boxes which I'll go
into<00:03:44.609> on<00:03:45.599> another<00:03:45.959> spotlight<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:49.470> other

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
into on another spotlight the other

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.020 
into on another spotlight the other
thing<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:51.709> I'll<00:03:52.709> note<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.280> over<00:03:53.519> in<00:03:53.609> mind<00:03:53.879> on

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
thing that I'll note and over in mind on

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.409 
thing that I'll note and over in mind on
that<00:03:54.209> spotlight<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:57.150> don't

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
that spotlight is that you don't

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.089 
that spotlight is that you don't
actually<00:03:57.690> need<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.379> use<00:03:59.510> wiring<00:04:00.510> for<00:04:00.810> this

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
actually need to use wiring for this

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.089 
actually need to use wiring for this
they<00:04:02.099> will<00:04:02.510> transfer<00:04:03.510> power<00:04:03.870> just<00:04:04.169> by<00:04:04.349> being

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
they will transfer power just by being

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.259 
they will transfer power just by being
placed<00:04:05.310> next<00:04:05.699> to<00:04:05.879> each<00:04:06.030> other<00:04:06.319> so<00:04:07.319> if<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.650> had

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
placed next to each other so if I had

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.849 
placed next to each other so if I had
something<00:04:09.269> they<00:04:09.389> used<00:04:09.720> electric<00:04:10.319> power<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.769> I

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
something they used electric power and I

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.890 
something they used electric power and I
put<00:04:11.069> it<00:04:11.190> next<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.729> this<00:04:11.849> battery<00:04:12.239> box<00:04:12.449> it's<00:04:12.629> all

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
put it next to this battery box it's all

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.259 
put it next to this battery box it's all
going<00:04:13.109> to<00:04:13.169> connect<00:04:13.470> up<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.489> if<00:04:14.639> I<00:04:14.790> took<00:04:14.849> I<00:04:15.090> put

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
going to connect up and if I took I put

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.939 
going to connect up and if I took I put
another<00:04:15.510> machine<00:04:15.750> next<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.470> house<00:04:16.650> well

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
another machine next to the house well

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.060 
another machine next to the house well
and<00:04:17.430> they<00:04:17.789> would<00:04:17.909> all<00:04:18.060> transfer<00:04:18.889> among<00:04:19.889> each

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
and they would all transfer among each

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.409 
and they would all transfer among each
each<00:04:20.400> other<00:04:21.199> so<00:04:22.199> that<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:23.029> blue<00:04:24.029> electric

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
each other so that is blue electric

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.779 
each other so that is blue electric
power<00:04:24.630> again<00:04:24.900> if<00:04:25.370> you've<00:04:26.370> got<00:04:26.400> any<00:04:26.700> more

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
power again if you've got any more

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.279 
power again if you've got any more
questions<00:04:27.060> about<00:04:27.450> this<00:04:27.690> so<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:27.960> think<00:04:28.169> I've

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
questions about this so you think I've

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.059 
questions about this so you think I've
missed<00:04:28.529> something

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
missed something

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.600
