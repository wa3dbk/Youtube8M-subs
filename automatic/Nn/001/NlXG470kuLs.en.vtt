00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.500
 then already the next one 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.340
 yes, that's exactly what happened with another one 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.930
 Technology is linked with technology but with 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.309
 the same want exactly 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.629
 also the mistakes I'm pretty 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:42.290
 now just two so poor long 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.900
 It will be exactly right then 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.309
 I am about the width I am now 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.820
 how can it be wider? 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.070
 do 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.410
 on the now three 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.510
 different colors also come with the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.780
 still vary depending on how 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.780
 one likes to 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.980
 about the same length 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.660
 they're just going to go upstairs too 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.190
 small loop knotted and best 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.600
 fixed somewhere I have it now 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.729
 The pants are made in the same way 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.590
 simply fix that table yourself 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.590
 then it does not make it easier to make a knot 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.600
 Anna and then we work in public 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 take to the right so the utmost 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:37.260
 thread it over the next already 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.210
 started over the next one in this one 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.970
 form this way and also in the 11 10 once 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.380
 by keeping it with was a bit 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.960
 curious and she in the other after 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.369
 above 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.710
 So that's always the same ties 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.399
 technology and the whole thing twice with 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.399
 every thread 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.100
 and then you go to the next drive 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.110
 about so always one by one 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.110
 you work from left to right tv 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.459
 Look, I've got that before 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.079
 just made a few vacations 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.239
 I also want to perform that too 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.939
 do 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:45.489
 Here you can choose different 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:48.489
 this one looks great and now 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.489
 easy 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.700
 on the slopes 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.590
 quite normal 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.299
 great and now we just knot it 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:44.599
 the ends 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:47.950
 Here we can cut on it 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.950
 just linked more quickly 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:59.360
 now we just knot 2 and 2 that 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:04.110
 I do exactly finished knotted super 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.380
 win and now that powerful here please 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.380
