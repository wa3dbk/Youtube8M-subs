think that shows you how open the race

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.360 
think that shows you how open the race

under<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:45.110> this<00:00:46.110> house<00:00:46.320> looked<00:00:46.649> good<00:00:47.719> just<00:00:48.980> he

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
under is this house looked good just he

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.799 
under is this house looked good just he
made<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> running<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> bumper<00:00:51.329> last<00:00:51.510> year

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
made the running in the bumper last year

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
made the running in the bumper last year
because<00:00:52.530> they<00:00:52.949> thought<00:00:53.160> he<00:00:53.340> stays<00:00:53.640> really

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
because they thought he stays really

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.819 
because they thought he stays really
well<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.570> we've<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.110> stretch<00:00:55.590> him

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
well so we've got to really stretch him

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.700 
well so we've got to really stretch him
and<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> way<00:00:57.960> he<00:00:58.109> jumped<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> last

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.490 
and I like the way he jumped the last
here<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> line<00:01:00.379> there<00:01:01.379> was

including a Shane's Hill it could be

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.859 
including a Shane's Hill it could be
more<00:01:17.610> likely<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.970> go<00:01:18.119> back<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> Supreme

we've also got in the mixer no more
heroes<00:01:22.680> yeah<00:01:23.250> no<00:01:23.580> more<00:01:23.759> heroes<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.390> probably

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
heroes yeah no more heroes is probably

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.179 
heroes yeah no more heroes is probably
the<00:01:24.840> interesting<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:25.770> garden

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the interesting one in here garden

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.429 
the interesting one in here garden
elliott<00:01:26.460> source<00:01:26.729> who<00:01:27.360> beat<00:01:27.630> Shane's<00:01:27.990> he<00:01:28.259> ran

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
elliott source who beat Shane's he ran

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.770 
elliott source who beat Shane's he ran
out<00:01:28.590> stays<00:01:28.950> him<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:30.090> think<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
out stays him and I think this is the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.819 
out stays him and I think this is the
key<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.579> stays<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.840> look<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
key out stays in because look at the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.319 
key out stays in because look at the
houses<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.310> won<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> Albert<00:01:35.909> parkland

houses that have won the Albert parkland

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.940 
houses that have won the Albert parkland
in<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> past<00:01:36.720> they<00:01:36.930> are<00:01:37.110> absolutely<00:01:37.619> Dara

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
in the past they are absolutely Dara

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.100 
in the past they are absolutely Dara
stairs<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:39.329> house<00:01:39.509> looks<00:01:39.750> every<00:01:40.079> inch

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
