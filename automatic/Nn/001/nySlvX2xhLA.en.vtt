back in New York at a stencil I'm making
the<00:02:02.820> label<00:02:02.970> readout<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.750> kilotons<00:02:04.380> because

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the label readout for kilotons because

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.219 
the label readout for kilotons because
this<00:02:05.190> bomb<00:02:05.460> design<00:02:05.909> loosely<00:02:06.540> resembles<00:02:06.720> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
this bomb design loosely resembles the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.900 
this bomb design loosely resembles the
fat<00:02:07.470> man<00:02:07.680> bomb<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.459> dropped<00:02:08.640> on

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
fat man bomb that was dropped on

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.790 
fat man bomb that was dropped on
Nagasaki<00:02:08.940> which<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:09.990> about<00:02:10.170> five<00:02:10.380> feet<00:02:10.619> wide

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
Nagasaki which is about five feet wide

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.710 
Nagasaki which is about five feet wide
and<00:02:11.069> had<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> yield<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.670> twenty-one<00:02:12.180> kilotons

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and had a yield of twenty-one kilotons

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.360 
and had a yield of twenty-one kilotons
actually<00:02:13.140> even<00:02:13.380> more<00:02:13.530> closely<00:02:13.740> resembles<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
actually even more closely resembles the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.040 
actually even more closely resembles the
mark<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:14.910> atomic<00:02:15.330> bomb<00:02:15.540> which<00:02:15.780> had<00:02:16.020> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
mark for atomic bomb which had a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.170 
mark for atomic bomb which had a
variable<00:02:16.590> yield<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.160> one<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.850> thirty<00:02:18.090> one

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
variable yield of one to thirty one

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.120 
variable yield of one to thirty one
kilotons<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.200> also<00:02:19.380> got<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.680> go<00:02:19.770> on<00:02:19.830> by<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
kilotons so I also got to go on by that

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.729 
kilotons so I also got to go on by that
range<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.520> devastation<00:02:21.120> man<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.230> video<00:02:22.650> took
