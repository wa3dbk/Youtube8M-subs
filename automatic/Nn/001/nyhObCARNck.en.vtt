three you get more ammo and a grenade I

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.980 
three you get more ammo and a grenade I
like<00:04:25.039> that<00:04:25.220> idea<00:04:25.400> that's<00:04:25.910> good<00:04:26.240> that<00:04:26.780> with<00:04:26.900> the

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
like that idea that's good that with the

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.270 
like that idea that's good that with the
kickbacks<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.500> waiting<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.860> see<00:04:27.979> how<00:04:28.099> that

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
kickbacks and waiting to see how that

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.960 
kickbacks and waiting to see how that
works<00:04:28.460> out<00:04:29.830> kickbacks<00:04:30.830> are<00:04:31.130> very<00:04:31.580> similar<00:04:31.820> to

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
works out kickbacks are very similar to

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.180 
works out kickbacks are very similar to
contracts<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:33.080> call<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:33.440> duty<00:04:33.740> where<00:04:33.950> if<00:04:34.099> you

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190
