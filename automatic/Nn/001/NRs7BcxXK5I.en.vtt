this<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> look<00:01:11.360> this<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.689> sketched<00:01:13.049> out

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
this is the look this is my sketched out

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.140 
this is the look this is my sketched out
version<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.939> try<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
version of what I want to try to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.660 
version of what I want to try to
accomplish<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> front<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
accomplish so that's the front of the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.570 
accomplish so that's the front of the
chain<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> back<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.720> chain

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
chain so this is the back of the chain

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
chain so this is the back of the chain
this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.790> what<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.000> want<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> try<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.869> accomplish

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
this is what I want to try to accomplish

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.140 
this is what I want to try to accomplish
on<00:01:25.979> my<00:01:26.130> own<00:01:26.310> or<00:01:26.720> either<00:01:27.770> I<00:01:28.770> may<00:01:29.579> end<00:01:29.790> up<00:01:29.850> doing
