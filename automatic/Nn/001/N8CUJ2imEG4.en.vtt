think it's quite nice to embrace being

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.550 
think it's quite nice to embrace being
pale<00:01:33.619> during<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.459> winter<00:01:34.729> months<00:01:34.999> and<00:01:35.560> that's

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
pale during the winter months and that's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.879 
pale during the winter months and that's
good<00:01:36.799> if<00:01:37.009> that<00:01:37.039> suits<00:01:37.399> you<00:01:38.380> but<00:01:39.380> sometimes<00:01:39.590> if

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
good if that suits you but sometimes if

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:41.379

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
into the foundation and it doesn't go

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.370
