00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hey guys , here's the dark one and in the video 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.220
 not only for you my character 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.889
 This bike is so delicious 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:24.500
 I love one of them so now you have to 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:24.500
 elektro principle is 100% 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.930
 the engine picking up the improvement at its level 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.329
 four explosives 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.800
 Our hotel from the start but I 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.110
 I swear I do not know for serving 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.610
 explosives but I know that on departure 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.000
 then you do not like to put lights on 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.920
 phenom 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.020
 It is logical that you already have a 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.960
 neurotic black 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.050

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.050

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.689

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.189
 nitro and I'm going to leave soon 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.159
 show you leave you hear the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:43.020
 sound but the main thing is to put a 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:44.880
 frosted like a little car so I 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.090

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.640
 car even than frosted is very 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.640
