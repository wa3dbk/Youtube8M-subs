using<00:03:31.410> those<00:03:31.920> claw<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.640> that's<00:03:33.240> where<00:03:33.630> not

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
every class has that kind of different'

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.740 
every class has that kind of different'
so<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.490> guess<00:03:38.880> that's<00:03:39.090> why<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.270> like<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.540> class

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
so I guess that's why I like this class

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.510 
so I guess that's why I like this class
you<00:03:40.020> know<00:03:40.140> there<00:03:40.380> there's<00:03:40.830> different<00:03:41.340> moves

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
you know there there's different moves

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.070 
you know there there's different moves
for<00:03:41.730> different<00:03:42.090> things<00:03:42.270> that<00:03:42.840> are<00:03:42.900> gonna<00:03:42.990> be

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
for different things that are gonna be

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.260 
for different things that are gonna be
doing<00:03:43.470> cloth<00:03:44.190> smashes<00:03:44.580> versatile<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.240> can

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
doing cloth smashes versatile you can

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.640 
doing cloth smashes versatile you can
use<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.570> against<00:03:45.810> moms<00:03:46.020> as<00:03:46.230> well<00:03:46.410> because<00:03:46.590> it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
use that against moms as well because it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.800 
use that against moms as well because it
hits<00:03:46.800> three<00:03:47.010> moms<00:03:47.220> but<00:03:48.090> you're<00:03:48.390> going<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.690> be

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
hits three moms but you're going to be

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.780 
hits three moms but you're going to be
probably<00:03:49.140> killing<00:03:49.410> more<00:03:49.680> than<00:03:49.709> three<00:03:50.100> mobs<00:03:50.340> so

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
probably killing more than three mobs so

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.940 
probably killing more than three mobs so
claw<00:03:51.450> slash<00:03:51.720> isn't<00:03:52.050> exactly<00:03:52.410> useful<00:03:52.830> as

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
claw slash isn't exactly useful as

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.220 
claw slash isn't exactly useful as
you're<00:03:53.070> bossing<00:03:53.420> or<00:03:54.420> even<00:03:54.870> range<00:03:55.080> is

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
you're bossing or even range is

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.980 
you're bossing or even range is
incredibly<00:03:55.620> high<00:03:55.800> that<00:03:56.280> works<00:03:56.520> too<00:03:56.990> but

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
incredibly high that works too but

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.010 
incredibly high that works too but
overall<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:58.920> enjoyed<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.550> mall<00:03:59.760> my<00:04:00.300> funding<00:04:00.750> is

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
overall I enjoyed you mall my funding is

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.040 
overall I enjoyed you mall my funding is
about<00:04:01.410> 30<00:04:02.280> something<00:04:02.910> percent<00:04:03.270> strange<00:04:03.750> so

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
about 30 something percent strange so

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.280 
about 30 something percent strange so
not<00:04:04.230> too<00:04:04.440> much<00:04:04.620> once<00:04:05.610> I<00:04:05.790> hit<00:04:06.000> level<00:04:06.270> 140<00:04:07.050> i<00:04:07.110> did

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
not too much once I hit level 140 i did

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.770 
not too much once I hit level 140 i did

get Empress gear so that's something
Empress<00:04:10.410> gear<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:10.709> really<00:04:11.010> cheap<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.340> free

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
Empress gear is really cheap and free

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.460 
Empress gear is really cheap and free
market<00:04:11.820> right<00:04:11.940> now<00:04:11.970> luckily<00:04:12.959> for<00:04:13.140> me<00:04:13.260> I<00:04:13.290> was

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
market right now luckily for me I was

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.270 
market right now luckily for me I was
able<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.680> get<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:13.950> from<00:04:14.220> Empress<00:04:14.820> herself<00:04:15.000> so

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
able to get it from Empress herself so

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.270 
able to get it from Empress herself so
but<00:04:16.940> if<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:17.780> like<00:04:17.989> close<00:04:18.620> range<00:04:18.889> fighters

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
but if you like close range fighters

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.250 
but if you like close range fighters
like<00:04:19.910> really<00:04:20.239> close<00:04:20.359> range<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:20.959> might<00:04:21.170> not

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
like really close range this might not

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.780 
like really close range this might not
be<00:04:21.320> for<00:04:21.560> you<00:04:21.620> because<00:04:22.010> it's<00:04:22.220> actually<00:04:22.400> very

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
be for you because it's actually very

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.159 
be for you because it's actually very
ranged<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:24.530> think<00:04:25.220> of<00:04:25.310> it<00:04:25.430> somewhere<00:04:26.330> along

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
ranged so think of it somewhere along

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.540 
ranged so think of it somewhere along
the<00:04:27.410> line<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:29.290> I<00:04:30.290> guess<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.100> best<00:04:31.220> way<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.430> put

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
the line of I guess the best way to put

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.820 
the line of I guess the best way to put
it<00:04:31.610> would<00:04:31.760> be<00:04:31.850> a<00:04:32.090> Dark<00:04:32.540> Knight's<00:04:32.990> range<00:04:33.500> I

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
it would be a Dark Knight's range I

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.200 
it would be a Dark Knight's range I
think<00:04:34.010> they<00:04:34.100> have<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.220> new<00:04:34.340> crowd<00:04:34.520> I<00:04:34.790> think<00:04:35.120> I

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
think they have a new crowd I think I

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.480 
think they have a new crowd I think I
have<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.330> pretty<00:04:35.540> long<00:04:36.169> range<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:37.010> that<00:04:37.040> works

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
have a pretty long range so that works

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.960 
have a pretty long range so that works
or<00:04:38.470> think<00:04:39.470> of<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.590> Ron's<00:04:39.800> form<00:04:40.190> job<00:04:40.400> skills<00:04:40.790> the

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
or think of a Ron's form job skills the

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.150 
or think of a Ron's form job skills the
tiger<00:04:41.330> or<00:04:41.480> whatever<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.840> hell<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.110> is<00:04:42.139> just<00:04:43.070> a

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
tiger or whatever the hell it is just a

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.190 
tiger or whatever the hell it is just a
longer<00:04:43.490> range<00:04:43.820> skills<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:44.540> that's<00:04:44.870> what<00:04:45.110> it

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
longer range skills that that's what it

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.590 
longer range skills that that's what it
is<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:46.550> definitely<00:04:47.000> give<00:04:47.150> you<00:04:47.180> an<00:04:47.360> Wallace

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
is so definitely give you an Wallace

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.630 
is so definitely give you an Wallace
shot<00:04:47.840> his<00:04:48.440> link<00:04:48.800> skills<00:04:49.070> incredible<00:04:49.520> too

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
shot his link skills incredible too

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.180 
shot his link skills incredible too
because<00:04:49.940> it<00:04:50.060> is<00:04:50.180> ten<00:04:50.540> percent<00:04:51.050> chance<00:04:51.350> to

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190

bossing<00:04:57.440> type<00:04:57.590> of<00:04:57.710> person<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:58.669> if<00:04:58.730> you<00:04:58.820> got<00:04:58.940> a

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
bossing type of person so if you got a

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.060 
bossing type of person so if you got a

root abyss and you die by one shot you

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.409 
root abyss and you die by one shot you

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.020 
range is nearly 50 K but their range is
nearly<00:05:32.690> 1<00:05:32.930> million<00:05:33.200> i<00:05:33.530> I<00:05:33.800> can't<00:05:34.100> compete<00:05:34.430> you

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030
