to this day and it's only been eight
years<00:01:01.949> now<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.030> went<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.840> being

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
years now so it went from just being

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.660 
years now so it went from just being
able<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> open<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.890> close<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.430> very

anything<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:09.180> where<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:09.840> now

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.070 

it's<00:01:13.979> got<00:01:14.310> six<00:01:14.850> motors<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> thumb

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
it's got six motors in it so the thumb

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.600 
it's got six motors in it so the thumb
will<00:01:16.290> actually<00:01:16.710> move<00:01:17.250> into<00:01:17.430> different

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
will actually move into different

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
will actually move into different
positions<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> fingers<00:01:19.080> move<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.830> this

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
positions all the fingers move so this

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.100 
positions all the fingers move so this
is<00:01:20.130> them<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> more<00:01:20.790> advanced<00:01:21.060> ones<00:01:21.210> out<00:01:24.110> as

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
soon as you open an app up it syncs with

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
soon as you open an app up it syncs with
the<00:01:27.000> hand<00:01:27.180> inside<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.020> app<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.350> has<00:01:28.500> all

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the hand inside that app that has all

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
the hand inside that app that has all
these<00:01:29.189> different<00:01:29.520> pictures<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.820> different

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
these different pictures of different

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.179 
these different pictures of different
grips<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.530> click<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.009> of
