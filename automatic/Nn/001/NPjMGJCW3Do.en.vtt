00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
that's what we're testing here is how

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.400 
that's what we're testing here is how
well<00:04:30.440> they<00:04:30.620> fly<00:04:30.889> you<00:04:31.419> know<00:04:32.419> compared<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.260> what

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
feathers were gonna keep everything in

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.280 
feathers were gonna keep everything in
line<00:05:44.660> but<00:05:45.660> they<00:05:45.900> work<00:05:46.170> perfectly<00:05:47.450> it<00:05:48.450> was<00:05:48.600> even

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
line but they work perfectly it was even

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.560 
line but they work perfectly it was even
windy<00:05:49.620> out<00:05:49.740> there<00:05:50.010> it<00:05:50.220> still<00:05:50.430> they<00:05:50.670> flew<00:05:50.940> just

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
windy out there it still they flew just

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.740

like<00:05:51.810> my<00:05:52.020> 4-inch<00:05:52.470> feathers<00:05:53.340> did<00:05:53.550> they<00:05:54.390> got<00:05:54.600> to

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
like my 4-inch feathers did they got to

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.330 
like my 4-inch feathers did they got to
be<00:05:54.810> quieter<00:05:55.350> because<00:05:55.590> there<00:05:55.830> ain't<00:05:55.950> near<00:05:56.280> as

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
be quieter because there ain't near as

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.090 
be quieter because there ain't near as
much<00:05:56.700> feather<00:05:57.000> about<00:05:57.570> half<00:05:57.810> as<00:05:57.960> long<00:05:58.140> and<00:05:59.570> they

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
much feather about half as long and they

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.030 
much feather about half as long and they
controlled<00:06:02.100> the<00:06:02.910> coat<00:06:03.150> on<00:06:03.180> contact<00:06:03.870> to<00:06:04.770> blade

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
controlled the coat on contact to blade

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.730 
controlled the coat on contact to blade
they<00:06:05.970> controlled<00:06:06.390> three<00:06:06.750> blade<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:07.380> they

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
they controlled three blade and they

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.550 
they controlled three blade and they
control<00:06:08.160> the<00:06:09.060> expandable<00:06:10.020> you<00:06:10.320> know<00:06:10.410> that's

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
control the expandable you know that's

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.950 
control the expandable you know that's
your<00:06:10.710> three<00:06:10.890> basic<00:06:11.220> broad<00:06:11.700> heads<00:06:11.970> and<00:06:12.300> it

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
worked well on all of them out of my

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.820 
worked well on all of them out of my
longbow<00:06:14.790> even<00:06:15.150> so<00:06:15.480> and<00:06:15.780> that's<00:06:16.500> I<00:06:16.620> mean<00:06:16.770> that's

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
longbow even so and that's I mean that's

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.210 
longbow even so and that's I mean that's
all<00:06:17.100> I<00:06:17.130> could<00:06:17.340> test<00:06:17.670> is<00:06:17.940> my<00:06:18.120> longbow<00:06:18.600> but<00:06:19.230> they

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
all I could test is my longbow but they

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.430 
all I could test is my longbow but they
done<00:06:20.430> really<00:06:20.820> really<00:06:20.910> well<00:06:21.150> I'm<00:06:21.990> pretty

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
done really really well I'm pretty

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.530 
done really really well I'm pretty
pleased<00:06:22.770> with<00:06:22.890> them<00:06:23.160> I<00:06:23.400> wouldn't<00:06:24.180> mind<00:06:24.330> having

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
pleased with them I wouldn't mind having

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.140 
pleased with them I wouldn't mind having
something<00:06:24.930> like<00:06:25.050> that<00:06:25.320> really<00:06:25.730> it<00:06:26.730> might<00:06:27.000> look

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
something like that really it might look

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.420 
something like that really it might look
a<00:06:27.270> little<00:06:27.420> weird<00:06:27.720> in<00:06:28.500> my<00:06:28.590> lung<00:06:28.980> both<00:06:29.250> these

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
a little weird in my lung both these

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.690 
a little weird in my lung both these
short<00:06:29.760> feathers<00:06:30.570> but<00:06:31.070> there<00:06:32.070> was<00:06:32.280> actually<00:06:32.670> I

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.700 
short feathers but there was actually I

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.950 
short feathers but there was actually I
mean<00:06:33.200> no<00:06:34.200> difference<00:06:34.700> and<00:06:35.700> if<00:06:36.060> there<00:06:36.570> was<00:06:36.720> any

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
mean no difference and if there was any

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.750 
mean no difference and if there was any
difference<00:06:37.170> it<00:06:37.530> was<00:06:37.650> a<00:06:37.890> positive<00:06:38.610> difference

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
difference it was a positive difference

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.020 
difference it was a positive difference
so<00:06:39.240> I<00:06:39.530> can't<00:06:40.530> say<00:06:40.860> anything<00:06:41.400> bad<00:06:41.700> about<00:06:41.820> them

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
so I can't say anything bad about them

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.660 
so I can't say anything bad about them
even<00:06:42.870> in<00:06:43.200> the<00:06:43.290> wind<00:06:43.500> it<00:06:44.040> cut<00:06:44.280> through<00:06:44.490> the<00:06:44.550> wind

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
even in the wind it cut through the wind

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.270 
even in the wind it cut through the wind
pretty<00:06:44.970> good<00:06:45.180> so<00:06:45.450> that's<00:06:46.040> that's<00:06:47.040> it

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
pretty good so that's that's it

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.030 
pretty good so that's that's it
wonderful<00:06:47.640> because<00:06:48.140> then<00:06:49.140> bigger<00:06:49.440> feathers

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
wonderful because then bigger feathers

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.370 
wonderful because then bigger feathers
when<00:06:50.520> it's<00:06:50.640> windy<00:06:50.850> can<00:06:51.540> get<00:06:51.810> a<00:06:51.840> lot<00:06:52.080> of<00:06:52.170> tail

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
when it's windy can get a lot of tail

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.800 
when it's windy can get a lot of tail
