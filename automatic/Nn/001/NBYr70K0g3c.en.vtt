called sculpt foam it comes in a sheet I
cut<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:37.819> about<00:00:38.059> 9<00:00:38.449> by<00:00:38.719> 13<00:00:38.960> inches<00:00:39.679> I<00:00:39.890> pre

you see how rough that is if you'll take

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.349 
you see how rough that is if you'll take
it<00:00:45.620> out<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.100> you'll<00:00:46.309> put<00:00:46.519> it<00:00:46.639> on<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.879> concrete

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
it out and you'll put it on the concrete

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.079 
it out and you'll put it on the concrete

and you push it back and forth it makes

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.869 
and you push it back and forth it makes
it<00:00:50.329> smooth<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.620> we've<00:00:51.739> got<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.129> basis<00:00:52.579> for

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
it smooth so we've got the basis for

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.750 
it smooth so we've got the basis for
with<00:00:53.659> the<00:00:53.780> sculpt<00:00:54.079> foam<00:00:54.350> we've<00:00:55.249> taken<00:00:55.549> a
