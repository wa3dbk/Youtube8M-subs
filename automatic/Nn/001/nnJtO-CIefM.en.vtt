00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 passenger attention is time to board 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.020
 with the commander is from where as first 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.500
 we have to return a few decades 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.540
 to remember the steed, good day today, I 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.619
 I bring you the whooping cough of years 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:22.890
 60 ford steed the story of that car 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.289
 started in 1968 as a result of the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.269
 m project authored by willys overland 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.900
 from Brazil and reindeer 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.329
 but in 1967 after bought the willys and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.910
 acquired the rights of its manufacture 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.610
 in France the project of origin a renewal 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.610
 12 and here in brazil turned the concel 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.780
 according to the dictionary aurelio cocel wants 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.399
 say beautiful and fast horse and escobar 72 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.059
 did not for less 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.960
 the engine is a point 3 4 cylinders and 68 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.360
 horses 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.170
 would be little for the present day more 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.019
 adequate for that time and as early as 1973 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.549
 this engine became a 1.4 liter and 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.560
 75 horses 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.229
 the car already brought some innovations to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.200
 the time for example the hood open to 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.570
 front here in the sealed radiator that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.640
 that's why the hot water was transferred 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.680
 to this reservoir when 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.630
 cools back to the radiator 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.520
 which is to say that the liquid only 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.200
 needed to be changed every two years 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.200
 or 30 thousand kilometers 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.150
 another sedan attraction is the suspension 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.940
 independent of the front and axle 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.720
 hard on the back schematic till today 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.270
 widely used by several cars 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.120
 The inside is very nice too. 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.580
 on the panel the temperature marker and 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.220
 the spy light for charging the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.740
 alternator and engine oil pressure 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.810
 the interior is full of curiosities 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.530
 gear lever goes straight into the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.650
 floor 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.500
 the pedals are the same as the ford galaxy 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.119
 only without the chrome and the handbrake 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.900
 the handbrake 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.240
 he looks there on the left side of the driver 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.340
 may seem a bit strange but these 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.890
 features that helped make the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.750
 ii steed and a desired car in 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.330
 launching propaganda was given a lot of 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.220
 Emphasis on the steed trunk 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.580
 but looking closely is not so 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.580
 big like this 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.230
 It is not only there that the steed becca car 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.440
 family with two doors 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.959
 it was usual, it was released with 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.510
 four doors however for reasons of 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.060
 market requirements one year after the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.820
 launch of this beautiful horse emerged 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.580
 two-door version of the steed 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.180
 survived without much change until the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.760
 first half in 1977 to go through 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.070
 a complete change and be christened 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.730
 Steed 2 but that's another story 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:01.790
 I want to tell you another day. 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.790
 he calls me 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.600
 the ipad
