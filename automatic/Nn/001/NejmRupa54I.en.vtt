evolution has brought the human race to

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.110 
evolution has brought the human race to
the<00:00:04.470> peak<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.770> resilience<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.520> intelligence

the peak of resilience and intelligence

the peak of resilience and intelligence
it's<00:00:06.810> hard<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.109> see<00:00:07.319> how<00:00:07.529> we<00:00:07.589> could<00:00:07.890> evolve

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
it's hard to see how we could evolve

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.879 
it's hard to see how we could evolve
further<00:00:08.460> except<00:00:09.450> maybe<00:00:09.990> through<00:00:10.440> artificial

further except maybe through artificial

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.970 
further except maybe through artificial
means<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:12.210> can<00:00:12.360> upgrade<00:00:12.599> our<00:00:12.900> bodies<00:00:13.469> make

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
means we can upgrade our bodies make
