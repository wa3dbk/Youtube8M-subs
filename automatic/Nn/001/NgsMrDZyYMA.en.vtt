00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.420
 friends today we are going to talk about anem 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.880
 on and the moon that is anne moon is a 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.040
 alternative to win terror that undoubtedly 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.379
 I would dare to say that it is much 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.900
 better because good then I find in 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.670
 reasons one is that go with andemos 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.130
 we do not need to install 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.320
 some other twit for extensions it 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.470
 can say to give effect to our 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.779
 topics for example with winter by 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.230
 we need to install there 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.570
 with worlds or there are tires for 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.879
 effects the shadows etcetera or so that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.629
 complete the topics in this 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.460
 case there are common then that 's what 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.530
 I do not like the winter board so much 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.510
 winterboard her for now so why 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.789
 añejo for so long that it has as 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.350
 that one catches you baby in this case I 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.670
 the truth is that I say I 'm going to leave 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.340
 winterboard after he liked it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.079
 for years but now the truth is that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.239
 we will do is very father because not 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.190
 we need extensions and apart because 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.220
 they offer us this clue of two of the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.159
 issues for example since I 'm going to go into 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.439
 then you can see me 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.749
 until the presentation of this very beautiful 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.880
 here is what he offers us 

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:15.130
 nemo as you can see here I get the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.229
 issues that I have then to activate 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.149
 or we're just going to go to the subject by 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.340
 example here I will enter file and what 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.469
 I'm going to activate and I'm going to activate here between 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.149
 the functions that I want as such 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.829
 we made it into account as you can see 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.109
 well here in this way I like more 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.539
 very father everything is too much father 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.240
 so for example here I'm going to 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.450
 select this 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.490
 and I'm going to put it in apply and they'll see 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.369
 how we have a preview of how it would look 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.860
 and obviously my subject and after 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.780
 today the quick restart then this 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.000
 I also liked it a lot apart from that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.920
 every time they are updating the mood 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.360
 to the developers at every moment that 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.549
 they are updating then that I 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.990
 it pleases a lot and apart for those who do 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.610
 issues in this case that I'm 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.830
 starting to make subjects for the truth 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.320
 is that he is very father for everything that you 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.210
 they provide the functions and so you 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.590
 devices will be prettier the truth 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.500
 is that I set myself to differentiate a 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.239
 little on a device a theme 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.760
 installed with winterboard and another with a 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.850
 demo then the truth yes I know a little bit of 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.580
 difference the truth and animal is 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.190
 very best I tell you the truth 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.410
 I have sincerely left winterboard and 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.560
 now I use animal apart from that all the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.940
 issues work with him then this one me 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.890
 I recommend you try and the moon 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.989
 give him a chance and they will see 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.599
 that will undoubtedly convince us is going to 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.430
 like more than the winter and then only 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.200
 for friends this is the whole explanation 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.450
 of anemone you do not want to install 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.980
 they just have to go to cydia 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.780
 and they have to add the repú that they 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.400
 It is appearing on the screen as 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.560
 they added because they are simply going to 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.480

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.550
 totally free you do not need to pay 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.129
