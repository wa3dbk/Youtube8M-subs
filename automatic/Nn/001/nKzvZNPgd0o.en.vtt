00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
my opinion well not from any of my

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.630 
my opinion well not from any of my
videos<00:00:37.129> everyone<00:00:38.129> else<00:00:38.250> could<00:00:38.340> choose<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.550> do

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

what i can tell i don't know haven't
kept<00:01:41.100> too<00:01:41.220> much<00:01:41.369> up<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.509> until<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
kept too much up with it but until the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.660 
kept too much up with it but until the
complete<00:01:43.350> adventure<00:01:43.740> update<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.369> think

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
complete adventure update is out I think

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.249 
complete adventure update is out I think
I'll<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.000> think<00:01:45.329> I'll<00:01:45.420> hold<00:01:45.509> off<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
I'll I think I'll hold off on that and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.969 
I'll I think I'll hold off on that and
the<00:01:46.619> reason<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:48.680> one<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.829> big

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the reason for that is one of the big

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.830 
the reason for that is one of the big
things<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.549> 1.8<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> wanted<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.630> was

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
things in 1.8 that I wanted to go to was

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.700 
things in 1.8 that I wanted to go to was
it<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.380> explore<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> strongholds<00:01:53.540> but

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
it was to explore the strongholds but

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.410 
it was to explore the strongholds but
the<00:01:55.710> strongholds<00:01:55.979> don't<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.399> bosses<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.969> 1.8

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the strongholds don't have bosses in 1.8

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.020 
the strongholds don't have bosses in 1.8
and<00:01:58.040> they're<00:01:59.040> supposed<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.340> spawn<00:01:59.549> bosses<00:01:59.909> in

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and they're supposed to spawn bosses in

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.550
