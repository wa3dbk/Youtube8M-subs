00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.810
 the powerful weapon of war the presence of Jorge Costa here was also a 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 political message 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.749
 I'm going to use a staff and require control of my emotions. 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.720
 seen through the eyes of the American pilot the track is small 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.460
 inside the US Navy transport plane 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.240
 a lot of confident people that everything will work out the lack of windows may help 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.240
 fighting fear does not feel what you do not see 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.630
 until the plane hits the runway 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.680
 in a better third 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 the benfica insurance 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.010
 in the game the title is in Brazilian territorial waters to participate 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.010
 of exercises 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.560
 we go on the high seas 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.560
 a river of january 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.110
 300 meters long 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 displacing 100 thousand tons to build the cost 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.880
 the floating airport affirmed 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.110
 the risk that the city 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.560
 due to the lack of this 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.820
 about the episode 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.740
 we need to change that goal 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.580
 selected for the track 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.660
 the program costs nothing the parliament is all very tight narrow without windows 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.580
 the painful subject exists only for airplanes 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.130
 surrounded by death care of the crew 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.970
 it was a good idea of â€‹â€‹the situation 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.290
 good luck proportions 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.920
 the pimco muniz also brazilians 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.010
 the defense 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.010
 the museum does 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.610
 rose support

 if the driver is 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.459
 the students like this coming 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.369
 The aircraft carrier is not just a 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.369
 levels of schooling 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.279
 the most powerful of the strongest navy 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.279
 Why the American Navy? 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.459
 a message 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.459
 the American commander on the river 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.919

 Brazil and Argentina 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.829
 serra said in the region 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.829
 but the Brazilians that makes sense 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.489
 in fact it should be before the matches because several friends 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.949
 with air operations 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.469
 with the operation of the airplanes champions 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.469
 this is a demonstration of this the leader 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.039
 they essentially consist of the launching of various 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.139
 home partners 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.189
 the a6 that lead

 sheriff protection 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.659
 the planes do not take off 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.719
 the accident 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.949
 the ricardo 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.959
 if the American Navy matters 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.139
