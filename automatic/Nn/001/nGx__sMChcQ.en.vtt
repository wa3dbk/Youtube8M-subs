00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:27.699 
shredded because it only has got like

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.030 
shredded because it only has got like
six<00:03:27.970> shots<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.870> takes<00:03:29.139> average<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.859> three

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
six shots it takes average of three

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.890 
six shots it takes average of three
bullets<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.400> kill<00:03:30.430> like<00:03:31.269> most<00:03:31.479> of<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.659> time<00:03:31.780> it

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
bullets to kill like most of the time it

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.009 
bullets to kill like most of the time it
takes<00:03:32.199> three<00:03:32.470> bullets<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.769> kill<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.810> think

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
takes three bullets to kill and I think
