top of the left in on vegetation this
this<00:02:20.019> system<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:21.390> also<00:02:22.390> possible<00:02:22.860> used<00:02:23.860> for

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
this system is also possible used for

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.280 
this system is also possible used for
the<00:02:24.519> organic<00:02:25.739> system<00:02:26.739> because<00:02:27.989> these<00:02:28.989> are

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
the organic system because these are

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.670 
the organic system because these are

of<00:06:28.330> of<00:06:29.330> these<00:06:30.610> attachment<00:06:31.610> is

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
of of these attachment is

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.770 
of of these attachment is
a very<00:06:32.790> later<00:06:33.150> and<00:06:33.680> I<00:06:34.820> prefer<00:06:35.820> use<00:06:36.090> the

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
a very later and I prefer use the

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.260 
a very later and I prefer use the
organic<00:06:37.229> system<00:06:37.710> and<00:06:38.310> not<00:06:38.550> the<00:06:38.729> chemical

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
organic system and not the chemical

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.050 
organic system and not the chemical
system<00:06:39.720> because<00:06:40.139> the<00:06:40.860> chemical<00:06:41.370> system<00:06:41.850> like

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
system because the chemical system like

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.659 
system because the chemical system like
a<00:06:42.090> systemic<00:06:42.630> product<00:06:43.380> that<00:06:43.590> we<00:06:43.770> have<00:06:43.889> used<00:06:44.220> we

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
a systemic product that we have used we

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.710 
a systemic product that we have used we
have<00:06:44.850> a<00:06:45.470> taller<00:06:46.470> and<00:06:46.970> also<00:06:47.970> they<00:06:48.120> also<00:06:48.270> the

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
have a taller and also they also the

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.260 
have a taller and also they also the
super<00:06:50.000> the<00:06:51.000> King<00:06:51.539> chemical<00:06:52.440> so<00:06:52.680> far<00:06:53.009> I<00:06:53.270> don't

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
super the King chemical so far I don't

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.170 
super the King chemical so far I don't
like<00:06:54.419> I<00:06:54.539> prefer<00:06:55.139> use<00:06:55.650> just<00:06:56.100> the<00:06:56.250> natural<00:06:56.580> is

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
like I prefer use just the natural is

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.499 
like I prefer use just the natural is
better<00:06:57.500> also<00:06:58.500> the<00:06:58.710> lift<00:06:58.949> is<00:06:59.460> more<00:06:59.880> is<00:07:00.479> more

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.509 
better also the lift is more is more

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:03.770 
better also the lift is more is more
green<00:07:01.080> is<00:07:01.350> man
