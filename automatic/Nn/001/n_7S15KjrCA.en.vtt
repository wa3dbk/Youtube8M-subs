00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.630
 of winter is how you get angry and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.030
 I had so many faces to have 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.200

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.390

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.979
 I love it and it applies a lot and I 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.930
 like it a lot so this one obviously is 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.970
 a recommendation of every person I have 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.280
 this change to the one that takes my video of my 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.020

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.569

 Chastain is ever in our life 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.789
 which I imagine is the most normal 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.649
 our room or at least mine just 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.659
 above the covers things like the 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.009

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.420

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.840
 great because it's clearly more 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.520
 important that I cut myself if it's the only 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.200
 why I do dire straits 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.849
 sincere I do not have without following I have 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.349

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.909
 neck because it's super elegant a month 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.530
 as a super casual sacred to my aunt 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.149

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.860

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.100
 eager for saved by the bell or 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.000
 less in this time of my life when 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.430
 how I bought 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.530
 by calvin klein if you do not know this website 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.450
 It is basically a comfortable clothing 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.760
 in pajamas to follow underwear from 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.080
 brands like Calvin Klein and Alcolea 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.940
 sister and they have many brands 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.680
 of important designers is only 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.390

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.570
 these calvin klein are super comfortable 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.130
 and you have elastic satire but that 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.260
 allow not to shoot at all because it is 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.140

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.150
 the good thing this web is that you buy and 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.860

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.450
 messenger gets you the correct size with 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.700
 letters like the incorrect one then it's 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.140
 how to make a change understand what is not 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.760
 I like it a lot because then the prices 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.590
 as its valued what do the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.720
 shipments that charge as a bargain and 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.010
