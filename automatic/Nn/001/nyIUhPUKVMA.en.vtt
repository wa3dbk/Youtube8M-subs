00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
you two different preparations of duck

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.430 
you two different preparations of duck
they<00:02:39.390> gave<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.690> duck<00:02:39.840> leg<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.720 
they gave you the duck leg and the
breast<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.980> thought<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.220> duck<00:02:41.370> leg<00:02:41.550> was

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
breast and I thought the duck leg was

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.300 
breast and I thought the duck leg was
amazing<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.750> broth<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.170> really<00:02:43.230> good<00:02:43.740> but

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
amazing and the broth is really good but

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.550 
amazing and the broth is really good but
the<00:02:44.640> duck<00:02:44.820> breast<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.209> felt<00:02:45.450> like<00:02:45.600> felt<00:02:46.020> not

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
the duck breast I felt like felt not

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.130 
the duck breast I felt like felt not
that<00:02:46.830> good<00:02:47.070> because<00:02:47.250> um<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.660> temperature<00:02:49.020> was

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
that good because um the temperature was

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.110 
that good because um the temperature was
off<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:50.340> was<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.520> little<00:02:50.700> bit<00:02:50.850> undercooked

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
off and it was a little bit undercooked

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.660 
off and it was a little bit undercooked
for<00:02:51.510> me<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.040> ended<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.370> little<00:02:53.550> bit

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
for me so it ended up a little bit

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.729 
for me so it ended up a little bit
stringy<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.030> tough<00:02:54.300> but<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.900> leg<00:02:55.350> was

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
stringy and tough but the leg was

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:56.780 
stringy and tough but the leg was
amazing<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.190> if<00:02:56.280> everything<00:02:56.640> had<00:02:56.760> been

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
amazing so if everything had been

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.580 
amazing so if everything had been
prepared<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.360> same<00:02:57.540> way<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.959> think<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.440> would

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
prepared that same way I think I would

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.350 
prepared that same way I think I would
have<00:02:58.680> enjoyed<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.190> dish<00:02:59.459> so<00:02:59.670> much<00:02:59.790> more<00:03:00.000> did

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
have enjoyed that dish so much more did

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.880 
have enjoyed that dish so much more did

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.650 
appetizer I think it's an odd choice you
give<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.280> an<00:03:41.580> option<00:03:41.970> for<00:03:42.000> either<00:03:42.150> one<00:03:42.390> and

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
give it an option for either one and

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.569 
give it an option for either one and

actually the thing I thought was going
to<00:05:30.960> be<00:05:31.050> least<00:05:31.289> interesting<00:05:31.979> was<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:33.120> espresso

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
to be least interesting was the espresso

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.860

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.290 
Sunday and I'm not a big fan of coffee
one<00:05:37.560> of<00:05:37.680> my<00:05:37.800> friends<00:05:38.370> ordered<00:05:38.520> that<00:05:38.760> and<00:05:39.090> it

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
one of my friends ordered that and it

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.550 
one of my friends ordered that and it
was<00:05:39.389> actually<00:05:39.510> my<00:05:40.020> favorite<00:05:40.229> of<00:05:40.409> the<00:05:40.470> three

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
was actually my favorite of the three

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.350 
was actually my favorite of the three
desserts<00:05:41.070> like<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.550> coffin<00:05:41.940> is<00:05:42.030> added<00:05:42.330> to

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
desserts like that coffin is added to

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.960 
desserts like that coffin is added to
the<00:05:42.479> chocolate<00:05:43.080> and<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.650> I<00:05:44.520> think<00:05:44.820> was<00:05:44.909> a

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
the chocolate and the I think was a

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.990 
the chocolate and the I think was a
tangerine<00:05:45.270> ice<00:05:45.479> cream<00:05:46.340> beautifully<00:05:47.340> just<00:05:47.669> all

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
tangerine ice cream beautifully just all

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.430 
tangerine ice cream beautifully just all
the<00:05:48.120> flavors<00:05:48.419> meld<00:05:48.599> it<00:05:48.750> was<00:05:49.020> my<00:05:49.139> favorite

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
the flavors meld it was my favorite

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.270 
dessert it was the highlight of the meal
for<00:05:51.120> me<00:05:51.240> it<00:05:51.389> was<00:05:51.479> a<00:05:51.539> great<00:05:51.900> way<00:05:52.169> to<00:05:52.740> finish<00:05:52.919> all

of<00:05:53.340> those<00:05:53.699> flavors<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.930> tangerine<00:05:55.830> ice

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
of those flavors and the tangerine ice

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.189 
of those flavors and the tangerine ice
cream<00:05:56.370> was<00:05:56.550> really<00:05:57.000> great<00:05:57.210> but<00:05:57.389> having<00:05:58.169> the

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
cream was really great but having the

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.210

refreshing way to end the meal the
strawberry<00:06:08.610> flavors<00:06:08.909> really<00:06:09.030> delicate<00:06:09.570> they

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
strawberry flavors really delicate they

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.080

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.670 
paired it with pistachios and some
meringue<00:06:12.330> which<00:06:12.630> I<00:06:12.750> thought<00:06:12.870> was<00:06:12.990> really<00:06:13.409> good

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.180 
invokes that special occasion type of
feel<00:06:49.600> I<00:06:49.840> might<00:06:50.260> say<00:06:50.380> price<00:06:50.620> point<00:06:50.860> is<00:06:50.949> very

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
feel I might say price point is very

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.670 
feel I might say price point is very
reasonable<00:06:51.490> for<00:06:51.910> the<00:06:51.970> area<00:06:52.120> so<00:06:53.110> if<00:06:53.229> I<00:06:53.320> lived<00:06:53.560> in

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
reasonable for the area so if I lived in

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.960 
reasonable for the area so if I lived in
the<00:06:53.740> area<00:06:53.830> probably<00:06:54.130> go<00:06:54.310> more<00:06:54.490> often<00:06:54.639> but

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
the area probably go more often but

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.240 
the area probably go more often but
since<00:06:55.570> I<00:06:55.660> do<00:06:55.720> live<00:06:55.930> kind<00:06:56.139> of<00:06:56.199> far<00:06:56.260> I<00:06:56.620> probably

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
since I do live kind of far I probably

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.740 
since I do live kind of far I probably
wouldn't<00:06:57.580> make<00:06:57.610> the<00:06:57.699> trip<00:06:57.970> it's<00:06:58.240> definitely<00:06:58.449> a

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
wouldn't make the trip it's definitely a

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.870 
wouldn't make the trip it's definitely a

special occasion place because there's

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.879 
special occasion place because there's
so<00:07:01.120> much<00:07:01.270> attention<00:07:01.630> to<00:07:01.840> detail<00:07:02.380> you<00:07:02.500> feel
