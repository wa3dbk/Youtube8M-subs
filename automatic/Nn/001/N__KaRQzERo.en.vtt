00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.720
 that is Mr. huber he is in his 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.730
 company responsible for that 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.960
 machines always without problems and 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.940
 run smoothly 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.670
 Herrnhofer was a colleague 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.980
 reported that in a machine that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.760
 gear vibrates and is hotter than 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.580
 normal 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.830
 He wants the machine but in progress 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.130
 Do not just stop production operation 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.980
 because that can be expensive so he in 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.330
 Such a case is fast and flexible 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.840
 He has been able to react sooner 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.630
 the oil leak analysis sets an ordered 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 set consists of a sample container the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.940
 samples accompanying a questionnaire 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.059
 to the sample as well as one addressed before 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.370
 return envelope Mr huber withdraws 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.030
 quick and easy out of the eye-catching 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.620
 drive a sample into the sample container 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.960
 then he fills in the samples accompanying certificate 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.270
 and send it along with the oil 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.670
 Sample in special envelope to oil cicek 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.820
 The oil is first used in the laboratory with help 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.130
 from many different modern ones 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.830
 Analyzers examined among others 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.560
 in the case of mr. rober's test, it is determined whether 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.530
 high temperature in a gear oil 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.930
 has already harmed the values 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.380
 cause for the vibrations could be 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.369
 an engineer is not analyzed 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.790
 a computer sees itself determined 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.280
 analysis results 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.200
 by the details on the samples 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.250
 Accompanying license he can get the gear 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.939
 imagine 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.369
 the oil knows how to speak the expert knows 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.829
 So the gear and can now based 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.470
 the analysis results an accurate 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.360
 create a diagnosis 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.030
 at mr. rober's facility, he puts it that way 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.790
 states that the iron and chromium content 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.189
 the disco looks very much higher 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.310
 has risen and the infrared spectrum 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.710
 low oil age around shows 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.829
 the expert gives his report in the lab report 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.439
 individual comment from the next 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.509
 Mr. Huber gets the result 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.390
 an analysis by e mail 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.739
 the general condition of the oil is still 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.510
 Well 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.840
 However, there is evidence in stock 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.530
 Wear in the oil are hard 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.450
 impurities present 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.819
 that should be filtered a 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.250
 machines stop and oil changes are 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.140
 currently not required Mr. Upper 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.660
 can now sleep peacefully again 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.090
 He knows that the gear up to 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.560
 holds next revision saves itself 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.110
 the money for one actually 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.959
 necessary oil change and spares it 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.190
 also the environment 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.830
 In addition, he can through the damage 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.660
 early diagnosis of future defects 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.610
 prevent 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.700
 From now on, mister will talk about his machines 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.180
 Check regularly by oil analyzes 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.849
 to let 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.980
 by trend monitoring while running 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.319
 So he can do more about that 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.269
 Machine condition experienced damage and 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.019
 detect failures even earlier and 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.030
 avoid unnecessary oil changes 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.880
 An oil analysis is for all devices 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.370
 machines and systems useful in those 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.540
 Lubricants are used 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.450
 example construction machinery wind turbines 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.459
 biogas plants commercial vehicle generators 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.650
 biogas engines turbines steel and 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:24.930
 Power plants paper and cement factories 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:27.359
 or plane car and truck engines can 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.989
 we speak decode his 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.989
