00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.930
 when the arm is terrible a 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.930
 fly can be here why 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.000
 I'm in charge of there will be room for 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.870
 so much 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.870
 What's up 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.820
 to one leg and I can not change to the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.820
 two for rivals 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.640
 that is a weak 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.900
 usually 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.430
 s added now I want to get to both 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.500
 legs 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.630
 without needing to arrive some 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.120
 of the moment and finally I'm trying to 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.260
 remove this arm so that the arm already 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.960
 that here 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.890
 and when I have alcohol controlled 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.510
 then I advance the buttonhole 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.510
 advanced and this arm 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.339
 and nothing 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.339
 to the other leg 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.619
 and I'm going to side 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 what is the main thing suddenly many are 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.460
 they are wrong it was not being spent 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.260
 they are getting hooked remember that if 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.570
 both are on the same level and if I do not 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.210
 I bend over I'm going to crash in all the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.890
 possibility of the front with front not 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.190
 up here 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.230
 here comes a lot 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.160
 in the videos people who already have 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.160
 experience 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.860
 that's why it's not usual if today is 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.860
 good 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.880
 then when she is finished 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.689
 by the right leg you see what 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.229
 our colorful sidewalks and once we 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.229
 here is not with 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.130
 one 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.440
 the analogy 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.440
 on one side is the other leg 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.099
 I already say who is 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.710
 Similary 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:33.220
 so let's do us 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.510
 when we marking in that way the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.180
 another person what they do is that 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.710
 you will be what tension in the abdomen 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.710
 what because the shoulder 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.210
 to each case of the abdomen and how I have 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.210
 to send me with my head 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.380
 when he entered here one 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.840
 share I'm here what you have here 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:04.170
 no no 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.170
 because I continue as he continued to do 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.820
 yes
