you<00:04:34.419> say<00:04:34.629> my<00:04:34.870> name

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.250 

I<00:04:40.110> think<00:04:40.860> like<00:04:40.980> for<00:04:41.070> all<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:41.310> time<00:04:41.580> -<00:04:41.820> she

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
I think like for all this time - she

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260 
I think like for all this time - she
gets<00:04:43.260> away<00:04:43.410> from<00:04:43.740> me

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
gets away from me

gets away from me
yeah<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:49.310> think<00:04:50.310> it's<00:04:50.490> -<00:04:50.670> look<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.420> one<00:04:51.630> that

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
yeah I think it's - look the one that

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.630 
yeah I think it's - look the one that
where<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.050> get<00:04:52.440> lucky<00:04:54.650> after<00:04:55.650> hundreds<00:04:56.460> of

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
where I get lucky after hundreds of

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:17.069 
where I get lucky after hundreds of
sides

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:17.079 

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:28.369 

oh<00:05:18.399> yeah

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:37.830 

namely<00:05:29.909> finally

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.350 

I<00:05:39.870> went<00:05:40.870> through<00:05:41.080> this<00:05:41.200> weight<00:05:41.470> fast<00:05:42.360> I'm

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
I went through this weight fast I'm
