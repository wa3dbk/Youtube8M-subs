00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.860
 Welcome back full xavier iván 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.529
 today I bring you a super video 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.620
 special in collaboration with the super 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.420
 cute and super talented law here in 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.340
 youtube whom I love and admire 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.049
 very much and we will be talking to you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.560
 about the foundation of makeup 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.539
 revlon color white swan and four hours 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.550
 this is a makeup foundation that came out 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.529
 recently so we decided 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.510
 venture to see how this base of 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.730
 makeup works in different 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.349
 skin types and good if you want to know 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.670
 how can you invite us to follow 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.999
 seeing I'll start mentioning that my type 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.109
 of skin is mixed is fatty in what is 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:48.149
 the zone ty a little dry in what they are 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:51.629
 the cheeks to start the packaging 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.589
 for me it was one point less than I gave him 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.030
 to this base because honestly I 'm not 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.819
 very sure how to get the product 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.529
 to apply it to my first instinct is 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:04.260
 want to put the brush but since 

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:06.060
 I am very prone to pimples 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.920
 I do not want for any 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.680
 circumstance although my brooch this 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.500
 just washed or not maybe I can put 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.110
 bacteria in my makeup and that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.420
 it would really create a problem on my skin 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.210
 I feel that the packaging is quite heavy 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.479
 and it's awful to me sincerely to 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.060
 comparison of for example the true 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.000
 match that I have although it is glass 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.460
 the video is not so thick that it is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.250
 feel heavy is immediately in 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.940
 When you lift her off the shelf, you can 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.869
 feel how heavy as this is the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.000
 packaging although my first instinct is 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.959
 probably say that the liquid base 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.369
 It is much easier to apply 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:53.039
 definitely ramón calderé state wave 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.140
 it's much easier to control where the 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.270
 you put and how much you put for the simple and 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.270
 simple reason that it does not drain and 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.549
 of course it adheres much better to your 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.679
 skin without problems as for 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.039
 application is concerned I feel that if 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.109
 dissolved well dissolved many easy 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.180
 Sometimes with the liquid base it is difficult for me 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:14.730
 I do not have streaks 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.280
 although I know it's mainly because 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.180
 the type of brush that I use but with the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.060
 web color 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.950
 it's almost not a problem for me like that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.719
 that in that sense I feel it was a 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.719
 point in your favor 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.610
 the coverage is of complete average 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.190
 depending if you have marquitas in the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.200
 skin like me you can use concealer in 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.900
 your imperfections if you want or 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.110
 even as the texture of the base does not 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.380
 it's so watered down what I did was apply 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.750
 a little extra in those areas like in 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.270
 dark circles and acne marks that 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.670
 but if you do not have problem 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.400
 granites or dark circles the truth is that no 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.190
 you will need a lot of product what 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.010
 promises this base are up to 24 hours of 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.680
 duration which obviously does not leave the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.510
 product for so long but I think 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.000
 that if he defends himself very well at least 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.400
 for 8 hours and says it has coverage 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.060
 wide without talc and without for viola provides 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.220
 without any evidence and this the 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.130
 The first day I provided it was 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.830
 using without any powder to fix it or 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.700
 to keep it this mate and I could 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:31.150
 say that without using the fixative powder I 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.860
 it lasted like 3 hours without me having what 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.950
 challenge 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.680
 and that I had to spend what they are 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.410
 the rice pieces although already after 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.600
 of that time if I had to spend some 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.050
 how many precisely because of the fact that 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.240
 my skin is fat I always have to have 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.510
 something like that at hand but honestly 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.130
 compared to the one I always use that 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.780
 it was nothing I was going to be regular 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.790
 I have to start passing on the 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.240
 rice pieces from the first hour 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.820
 so one more point in his favor and he has already 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.209
 progressed the time you use it if 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.610
 I applied this the fixative powder and 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.500
 being the weather how was that 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.380
 it was definitely something that 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.870
 impressed because I did not have to almost 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.690
 retouch me for nothing usually when 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.390
 I pass my rice paper I have 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.610
 to reapply either dust or something 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.730
 so that I based my makeup does not remain 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.680
 everything is uneven but with that I did not have to 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.740
 apply absolutely nothing simply 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.690
 I had to remove the excess fat and my 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.030
 makeup was like when I just 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.480
 I had applied 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.340
 and local is between 75 and 82 degrees 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.550
 fahrenheit which for us is 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.410
 between warm and semi warm 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.360
 and as for humidity I could say that 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:55.000
 Semi humid if the purchase is badly damaged 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.000
 I think that is a big difference because 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.700
 at least me at walmart cost me 10 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.650
 $ 10 dollars and a few 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.080
 cents but definitely those 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.580
 prices vary among walgreens stores 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.380
 yen target this were between 11 12 and 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.300
 up to $ 13 I think they can 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.300
 walgreens where I saw her at 13 dollars 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.090
 if I definitely feel that it was worth 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.130
 worth paying 10 and still up to 13 dollars for 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.410
 the quality of the product if someone 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.660
 will ask if the recommend say that 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.820
 yes so of everything I think it's a 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.190
 good product I feel that by the fact of 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.800
 that is new have not taken enough 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:39.250
 colors having about five tones by 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.220
 tonality in my case I 'm 250 in 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:47.560
 million beige and in church I am in 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:49.600
 double 6 w 6 sandwiches but the truth 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.300
 is that you will not think it if you saw the 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.460
 bottles together because the colors do not 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.190
 as I had already told you how it happens when 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.310
 talk about the packaging that can not be 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.080
 appreciate very well what colors and 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.330
 honestly at first I thought I was going 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.640
 to be pretty clear but I knew that 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.890
 that was my limit that was my color 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.110
 so I decided to grab him from any 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.569
 way but if your skin tone is like 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.210
 mine is more or less like a brunette 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.639
 this out there in if it could be that if 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.369
 find I saw that if they had in them the 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.959
 basic tones of the dark rows and of 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:26.749
 all ways like I have already told you 

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:29.300
 before I have to mix some 

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:31.189
 try mixing a few bases to 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.529
 times because it's not always in 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:34.520
 the tonality that they seek but really 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.619
 is that I hope that for the 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.889
 convenience of many expand your range 

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:41.839
 of colors and the color that I chose 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:45.559
 combined well commented he has not and I feel 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:48.979
 that matched it and left it a color 

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:51.529
 healthy of a color not very clear not 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:54.050
 very dark I feel that really 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:56.209
 coupled to me to my skin color though 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.180
 Clearly, if you find a color that 

00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:02.059
 this one is a little clearer than you 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.800
 I always have sunscreens and 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:06.499
 all that that can help you 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.659
 channel the color a little better and good 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:11.599
 this is also how we finished my first 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:14.050
 review the green product not 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:16.519
 it was definitely an adventure 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.019
 make this collaboration with my little friend 

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.860
