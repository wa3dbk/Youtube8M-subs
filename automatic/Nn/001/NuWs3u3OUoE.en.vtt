actually has a bump and not a bump and a

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.240 
actually has a bump and not a bump and a
day<00:04:14.170> so<00:04:15.130> I<00:04:15.160> thought<00:04:15.400> that<00:04:15.549> was<00:04:15.670> great

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
day so I thought that was great

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.650 
day so I thought that was great
it<00:04:18.250> also<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:19.150> it's<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:20.010> 360<00:04:21.010> degree<00:04:21.430> swivel

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
it also the it's a 360 degree swivel

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.850 
it also the it's a 360 degree swivel
which<00:04:22.660> means<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:23.080> won't<00:04:23.200> get<00:04:23.320> all<00:04:23.440> tangled<00:04:23.740> up

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
which means I won't get all tangled up

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.130 
which means I won't get all tangled up
the<00:04:23.979> courgettes<00:04:24.460> hang<00:04:24.580> it<00:04:24.700> up<00:04:24.789> and<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.840> cord

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
the courgettes hang it up and the cord

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.040 
the courgettes hang it up and the cord
actually

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
actually

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.360 
actually
comes<00:04:28.060> with<00:04:29.060> this<00:04:30.020> little<00:04:30.080> velcro<00:04:30.680> strip<00:04:31.069> on

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
comes with this little velcro strip on

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.760 
comes with this little velcro strip on
it<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.180> can<00:04:32.479> wrap<00:04:32.659> it<00:04:32.720> up<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.259> then<00:04:33.470> just

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
it so you can wrap it up and then just

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.490 
it so you can wrap it up and then just
transport<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.400> easily<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:35.150> this<00:04:36.020> little

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
transport it easily and this little

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.189 
transport it easily and this little
triangle<00:04:37.250> thing<00:04:37.550> so<00:04:38.240> it's<00:04:38.569> good<00:04:38.780> for<00:04:38.810> Mike

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
triangle thing so it's good for Mike

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.580 
triangle thing so it's good for Mike
transporting<00:04:39.889> around<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:41.289> all<00:04:42.289> that<00:04:42.319> tech

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
transporting around and all that tech

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.939 
transporting around and all that tech
stuff

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
stuff

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.450 
stuff
so<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.639> side<00:04:43.819> iron<00:04:44.060> actually<00:04:44.680> has<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:46.099> lot<00:04:46.430> of

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
so the side iron actually has a lot of

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.529 
so the side iron actually has a lot of
temperature<00:04:47.270> settings<00:04:47.690> that<00:04:47.810> goes<00:04:47.960> from<00:04:49.539> 248

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
temperature settings that goes from 248

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.460 
temperature settings that goes from 248
degrees<00:04:50.599> Fahrenheit<00:04:51.229> all<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:52.220> way<00:04:52.340> to<00:04:53.470> four

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
degrees Fahrenheit all the way to four

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.740

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
hundred and fifty-five degrees and it

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.659 
hundred and fifty-five degrees and it
has<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:56.930> LED<00:04:57.409> light<00:04:57.590> to<00:04:57.919> tell<00:04:58.099> you<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.340> it's<00:04:58.490> on

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.200 
has a LED light to tell you that it's on
and<00:04:58.879> has<00:04:59.090> on/off<00:04:59.659> switch<00:04:59.930> like<00:05:00.310> it<00:05:01.310> should<00:05:01.550> so

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
and has on/off switch like it should so

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.939 
and has on/off switch like it should so
I<00:05:03.610> would<00:05:04.610> definitely<00:05:04.759> recommend<00:05:05.120> this<00:05:05.599> to
