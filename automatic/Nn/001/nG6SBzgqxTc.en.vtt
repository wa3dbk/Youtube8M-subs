00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.719 

I<00:02:07.080> think<00:02:08.080> it's<00:02:08.260> a<00:02:08.350> lot<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:09.040> things<00:02:09.190> well<00:02:09.550> he's

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
I think it's a lot of things well he's

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.880 
I think it's a lot of things well he's
more<00:02:10.420> experience<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.110> better<00:02:11.140> he's<00:02:11.500> getting

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
more experience the better he's getting

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.130 
more experience the better he's getting
and<00:02:12.070> he<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.460> consistent<00:02:13.150> hard<00:02:13.540> worker<00:02:13.780> he

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
and he is a consistent hard worker he

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.250 
and he is a consistent hard worker he
takes<00:02:14.560> care<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:14.860> his<00:02:15.070> weight<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:16.260> would

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.130 
takes care of his weight I would
guarantee<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:18.190> nobody<00:02:18.580> is<00:02:18.760> with<00:02:19.090> class<00:02:19.360> is

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
guarantee that nobody is with class is

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.230 
guarantee that nobody is with class is
heavier<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.740> summer<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.190> he<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.520> but<00:02:22.150> he

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
heavier in summer the he is but he

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.150 
heavier in summer the he is but he
brings<00:02:22.630> his<00:02:22.750> way<00:02:22.959> down<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.709> then<00:02:23.830> he<00:02:23.980> can<00:02:24.100> turn

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
brings his way down and then he can turn

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.800 
brings his way down and then he can turn
around<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.670> still<00:02:24.970> make<00:02:25.180> conditioning<00:02:25.720> a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
around and still make conditioning a

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.020 
around and still make conditioning a
factor<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:27.040> leave<00:02:27.220> him<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.580> man

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
factor if you leave him in the man

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.540 
factor if you leave him in the man
let<00:02:28.990> him<00:02:29.080> hang<00:02:29.260> around<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.160> think<00:02:33.280> its

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
let him hang around so I think its

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.260 
let him hang around so I think its
commitment<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:35.190> lot<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.220> lot<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.610> things<00:02:36.730> he's
