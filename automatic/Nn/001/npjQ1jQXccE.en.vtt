00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
other than to say that I think it's very

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.100

clear<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.730> we<00:02:51.239> have<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.690> both<00:02:51.900> a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
clear that we have to have both a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.490 
clear that we have to have both a
security<00:02:52.920> dimension<00:02:53.610> alongside<00:02:54.330> any<00:02:55.050> kind<00:02:55.380> of

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
security dimension alongside any kind of

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.009 
security dimension alongside any kind of
discussion<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.280> reconciliation<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
discussion of reconciliation and in the

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.750 
discussion of reconciliation and in the
end<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.320> reconciliation<00:02:58.709> process<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.640> going

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
end that reconciliation process is going

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.940 
end that reconciliation process is going
to<00:02:59.850> be<00:02:59.940> an<00:03:00.000> Afghan<00:03:00.390> process<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.050> has<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.620> do

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
to be an Afghan process it has to I do

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.610 
to be an Afghan process it has to I do
want<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.220> make<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> point<00:03:02.670> about<00:03:02.850> reintegration

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
want to make a point about reintegration

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.199 
want to make a point about reintegration
which<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.860> bringing<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.670> Taliban

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
which is bringing in the Taliban

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.479 
which is bringing in the Taliban
fighters<00:03:06.780> who<00:03:07.560> are<00:03:07.709> willing<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.220> lay<00:03:08.459> down

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
fighters who are willing to lay down

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.070 
fighters who are willing to lay down
their<00:03:08.820> arms<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.330> think<00:03:09.570> there's<00:03:09.750> real

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
their arms I think there's real

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.810 
their arms I think there's real
potential<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.220> we're<00:03:11.670> going<00:03:11.790> to

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
potential in that and we're going to

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.300 
potential in that and we're going to
move<00:03:12.030> very<00:03:12.269> aggressively<00:03:12.989> after<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
move very aggressively after the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.460 
move very aggressively after the
reintegration<00:03:14.610> piece<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.690> reconciliation

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
reintegration piece the reconciliation

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.440 
reintegration piece the reconciliation
piece<00:03:16.709> again<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.340> think<00:03:17.400> isn't<00:03:17.850> going<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:18.360> have

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
piece again I think isn't going to have

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.420 
piece again I think isn't going to have
to<00:03:18.540> be<00:03:18.630> an<00:03:18.720> afghan-led<00:03:19.230> process<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.340> it's

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
to be an afghan-led process and it's

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.500 
to be an afghan-led process and it's
going<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.579> have<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.760> run<00:03:20.970> parallel<00:03:21.480> to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
going to have to run parallel to
