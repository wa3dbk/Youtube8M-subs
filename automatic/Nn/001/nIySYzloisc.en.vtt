00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
dough should start to form now we can

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.620 
dough should start to form now we can
use<00:01:14.450> our<00:01:14.840> hand<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.320> knead<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.619> dough<00:01:15.650> together

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
use our hand to knead the dough together

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.330 
use our hand to knead the dough together
the<00:01:17.630> dough<00:01:17.840> is<00:01:18.080> dry<00:01:18.290> at<00:01:18.500> first<00:01:18.770> but<00:01:18.950> we<00:01:19.130> will

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
the dough is dry at first but we will

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.570 
the dough is dry at first but we will
add<00:01:19.550> water<00:01:19.760> a<00:01:20.030> little<00:01:20.330> bit<00:01:20.570> at<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.840> time<00:01:21.580> let's

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
add water a little bit at a time let's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.520 
add water a little bit at a time let's
add<00:01:22.760> just<00:01:23.090> one<00:01:23.270> tablespoon<00:01:23.690> of<00:01:24.050> water<00:01:24.230> and

add just one tablespoon of water and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.060 
add just one tablespoon of water and
then<00:01:24.800> continue<00:01:25.430> kneading<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.880> dough<00:01:25.910> a<00:01:27.070> quick

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
then continue kneading the dough a quick

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.100 
then continue kneading the dough a quick
test<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.460> see<00:01:28.730> if<00:01:28.760> your<00:01:29.000> dough<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:29.360> too<00:01:29.390> dry<00:01:29.840> is

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
test to see if your dough is too dry is

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.140 
test to see if your dough is too dry is
to<00:01:30.440> take<00:01:30.650> a<00:01:30.680> small<00:01:31.070> amount<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:31.580> stretch<00:01:31.970> it

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
to take a small amount and stretch it

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.690 
to take a small amount and stretch it
out<00:01:32.270> if<00:01:32.510> it<00:01:33.080> cracks<00:01:33.350> it's<00:01:33.740> too<00:01:34.040> dry<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.490> we

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
out if it cracks it's too dry and we

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.120 
out if it cracks it's too dry and we
need<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:34.970> add<00:01:35.090> more<00:01:35.360> water<00:01:35.710> let's<00:01:36.710> add<00:01:36.920> another

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
need to add more water let's add another

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.310 
need to add more water let's add another
tablespoon<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:38.150> water<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:38.660> continue

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
tablespoon of water and continue

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.770 
tablespoon of water and continue
kneading<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.770> dough<00:01:40.030> now<00:01:41.030> we<00:01:41.090> see<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.630> dough

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
kneading the dough now we see the dough

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.200 
kneading the dough now we see the dough
is<00:01:41.810> nice<00:01:42.230> and<00:01:42.440> smooth<00:01:42.800> without<00:01:43.070> being<00:01:43.640> overly

long now we cut the log in half and

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.359 
long now we cut the log in half and
then<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.230> half<00:02:04.440> again<00:02:04.650> cut<00:02:07.070> each<00:02:08.070> of<00:02:08.280> the

smaller sections into three equal pieces
once<00:02:12.660> done<00:02:12.990> we<00:02:13.170> should<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.500> 12<00:02:13.800> pieces<00:02:14.010> of

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
once done we should have 12 pieces of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.150 
once done we should have 12 pieces of
dough<00:02:14.900> before<00:02:15.900> we<00:02:16.260> start<00:02:16.530> rolling<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.950> balls

cover<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.700> dough<00:02:17.880> with<00:02:17.910> plastic<00:02:18.090> wrap<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.960> it

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
cover the dough with plastic wrap so it

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.260 
cover the dough with plastic wrap so it
doesn't<00:02:19.380> dry<00:02:19.620> out<00:02:19.650> take<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> section<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:21.120> the
