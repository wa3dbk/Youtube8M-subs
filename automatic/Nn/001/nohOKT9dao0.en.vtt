 nothing more in a compressed file 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.620
 you extract it from success since what 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.230
 they extract it run as administrator 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.730
 that made clear to them if they do not execute it as 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.590
 administrator can not do any 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.490
 good process once we are already 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.300
