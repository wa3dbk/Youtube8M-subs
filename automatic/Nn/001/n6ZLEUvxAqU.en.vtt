flower<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> sword<00:00:40.290> now<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
flower with a sword now this is just a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.360 
flower with a sword now this is just a
basic<00:00:42.239> figure<00:00:42.809> eight<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.620> passes<00:00:43.920> each

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
basic figure eight and it passes each

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.840 
basic figure eight and it passes each
side<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.850> body<00:00:45.059> once<00:00:46.309> also<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.640> should

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
side of the body once also you should

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.510 
side of the body once also you should
know<00:00:48.000> how<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.750> double<00:00:48.960> weapon<00:00:49.520> upward

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
know how to do the double weapon upward

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.119 
know how to do the double weapon upward
flower<00:00:50.789> now<00:00:51.600> again<00:00:51.960> each<00:00:52.320> weapon<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.980> only

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
flower now again each weapon is only

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.970 
flower now again each weapon is only
passing<00:00:53.699> by<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.030> body<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.899> time<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.800> it's

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
passing by the body one time so it's

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.610 
passing by the body one time so it's
that<00:00:56.219> figure<00:00:56.670> eight<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.440> top

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
that figure eight it's just one on top

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.369 
that figure eight it's just one on top
of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.920> other<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.370> alternating<00:00:59.879> timing<00:01:00.539> now

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
of the other with alternating timing now

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.869 
of the other with alternating timing now
the<00:01:01.440> thing<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.699> notice

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the thing about this is if you notice

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.750 
the thing about this is if you notice
one<00:01:03.510> hand<00:01:03.870> stays<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.710> top<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> other<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
one hand stays on top of the other as I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.120 
one hand stays on top of the other as I
do<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.810> doesn't<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.170> exchange<00:01:07.770> over

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
do this it doesn't really exchange over

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.280 
do this it doesn't really exchange over
and<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.119> flower<00:01:09.510> we're<00:01:10.170> going

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and that's what this flower we're going

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.240 
and that's what this flower we're going
to<00:01:10.350> work<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.799> exchange<00:01:11.010> over<00:01:12.770> okay<00:01:13.770> so

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
to work on that exchange over okay so

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.580 
to work on that exchange over okay so
let's<00:01:14.760> take<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.119> apart<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> simply<00:01:16.350> do

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
let's take it apart now to simply do

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.440 
let's take it apart now to simply do
this<00:01:16.770> we're<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> isolate<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.790> side<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
this we're going to isolate one side and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.910 
this we're going to isolate one side and
just<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.590> don't<00:01:19.680> really

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
just so you can see you don't really

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
just so you can see you don't really
need<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> practice<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.880> you're<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> do

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
need to practice this you're going to do

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.249 
need to practice this you're going to do
two<00:01:22.380> loops<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.299> pass<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.810> front<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.140> your

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
two loops as you pass the front of your

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.100 
two loops as you pass the front of your
body<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.060> pass<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.570> back<00:01:27.780> side

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
body and one as you pass the back side

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.640 
body and one as you pass the back side
of<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> body

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
of the body

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.010 
of the body
so<00:01:29.130> rather<00:01:29.460> than<00:01:29.820> doing<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.240> regular<00:01:30.420> figure

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
so rather than doing the regular figure

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.620 
so rather than doing the regular figure
eight<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.920> upward<00:01:32.340> flower<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.479> goes

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
eight with the upward flower as it goes

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.910 
eight with the upward flower as it goes
in<00:01:33.780> front<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.020> our<00:01:34.110> body<00:01:34.259> we're<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.770> move

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
in front of our body we're going to move

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.530 
in front of our body we're going to move
one<00:01:35.280> more<00:01:35.549> time<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.210> then

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
one more time and then

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.500 
one more time and then
come<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.750> behind<00:01:36.960> us<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.190> it's<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.880> type<00:01:39.480> of

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
come up behind us so it's this type of

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.230 
come up behind us so it's this type of
motion<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.890> should<00:01:41.190> feel<00:01:41.460> awkward<00:01:41.790> because

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
motion this should feel awkward because

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.420 
motion this should feel awkward because
it<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.470> once<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.860> involve<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.280> other

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
it is but once we involve the other

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.430 
it is but once we involve the other
weapon<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.210> works<00:01:45.780> out<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.050> little<00:01:46.260> bit

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
weapon it's it works out a little bit

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.430 
weapon it's it works out a little bit
easier<00:01:46.670> now<00:01:47.670> we're<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> again<00:01:48.810> separate

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
easier now we're going to again separate

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.990 
easier now we're going to again separate
the<00:01:49.590> technique<00:01:49.980> we'll<00:01:50.190> only<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.760> our

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the technique we'll only going to do our

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.120 
the technique we'll only going to do our
right<00:01:51.210> hand<00:01:51.480> side<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.410> my<00:01:52.560> right<00:01:52.740> hand<00:01:52.950> I

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
right hand side so in my right hand I

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.530 
right hand side so in my right hand I
have<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.460> red<00:01:53.700> one<00:01:53.910> so<00:01:54.120> you<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.360> follow

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
have this red one so you can follow

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.969 
have this red one so you can follow
along<00:01:54.690> in<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.320> left<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
along in the left one I have the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.000 
along in the left one I have the
blackheath<00:01:56.430> okay<00:01:57.300> so<00:01:57.750> from<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.500> we're<00:01:58.890> going

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
blackheath okay so from here we're going

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.150 
blackheath okay so from here we're going
to<00:01:59.070> focus<00:01:59.220> on<00:01:59.490> three<00:01:59.790> cuts<00:02:00.440> leading<00:02:01.440> with<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
to focus on three cuts leading with the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.460 
to focus on three cuts leading with the
right<00:02:02.190> now<00:02:03.150> our<00:02:03.360> left<00:02:03.660> hand<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.050> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> come

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
right now our left hand is going to come

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.830 
right now our left hand is going to come
up<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:05.370> our<00:02:05.580> right<00:02:05.820> hand<00:02:06.090> has<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.450> loop<00:02:06.690> around

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
up now our right hand has to loop around

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.540 
up now our right hand has to loop around
make<00:02:07.500> sure<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:07.860> left<00:02:08.070> hand<00:02:08.340> stays

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
make sure your left hand stays

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.940 
make sure your left hand stays
underneath<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.360> then<00:02:09.929> right<00:02:10.470> hand<00:02:10.740> is<00:02:10.890> going

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
underneath and then right hand is going

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.060 
underneath and then right hand is going
to<00:02:11.100> come<00:02:11.160> back<00:02:11.430> as<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:12.390> go<00:02:12.540> across

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
to come back as we go across

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.160 
to come back as we go across
okay<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:14.130> again<00:02:14.459> this<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.600> my<00:02:15.930> right

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
okay so again this is just for my right

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.949 
okay so again this is just for my right
side<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.740> body<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.820> again<00:02:18.330> I'm<00:02:18.570> going<00:02:18.840> to

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
side of the body so again I'm going to

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.220 
side of the body so again I'm going to
lead<00:02:19.320> with<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.890> right<00:02:20.070> hand<00:02:20.660> follow<00:02:21.660> with<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
lead with the right hand follow with the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.010 
lead with the right hand follow with the
left<00:02:22.590> hand<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.190> then<00:02:23.670> loop<00:02:23.940> over<00:02:24.690> with<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
left hand and then loop over with the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.110 
left hand and then loop over with the
right<00:02:25.200> hand<00:02:25.530> one<00:02:25.800> more<00:02:25.830> time<00:02:26.100> as<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.760> bring<00:02:26.970> it

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
right hand one more time as I bring it

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.530 
right hand one more time as I bring it
across<00:02:27.739> okay<00:02:28.739> again<00:02:29.430> lead<00:02:30.390> follow<00:02:31.160> loop<00:02:32.510> okay

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
across okay again lead follow loop okay

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.900 
across okay again lead follow loop okay
setting<00:02:34.140> us<00:02:34.260> up<00:02:34.380> for<00:02:34.440> our<00:02:34.680> other<00:02:34.890> side<00:02:35.220> again

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
setting us up for our other side again

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.759 
setting us up for our other side again
lead<00:02:36.780> follow<00:02:37.790> loop<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.260> course<00:02:40.380> this

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
lead follow loop and then of course this

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.740 
lead follow loop and then of course this
is<00:02:40.920> where<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.190> would<00:02:41.310> unwind<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:42.120> then<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:42.570> our

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
is where we would unwind and then do our

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.400 
is where we would unwind and then do our
other<00:02:42.930> side<00:02:43.640> take<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.209> practice<00:02:45.870> both

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
other side take this in practice both

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.470 
other side take this in practice both
sides<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.250> then<00:02:47.700> we'll<00:02:47.820> go<00:02:47.940> on<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.269> next

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
sides and then we'll go on to the next

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.930 
sides and then we'll go on to the next
step<00:02:48.840> okay<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:49.860> for<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.310> step<00:02:50.580> we're<00:02:50.790> going

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
step okay so for this step we're going

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.270 
step okay so for this step we're going
to<00:02:51.030> combine<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.690> movement<00:02:52.200> from<00:02:52.739> right<00:02:53.070> and

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
to combine the movement from right and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.850 
to combine the movement from right and
left<00:02:53.489> side<00:02:54.030> now<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.810> best<00:02:55.200> way<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.470> do<00:02:55.709> this

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
left side now the best way to do this

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.860 
left side now the best way to do this
and<00:02:56.070> stay<00:02:56.280> consistent<00:02:56.549> is<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.420> pay<00:02:57.600> attention

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
and stay consistent is to pay attention

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.350 
and stay consistent is to pay attention
to<00:02:58.110> where<00:02:58.380> your<00:02:58.500> arm<00:02:58.680> comes<00:02:58.980> underneath

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
to where your arm comes underneath

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.330 
to where your arm comes underneath
remember<00:03:00.360> for<00:03:00.600> our<00:03:00.660> first<00:03:00.959> flower<00:03:01.350> one<00:03:02.070> hand

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
remember for our first flower one hand

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.000 
remember for our first flower one hand
always<00:03:02.519> stayed<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.180> top<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.959> other<00:03:04.170> for

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
always stayed on top of the other for

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.009 
always stayed on top of the other for
this<00:03:05.220> one<00:03:05.489> each<00:03:05.820> hand<00:03:06.269> will<00:03:06.540> spend<00:03:06.810> some<00:03:06.959> time

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
this one each hand will spend some time

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.470 
this one each hand will spend some time
underneath<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.980> other<00:03:08.130> barn<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:09.299> is

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
underneath the other barn and this is

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.380 
underneath the other barn and this is
done<00:03:09.660> when<00:03:10.049> coming<00:03:10.410> up<00:03:10.560> from<00:03:10.799> one<00:03:11.040> side<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:12.269> go

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
done when coming up from one side to go

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.420 
done when coming up from one side to go
across<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.019> other<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.620> if<00:03:13.709> my<00:03:13.860> right<00:03:14.130> hand

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
across to the other so if my right hand

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.640 
across to the other so if my right hand
is<00:03:14.549> coming<00:03:14.790> across<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.720> goes<00:03:15.959> underneath<00:03:16.380> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
is coming across it goes underneath the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.270 
is coming across it goes underneath the
left<00:03:16.860> arm

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
left arm

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.060 
left arm
I<00:03:17.400> will<00:03:18.090> unwind<00:03:18.269> my<00:03:19.140> left<00:03:19.410> arm<00:03:19.650> will<00:03:19.799> end<00:03:19.950> up

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
I will unwind my left arm will end up

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.030 
I will unwind my left arm will end up
underneath<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.760> then<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.209> will<00:03:21.360> cross<00:03:22.040> unwind

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
underneath and then I will cross unwind

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.810 
underneath and then I will cross unwind
go<00:03:23.760> underneath<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.480> across<00:03:25.370> unwind<00:03:26.370> go

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
go underneath and across unwind go

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.960 
go underneath and across unwind go
underneath<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.870> curl<00:03:28.080> this<00:03:28.640> once<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.760> get

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
underneath and it curl this once you get

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.660 
underneath and it curl this once you get
this<00:03:30.150> down<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:30.840> touch<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.769> arms<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.549> get

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
this down and you touch the arms and get

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.550 
this down and you touch the arms and get
used<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.269> remembering<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.170> your<00:03:34.320> arm

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
used to that remembering that your arm

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.650 
used to that remembering that your arm
goes<00:03:34.830> underneath<00:03:35.160> before<00:03:35.610> crossing<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.360> body

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
goes underneath before crossing the body

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.440 
goes underneath before crossing the body
it's<00:03:37.530> time<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.040> speed<00:03:38.340> up<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.760> tighten<00:03:39.090> up<00:03:39.269> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
it's time to speed up and tighten up the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.990 
it's time to speed up and tighten up the
flower<00:03:39.720> keeping<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.440> wrists<00:03:40.830> together<00:03:41.040> and

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
flower keeping the wrists together and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.390
