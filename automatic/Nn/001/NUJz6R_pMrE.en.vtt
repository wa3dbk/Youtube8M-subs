00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.279
 Hello Monday you have the hat Allows the coach and therapist man 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.220
 actually owns AG 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.500
 Nuremberg 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.240
 time and again I am asked why change does not succeed and there is 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.949
 a very different answer up 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.450
 People always do that 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.900
 What we can do the easiest is the least difficult 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.460
 At the same time, this is a close guest, which is good 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.679
 We also do that as a cleaning lady or old convenience or the doctor 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.720
 because they have recorded 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.460
 and not otherwise 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.989
 this is similar to honoring the CIS 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.410
 and I have now seen a report 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.500
 is transferred to the old part in a whole ungeschÃ¶nt Tierpark 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.059
 he defies 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.780
 immense space 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.360
 still running in circles 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.880
 he does not change his advice even though he is far away in the mountains 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.890
 could 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.310
 and humans are similar, we are reluctant to leave the comfort zone 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.750
 we do not give up security though we want freedom 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.229
 and if freedom 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.949
 to 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.629
 would have to give up a piece of assurance but life wants us to serve it too 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.410
 really is acting 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.320
 and we all want to be lucky 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.370
 us lucky 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.140
 It's easy to describe happiness is a Low German word 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.140
 are 1600 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.130
 and originally comes from the Local 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.940
 also the English Lakic 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.899
 us this word luck in a figurative sense the hatch 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.570
 means nothing else 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.490
 the cycles 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.299
 we humans are happy then 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.190
 when the cycles really close 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.630
 I always like to compare them 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.630
 with a house of personality 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.020
 Janne maybe 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.280
 yes 6 7 or 8 rooms 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.020
 and when we start 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.310
 painting the first room in the early morning perhaps in the colors red 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.320
 stop by the others 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.950
 and start in the next 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.950
 to delete aloud 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.060
 also stop there again 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.850
 Next time try again to paint a little blue and so on 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.590
 continue 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.400
 then you can imagine what happens 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.079
 in the evening of the same day 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.409
 Hanning did not do her much, but she did not finish 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.029
 has not finished 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.200
 this dissatisfied 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.650
 would have been in the early morning 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.230
 completely painted in the room 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.779
 next to the view 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.030
 and so does that in life, even if they can not finish it 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.739
 Do not close trains and in daily life 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.909
 then the decision is his contracts are not terminated or professional 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.219
 Things that just are not changed then we become more natural 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.529
 wise 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:35.319
 the question arises at this point why are we so damaging a house 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.699
 in blue and green or red 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.200
 how to do it is also for others 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.320
 and not for ourselves we like others 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.249
 and the diminished that our self-confidence belongs to our self 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.039
 we feel after others 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.639
 In the animal kingdom, there are only limited 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.629
 quite simply and clearly to see the clinical pictures with me 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.029
 Reptiles, for example, can also be very intense 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:00.659
 to get 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.430
 why because they also feel socially and, so to speak, no social relationships 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.459
 and thunderous 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.339
 and do not sympathize for the other 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:12.089
 Dog cat and human can let students get diseases 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.730
 gets 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.290
 because they are an expression of that maybe they 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.559
 not done for ourselves 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:23.289
 our behavior is therefore always determined by the expected consequences 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:25.699
 A simple example of the lemons 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.429
 the title the thrones of the hand and 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.579
 Something moving for me that sounds like she was dying to death 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.429
 we all know 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.259
 she is very angry 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:35.939
 and when we bite 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.839
 So that's what you're going to talk about food for now 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:42.309
 and also with them the salivation flow activated 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:44.920
 that is, their mirror neurons work brilliantly 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.200
 and you feel Vilbel is similar with when I cut my hand 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.739
 would 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.739
 they will suddenly power down and say 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.109
 ensured after the bike wheel 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.369
 they do not feel 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:04:00.269
 and that shows Vigier thinking socially with others compassion 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.269
 and also fun in terms of others acting 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.349
 a nice example of a human together 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.349
 is our classic family system 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:12.729
 father 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:14.329
 two little children 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.949
 an intact family 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.620
 when the parents are well 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.979
 then the children can go back 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.050
 everyone is growing 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.979
 to us with the other 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.819
 each one is self-developed 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.819
 through each other with the opposite 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.550
 the DIG is determined by the knee 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.250
 would have to stop 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.430
 the family is an important aspect 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.120
 to find security in our lives 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.080
 and the way things change 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.939
 The ITI is changing as well 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.599
 to them system 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.479
 maybe the man leaves 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.479
 the system and again new system 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:55.969
 he dies 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:57.550
 naturally 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.900
 the mother has to 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.289
 Everything else, therefore, takes over 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.280
 and that without will feel very soon 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.009
 that he can support the mother 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.449
 maybe even his real size Indians will grow everywhere 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:11.809
 and want the father 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:13.370
 completely replace 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.490
 that will be the mature because they do not do well 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.330
 if arrange because learn from it 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
 it has no major consequences 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.550
 but there are always aspects 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.669
 where the failure of relationships 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.589
 in the body expresses 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:31.430
 with thyroid problems 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.830
 heart problems 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.120
 Lauenau Themes 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.289
 perfection 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.410
 over claim 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.120
 everything exactly to life 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.129
 every organ every disease 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.990
 has a specific picture so these people has happened 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.650
 sees in it wanting to learn more 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.629
 I would be glad if you contact me 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.870
 and how to discuss your personal concerns 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.999
 Thank you very much 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.849
 maybe see you soon
