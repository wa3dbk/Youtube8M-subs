from<00:00:05.100> osmosis<00:00:05.580> we've<00:00:06.540> been<00:00:06.930> working<00:00:07.230> for<00:00:07.379> a

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
from osmosis we've been working for a

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.020 
from osmosis we've been working for a
long<00:00:07.470> time<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.130> trying<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.460> come<00:00:08.610> up<00:00:08.760> with<00:00:08.880> ways

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
long time on trying to come up with ways

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.120 
long time on trying to come up with ways
to<00:00:09.240> treat<00:00:09.480> age<00:00:09.960> spots<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:12.590> what<00:00:13.590> I've<00:00:13.710> come<00:00:13.740> to

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
to treat age spots and what I've come to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.070 
to treat age spots and what I've come to
learn<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.730> age<00:00:15.000> spots<00:00:15.360> are<00:00:15.570> really<00:00:15.839> just

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
learn is that age spots are really just

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.950 
learn is that age spots are really just
a<00:00:16.170> reflection<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> skin<00:00:17.390> being<00:00:18.390> in<00:00:18.840> a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
a reflection of the skin being in a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.840 
a reflection of the skin being in a
really<00:00:19.289> distressed<00:00:19.740> state<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.460> when<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.699> gets

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
really distressed state so when it gets

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.269 
really distressed state so when it gets
really<00:00:21.090> injured<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.840> sends<00:00:22.650> out<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.769> message<00:00:22.859> to

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
really injured it sends out a message to

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.120 
really injured it sends out a message to
the<00:00:23.730> cells<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.689> make<00:00:24.990> your<00:00:25.199> pigment<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.039> it

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
says please create a little protective

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.890 
says please create a little protective
cloud<00:00:28.140> over<00:00:28.529> me<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.539> prevent<00:00:30.539> me<00:00:30.660> from<00:00:30.689> getting

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
cloud over me to prevent me from getting

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.840 
cloud over me to prevent me from getting
more<00:00:31.050> damaged<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.740> that's<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.610> call<00:00:32.730> an

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
more damaged and that's what we call an

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.940 
more damaged and that's what we call an
age<00:00:33.000> spot<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.960> our<00:00:34.290> minds<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.800> this

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
age spot so in our minds it's this

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.799 
age spot so in our minds it's this
imperfection<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.030> shouldn't<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.510> but

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
imperfection that we shouldn't have but

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.420 
imperfection that we shouldn't have but
for<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.050> skin<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.500> really<00:00:37.590> something

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
for the skin it's really something

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.360 
for the skin it's really something
protected<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.570> since<00:00:40.500> I've<00:00:40.620> formulated<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
protected so since I've formulated the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.549 
protected so since I've formulated the
the<00:00:41.910> line<00:00:42.090> I've<00:00:42.420> never<00:00:42.660> been<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> big<00:00:43.200> fan<00:00:43.260> of

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the line I've never been a big fan of

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.889 
the line I've never been a big fan of
wanting<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.280> reduce<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.360> amount<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.660> color

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
wanting to reduce the amount of color

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.180 
wanting to reduce the amount of color
your<00:00:46.170> skin<00:00:46.289> makes<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:46.770> that's<00:00:47.010> what

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
your skin makes because that's what

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.790 
your skin makes because that's what
protects<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> Sun<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.590> came<00:00:49.739> up

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
protects you from the Sun so we came up

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.799 
protects you from the Sun so we came up
first<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> DNA<00:00:50.700> repair<00:00:50.820> serum<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.539> had<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
first with a DNA repair serum that had a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.100 
first with a DNA repair serum that had a
tremendous<00:00:52.320> effect<00:00:52.610> effect<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.760> pigment<00:00:54.390> but

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
tremendous effect effect on pigment but

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.600 
tremendous effect effect on pigment but
now<00:00:55.320> we've<00:00:55.649> actually<00:00:55.770> come<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> way<00:00:56.579> to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
now we've actually come up with a way to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.660 
now we've actually come up with a way to
heal<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:58.109> skin<00:00:58.410> enough<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.340> doesn't

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
heal the skin enough so that it doesn't

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
heal the skin enough so that it doesn't
make<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> request<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.960> protection

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
make the request for that protection

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.439 
make the request for that protection
anymore<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.520> age<00:01:02.699> spots<00:01:03.030> literally

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
anymore and the age spots literally

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.270 
anymore and the age spots literally
disappear<00:01:03.960> from<00:01:04.080> your<00:01:04.290> face<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.799> they<00:01:05.100> don't

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
disappear from your face and they don't

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.750 
disappear from your face and they don't
come<00:01:05.400> back<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.900> found<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.560> our<00:01:08.490> early

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
use it twice a day and it and it works

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.410 
use it twice a day and it and it works
to<00:01:48.329> remove<00:01:49.170> or<00:01:49.860> heal<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> pigment<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
to remove or heal the pigment and the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.760 
to remove or heal the pigment and the
way<00:01:51.540> it'll<00:01:51.689> work<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:52.079> you'll<00:01:52.259> actually<00:01:52.409> see

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
way it'll work is you'll actually see

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.179 
way it'll work is you'll actually see
your<00:01:52.979> age<00:01:53.159> spots<00:01:53.930> peeling<00:01:54.930> as<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.799> skin<00:01:56.070> is

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
your age spots peeling as the skin is

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.440 
your age spots peeling as the skin is
healing<00:01:56.520> them<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.790> rest<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.060> your<00:01:57.149> skin<00:01:57.329> isn't

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
healing them the rest of your skin isn't

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.060 
healing them the rest of your skin isn't
peeling<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> age<00:01:58.259> spot<00:01:58.560> itself<00:01:58.920> which

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
peeling just the age spot itself which

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.709 
peeling just the age spot itself which
is<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.219> interesting<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.630> will

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
is really interesting and then it will

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.240 
is really interesting and then it will
break<00:02:00.899> up<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.290> almost<00:02:01.500> look<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:01.680> puzzles

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
break up and it almost look like puzzles

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.330 
break up and it almost look like puzzles
are<00:02:02.369> missing<00:02:02.670> from<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.000> puzzle<00:02:04.130> pieces<00:02:05.130> are

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
are missing from a puzzle pieces are

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.000 
are missing from a puzzle pieces are
missing

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
missing

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.800 
missing
and<00:02:06.100> then<00:02:06.550> it<00:02:06.700> just<00:02:06.880> completely<00:02:07.210> disappears

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
and then it just completely disappears

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.320 
and then it just completely disappears
so<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:08.470> is<00:02:08.590> it's<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.920> daily<00:02:09.250> treatment<00:02:09.730> now<00:02:10.270> we

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
so it is it's a daily treatment now we

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.180 
so it is it's a daily treatment now we
do<00:02:10.570> also<00:02:10.870> have<00:02:11.080> an<00:02:11.170> internal<00:02:11.530> version<00:02:11.830> and

do also have an internal version and
that<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:12.970> actually<00:02:13.360> used<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.720> treat<00:02:14.050> melasma

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
that is actually used to treat melasma

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.590 
that is actually used to treat melasma
melasma<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.090> really<00:02:16.450> challenging

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600

condition<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.290> think<00:02:17.320> one<00:02:17.710> in<00:02:17.860> three<00:02:18.130> women

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
condition I think one in three women

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.440 
condition I think one in three women
with<00:02:18.580> birth<00:02:18.730> control<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:19.180> birth<00:02:19.420> control

with birth control on birth control

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.780 
with birth control on birth control

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
pills develop those dark spots on the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.200

forehead<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.390> lip<00:02:22.570> this<00:02:23.500> treats<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:23.980> and

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
forehead and the lip this treats it and

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.550 
forehead and the lip this treats it and
it<00:02:25.210> takes<00:02:25.420> again<00:02:25.690> three<00:02:25.960> to<00:02:26.050> six<00:02:26.230> months<00:02:26.500> to

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
it takes again three to six months to

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.140 
it takes again three to six months to
finish<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.070> process<00:02:27.520> but<00:02:27.730> it's<00:02:27.850> really

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
finish the process but it's really

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.620 
finish the process but it's really
exciting<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:29.290> what<00:02:29.410> are<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.590> other<00:02:29.710> benefits

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
exciting so what are the other benefits

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.090 
exciting so what are the other benefits
because<00:02:31.630> restore<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.440> effective<00:02:32.980> at

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
because restore is so effective at

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.920 
because restore is so effective at
healing<00:02:33.430> inflammation<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.180> that's<00:02:34.360> why<00:02:34.690> it's

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
healing inflammation and that's why it's

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.510 
healing inflammation and that's why it's
clearing<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.530> pigment<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:35.980> your<00:02:36.010> skin<00:02:36.160> is

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
because it heals the inflammation that

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.320 
because it heals the inflammation that
causes<00:02:38.020> it<00:02:38.410> when<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.430> take<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.640> internally<00:02:40.000> it

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330

heals inflammation internally and we've

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.400 
heals inflammation internally and we've
had<00:02:42.340> some<00:02:43.330> of<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.510> case<00:02:43.720> results<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.260> came

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
had some of the case results that came

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.590 
had some of the case results that came
out<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.710> 25<00:02:45.070> years<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.490> testing<00:02:45.850> found

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
out of the 25 years of testing found

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.260 
out of the 25 years of testing found
that<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.320> you<00:02:47.920> know<00:02:48.040> heals<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.850> liver<00:02:49.030> damage

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
that it you know heals the liver damage

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.140 
that it you know heals the liver damage
so<00:02:49.660> people<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.140> drink<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.440> lot<00:02:50.620> definitely<00:02:51.150> be

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
so people that drink a lot definitely be

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.080 
so people that drink a lot definitely be
on<00:02:52.270> restore<00:02:53.010> he<00:02:54.010> did<00:02:54.550> they<00:02:54.700> actually<00:02:54.850> did

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
on restore he did they actually did

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.180 
on restore he did they actually did
clinical<00:02:55.300> trials<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.870> Kenya<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.440> arthritis

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
clinical trials in Kenya on arthritis

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.560 
clinical trials in Kenya on arthritis
and<00:02:57.430> they<00:02:57.490> had<00:02:57.640> amazing<00:02:58.180> results<00:02:58.540> with

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
and they had amazing results with

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.240 
and they had amazing results with
rheumatoid<00:02:58.990> arthritis<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.590> arthritis<00:03:00.040> and

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
rheumatoid arthritis and arthritis and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.670 
rheumatoid arthritis and arthritis and
so<00:03:00.820> it's<00:03:01.180> it's<00:03:01.510> not<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.930> know<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.140> panacea

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
so it's it's not you know the panacea

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.980 
so it's it's not you know the panacea
for<00:03:02.740> everything<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:03.790> because<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.690> an<00:03:04.810> aunt

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
for everything but because it is an aunt

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.260 
for everything but because it is an aunt
it's<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.260> most<00:03:05.470> powerful<00:03:06.270> anti-inflammatory

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
it's the most powerful anti-inflammatory

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.190 
it's the most powerful anti-inflammatory
I've<00:03:07.960> ever<00:03:08.140> seen<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:09.700> literally<00:03:10.660> almost<00:03:10.870> any

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
I've ever seen it literally almost any

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.540 
I've ever seen it literally almost any

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
will be improved with it including

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.740 
will be improved with it including
melasma<00:03:15.459> like<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:15.970> mentioned<00:03:16.330> for<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.510> skin

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
melasma like I mentioned for the skin

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.010 
melasma like I mentioned for the skin
I'm<00:03:17.320> hoping<00:03:17.860> that<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:19.209> becomes<00:03:19.630> the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
I'm hoping that it becomes the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.220 
I'm hoping that it becomes the
mainstream<00:03:20.650> product<00:03:21.430> for<00:03:22.360> daily<00:03:22.630> use<00:03:22.780> for

mainstream product for daily use for

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.840 
mainstream product for daily use for
most<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.830> world<00:03:24.010> actually<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.820> know

most of the world actually and I know

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.800 
most of the world actually and I know
that's<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.239> big<00:03:26.050> request<00:03:26.830> but<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:28.360> people<00:03:28.630> that

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
that's a big request but the people that

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.750
