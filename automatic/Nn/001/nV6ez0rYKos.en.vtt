00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.850
 the chicken to the beer can is one of 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:17.330
 my favorite recipes we are going to put 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:17.330
 salt inside and pepper 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.010
 here are our beers the this 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.510
 bread 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.510
 and we will use only 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.700
 half a peak opener will 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.680
 we make more holes 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.880
 to the tin 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.180
 Y 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.730
 we are going to put salt 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.250
 we're going to put a little bit of beer 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.210
 of pepper to give it flavor 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.160
 we are going to varnish what I am going to varnish with 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.090
 paprika and oil because what you 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.090
 I want to give is color 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.970
 I think we're going to finish 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.390
 we take our can that is already 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.520
 prepared 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.490
 I'm going to place it on top of the tray 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.950
 because I want the chicken fat 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.380
 Drain on the tray and not on the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.420
 embers because that causes me a fire 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.420
 there we take the chicken 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.750
 and we assembled it 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.530
 and we are going to make a triple 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:31.220
 with both paws forward 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.350
 the beer can in the middle we doubled 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.350
 the wings for back 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.409
 I have indirect heat, this is 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.359
 heat from one side and heat from the other and in 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.740
 half I put a brick even if 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.280
 hot but I do not want it to have 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.090
 embers nor direct heat our chicken 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.090
 we put the grill 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.939
 we place 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.350
 or me 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.140
 and now to create the effect 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.140
 from the oven 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.540
 this is a mine market vat 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.940
 of the same material from which the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.300
 brazier to reach the cooking of 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.300
 chicken 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.370
 in the heat it's going to climb on top in the 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.020
 tina and we will cook the chicken now 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.020
 work in the big pass to carriÃ³ 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.430
 and I'm putting him in the part of 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.519
 above the tub 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.519
 to generate more heat 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.120
 when it takes inside the room 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.670
 an hour and a half depending on how 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.440
 big is the chicken 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.440
 it's been an hour and a half 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.260
 and I think our chicken is ready
