clean cakes don't necessarily need a
topper<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.130> tend<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.820> having<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
topper but I tend to like having a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.810 
topper but I tend to like having a
topper<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.920> top<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.250> cake<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.579> gives<00:01:41.729> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
topper on the top of the cake it gives a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.840 
topper on the top of the cake it gives a
little<00:01:41.909> more<00:01:42.060> height<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:44.369> gives

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
little more height and it gives

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.429 
little more height and it gives
something<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> eye<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.689> kind<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.380> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
something for the eye to kind of go to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.690 
something for the eye to kind of go to
and<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> little<00:01:47.490> bit<00:01:48.320> fun<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.590> little<00:01:50.340> silly
