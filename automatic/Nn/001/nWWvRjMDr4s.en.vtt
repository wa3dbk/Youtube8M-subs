00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.220 
should be nothing for the the shooter to
see<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:45.739> you<00:00:46.579> know<00:00:46.699> I<00:00:46.730> gave<00:00:46.879> Sid<00:00:47.300> like<00:00:47.780> four<00:00:48.170> or

see and you know I gave Sid like four or

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.139 
see and you know I gave Sid like four or
five<00:00:48.260> bucks<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.400> know<00:00:49.489> he'd<00:00:49.699> studied<00:00:49.940> me

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
five bucks and you know he'd studied me

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.209 
five bucks and you know he'd studied me
for<00:00:50.360> a<00:00:50.390> while<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.809> then<00:00:50.930> wind<00:00:51.140> up<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:51.680> sure

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219

for a while and then wind up and sure
enough<00:00:52.250> I<00:00:52.550> think<00:00:52.730> he<00:00:52.820> put<00:00:53.000> three<00:00:53.180> or<00:00:53.270> four<00:00:53.360> of

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
enough I think he put three or four of

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.150 
enough I think he put three or four of
them<00:00:53.660> in<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.020> like<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:54.199> know<00:00:54.440> obviously<00:00:55.070> I

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
them in and like you know obviously I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.560 
them in and like you know obviously I
was<00:00:55.340> just<00:00:55.489> there<00:00:55.640> not<00:00:55.879> moving<00:00:56.059> I<00:00:56.300> was<00:00:56.329> just

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
was just there not moving I was just

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.150 
was just there not moving I was just
seeing<00:00:56.750> if<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.020> could<00:00:57.170> hit<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:57.410> holes<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:57.920> it

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
seeing if you could hit the holes and it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.430 
seeing if you could hit the holes and it
was<00:00:58.520> much<00:00:58.699> for<00:00:58.940> me<00:00:59.059> as<00:00:59.239> for<00:00:59.840> him<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:00.199> I<00:01:00.230> could

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
was much for me as for him so I could

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.709 
was much for me as for him so I could
learn<00:01:00.559> where<00:01:00.770> those<00:01:00.949> holes<00:01:01.129> were<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:01.719> you

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
people don't realize this doesn't always

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.440

have<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:03.979> be<00:02:04.099> the<00:02:04.280> most<00:02:04.489> accurate<00:02:04.729> shot<00:02:05.119> or<00:02:05.360> the

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
have to be the most accurate shot or the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.910 
have to be the most accurate shot or the
hardest<00:02:05.780> shot<00:02:05.929> you<00:02:06.140> just<00:02:06.319> have<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.560> get<00:02:06.709> it<00:02:06.800> off

hardest shot you just have to get it off
quick<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:07.459> think<00:02:07.640> that's<00:02:07.819> what<00:02:07.970> he<00:02:08.060> really

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
quick and I think that's what he really

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.690 
quick and I think that's what he really
does<00:02:08.509> well<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.440> I'd<00:02:09.800> say<00:02:10.009> just<00:02:10.039> speed<00:02:10.489> and<00:02:10.670> a

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
does well so I'd say just speed and a

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.400 
does well so I'd say just speed and a
quick<00:02:10.910> release<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.480> something<00:02:12.170> he<00:02:12.290> really

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
quick release is something he really

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.470 
quick release is something he really
brings<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.830> table<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.400> finally<00:02:13.819> map<00:02:14.270> to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
brings the table and finally map to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.710 
brings the table and finally map to
