00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.210 
they work as money probably because they
are<00:04:00.220> money<00:04:00.549> fake<00:04:01.359> and<00:04:02.049> gold<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:03.010> gold

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
are money fake and gold is and the gold

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.069 
are money fake and gold is and the gold
and<00:04:03.400> silver<00:04:03.639> really<00:04:03.910> aren't<00:04:04.239> an<00:04:04.359> investment

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
and silver really aren't an investment

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.839 
and silver really aren't an investment
because<00:04:05.410> they<00:04:05.650> can't<00:04:05.919> self-replicate

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
because they can't self-replicate

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.319 
because they can't self-replicate
themselves<00:04:07.419> like<00:04:07.569> a<00:04:07.599> fiat<00:04:07.959> currency<00:04:08.500> unit<00:04:08.799> can

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
themselves like a fiat currency unit can

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.140 
themselves like a fiat currency unit can
