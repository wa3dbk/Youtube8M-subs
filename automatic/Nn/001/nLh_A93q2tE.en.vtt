00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
if I slow down the double stroke roll in

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.150 
if I slow down the double stroke roll in
slow<00:00:10.840> motion<00:00:11.139> here<00:00:11.650> and<00:00:11.830> show<00:00:11.980> what's

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
slow motion here and show what's

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.980 
slow motion here and show what's
actually<00:00:12.309> going<00:00:12.639> on<00:00:12.820> you<00:00:12.969> can<00:00:13.120> see<00:00:13.299> what's

actually going on you can see what's

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.030 
actually going on you can see what's
actually<00:00:14.139> happening<00:00:14.620> when<00:00:14.740> you<00:00:14.830> play<00:00:15.009> a

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
actually happening when you play a

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.839 
actually happening when you play a
double<00:00:15.550> is<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:17.320> bring<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:17.920> stick<00:00:18.160> down<00:00:18.400> onto

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849 
double is you bring the stick down onto

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.380 
double is you bring the stick down onto
the<00:00:18.880> head<00:00:19.119> like<00:00:19.330> this<00:00:19.540> you<00:00:20.470> hid<00:00:20.800> in<00:00:21.189> a<00:00:21.430> way<00:00:21.640> that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
the head like this you hid in a way that

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.090 
the head like this you hid in a way that
when<00:00:22.509> you're<00:00:22.689> making<00:00:22.990> patna<00:00:23.320> stick<00:00:23.590> bounces

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
when you're making patna stick bounces

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.700 
when you're making patna stick bounces
up<00:00:24.250> and<00:00:24.699> the<00:00:25.570> stick<00:00:25.810> will<00:00:25.990> then<00:00:26.140> bounced<00:00:26.410> into

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
up and the stick will then bounced into

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.460 
up and the stick will then bounced into
your<00:00:26.920> fingers<00:00:27.460> here<00:00:27.939> menu<00:00:28.779> with<00:00:28.810> by<00:00:29.170> grabbing

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
your fingers here menu with by grabbing

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.589 
your fingers here menu with by grabbing
with<00:00:29.710> your<00:00:29.800> fingers<00:00:30.160> you<00:00:30.250> get<00:00:30.400> a<00:00:30.599> second

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
with your fingers you get a second

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.630 
with your fingers you get a second
stroke<00:00:31.990> so<00:00:32.320> if<00:00:32.379> I<00:00:32.439> just<00:00:32.619> recap<00:00:33.010> that<00:00:33.040> again<00:00:33.460> is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
stroke so if I just recap that again is

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.520 
stroke so if I just recap that again is
down<00:00:34.410> bounce<00:00:35.730> grab<00:00:36.730> and<00:00:37.120> we<00:00:38.019> can<00:00:38.199> simplify

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
down bounce grab and we can simplify

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.420 
down bounce grab and we can simplify
that<00:00:38.739> into<00:00:39.220> saying<00:00:39.670> heat<00:00:40.180> grab<00:00:41.220> so<00:00:42.220> you're

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
that into saying heat grab so you're

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.590 
that into saying heat grab so you're
basically<00:00:42.549> hitting<00:00:43.269> and<00:00:43.600> grabbing<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:46.420> that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
basically hitting and grabbing see that

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.160 
basically hitting and grabbing see that
again<00:00:48.269> do<00:00:49.269> the<00:00:49.420> other<00:00:49.570> hand<00:00:49.750> so<00:00:49.870> you<00:00:49.900> can<00:00:50.049> see

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
again do the other hand so you can see

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.030 
again do the other hand so you can see
inside<00:00:50.409> by<00:00:50.589> hand<00:00:50.799> here<00:00:50.979> so<00:00:51.400> anything<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:57.010> I

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
inside by hand here so anything so I

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.410 
inside by hand here so anything so I

a<00:01:31.370> bass<00:01:31.640> drum<00:01:31.670> here<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.410> bass<00:01:33.620> drum<00:01:33.800> is

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
a bass drum here and the bass drum is

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.180 
a bass drum here and the bass drum is
keeping<00:01:34.400> time<00:01:34.729> holding<00:01:35.690> time<00:01:35.960> down<00:01:36.350> so<00:01:37.160> that

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
keeping time holding time down so that

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.830 
keeping time holding time down so that
because<00:01:37.940> basically<00:01:38.120> what<00:01:38.360> we're<00:01:38.510> doing<00:01:38.720> here

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
because basically what we're doing here

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.150 
because basically what we're doing here
is<00:01:38.870> we're<00:01:39.020> playing<00:01:39.259> left<00:01:39.710> left<00:01:39.950> right<00:01:40.009> right

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
is we're playing left left right right

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.980 
is we're playing left left right right
we<00:01:40.520> turned<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:40.940> around<00:01:41.000> by<00:01:41.630> turning<00:01:41.840> around

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
we turned it around by turning around

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.270 
we turned it around by turning around
that's<00:01:42.200> going<00:01:42.410> to<00:01:42.470> strengthen<00:01:42.950> your<00:01:43.130> left

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
that's going to strengthen your left

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.560 
that's going to strengthen your left
hand<00:01:43.550> because<00:01:43.729> your<00:01:43.850> left<00:01:44.000> hands<00:01:44.240> having<00:01:44.509> to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
hand because your left hands having to

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.300 
hand because your left hands having to
leave<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:44.960> pattern<00:01:45.320> but<00:01:45.830> just<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.100> make<00:01:46.280> sure

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
leave that pattern but just to make sure

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.070 
leave that pattern but just to make sure
you<00:01:46.580> don't<00:01:46.880> wander<00:01:47.240> off<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.660> your<00:01:47.810> brain

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
you don't wander off in your brain

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.540

feeling<00:02:17.260> does<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.650> feel<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.830> bit<00:02:18.040> weak<00:02:18.220> and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
feeling does it feel a bit weak and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.090 
feeling does it feel a bit weak and
wobbly<00:02:18.520> at<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.850> moment<00:02:19.240> does<00:02:19.900> now<00:02:20.110> yeah<00:02:20.740> but

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
wobbly at the moment does now yeah but

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.530 
wobbly at the moment does now yeah but
hopefully<00:02:21.610> as<00:02:21.730> he<00:02:21.880> does<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.450> will

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
hopefully as he does that it will

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.000 
hopefully as he does that it will
strengthen<00:02:22.780> up<00:02:23.050> right<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.320> next<00:02:23.500> one<00:02:23.860> we're

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
strengthen up right the next one we're

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.130 
strengthen up right the next one we're
gonna<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.250> look<00:02:24.370> at<00:02:24.580> these<00:02:24.700> this<00:02:24.970> one<00:02:25.140> same

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
gonna have a look at these this one same

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.130 
gonna have a look at these this one same
principle<00:02:26.380> again<00:02:26.950> got<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.640> bass<00:02:27.850> drum<00:02:27.880> here<00:02:28.450> I'm

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
principle again got a bass drum here I'm

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.440 
principle again got a bass drum here I'm
just<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.410> just<00:02:29.530> rubbed<00:02:29.890> out<00:02:30.010> on<00:02:30.100> my<00:02:30.190> finger<00:02:30.550> hold

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
just I just rubbed out on my finger hold

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.970 
just I just rubbed out on my finger hold
the<00:02:31.600> time<00:02:31.840> down<00:02:32.140> but<00:02:32.500> now<00:02:32.620> we're<00:02:32.770> playing

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
the time down but now we're playing

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.490 
the time down but now we're playing
inverted<00:02:33.670> doubles<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.810> we're<00:02:34.989> doing<00:02:35.140> right

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
inverted doubles so we're doing right

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.199 
inverted doubles so we're doing right
left<00:02:35.830> left<00:02:35.920> right<00:02:36.160> right<00:02:36.340> left<00:02:36.640> left<00:02:36.970> right

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
left left right right left left right

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.550 
left left right right left left right
right<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.890> downbeat<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:40.090> on

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
right so the so the downbeat is on

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.840 
right so the so the downbeat is on
actually<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.800> back<00:02:42.040> end<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.519> double<00:02:42.790> if

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
actually the back end of the double if

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.030 
actually the back end of the double if
you<00:02:42.910> imagine<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.239> double<00:02:43.570> is<00:02:44.050> starting<00:02:44.620> here

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
you imagine the double is starting here

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.430 
you imagine the double is starting here
so<00:02:45.250> you're<00:02:45.370> going<00:02:45.519> right<00:02:45.820> right<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:47.140> base<00:02:47.410> is

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
so you're going right right the base is

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.280 
so you're going right right the base is
on<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.800> back<00:02:48.010> end<00:02:48.280> end<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.090> right<00:02:49.330> hand<00:02:49.600> so

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
on the back end end of the right hand so

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.020 
on the back end end of the right hand so
this<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.530> going<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.769> force<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.400> pressure<00:02:51.670> onto

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
this is going to force the pressure onto

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.970 
this is going to force the pressure onto
the<00:02:52.269> back<00:02:52.540> end<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:52.989> double<00:02:53.320> which<00:02:53.800> is

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
the back end of the double which is

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.860 
the back end of the double which is
usually<00:02:54.370> most<00:02:54.550> people<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.970> weaker<00:02:55.390> doctor<00:02:55.750> you

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
usually most people is weaker doctor you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.050 
usually most people is weaker doctor you
can<00:02:56.019> hit<00:02:56.290> but<00:02:57.010> if<00:02:57.100> they're<00:02:57.280> bounce<00:02:57.550> all<00:02:57.850> their

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
can hit but if they're bounce all their

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.699 
can hit but if they're bounce all their
grab<00:02:58.330> isn't<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:58.810> strong<00:02:59.110> it's<00:02:59.350> not<00:02:59.470> going<00:02:59.620> to

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
grab isn't that strong it's not going to

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.630 
grab isn't that strong it's not going to
be<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.100> very<00:03:00.610> strong<00:03:01.000> second<00:03:01.989> heat<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.489> want

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
be a very strong second heat so you want

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.580 
be a very strong second heat so you want
to<00:03:03.700> try<00:03:03.850> doing<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.150> one<00:03:04.390> for<00:03:04.660> us<00:03:04.780> now<00:03:05.320> see

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
to try doing that one for us now see

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.690 
to try doing that one for us now see
Shawn's<00:03:05.829> never<00:03:06.010> done<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.250> pattern<00:03:06.549> before

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
Shawn's never done this pattern before

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.080 
Shawn's never done this pattern before
so<00:03:07.060> let's<00:03:07.239> see<00:03:07.420> he<00:03:07.930> gets<00:03:08.170> answers<00:03:08.790> right<00:03:09.790> left

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
so let's see he gets answers right left

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.550 
so let's see he gets answers right left
left<00:03:10.180> right<00:03:10.390> right<00:03:10.570> left<00:03:10.840> left<00:03:11.170> right<00:03:11.410> right

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
left right right left left right right

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.289 
left right right left left right right

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
left left with a bass drum at the star

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:25.339 
left left with a bass drum at the star
trying<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.840> try<00:03:13.989> that

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.410 

that's<00:03:26.349> right<00:03:26.970> what<00:03:27.970> does<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.150> feel<00:03:28.330> like

pretty good actually and then what we're
going<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.340> do<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.519> last<00:03:33.640> exercise<00:03:34.150> we're

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
going to do the last exercise we're

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.600 
going to do the last exercise we're
going<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.599> do<00:03:34.780> is<00:03:34.959> this<00:03:35.140> one<00:03:35.440> which<00:03:36.430> is

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
going to do is this one which is

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.460 
going to do is this one which is
basically<00:03:36.879> a<00:03:36.970> combination<00:03:37.209> of<00:03:37.660> both<00:03:37.720> it

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
basically a combination of both it

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.619 
basically a combination of both it
starts<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.099> left<00:03:39.310> hand<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:39.940> it's

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
starts to the left hand and it's

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.809 
starts to the left hand and it's
inverted<00:03:41.200> as<00:03:41.349> well<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.280> it's<00:03:42.430> got<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.640> bass

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
inverted as well and it's got the bass

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.809 
inverted as well and it's got the bass
drum<00:03:43.000> on<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.530> back<00:03:44.530> end<00:03:45.069> of<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.310> left<00:03:45.519> hand

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
drum on the back end of the left hand

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.940 
drum on the back end of the left hand
double<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:46.209> now<00:03:46.390> we<00:03:46.620> accentuating<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.650> back

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
double so now we accentuating the back

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.490 
double so now we accentuating the back
end<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.909> left<00:03:49.120> hand<00:03:49.390> double<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.930> this

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
end of the left hand double and this

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500 
end of the left hand double and this
will<00:03:50.650> really<00:03:50.980> help<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.760> strengthen<00:03:52.090> not<00:03:52.390> on

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
will really help to strengthen not on

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.000 
will really help to strengthen not on
the<00:03:52.629> left<00:03:52.840> hand<00:03:53.049> but<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.260> actual<00:03:53.560> doubles

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
the left hand but the actual doubles

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.830 
the left hand but the actual doubles
themselves<00:03:54.579> so<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:55.150> want<00:03:55.299> to<00:03:55.360> try<00:03:55.510> that<00:03:55.540> one

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
themselves so just want to try that one

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:07.890 
themselves so just want to try that one
for<00:03:56.019> sure

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.140 

that's<00:04:08.900> right
