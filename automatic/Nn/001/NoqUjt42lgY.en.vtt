pivot<00:06:38.919> and<00:06:39.280> head<00:06:39.490> to<00:06:39.580> the<00:06:39.669> modify<00:06:40.030> column<00:06:40.270> so

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:40.569 
pivot and head to the modify column so

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:42.209 
pivot and head to the modify column so
we<00:06:40.659> can<00:06:40.810> make<00:06:40.930> a<00:06:40.960> sub<00:06:41.229> object<00:06:41.590> selection

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:42.219 
we can make a sub object selection

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:44.369 
we can make a sub object selection
let's<00:06:42.759> now<00:06:42.939> drop<00:06:43.240> down<00:06:43.479> to<00:06:43.719> the<00:06:43.810> element<00:06:44.289> way

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:44.379 
let's now drop down to the element way

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:47.070 
let's now drop down to the element way
of<00:06:44.530> selecting<00:06:44.830> and<00:06:45.250> click<00:06:45.580> on<00:06:45.699> the<00:06:45.789> lid<00:06:46.080> notice

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
of selecting and click on the lid notice

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.140 
of selecting and click on the lid notice
the<00:06:47.199> position<00:06:47.349> of<00:06:47.740> the<00:06:47.830> pivot<00:06:47.979> point<00:06:48.340> we<00:06:48.939> can

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
the position of the pivot point we can

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.929 
the position of the pivot point we can
now<00:06:49.360> using<00:06:49.930> the<00:06:50.020> rotates<00:06:50.439> green<00:06:50.889> ring<00:06:51.159> rotate

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:51.939 
now using the rotates green ring rotate

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:55.550 
now using the rotates green ring rotate
the<00:06:52.090> lid<00:06:52.270> so<00:06:52.599> it<00:06:52.719> tilts<00:06:52.990> up

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.100 

if<00:06:55.620> we<00:06:56.340> wanted<00:06:56.610> to<00:06:56.760> instead<00:06:57.150> rotate<00:06:57.840> the<00:06:57.960> lid

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
if we wanted to instead rotate the lid

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.090 
if we wanted to instead rotate the lid
from<00:06:58.230> the<00:06:58.320> other<00:06:58.470> side

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
from the other side

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.280 
from the other side
well<00:06:59.400> back<00:06:59.669> to<00:06:59.700> edit<00:07:00.150> working<00:07:00.510> mode<00:07:00.660> we<00:07:00.840> go<00:07:00.990> and

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
well back to edit working mode we go and

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.420 
well back to edit working mode we go and
we'll<00:07:01.650> make<00:07:01.770> the<00:07:01.889> quick<00:07:02.070> switch<00:07:02.220> over

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
we'll make the quick switch over

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.960 
we'll make the quick switch over
we'll<00:07:04.880> return<00:07:05.240> to<00:07:05.300> use<00:07:05.660> working<00:07:06.050> pivot<00:07:06.970> back

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:07.970 
we'll return to use working pivot back

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.060 
we'll return to use working pivot back
to<00:07:08.150> the<00:07:08.270> editable<00:07:08.509> poly<00:07:08.810> element<00:07:09.500> level<00:07:09.650> and

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
to the editable poly element level and

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.310 
to the editable poly element level and
we'll<00:07:10.460> rotate<00:07:10.720> anything<00:07:11.720> selected<00:07:12.199> at<00:07:12.290> the

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
we'll rotate anything selected at the

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.499 
we'll rotate anything selected at the
sub<00:07:12.590> object<00:07:12.710> level<00:07:13.130> will<00:07:13.699> now<00:07:13.820> rotate<00:07:14.180> or

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:14.509 
sub object level will now rotate or

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.450 
sub object level will now rotate or
scale<00:07:14.660> from<00:07:15.259> this<00:07:15.410> new<00:07:15.620> temporary<00:07:16.130> pivot

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460 
scale from this new temporary pivot

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.520 
scale from this new temporary pivot
location<00:07:17.090> you<00:07:17.780> could<00:07:17.930> see<00:07:18.110> how<00:07:18.259> that<00:07:18.440> would

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
location you could see how that would

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.480 
location you could see how that would
work<00:07:18.560> if<00:07:19.039> we<00:07:19.160> for<00:07:19.400> example<00:07:19.430> scaled<00:07:20.270> an<00:07:20.419> X<00:07:21.490> when

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 
work if we for example scaled an X when

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.129 
work if we for example scaled an X when
we're<00:07:22.639> done<00:07:22.850> we<00:07:23.300> simply<00:07:23.449> get<00:07:23.720> out<00:07:23.840> of<00:07:23.960> sub

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:24.139 
we're done we simply get out of sub

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:26.969 
we're done we simply get out of sub
object<00:07:24.500> mode<00:07:24.680> and<00:07:24.979> turn<00:07:25.370> working<00:07:26.000> pivot<00:07:26.120> off

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:26.979 
object mode and turn working pivot off

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.379 
object mode and turn working pivot off
once<00:07:27.979> that's<00:07:28.190> been<00:07:28.340> accomplished<00:07:28.880> we're<00:07:29.210> back

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389 
once that's been accomplished we're back

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:31.659 
once that's been accomplished we're back
to<00:07:29.570> rotating<00:07:30.169> and<00:07:30.320> scaling<00:07:30.470> our<00:07:30.919> teapot<00:07:31.310> from

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:31.669 
to rotating and scaling our teapot from

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:34.700 
to rotating and scaling our teapot from
its<00:07:31.759> original<00:07:31.880> pivot<00:07:32.600> point<00:07:32.810> location

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.710 
its original pivot point location

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.279 
its original pivot point location
so<00:07:35.550> there<00:07:35.729> you<00:07:35.850> go<00:07:36.030> with<00:07:36.419> the<00:07:36.570> working<00:07:36.930> pivot

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:37.289 
so there you go with the working pivot

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.770 
so there you go with the working pivot
and<00:07:37.530> pivot<00:07:37.590> points<00:07:38.370> in<00:07:38.490> general<00:07:38.850> now<00:07:39.389> there

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 
and pivot points in general now there

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.600 
and pivot points in general now there
won't<00:07:40.020> be<00:07:40.080> many<00:07:40.259> projects<00:07:40.889> we're<00:07:41.160> moving<00:07:41.520> a

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610 
won't be many projects we're moving a

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.610 
won't be many projects we're moving a
pivot<00:07:41.970> a<00:07:42.030> time<00:07:42.240> or<00:07:42.389> two<00:07:42.539> won't<00:07:42.990> come<00:07:43.229> into<00:07:43.410> play

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 
pivot a time or two won't come into play

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.980 
pivot a time or two won't come into play
so<00:07:44.190> practice<00:07:44.669> the<00:07:44.789> techniques<00:07:45.210> and<00:07:45.630> be<00:07:45.810> ready

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:45.990 
so practice the techniques and be ready

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.770 
so practice the techniques and be ready
to<00:07:46.110> put<00:07:46.350> them<00:07:46.440> into<00:07:46.560> action
