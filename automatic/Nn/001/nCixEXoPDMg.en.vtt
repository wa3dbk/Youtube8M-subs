00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.110 

do<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.770> boom<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:27.040> plastic<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.790> doesn't

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
do that boom is plastic so it doesn't

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.800 
do that boom is plastic so it doesn't
really<00:02:28.209> take<00:02:28.510> much<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:29.830> go<00:02:30.010> through<00:02:30.280> there<00:02:30.810> now

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
really take much to go through there now

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.470 
really take much to go through there now
you<00:02:31.870> can<00:02:32.170> preset<00:02:32.470> these<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:33.970> fast<00:02:34.300> you

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
you can preset these this is so fast you

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.240 
you can preset these this is so fast you
could<00:02:34.690> do<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.020> can<00:02:35.170> actually<00:02:35.350> before<00:02:35.770> you<00:02:35.950> put

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
could do you can actually before you put

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.559 
could do you can actually before you put
the<00:02:36.340> sign<00:02:36.580> now<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.790> can<00:02:37.000> do<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.239> sitting<00:02:37.450> right

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
the sign now you can do it sitting right

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.650 
the sign now you can do it sitting right
in<00:02:37.750> your<00:02:38.020> car<00:02:38.290> whatever<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.550> poke<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.800> the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
cable tied through the hole and you'll

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.110 
cable tied through the hole and you'll
feel<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:47.769> within<00:02:48.069> a<00:02:48.130> 10<00:02:48.400> cut<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.760> see<00:02:48.970> the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
feel it within a 10 cut you see the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.110 
feel it within a 10 cut you see the
grooves<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.750> allow<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.950> set<00:02:51.340> whenever

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
grooves that allow it to set whenever

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.990 
grooves that allow it to set whenever
you<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.739> connected<00:02:54.370> one<00:02:54.580> ear<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.850> the

you you you connected one ear to the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.940 
you you you connected one ear to the
other<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.750> you'll<00:02:55.900> start<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.319> hear<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.500> ticket

it's<00:03:57.880> not<00:03:58.030> brain<00:03:58.329> surgery<00:03:58.359> but<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:58.989> still<00:03:59.170> want

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
it's not brain surgery but I still want

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.280 
it's not brain surgery but I still want
to<00:03:59.410> give<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.739> an<00:03:59.859> example<00:04:01.170> obviously<00:04:02.170> at<00:04:02.260> a

to give you an example obviously at a
stop<00:04:02.590> sign<00:04:02.620> everybody<00:04:03.400> has<00:04:03.579> to<00:04:03.760> stop<00:04:04.030> it's<00:04:04.390> not

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
stop sign everybody has to stop it's not

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.819 
stop sign everybody has to stop it's not
as<00:04:04.780> busy<00:04:04.989> as<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.410> potential<00:04:07.650> traffic<00:04:08.650> light

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
as busy as a potential traffic light

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.520 
as busy as a potential traffic light
could<00:04:09.040> be<00:04:09.069> because<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.700> have<00:04:09.730> thousands<00:04:10.569> pass

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
could be because you have thousands pass

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.930 
could be because you have thousands pass
through<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.829> traffic<00:04:12.250> light<00:04:12.370> where<00:04:12.609> the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
through a traffic light where the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.699 
through a traffic light where the
hundreds<00:04:13.480> on<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.720> stop<00:04:13.989> sign<00:04:14.260> but<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.530> stop

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
hundreds on the stop sign but the stop

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.349 
hundreds on the stop sign but the stop
signs<00:04:14.950> gives<00:04:15.160> you<00:04:15.250> more<00:04:15.400> flexibility<00:04:16.090> but<00:04:16.239> you

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
signs gives you more flexibility but you

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.539 
signs gives you more flexibility but you
still<00:04:16.600> can<00:04:16.750> place<00:04:17.019> them<00:04:17.289> and<00:04:18.100> then<00:04:18.250> stop

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
still can place them and then stop

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.580 
still can place them and then stop
traffic<00:04:19.239> lights<00:04:19.419> also<00:04:19.870> depending<00:04:20.350> on<00:04:20.440> what

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
traffic lights also depending on what

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.690 
traffic lights also depending on what
type<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:21.900> sign<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:23.169> there<00:04:23.380> but<00:04:23.919> you<00:04:24.430> see<00:04:24.580> this

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
type of sign is there but you see this
