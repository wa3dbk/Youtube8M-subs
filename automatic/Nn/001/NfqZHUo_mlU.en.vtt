 and 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.469
 Y 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.360
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.060
 the hunter of myths of gta 5 speaks to you 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.619
 chuches and today I bring you 5 myths 5 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.500
 very good myths thank you all for 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.980
 your comments so well I do not 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.360
 entertain more let's go let's go 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.519
 and good, we start with myth number 1 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.290
 where perceptive says that if we leave a 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.989
 car if the four wheels or a motorcycle if 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.489
 the two will walk the train tracks 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.320
 Well, I understand that if I 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.239
 we leave above we invite to accelerate 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.589
 Well, it will only go through the tracks, so 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.219
 well I did not have many plants with 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:52.070
 this myth and indeed nothing happens 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.430
 we put the bikes without wheels are the 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.820
 two without a tire and the truth is that 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.949
 It is even worse nor better not so 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.570
 only removed but does not go 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.630
 tracks so good we tried the car 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.210
 He also eats and we did not put the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.160
 drive wheels that are the back wheels 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.000
 we accelerate we accelerate but it does not drive or 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.710
 it's a lot worse, so it 's a myth 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.930
 totally hunted so 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.450
 we can not go the ways with 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.790
 our cars and in number 2 says 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.170
 hector did that if we throw a c4 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.360
 in between the helicopter where 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.190
 seats is transferred or stays floating 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.530
 here I will understand that if it is transferred it is 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.800
 confirmed so we're going to throw you the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.229
 c4 and it effectively passes through it so 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.180
 this myth is confirmed and good for 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.880
 tell you not to ask me simply 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.100
 tell me one thing that is yes or no 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.259
 that here, as you can see, the c4 go through like this 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.470
 I wanted to know if the grenades 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.110
 so they pull one and so 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.789
 seen an invisible barrier is created and the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.700
 granada then it does not happen so it's a myth 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.740
 confirmed the c4 yes they trespass 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.390
 and in fear number 3 we have a bryant 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.100
 which says that if the campaign is exploited 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.840
 You can take a car with the charge 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.939
 put in the online is totally 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.580
 hunted because you can not so we're going 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.980
 to throw a missile at that car with 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.069
 trevor and we take your bonus charge in your 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.510
 2011 gone that costs and let's go straight to the 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.160
 car to see if it is caught as we already know 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.630
 As I said in the online, I do not know 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.110
 can is impossible you can simply 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.690
 catch the cars that are 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.300
 has assets so as you can see there 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.710
 car on fire burning the charge for 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.780
 trying it, I'm not very good at 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.720
 the charge as you can see but what 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.060
 I tried to get caught and effectively 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.880
 we have a car hanging in flames that is 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.010
 that you can catch exploded cars 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.840
 so it's a totally confirmed myth 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.250
 very good myth and we do not know for the 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.300
 next 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.220
 [Music] 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.140
 and in fear number 4 we have Carlos 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.640
 blindly he says that if we get one 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.830
 photo from a parachute will look at 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.240
 third person so good the truth is 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.890
 I have not done this ever ever 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.420
 has tried to take a picture of the 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.910
 parachute so good is a little bit 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.250
 at night nothing happens we throw in 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.980
 parachute and we go quickly to the mobile 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.200
 to take out the camera and if indeed you 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.030
 puts in third person and well then 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.250
 there seems to be a camera following us or 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.540
 I know why not if I do not join 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.010
 He explained to me who does the photo in 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.010
 third person but good is a myth 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.960
 totally confirmed and thanks for that 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.300
 myth because I really did not know and 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.530
 in myth number 5 and last says mikel 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.840
 alonso that if you can stick a c4 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.860
 in the online mobile so good yo 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.630
 this the truth that I have never tried 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.000
 Nor do you get me some things so 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.010
 good 6 was here with rail killer and 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.380
 I take out the mobile thus removing a small photo 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.850
 inside hit c4 so good I tried 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.160
 hit first here as you see there 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.140
 seems that sticks but plummets 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.710
 so good has I got the screen of 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.990
 filling and it seems that the mobile 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.490
 well, it does not have that physics of being 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.040
 hit this 4 so it's a myth 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.019
 totally 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.299
 so good then yes yes they explode 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.700
 12 4 but it does not stick to the mobile so 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:04:00.120
 we're 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.970
