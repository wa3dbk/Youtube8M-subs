00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 who would not like a glorious, 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.500
 huge shiny steel sword 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.840
 blood stained virtual and fed 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.240
 for the death of the enemies is the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.550
 time to cross the swords as you 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.800

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.800
 impressive in the world of games 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.210
 if you have ever played the o2 online 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.730
 you will remember the frustration that produces 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.500
 this sword with people the energy surf 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.650
 and his melee attack are 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.930
 extremely powerful 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.270
 from the sound it produces when 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.420
 you pick up the attack directed at others 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.560
 players the south energy impacts the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.560
 players with fear 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.990
 or if 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.940
 dante of the series of bomb cry likes 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.530
 combine the sword with shots his 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.830
 back sword is a sword 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.630
 indestructible forged by demons 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.610
 needing both the force edge and its 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.310
 perfect mulet to wake up your 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.130
 demonic powers was introduced in the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.440
 first game of devil may cry and we've 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.240
 seen in all the games since then 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.240
 so powerful is 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.340
 no wonder because siegfried is 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.430
 became nightmare in the series of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.710
 soul calibur the sword soul edge is 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.570
 part metal organic part and one 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.210
 100% brutality 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.210
 soul calibur is of course its counterpart 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.830
 of the good guy however we have to 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.470
 go with the evil soul edge 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.870
 because there is something in demonic swords 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.210
 with creepy eyes that makes them 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.210
 look simply spectacular 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.280
 we know that the sapphire masamune sword 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.750
 of the final fantasy series is one of the 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.270
 most powerful swords in videogames 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.120
 but his great power does not match his 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.549
 relatively simple appearance 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.250
 we prefer the aspect of 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:42.430
 booster sword in prison 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:44.980
 in short reflections the big piece 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.740
 wide and metallic cloud looks 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.680
 just awesome to wield this 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.420
 huge piece of metal makes it look like a 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.420
 hard guy instantly 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.680
 the number one of the swords in our 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.270
 list of course the sword more 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.270
 emblematic of the world gamer 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.870
 the master short is the sword that 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.630
 you will need to save the princess 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.630
 zelda in the games the legend of zelda 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.820
 It is strong but it is the satisfaction of 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.460
 embark on an epic adventure that 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.460
 Makes this baby even more special 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.510
 lynn has a big sword and cell what 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.700
 is waiting anxiously 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.700
 well that sounds bad
