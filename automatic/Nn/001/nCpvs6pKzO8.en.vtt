you should totally try this out for
yourself<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.660> fun<00:00:55.020> actually<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:55.850> it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
yourself really fun actually because it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.689 
yourself really fun actually because it
works<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.600> lot<00:00:58.590> better<00:00:58.649> than<00:00:59.070> you'd<00:00:59.190> expect<00:00:59.579> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
works a lot better than you'd expect it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.650 
works a lot better than you'd expect it
to<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.660> does<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:02.000> one<00:01:03.000> once<00:01:03.420> they

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
to what what it does is one once they

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.010 
to what what it does is one once they
die<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.350> teens<00:01:04.559> he<00:01:04.680> gets<00:01:04.860> shot<00:01:04.970> off<00:01:05.970> or<00:01:06.540> just

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
die the teens he gets shot off or just

Falls<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.710> whatever<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.610> lands<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> ground

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
Falls or whatever it lands on the ground

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.560 
Falls or whatever it lands on the ground
and<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:09.960> other<00:01:10.229> creepers<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.950> load<00:01:11.159> up<00:01:11.570> so

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and then other creepers just load up so

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.990 
and then other creepers just load up so
you<00:01:12.659> see

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.990 
so yeah ok so now I'm going to show you
how<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.280> works<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:34.370> mainly<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.700> command

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
how this works so it's mainly a command

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.420 
how this works so it's mainly a command
block<00:02:35.170> um<00:02:37.180> just<00:02:38.180> uncover<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:45.280> start<00:02:46.280> by<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
block um just uncover it start by the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.490 
block um just uncover it start by the
lag<00:02:46.610> spike<00:02:46.850> ok<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:48.400> here<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.780> uh<00:02:50.780> here's<00:02:51.200> the

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
lag spike ok so here is uh here's the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.400 
lag spike ok so here is uh here's the
whole<00:02:51.830> thing<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.820> this<00:02:53.120> basically<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:54.200> lover

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
whole thing so this basically the lover

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.979 
whole thing so this basically the lover
is<00:02:54.590> just<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:55.100> piston<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:55.880> letting<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.690> signal

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
is just a piston and letting the signal

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.900 
is just a piston and letting the signal
and<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.770> starts<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.130> clock<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.760> clock

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
and it starts to the clock so the clock

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.509 
and it starts to the clock so the clock
do<00:02:59.060> spins<00:02:59.360> are<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.709> know<00:03:00.799> sent<00:03:01.070> pulses<00:03:01.489> a

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
do spins are you know sent pulses a

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.690 
do spins are you know sent pulses a
signal<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.420> when<00:03:03.049> this<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.440> off<00:03:04.010> than<00:03:04.640> the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
signal and when this is a off than the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.130 
signal and when this is a off than the
piston<00:03:05.030> retracts<00:03:05.570> lingus<00:03:05.959> block<00:03:06.290> take<00:03:07.130> the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
piston retracts lingus block take the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.130 
piston retracts lingus block take the
power<00:03:09.140> from<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:10.000> redstone<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.150> power<00:03:11.810> this

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
power from the redstone and power this

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.620 
power from the redstone and power this
command<00:03:12.830> Bob<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.190> this<00:03:14.090> can<00:03:14.269> i<00:03:14.330> block<00:03:14.480> this

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
command Bob and this can i block this

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.100 
command Bob and this can i block this
world<00:03:14.959> magic<00:03:15.200> happens<00:03:15.680> right<00:03:15.799> here<00:03:15.950> so<00:03:17.110> we

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
world magic happens right here so we

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.650 
world magic happens right here so we
have<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> summon<00:03:18.739> command<00:03:19.310> then<00:03:19.760> falling<00:03:20.299> sand

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
have a summon command then falling sand

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.060 
have a summon command then falling sand
and<00:03:22.630> then<00:03:23.630> these<00:03:23.870> are<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.110> coordinates<00:03:24.320> it's

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
and then these are the coordinates it's

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.890 
and then these are the coordinates it's
relative<00:03:25.489> coordinates<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:25.910> it's<00:03:26.329> relative

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
relative coordinates so it's relative

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.039 
relative coordinates so it's relative
mean<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:28.250> it's<00:03:28.610> like<00:03:28.820> welcome<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.780> command

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
mean it it's like welcome to the command

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.729 
mean it it's like welcome to the command
book<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:30.940> it's<00:03:31.940> over<00:03:32.090> there<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:33.079> it<00:03:33.320> spawns

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
book and it's over there so it spawns

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.860 
book and it's over there so it spawns
them<00:03:33.920> over<00:03:34.070> there<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:35.000> we<00:03:35.120> have<00:03:35.329> a<00:03:35.360> data

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
them over there and then we have a data

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.580 
them over there and then we have a data
tag<00:03:36.140> here<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:36.980> title<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:38.420> this<00:03:39.140> is<00:03:39.290> reeling

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
tag here so a title the this is reeling

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.090 
tag here so a title the this is reeling
with<00:03:39.650> this<00:03:39.890> so<00:03:40.100> tile<00:03:40.790> ID<00:03:41.030> which<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.660> what<00:03:42.590> what

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
with this so tile ID which is what what

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.940 
with this so tile ID which is what what
do<00:03:43.160> you<00:03:43.220> want<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.430> following<00:03:43.670> send<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:43.940> be<00:03:44.120> is

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
do you want the following send to be is

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.470 
do you want the following send to be is
46<00:03:45.950> because<00:03:46.190> that's<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.459> ID<00:03:46.610> of<00:03:48.610> TT<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:49.820> then

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
46 because that's the ID of TT and then

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.180 
46 because that's the ID of TT and then
the<00:03:50.900> time<00:03:51.170> one<00:03:51.440> now<00:03:51.560> that's<00:03:51.799> just<00:03:51.980> something

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
the time one now that's just something

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.490 
the time one now that's just something
that<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:52.579> have<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.790> use<00:03:53.060> for<00:03:53.360> all<00:03:53.450> most<00:03:54.079> lines

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
that you have to use for all most lines

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.160 
that you have to use for all most lines
are<00:03:54.650> time<00:03:54.890> point<00:03:55.430> now<00:03:55.549> if<00:03:55.610> you'll<00:03:55.880> replace<00:03:56.239> for

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
are time point now if you'll replace for

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.160 
are time point now if you'll replace for
summit<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.590> then<00:03:58.280> writing<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.390> now<00:03:59.989> we<00:04:00.049> have

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
summit and then writing and now we have

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.740 
summit and then writing and now we have
another<00:04:01.239> set<00:04:02.239> of<00:04:02.799> brackets<00:04:03.799> to<00:04:04.730> close<00:04:05.120> in<00:04:05.360> the

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
another set of brackets to close in the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.690 
another set of brackets to close in the
is<00:04:06.170> writing<00:04:06.590> an<00:04:06.650> ID<00:04:06.830> creeper<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:07.370> it's<00:04:07.489> writing

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
is writing an ID creeper so it's writing

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.730 
is writing an ID creeper so it's writing
a<00:04:08.000> TNT<00:04:08.569> writing

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
a TNT writing

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.920 
a TNT writing
paper<00:04:09.860> so<00:04:10.400> that's<00:04:10.550> what<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.730> is<00:04:10.880> now<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.570> have

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
paper so that's what it is now I have

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.870 
paper so that's what it is now I have
some<00:04:12.490> I<00:04:13.490> have<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:15.370> there<00:04:16.370> is<00:04:16.459> something<00:04:16.730> that

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
some I have a there is something that

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.490 
some I have a there is something that
doesn't<00:04:17.300> really<00:04:17.390> work<00:04:17.510> too<00:04:17.900> well<00:04:17.930> about<00:04:18.200> this

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
doesn't really work too well about this

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.330 
doesn't really work too well about this
so<00:04:18.739> if<00:04:18.920> I<00:04:19.130> turn<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.360> zero<00:04:20.750> so<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.920> make<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.220> so

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
so if I turn it to zero so I make it so

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.530 
so if I turn it to zero so I make it so
it<00:04:22.460> spawns<00:04:22.730> at<00:04:22.910> level<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:24.040> height<00:04:25.040> level<00:04:25.540> this

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
it spawns at level a height level this

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.290 
it spawns at level a height level this
does<00:04:26.960> not<00:04:27.230> work<00:04:27.500> I<00:04:27.770> have<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.430> don't<00:04:28.970> really<00:04:29.090> know

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
does not work I have I don't really know

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.270 
does not work I have I don't really know
why<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.960> doesn't<00:04:30.260> work<00:04:30.290> but<00:04:30.650> as<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:31.010> can<00:04:31.100> see

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
why it doesn't work but as you can see

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.710 
why it doesn't work but as you can see
the<00:04:31.400> TT<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:32.510> Falls<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:35.030> actually<00:04:35.210> have

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
the TT just Falls so you actually have

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.580 
the TT just Falls so you actually have
to<00:04:36.020> like<00:04:36.230> it's<00:04:36.470> part<00:04:36.920> of<00:04:36.980> it<00:04:37.540> if<00:04:38.540> you<00:04:39.080> see<00:04:39.260> if<00:04:39.410> I

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
to like it's part of it if you see if I

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.330 
to like it's part of it if you see if I
come<00:04:39.800> over<00:04:39.830> there<00:04:40.010> now<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:41.770> change<00:04:42.770> this<00:04:43.070> to

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
come over there now and change this to

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.750 
come over there now and change this to
be<00:04:43.490> just<00:04:43.520> one<00:04:43.970> or<00:04:44.390> two<00:04:45.130> if<00:04:46.130> i<00:04:46.220> change<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.670> be

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
be just one or two if i change it to be

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:56.590 
be just one or two if i change it to be
to<00:04:53.020> stop<00:04:54.020> working<00:04:54.230> oh<00:04:54.910> we<00:04:55.910> kill<00:04:56.090> these<00:04:56.240> scripts

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
to stop working oh we kill these scripts

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.370 
to stop working oh we kill these scripts
i<00:04:58.450> think<00:04:59.450> i<00:04:59.510> might<00:04:59.660> have<00:04:59.690> turned<00:04:59.870> it<00:05:00.050> off<00:05:00.170> one

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
i think i might have turned it off one

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.850 
i think i might have turned it off one
probably<00:05:03.400> yeah<00:05:04.400> if<00:05:04.910> i<00:05:05.090> turn<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:05.780> height<00:05:06.590> to

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
probably yeah if i turn it to height to

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.570 
probably yeah if i turn it to height to
now<00:05:07.190> we<00:05:07.730> have<00:05:07.910> creepers<00:05:08.450> with<00:05:08.630> T&amp;T<00:05:09.290> other<00:05:09.580> so

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
now we have creepers with T&amp;T other so

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.250 
now we have creepers with T&amp;T other so
you<00:05:11.000> have<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.360> have<00:05:11.540> it<00:05:11.780> above<00:05:13.870> above<00:05:14.870> the

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
you have to have it above above the

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.900 
you have to have it above above the
ground<00:05:15.440> when<00:05:15.680> they<00:05:15.800> spawn<00:05:16.100> or<00:05:16.370> else<00:05:16.550> it<00:05:16.730> won't

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
ground when they spawn or else it won't

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.290 
ground when they spawn or else it won't
work<00:05:17.030> and<00:05:17.920> that's<00:05:18.920> basically<00:05:19.220> it<00:05:19.490> so<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:20.270> is

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
work and that's basically it so this is

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.940 
work and that's basically it so this is
something<00:05:20.540> that<00:05:20.690> I<00:05:20.810> just<00:05:21.020> found<00:05:21.200> and<00:05:21.650> I<00:05:21.800> just

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950
