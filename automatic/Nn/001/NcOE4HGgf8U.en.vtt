our<00:00:32.880> zucchini<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.750> here<00:00:33.960> roughly<00:00:34.410> about<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
our zucchini in here roughly about a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
our zucchini in here roughly about a
quarter<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> third<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.149> an<00:00:36.239> inch<00:00:36.420> cube<00:00:36.840> going

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
quarter to a third of an inch cube going

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.510 
quarter to a third of an inch cube going
to<00:00:37.200> try<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> get<00:00:37.500> everything<00:00:37.800> about<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.250> size

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
to try to get everything about that size

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.040 
to try to get everything about that size
so<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.820> when<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.329> toss<00:00:39.600> them<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.840> skillet

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
so that when we toss them in the skillet

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.930 
so that when we toss them in the skillet
it<00:00:40.290> all<00:00:40.379> cooks<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> same<00:00:41.160> time<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.879> I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
it all cooks up at the same time so I

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000 
it all cooks up at the same time so I
sit<00:00:42.149> down<00:00:42.270> size<00:00:42.629> roughly<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.440> same<00:00:43.559> size<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
sit down size roughly the same size and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.690 
sit down size roughly the same size and
