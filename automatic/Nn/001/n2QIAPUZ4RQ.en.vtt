some areas that have 9 feet of water and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.790 
some areas that have 9 feet of water and
no<00:00:21.180> way<00:00:21.330> around<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.100> it's<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:24.619> what<00:00:25.619> we're

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
no way around so it's it's what we're

no way around so it's it's what we're
trying<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.070> find<00:00:26.250> ways<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.939> around

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
trying to find ways to get around

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.450 
trying to find ways to get around
certain<00:00:27.420> areas<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.320> know<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.220> we

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
certain areas we know we can do it we

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.310 
certain areas we know we can do it we
know<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.849> get<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.060> done

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
know we can get it done

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.229 
know we can get it done
and<00:00:31.619> we're<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:32.610> trying<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.910> make<00:00:33.090> that

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and we're just trying to make that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.229 
and we're just trying to make that
happen<00:00:33.809> because<00:00:34.200> right<00:00:35.070> now<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> 47<00:00:36.059> year

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
happen because right now in the 47 year

history<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.870> Baja<00:00:37.140> 1000<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.129> race<00:00:38.370> is

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
history of the Baja 1000 this race is

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.190 
history of the Baja 1000 this race is
probably<00:00:38.730> more<00:00:39.090> important<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.870> us<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.079> go

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
probably more important for us to go

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.170 
probably more important for us to go
down<00:00:40.350> there<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.680> support<00:00:41.100> them<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.550> we're

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
down there and support them so we're

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.450 
down there and support them so we're
having<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.510> put<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> lot<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.290> extra<00:00:43.649> effort<00:00:43.770> into

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
having to put a lot of extra effort into
