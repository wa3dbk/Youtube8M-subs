00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.890
 or not 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.640
 of profiles that we have 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.790
 to understand the movement 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.990
 we have to bear in mind that in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.100
 what the hip is doing 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.649
 Is a circle 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:48.780
 the profile and that the sense of the circle 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.780
 is below on top and the site 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.809
 in the path 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.809
 to be able to do it 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.640
 if it is very difficult to remove it 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.329
 principle that usually happens we can 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.909
 imagine that the navel if I could 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.229
 see if it was an eye what would have to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.940
 see would be when the movement started 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.310
 I would have to be able to turn to the ground 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.950
 then I would look at the opposite wall 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.680
 then I would look at the ceiling and finally 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.250
 I would look straight ahead before 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.800
 serve and start over 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.770
 is all the time the same circle 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.180
 repeating is over and over again 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.280
 the most natural way to learn to 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.380
 do the hair is walking and 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.420
 using a camel for each skin by 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.420
 every little step we take a camel 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.880
 we can also do it on the site 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.470
 but to begin with, the easiest thing is if the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.470
 miners 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.560
 there is a way to explain the camel and 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.040
 it has to do with lace and 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.990
 hip disengagement 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.580
 and where do I have the weight of your body 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 on each ticket 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.030
 in career education songs 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.050
 here is the slow race 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.150
 this would be the box 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.750
 I return to the neutral position and 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.550
 unhinged 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.440
 we are playing with this position of the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.420
 hip 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.770
 and with the weight of the body if it is in it 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.770
 have in front of the back 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.650
 chain d is unthinkable 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.250
 floor and so as I have the career I 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.460
 I go with the weight at the foot of the front 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.710
 now while you understand back chalk 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.470
 in front of 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.650
 leaving the chain is the most 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.650
 hard 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.470
 and I have it ready again 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.100
 loose is fit and I have the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.200
 foot prepared weight in front I fit the 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.190
 hip 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.190
 forward feet loose advanced 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.719
 the hip camel is a movement 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.849
 very versatile and allows me to use it from 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.939
 many ways we can walk towards 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.939
 in front of 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.879
 we have to look back 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.950
 and we can also advance in profile if 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.830
 wants to advance in profile I do not have a 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.470
 way for each chalk skin but that 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.060
 every road now has two feet if I go 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.430
 to go to the right would take the foot 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.770
 right front left behind and each 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.680
 path would start at the foot in front and 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.580
 I would finish has no back 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.640
 every floor skin today taking the weight 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.650
 to the front of the hip, disheveled and weight 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.549
 of the hips 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.549
 and weight back 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.069
 and can give the same of questions 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.069
 making it 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.409
 I can also use a pulse of feet 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.350
 to give a different look to the 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.540
 camel 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.550
 Normally we control profile if 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.890
 let's go to the right I would take the foot 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.950
 right in front and my arms would be 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.019
 because these are sent right and I 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.989
 on the right 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.989
 12 12 12 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.720
 in this position of feet and arms and 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.760
 from left 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.870
 and the pines 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.870
 a knots 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.360
 in front of 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.860
 right to left 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.970
 from the feet 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:54.630
 and I'm going to the same side or I'll find if 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.730
 I go to the same side the weather watching it 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.170
 and it looks the opposite that knitted 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.660
 cross 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.230
 we started late 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.230
 tÃ©lam 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.849
 4 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.849
 fruits 2 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.700
 all right 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.280
 one
