 in this form at least for 12 hours 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.899
 the best option would be to pour the beans on

 and does grate 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.950
 we shift all the vegetables and big beans 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.350

 pan on the fire and in doing so to the vegetables 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.899
 prepared correctly 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.280
 did not sting with names were stewed under pans 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.340
 and it is desirable to put a divider 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.370
 bring the contents of the pot to a boil 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.739
 after which we reduce the fire to it 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:18.090
 but only so as not to interrupt itself 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:21.930
 boiling process and boil vegetables 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.510
 about two hours under the lid not closed 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.750
 forgetting to stir them from time to time 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.340
 during this time we will have time to cook the jars 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.940

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:44.549
 then stylize pour boiling water 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:47.310
 either hot steam and so develop our 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.700
 hot salad with beans in prepared 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.120
 dry banks and roll them tightly 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.750
 the lids are now very careful 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.629
 turn the cans neck down and 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.540
 we wind in a warm towel we leave 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.079

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.079
