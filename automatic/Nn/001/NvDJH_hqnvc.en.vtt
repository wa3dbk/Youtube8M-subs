00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
life off of the lifelink so let's look

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.870 
life off of the lifelink so let's look
at<00:01:49.140> some<00:01:49.259> non-combat<00:01:49.740> damage<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.250> this

at some non-combat damage in this

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.520 
at some non-combat damage in this
example<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.450> MS<00:01:51.899> IAM<00:01:52.079> orders<00:01:52.380> being

example we have MS IAM orders being

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770 
example we have MS IAM orders being
overloaded<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:54.119> about<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.570> four

any of those creatures have protection

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.530 
any of those creatures have protection
from<00:01:58.560> red<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.189> particular<00:01:59.460> case<00:01:59.850> none<00:02:00.509> of

from red in this particular case none of
them<00:02:00.780> will<00:02:00.899> be<00:02:00.930> dealt<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.320> damage<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.520> let's

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
them will be dealt that damage so let's

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.399 
them will be dealt that damage so let's
take<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> look<00:02:02.969> at<00:02:03.090> equipments<00:02:03.540> enchantments

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
and fortifications and how they interact

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.930 
and fortifications and how they interact
with<00:02:06.780> attraction<00:02:07.290> for<00:02:07.710> example<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.220> creature

of those equipments enchantments or

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.770 
of those equipments enchantments or
fortifications<00:02:21.130> will<00:02:21.580> simply<00:02:21.880> have<00:02:22.090> those

while equipments and fortifications will
just<00:02:30.400> sit<00:02:30.490> on<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.700> battlefield

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.589 

let's<00:02:33.510> take<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.660> look<00:02:33.840> at<00:02:33.959> attacking<00:02:35.390> how<00:02:36.390> does

let's take a look at attacking how does

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.900 
let's take a look at attacking how does
blocking<00:02:37.200> even<00:02:37.500> apply<00:02:37.709> with<00:02:37.860> protection<00:02:38.340> well

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.180 
blocking even apply with protection well
in<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.989> scenario<00:02:40.380> let's<00:02:40.440> take<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> look<00:02:41.010> at

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
in this scenario let's take a look at

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.370 
in this scenario let's take a look at
the<00:02:41.430> anatomy<00:02:41.640> again<00:02:42.300> but<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.050> time<00:02:43.230> the

by polar flame and you wanted to protect

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.320 
by polar flame and you wanted to protect
it<00:03:25.470> from<00:03:25.650> red<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.370> gave<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.819> protection

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
it from red so you gave it protection

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.259 
it from red so you gave it protection
with<00:03:27.780> faith<00:03:28.319> shield<00:03:28.680> upon<00:03:29.610> resolution<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.180> the

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
with faith shield upon resolution of the

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.580 
with faith shield upon resolution of the
pillar<00:03:30.450> flame<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.959> would<00:03:31.080> have<00:03:31.170> an<00:03:31.260> illegal

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
pillar flame it would have an illegal

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.949 
pillar flame it would have an illegal
target<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.040> be<00:03:32.100> countered<00:03:32.370> by<00:03:32.400> game<00:03:32.670> rules<00:03:32.959> so

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
target and be countered by game rules so

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.539 
target and be countered by game rules so
a<00:03:34.260> great<00:03:34.500> way<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.620> memorize<00:03:35.010> all<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.190> this<00:03:35.370> is

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
a great way to memorize all of this is

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.309 
a great way to memorize all of this is
to<00:03:35.760> look<00:03:35.850> at<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.060> acronym<00:03:36.420> debt<00:03:36.750> which

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
to look at the acronym debt which

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.640 
to look at the acronym debt which
includes<00:03:37.739> damage<00:03:38.780> enchantments<00:03:39.780> also

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
includes damage enchantments also

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.190 
includes damage enchantments also
equipments<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.340> fortifications<00:03:42.200> blocking

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
equipments and fortifications blocking

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.520 
equipments and fortifications blocking
and<00:03:43.350> targeting<00:03:44.359> so<00:03:45.359> why<00:03:46.079> do<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.260> need<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.500> know

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
and targeting so why do you need to know

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.440 
and targeting so why do you need to know
this<00:03:46.799> because<00:03:47.370> protection<00:03:48.030> doesn't<00:03:48.299> really

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
this because protection doesn't really

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.690 
this because protection doesn't really
protect<00:03:48.630> from<00:03:48.900> everything<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:50.160> only<00:03:50.340> protects

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
protect from everything it only protects

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.880 
protect from everything it only protects
from<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.850> very<00:03:51.060> specific<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:51.989> narrow<00:03:52.260> list<00:03:52.680> of

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
from a very specific and narrow list of

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.470 
from a very specific and narrow list of
things<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.760> can<00:03:53.970> make<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.180> difference

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
things it can make the difference

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.940 
things it can make the difference
between<00:03:54.540> your<00:03:54.810> night<00:03:54.989> of<00:03:55.079> infamy<00:03:55.470> surviving<00:03:55.920> a
