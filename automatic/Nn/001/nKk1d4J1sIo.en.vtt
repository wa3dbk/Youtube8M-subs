minutes<00:03:55.530> using<00:03:55.830> it<00:03:56.010> standing<00:03:56.430> up<00:03:56.550> supported

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
minutes using it standing up supported

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.430 
minutes using it standing up supported
with<00:03:57.270> one<00:03:57.420> hand<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.840> drawing<00:03:58.080> with<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.320> other

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
with one hand and drawing with the other

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.010 
with one hand and drawing with the other
and<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:59.100> will<00:03:59.310> tie<00:03:59.790> your<00:04:00.000> arm<00:04:00.240> out<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.780> this

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
and it will tie your arm out so this

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.840 
and it will tie your arm out so this
thing<00:04:01.260> is<00:04:01.380> better<00:04:01.560> sitting<00:04:01.980> on<00:04:02.070> your<00:04:02.190> lap<00:04:02.430> or

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
thing is better sitting on your lap or

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.160 
thing is better sitting on your lap or
on<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:03.030> table<00:04:03.450> when<00:04:03.570> you're<00:04:03.690> drawing<00:04:03.870> with<00:04:04.080> it

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
on a table when you're drawing with it

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.020 
on a table when you're drawing with it
but<00:04:04.260> let's<00:04:04.470> face<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.740> that's<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.670> best<00:04:05.850> way<00:04:06.000> to

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
but let's face it that's the best way to

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.540 
but let's face it that's the best way to
draw<00:04:06.330> with<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.540> book<00:04:06.810> or<00:04:07.080> a<00:04:07.110> paper<00:04:07.410> pad<00:04:07.800> too<00:04:08.220> so

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
draw with a book or a paper pad too so

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.550 
draw with a book or a paper pad too so
that's<00:04:08.970> not<00:04:09.270> really<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.780> big<00:04:10.080> deal

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
that's not really a big deal

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.500 
that's not really a big deal
and<00:04:10.860> it's<00:04:11.160> certainly<00:04:11.550> no<00:04:11.820> deal-breaker

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
and it's certainly no deal-breaker

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.820 
and it's certainly no deal-breaker
