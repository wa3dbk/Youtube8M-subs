00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
this off so we got this side piece off

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.260 
this off so we got this side piece off
over<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:58.699> now<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.879> look<00:01:00.000> underneath

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
over here now you can look underneath

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.640 
over here now you can look underneath
here<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.430> want<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:02.820> up

so it's important to note that thing go

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.450 
so it's important to note that thing go
that<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.939> best<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.630> around<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:13.460> try

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that it is best to go around and try

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.380
