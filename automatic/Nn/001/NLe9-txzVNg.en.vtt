what I've done in my trial and error
Stephan<00:00:19.560> curry<00:00:19.740> has<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.730> best<00:00:20.880> floater<00:00:21.150> in

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
Stephan curry has the best floater in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.939 
Stephan curry has the best floater in
the<00:00:21.359> game<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.750> just<00:00:21.779> goes<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.619> know<00:00:22.740> very

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the game it just goes in you know very

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.640 
the game it just goes in you know very
consistently<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.199> you<00:00:25.199> know<00:00:25.289> I've<00:00:25.380> tried

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
consistently and you know I've tried

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.990 
consistently and you know I've tried
Tony<00:00:25.890> Parker<00:00:26.310> I've<00:00:26.430> tried<00:00:26.640> other<00:00:26.789> point

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
Tony Parker I've tried other point

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.339 
Tony Parker I've tried other point
guards<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.359> they'll<00:00:27.449> go<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.810> once<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.199> while

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
guards and they'll go in once in a while

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.259 
guards and they'll go in once in a while
even<00:00:29.189> though<00:00:29.369> they<00:00:29.460> should<00:00:29.609> go<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.789> more<00:00:29.939> often

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
even though they should go in more often

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.609 
even though they should go in more often
especially<00:00:30.510> for<00:00:30.810> Tony<00:00:30.990> Parker<00:00:31.050> sake<00:00:31.500> but

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
especially for Tony Parker sake but

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.319 
especially for Tony Parker sake but
Stephan<00:00:32.099> curry<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> one<00:00:32.759> guy<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.239> I

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
Stephan curry is the one guy that I I

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.209 
Stephan curry is the one guy that I I
know<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.780> floater<00:00:34.140> will<00:00:34.320> most<00:00:34.530> likely<00:00:34.770> go<00:00:35.040> in

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
know a floater will most likely go in

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.440 
know a floater will most likely go in
and<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.059> there's<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> lot<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.360> different

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and I think there's a lot of different

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.260 
and I think there's a lot of different
things<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.050> into<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.559> equation<00:00:38.270> for

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
things that go into that equation for

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.240 
things that go into that equation for
when<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.480> comes<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.989> floater<00:00:40.320> success<00:00:40.800> as

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
when it comes to the floater success as

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.369 
when it comes to the floater success as
you<00:00:41.430> saw<00:00:41.579> his<00:00:41.700> layup<00:00:41.850> was<00:00:42.059> 95<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> think<00:00:43.230> that's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
you saw his layup was 95 I think that's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.080 
you saw his layup was 95 I think that's
it<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.980> variable<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.670> goes<00:00:44.820> into<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
it one variable that goes into the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.600 
it one variable that goes into the
equation<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.809> successful<00:00:46.710> floater<00:00:46.980> he

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
equation for that successful floater he

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.639 
equation for that successful floater he
has<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> 96<00:00:48.390> offensive<00:00:48.930> awareness<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.469> think

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
has a 96 offensive awareness I think

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.260 
has a 96 offensive awareness I think
that<00:00:49.829> helps<00:00:50.129> out<00:00:50.250> as<00:00:50.370> well<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.059> main

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that helps out as well and the main

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.420 
that helps out as well and the main
thing<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:51.660> shoot<00:00:51.930> off<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> dribble<00:00:52.469> 86

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
thing here shoot off the dribble 86

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.130 
thing here shoot off the dribble 86
shoot<00:00:53.640> off<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.940> dribble<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.420> mean<00:00:54.960> that's<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
shoot off the dribble I mean that's a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.569 
shoot off the dribble I mean that's a
very<00:00:55.440> high<00:00:55.680> shoot<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.070> dribble<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.370> think

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
very high shoot up to dribble I think

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.490 
very high shoot up to dribble I think
only<00:00:56.730> Carmelo<00:00:57.239> Anthony<00:00:57.750> has<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> higher<00:00:58.230> shoot

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
only Carmelo Anthony has a higher shoot

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.110 
only Carmelo Anthony has a higher shoot
off<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> dribble<00:00:58.920> than<00:00:59.129> he<00:00:59.250> does<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.940> game

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
off the dribble than he does in the game

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.740 
off the dribble than he does in the game
right<00:01:00.300> now

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
right now

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.780 
right now
inactive<00:01:02.440> teams<00:01:02.650> not<00:01:02.890> legends<00:01:03.250> of<00:01:03.340> course<00:01:03.550> but

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
inactive teams not legends of course but

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.700 
inactive teams not legends of course but
you<00:01:04.660> take<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.870> layup<00:01:05.199> ranking<00:01:05.590> the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
you take the layup ranking the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.040 
you take the layup ranking the
consistency<00:01:06.280> consistency<00:01:06.670> ranking<00:01:07.510> the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
consistency consistency ranking the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.360 
consistency consistency ranking the
offensive<00:01:08.410> awareness<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.130> shoot<00:01:09.280> off

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
offensive awareness and the shoot off

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.500 
offensive awareness and the shoot off
the<00:01:09.490> dribble<00:01:09.640> all<00:01:09.820> those<00:01:09.970> kind<00:01:10.180> of<00:01:10.210> things<00:01:10.360> I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
the dribble all those kind of things I

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.990 
the dribble all those kind of things I
think<00:01:10.540> factor<00:01:11.020> into<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.320> floater<00:01:11.590> now<00:01:12.400> the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
think factor into the floater now the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
think factor into the floater now the
first<00:01:13.210> thing<00:01:13.300> you<00:01:13.450> want<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.630> learn<00:01:13.750> is<00:01:13.930> the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
first thing you want to learn is the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.540 
first thing you want to learn is the
basic<00:01:14.410> floater<00:01:14.620> so<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:14.950> go<00:01:15.070> from<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.310> top<00:01:15.340> of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
basic floater so you go from the top of

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.250 
basic floater so you go from the top of
the<00:01:15.700> key<00:01:15.910> up<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.570> free-throw<00:01:16.750> line<00:01:16.960> and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
the key up to the free-throw line and

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.650 
the key up to the free-throw line and
activate<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.920> floater<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.630> activate<00:01:19.630> a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
activate the floater to activate a

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.570 
activate the floater to activate a
floater<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.920> one<00:01:21.160> thing<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.400> want<00:01:21.430> to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
floater the one thing you want to

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
floater the one thing you want to
remember<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:22.030> you're<00:01:22.150> always<00:01:22.360> going<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.540> be

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
remember is you're always going to be

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.150 
remember is you're always going to be
moving<00:01:22.750> towards<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.260> basket<00:01:23.440> with<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.920> left

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
moving towards the basket with the left

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.740 
moving towards the basket with the left
joystick<00:01:24.400> so<00:01:24.880> that's<00:01:25.060> always<00:01:25.300> going<00:01:25.600> to<00:01:25.690> be

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
joystick so that's always going to be

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.000 
joystick so that's always going to be
pointing<00:01:26.050> towards<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.350> basket<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:26.800> never

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
pointing towards the basket you never

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.560 
pointing towards the basket you never
stop<00:01:27.250> doing<00:01:27.430> that<00:01:27.610> that's<00:01:28.030> always<00:01:28.300> going<00:01:28.479> to

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
stop doing that that's always going to

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.330 
stop doing that that's always going to
be<00:01:28.600> consistent<00:01:29.110> just<00:01:29.320> always<00:01:29.560> keep<00:01:29.979> holding

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
be consistent just always keep holding

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.760 
be consistent just always keep holding

left joystick towards your basket the
second<00:01:33.160> thing<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.340> want<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.490> do<00:01:33.610> is<00:01:33.729> when<00:01:33.910> you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
second thing you want to do is when you

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.160 
second thing you want to do is when you
want<00:01:34.149> to<00:01:34.210> activate<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.570> floaters<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:34.960> hold

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
want to activate the floaters you hold

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.230 
want to activate the floaters you hold
the<00:01:35.259> left<00:01:35.380> trigger<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.910> at<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.000> same<00:01:37.180> time

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
the left trigger and at the same time

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.900 
the left trigger and at the same time
you<00:01:38.200> use<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.649> second<00:01:39.100> joystick<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.700> one<00:01:39.820> on

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
you use the second joystick the one on

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.790 
you use the second joystick the one on
the<00:01:40.000> right<00:01:40.030> point<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:41.050> towards<00:01:41.410> you<00:01:41.619> or

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
the right point that towards you or

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.999 
the right point that towards you or
point<00:01:42.220> that<00:01:42.430> backwards<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.380> remember<00:01:44.740> those

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
point that backwards so remember those

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.529 
point that backwards so remember those
key<00:01:45.160> things<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.550> left<00:01:45.759> joystick<00:01:45.910> is<00:01:46.270> always

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
key things the left joystick is always

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.180 
key things the left joystick is always
gonna<00:01:46.630> be<00:01:46.720> pointing<00:01:46.990> towards<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.380> basket<00:01:47.530> the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
gonna be pointing towards the basket the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.320 
gonna be pointing towards the basket the
right<00:01:48.399> joystick<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.910> always<00:01:49.119> going<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.300> be

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
right joystick is always going to be

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.180 
right joystick is always going to be
pointing<00:01:49.509> towards<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.530> so<00:01:50.860> it's<00:01:50.979> two

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
pointing towards you so it's two

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.889 
pointing towards you so it's two
opposite<00:01:51.729> movements<00:01:52.539> that<00:01:52.600> you're<00:01:52.720> going<00:01:52.810> to

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
opposite movements that you're going to

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.499 
opposite movements that you're going to
have<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.110> get<00:01:53.229> down<00:01:53.440> simultaneously<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.820> when

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
have to get down simultaneously and when

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.330 
have to get down simultaneously and when
you<00:01:55.630> activate<00:01:56.200> that<00:01:56.350> second<00:01:56.800> Joyce<00:01:56.950> take<00:01:57.190> that

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
you activate that second Joyce take that

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.529 
you activate that second Joyce take that
right<00:01:57.580> joystick<00:01:57.880> when<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.300> want<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.479> move

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
right joystick when you want to move

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.330

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
that backwards you want to hit the left

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.430 
that backwards you want to hit the left
trigger<00:02:00.550> and<00:02:00.850> look<00:02:01.420> where<00:02:01.570> I'm<00:02:01.690> activating<00:02:02.200> it

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
trigger and look where I'm activating it

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.810 
trigger and look where I'm activating it
I'm<00:02:02.619> holding<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.220> left<00:02:03.310> trigger<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.789> the

I'm holding the left trigger and the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.070 
I'm holding the left trigger and the
right<00:02:04.090> joystick<00:02:04.300> when<00:02:04.660> I'm<00:02:04.750> at<00:02:04.899> the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
right joystick when I'm at the

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.420 
right joystick when I'm at the
free-throw<00:02:05.350> line<00:02:05.590> that's<00:02:06.100> when<00:02:06.340> I'm

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
free-throw line that's when I'm

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.130 
free-throw line that's when I'm
activating<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:06.909> floater<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.720> don't<00:02:07.900> always

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
activating the floater you don't always

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.300 
activating the floater you don't always
have<00:02:08.260> to<00:02:08.440> activate<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:08.950> there<00:02:09.070> it<00:02:09.160> always

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
have to activate it there it always

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.919 
have to activate it there it always
depends<00:02:09.670> on<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.880> defense<00:02:10.269> where<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.630> big<00:02:10.780> man

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
depends on the defense where the big man

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.690 
depends on the defense where the big man
is<00:02:11.110> but<00:02:11.260> that's<00:02:11.440> usually<00:02:12.160> where<00:02:12.280> i<00:02:12.310> tend<00:02:12.640> to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
is but that's usually where i tend to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.610 
is but that's usually where i tend to
activate<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:13.989> keep<00:02:14.200> doing<00:02:14.530> this

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
activate it and just keep doing this

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.710 
activate it and just keep doing this
keep<00:02:15.340> practicing<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.510> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
keep practicing this and in the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.900 
keep practicing this and in the
freestyle<00:02:17.140> mode<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.730> eventually<00:02:18.730> it'll

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
freestyle mode and eventually it'll

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.160 
freestyle mode and eventually it'll
become<00:02:19.060> natural<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.870> it'll<00:02:20.019> become

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
become natural to you it'll become

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.630 
become natural to you it'll become
second<00:02:20.650> nature<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.100> you'll<00:02:21.220> know<00:02:21.370> exactly

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
second nature and you'll know exactly

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.759 
second nature and you'll know exactly
when<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.600> how<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.900> use<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.290> it'll<00:02:23.380> be<00:02:23.530> just<00:02:23.620> a

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
when and how to use it it'll be just a

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.229 
when and how to use it it'll be just a
quick<00:02:23.980> trigger<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.400> just<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:25.030> want<00:02:25.180> to

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
quick trigger you just you want to

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.210 
quick trigger you just you want to
dribble<00:02:25.390> around<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.989> then<00:02:26.080> go<00:02:26.769> on<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:27.010> left

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
dribble around and then go on the left

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.650 
dribble around and then go on the left
side<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.640> then<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.150> us<00:02:28.269> doing<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.570> from

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
side and then this is us doing it from

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.850 
side and then this is us doing it from
the<00:02:28.720> baseline<00:02:29.049> so<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.380> could<00:02:29.500> do<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.680> floater

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
the baseline so you could do the floater

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.080 
the baseline so you could do the floater
from<00:02:30.040> anywhere<00:02:30.310> look<00:02:30.519> where<00:02:30.640> we<00:02:30.730> take<00:02:30.880> off

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
from anywhere look where we take off

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.930 
from anywhere look where we take off
from<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.360> baseline<00:02:31.630> now<00:02:31.980> we<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.220> activated

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
from the baseline now we just activated

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.340 
from the baseline now we just activated
it<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.180> by<00:02:34.329> holding<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.690> left<00:02:34.810> trigger<00:02:35.049> and

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
it so by holding the left trigger and

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.800 
it so by holding the left trigger and
the<00:02:35.380> right<00:02:35.980> joystick<00:02:36.250> backwards<00:02:37.239> towards<00:02:37.690> us

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
the right joystick backwards towards us

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.410 
the right joystick backwards towards us
we<00:02:37.840> did<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.530> activation<00:02:39.100> here<00:02:39.850> on<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.209> left

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
we did that activation here on the left

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.390 
we did that activation here on the left
side<00:02:40.600> right<00:02:41.170> before<00:02:41.530> entering<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.860> paint<00:02:42.160> so

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
side right before entering the paint so

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.670 
side right before entering the paint so
that's<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.299> nice<00:02:43.450> area<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.900> do<00:02:44.079> it<00:02:44.200> usually<00:02:44.590> the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
that's a nice area to do it usually the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.020 
that's a nice area to do it usually the
big<00:02:44.829> man<00:02:44.980> will<00:02:45.100> be<00:02:45.190> under<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.430> basket<00:02:45.579> trying

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
big man will be under the basket trying

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.000 
big man will be under the basket trying
to<00:02:46.090> block<00:02:46.329> it<00:02:46.360> but<00:02:46.630> it's<00:02:47.019> very<00:02:47.350> hard<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.739> block

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
to block it but it's very hard to block

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.170 
to block it but it's very hard to block
a<00:02:48.070> floater<00:02:48.400> it's<00:02:48.579> almost<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.910> think<00:02:49.090> it's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
a floater it's almost I think it's

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.940 
a floater it's almost I think it's
impossible<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.750> block<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.989> floater<00:02:50.260> if<00:02:50.530> there's

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
impossible to block a floater if there's

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.770 
impossible to block a floater if there's
at<00:02:51.040> least<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.880> know<00:02:51.970> 2<00:02:52.150> feet<00:02:52.180> between<00:02:52.510> you

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
at least a you know 2 feet between you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.870 
at least a you know 2 feet between you
and<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.260> big<00:02:53.440> man<00:02:53.620> but<00:02:54.610> that's<00:02:54.700> what

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
and the and the big man but that's what

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.610 
and the and the big man but that's what
you<00:02:54.970> want<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.180> do<00:02:55.269> get<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.930> down<00:02:56.110> in<00:02:56.260> practice

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
you want to do get it down in practice

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.170 
you want to do get it down in practice
mode<00:02:56.799> from<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.310> top<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.640> key<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:58.090> the

mode from the top of the key to the
free-throw<00:02:58.360> line<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.900> then<00:02:59.019> do<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.260> from<00:02:59.440> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
free-throw line and then do it from the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.690 
free-throw line and then do it from the
left<00:02:59.709> and<00:02:59.890> then<00:03:00.070> from<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.310> right<00:03:00.459> keep

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
left and then from the right keep

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.310 
left and then from the right keep
practicing<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.239> until<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.750> get<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.079> down

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
practicing that until you get it down

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.199 
practicing that until you get it down
now<00:03:03.160> i'm<00:03:03.280> going<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.489> show<00:03:03.579> you<00:03:03.610> an<00:03:03.730> ingot<00:03:04.060> in

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
now i'm going to show you an ingot in

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.970 
now i'm going to show you an ingot in
game<00:03:04.390> example<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:04.989> i<00:03:05.079> had<00:03:05.230> online<00:03:05.500> today

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
game example that i had online today

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.380 
game example that i had online today
that<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:06.250> guy<00:03:06.370> was<00:03:06.489> mostly<00:03:06.820> running<00:03:07.060> his<00:03:07.239> own

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
that this guy was mostly running his own

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.910 
that this guy was mostly running his own
so<00:03:07.690> there<00:03:07.840> was<00:03:07.930> not<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.170> lot<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.380> floater

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
so there was not a lot of floater

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.470 
so there was not a lot of floater
opportunities<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:09.849> harder<00:03:10.150> against<00:03:10.360> his

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
opportunities it is harder against his

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.000 
opportunities it is harder against his
own<00:03:10.629> but<00:03:10.840> those<00:03:10.959> opportunities<00:03:11.500> are<00:03:11.620> still

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
own but those opportunities are still

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.650 
own but those opportunities are still
there<00:03:12.220> now<00:03:12.730> we're<00:03:12.910> going<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.060> catch<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.480> ball

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
there now we're going to catch the ball

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.600 
there now we're going to catch the ball
from<00:03:14.290> klay<00:03:14.620> Thompson<00:03:15.040> as<00:03:15.129> soon<00:03:15.280> as<00:03:15.370> we

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
from klay Thompson as soon as we

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.220 
from klay Thompson as soon as we
catch<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:16.000> we're<00:03:16.480> going<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.660> move<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.110> left

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
catch it we're going to move to the left

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.290 
catch it we're going to move to the left
our<00:03:17.470> guy<00:03:17.590> won't<00:03:17.830> be<00:03:17.920> able<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.280> react<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:18.670> boom

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
our guy won't be able to react and boom

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.510 
our guy won't be able to react and boom
as<00:03:19.570> soon<00:03:19.780> as<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.050> help<00:03:20.380> defense<00:03:20.830> comes<00:03:21.160> into

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
as soon as the help defense comes into

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.700 
as soon as the help defense comes into
the<00:03:21.610> pain<00:03:21.820> we<00:03:22.090> realize<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.750> natural<00:03:23.200> layup

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
the pain we realize that a natural layup

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.830 
the pain we realize that a natural layup
is<00:03:23.800> not<00:03:24.010> going<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.190> work<00:03:24.250> here<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.240> activate

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
is not going to work here so we activate

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.810 
is not going to work here so we activate
the<00:03:25.990> floater<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.920> help<00:03:27.100> defense<00:03:27.520> can't

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
the floater and the help defense can't

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.160 
the floater and the help defense can't
react<00:03:28.120> in<00:03:28.270> time<00:03:30.360> that's<00:03:31.360> one<00:03:31.600> example<00:03:31.750> where

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
react in time that's one example where

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.750 
react in time that's one example where
you<00:03:32.230> do<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.410> floater<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:32.860> game<00:03:33.100> second

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
you do the floater in game second

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.250 
you do the floater in game second
example<00:03:34.060> we<00:03:34.240> saw<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.660> left<00:03:34.870> side<00:03:35.080> was

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
example we saw that the left side was

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.320 
example we saw that the left side was
empty<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:36.250> we<00:03:36.310> did<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.460> crossover<00:03:36.940> than<00:03:37.180> we<00:03:37.240> did

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
empty so we did a crossover than we did

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.820 
empty so we did a crossover than we did
it<00:03:37.450> behind<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.840> back<00:03:37.990> the<00:03:38.260> Big<00:03:38.380> Mac<00:03:38.560> didn't

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
it behind the back the Big Mac didn't

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.530 
it behind the back the Big Mac didn't
react<00:03:39.070> in<00:03:39.190> time<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.580> we<00:03:40.030> activated<00:03:40.450> the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
react in time and we activated the

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.330 
react in time and we activated the
floater<00:03:40.780> again<00:03:43.350> another<00:03:44.350> example<00:03:44.800> here<00:03:44.950> we<00:03:45.160> go

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
floater again another example here we go

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.280 
floater again another example here we go
but<00:03:46.030> going<00:03:46.209> on<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.360> left<00:03:46.540> side<00:03:46.690> now<00:03:46.900> freeze<00:03:47.200> it

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
but going on the left side now freeze it

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.020 
but going on the left side now freeze it
right<00:03:47.320> here<00:03:47.620> we<00:03:47.830> see<00:03:48.040> Paul<00:03:48.310> George<00:03:48.610> coming<00:03:48.940> in

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
right here we see Paul George coming in

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.190 
right here we see Paul George coming in
from<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.270> weak<00:03:49.420> side<00:03:49.450> we<00:03:49.840> know<00:03:49.990> he's<00:03:50.110> gonna

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
from the weak side we know he's gonna

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.660 
from the weak side we know he's gonna
block<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.709> he's<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:50.980> good<00:03:51.220> defender<00:03:51.340> he's

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
block that he's a good defender he's

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.460 
block that he's a good defender he's
very<00:03:51.850> lengthy<00:03:52.240> look<00:03:52.810> or<00:03:52.959> reactivate<00:03:53.410> the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
photo from same area where we did it in

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.320 
photo from same area where we did it in
the<00:03:56.050> in<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.530> practice<00:03:56.980> tutorial<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:57.489> again

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
the in the practice tutorial so again

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.910 
the in the practice tutorial so again
guys<00:03:58.510> it's<00:03:59.140> going<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.350> become<00:03:59.440> second<00:03:59.890> nature

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
guys it's going to become second nature

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.860 
guys it's going to become second nature
and<00:04:00.190> become<00:04:00.370> very<00:04:00.640> easy<00:04:00.850> for<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.180> but<00:04:01.450> as<00:04:01.570> long

and become very easy for you but as long

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.479 
and become very easy for you but as long
as<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:02.140> go<00:04:02.260> into<00:04:02.410> your<00:04:02.440> practice<00:04:02.680> mode<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.280> do

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
as you go into your practice mode and do

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.370 
as you go into your practice mode and do
it<00:04:03.610> in<00:04:03.670> freestyle<00:04:04.120> do<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.750> there<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.959> lot<00:04:05.170> and

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.960 
it in freestyle do it there a lot and
then<00:04:05.530> do<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.739> in<00:04:05.860> game<00:04:06.070> I<00:04:06.250> hope<00:04:06.550> this<00:04:06.760> helped

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970
