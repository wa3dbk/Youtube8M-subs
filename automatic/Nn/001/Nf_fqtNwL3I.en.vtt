yeah so they match the bottom on my hair
all<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.320> they're<00:01:10.500> not<00:01:10.650> matching<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
all right but they're not matching the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.969 
all right but they're not matching the
top<00:01:11.369> at<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> had<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
top at all if you can see so I had to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.520 
top at all if you can see so I had to
get<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> new<00:01:14.310> pair<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.689> top<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.350> my

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
get a new pair for the top and as my

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.380 
get a new pair for the top and as my
hair<00:01:16.740> lightens<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.790> got<00:01:18.030> paparazzi<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:20.390> 20

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
hair lightens so I got paparazzi in 20

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.960 
hair lightens so I got paparazzi in 20
to<00:01:21.659> 22<00:01:22.049> inches<00:01:22.200> i<00:01:22.619> think<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.670> there's<00:01:23.790> no

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
to 22 inches i think so there's no

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.359 
to 22 inches i think so there's no
soldier<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:25.110> doesn't<00:01:25.439> say<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
soldier it doesn't say and it's the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.600 
soldier it doesn't say and it's the
deluxe<00:01:26.729> full<00:01:27.060> head<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.549> they<00:01:29.549> do

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
deluxe full head and you can see they do

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.609 
deluxe full head and you can see they do
look<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.970> little<00:01:30.000> bit<00:01:30.659> different<00:01:31.140> than<00:01:31.259> my<00:01:31.380> hair

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
look a little bit different than my hair

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.700 
look a little bit different than my hair
but<00:01:31.799> obviously<00:01:32.930> when<00:01:33.930> they're<00:01:34.110> blended<00:01:34.560> in

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
but obviously when they're blended in

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.580 
but obviously when they're blended in
they<00:01:35.100> match<00:01:35.340> really<00:01:36.210> well<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.689> um<00:01:36.930> these<00:01:37.530> are

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590
