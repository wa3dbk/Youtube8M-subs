00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.200 
does my new camera seems to be working
pretty<00:00:55.750> fun<00:00:56.049> so<00:00:56.469> on<00:00:56.620> Verizon<00:00:57.100> 3G<00:00:57.549> service<00:00:57.969> I

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
pretty fun so on Verizon 3G service I

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.389 
pretty fun so on Verizon 3G service I
know<00:00:58.839> that<00:00:59.109> this<00:00:59.289> would<00:00:59.530> most<00:00:59.920> likely<00:01:00.129> work

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
know that this would most likely work

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.840 
know that this would most likely work
with<00:01:00.670> Sprint<00:01:01.479> or<00:01:01.719> ATT<00:01:02.320> as<00:01:02.439> well<00:01:02.589> to<00:01:02.739> this<00:01:03.039> it's

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
with Sprint or ATT as well to this it's

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.539 
with Sprint or ATT as well to this it's
just<00:01:04.089> streaming<00:01:04.360> above<00:01:04.659> an<00:01:04.780> Internet

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
just streaming above an Internet

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.460 
just streaming above an Internet
connectivity<00:01:06.549> wise<00:01:06.880> you'll<00:01:07.840> see<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.229> little

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
connectivity wise you'll see a little

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.670 
connectivity wise you'll see a little
bit<00:01:08.619> of<00:01:08.680> difference<00:01:09.009> in<00:01:09.130> quality<00:01:09.369> but

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
bit of difference in quality but

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:22.070 
bit of difference in quality but
that<00:01:11.630> bad<00:01:12.630> at<00:01:12.780> all

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.330 

now<00:01:23.080> a<00:01:23.110> little<00:01:23.380> while<00:01:23.650> in<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:23.980> video<00:01:24.250> you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
now a little while in the video you

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.460 
now a little while in the video you
start<00:01:24.730> to<00:01:24.820> notice<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.210> little<00:01:25.330> bit<00:01:25.480> of<00:01:25.660> a<00:01:25.750> lag

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
start to notice a little bit of a lag

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.500 
start to notice a little bit of a lag
it's<00:01:26.950> just<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.370> cellular<00:01:27.880> network<00:01:27.910> trying<00:01:28.450> to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
it's just a cellular network trying to

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.540 
it's just a cellular network trying to
keep<00:01:28.690> up<00:01:28.870> with<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:29.140> quality<00:01:29.410> that<00:01:29.860> I've<00:01:30.310> let's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
keep up with the quality that I've let's

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.740 
keep up with the quality that I've let's
give<00:01:30.760> it<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.940> you<00:01:31.030> when<00:01:31.210> you're<00:01:31.360> streaming

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
give it to you when you're streaming

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.500 
give it to you when you're streaming
over<00:01:32.050> Skype<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.610> that's<00:01:33.820> really<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.450> only

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
over Skype so that's really the only

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.630 
over Skype so that's really the only
thing<00:01:34.660> you<00:01:34.900> can't<00:01:35.110> really<00:01:35.230> fix<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.190> and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
thing you can't really fix that and

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.310 
thing you can't really fix that and
unless<00:01:36.970> you're<00:01:37.120> on<00:01:37.210> Wi-Fi<00:01:37.420> it's<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:37.930> lot<00:01:38.080> better

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
unless you're on Wi-Fi it's a lot better

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.560 
unless you're on Wi-Fi it's a lot better
but<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:39.070> still<00:01:39.130> keeps<00:01:39.730> your<00:01:39.940> quality<00:01:40.270> looking

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
but it still keeps your quality looking

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.820 
but it still keeps your quality looking
really<00:01:40.750> good<00:01:40.900> so<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.290> can<00:01:41.410> see<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.680> other

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
really good so you can see the other

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.260 
really good so you can see the other
person<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.340> they<00:01:42.430> can<00:01:42.580> see<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:42.880> really<00:01:43.030> well

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
person and they can see you really well

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.600 
person and they can see you really well
as<00:01:43.360> we'll<00:01:43.480> see<00:01:44.010> sometimes<00:01:45.010> it'll<00:01:45.250> break<00:01:45.430> up

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
as we'll see sometimes it'll break up

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.610 
as we'll see sometimes it'll break up
just<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:45.910> little<00:01:46.120> bit<00:01:46.300> yeah<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.230> was<00:01:47.380> just<00:01:47.500> a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
just a little bit yeah this was just a

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.500 
just a little bit yeah this was just a
short<00:01:47.860> video<00:01:47.980> just<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.400> show<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:49.060> it
