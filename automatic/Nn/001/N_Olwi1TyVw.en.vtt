00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.179
 n in this region we will try to reveal 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.670
 back access cover will open 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.160
 battery ounce lockup Kiev map 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.690
 memory opens very easily but between 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.529
 other lifts 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.089
 and no Tajik cards then 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.579
 something is not observed a thousand 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.359
 normal climate hide that like 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.380
 snarl this plastic 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.759
 and somewhere under authority 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.710
 the only thing that strained and that's it 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.659
 location 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.559
 She is a memory card But in this way 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.740
 opens 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.230
 and here 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.329
 I am very comfortable 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.329
 accounted for like this here we are 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.270
 will see 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.520
 contacts which are in masalls here 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.790
 is that is theoretically 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.040
 odds from theoretical 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.929
 of course 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.700
 what we like here like them so here in it 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.790
 ao memory card 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.150
 maybe even those who are on cam over there like us 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.090
 we put and theoretically we can 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.250
 pop music all the contacts so how 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.680
 it doesnâ€™t really seem to me right 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.210
 was done 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.440
 that is why it is taking shape and 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.370
 shut up i really enjoyed it 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.580
 camera module huge komolli ator 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.210
 important is to take into account 400 grams 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.049
 then we have 3 7 fields, then 1500 million 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.040
 first minutes a hefty kabule 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.610
 author of course 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.570
 and so here is taken here he 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.570
 big fan 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.310
 here 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.420
 here we should recognize more often 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.850
 tc sticker with sms 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.060
 certified 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.520
 and then he has his own un all card 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.040
 iso standard is issued 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.300
 what is growth inside non-standard 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.570
 way power 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.410
 so the pass did not add up 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.430
 Tatarstan 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 the one who is used I close the line 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.300
 plus there is nothing he does not crack and does not creak 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.770
 the assembly is very, very good
