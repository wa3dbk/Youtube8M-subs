but really what this is this isn't about

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.280 
but really what this is this isn't about
me<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.519> isn't<00:02:34.670> even<00:02:34.790> about<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.359> car<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.079> much

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
me it isn't even about the car so much

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.849 
me it isn't even about the car so much
as<00:02:36.560> it's<00:02:37.489> about<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.910> team<00:02:38.120> at<00:02:38.530> CTD<00:02:39.530> and

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
as it's about the team at CTD and

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.250 
as it's about the team at CTD and
without<00:02:40.640> this<00:02:40.970> without<00:02:41.690> them<00:02:41.900> none<00:02:42.049> of<00:02:42.170> this

been thought out and engineered there's

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.580 
been thought out and engineered there's
over<00:03:49.860> 3,000<00:03:50.790> hours<00:03:50.940> into<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:51.870> project<00:03:52.170> in

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
over 3,000 hours into this project in

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.380 
over 3,000 hours into this project in
about<00:03:52.800> four<00:03:53.070> years<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.400> rd<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.500> research<00:03:56.390> it's

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
about four years of rd and research it's

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.180 
about four years of rd and research it's
really<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:57.960> been<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.170> culmination<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.920> great

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
really just been a culmination of great

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.370 
really just been a culmination of great
people<00:03:59.430> doing<00:04:00.270> what<00:04:00.390> they<00:04:00.450> do<00:04:00.630> best<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.140> doing

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
people doing what they do best and doing

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.440 
people doing what they do best and doing
what<00:04:01.530> they<00:04:01.560> love<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.910> think<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.240> is<00:04:03.300> a

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
what they love and I think this is a

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.350 
what they love and I think this is a
great<00:04:03.690> representation<00:04:04.140> of<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:05.490> without

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
great representation of that so without

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.780 
great representation of that so without
further<00:04:06.630> ado<00:04:07.200> I'll<00:04:07.380> I'll<00:04:07.620> open<00:04:08.220> up<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.400> engine

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
further ado I'll I'll open up the engine

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.430 
further ado I'll I'll open up the engine
bay<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.150> can<00:04:09.300> see<00:04:09.540> what<00:04:09.810> what<00:04:10.170> all<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
bay and you can see what what all the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:30.390 
bay and you can see what what all the
goodies<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:11.040> all<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.150> hoopla<00:04:12.900> about<00:04:12.930> is

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:51.170 

holy

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.670 

acid

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.280 

so<00:04:54.979> there<00:04:55.250> are<00:04:55.280> 20<00:04:55.940> x30<00:04:56.590> 294<00:04:57.590> so
