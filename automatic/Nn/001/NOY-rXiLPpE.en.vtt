00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.260
 I think we are very bad in the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.030
 get in the game quickly 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.519
 the goat bit dreamed 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.780
 and then these games I think 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.910
 concentrated on having done a great job 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.070
 worked the game turned and then 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.260
 Unfortunately the third goal was not made and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.029
 then the danger is that you have one against 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.529
 tricks and at the end again 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.730
 did not know what was there 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.699
 it happens is you have again 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.850
 analyze but then you stand here before 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.440
 Such a backdrop with 2 2 is annoying 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.050
 I think it was a very combative 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.920
 hard where both teams deal 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.079
 have invested 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.850
 we have to after in the second 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.170
 halftime we can maybe 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.030
 getting out of balance relatively early 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.559
 But the goal of the league must be too 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.239
 subsequently pave the sack and took 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.719
 there is no longer the problem out there 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.700
 that we are the 2 2 I think on the whole 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.500
 as well as the better team 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.170
 but we have to deal with everything 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.670
 Defend consistency and there is 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.010
 terribly annoying and bitter that was 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.620
 that was the other way around 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.440
 but we have to look ahead 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.980
 And that will not be our goal 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.890
 discourage 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.260
 yes, we knew that aggressive team 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.030
 where everything through the fight is now with 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.910
 many long balls second balls and that 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.530
 Did we stop and yes we were there 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.790
 prepared as I said, I think 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.450
 our game was not bad 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.650
 maybe more consistent then 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.570
 defend together and we have 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.729
 unfortunately twice failed today 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.700
 I believe that the gameplay of 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.619
 Ceramics permanently on top and 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.229
 Slap yourself in every fight 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.210
 after the body is clean though the ball is gone 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.770
 is and we knew that before us 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.610
 We have to be prepared and we have to 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.009
 Do not really have it bad 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.930
 I did that I am training 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.479
 training every now and then 33 eleven meters 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.190
 after training with jana peters 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.630
 and yes enough for me so far well over there 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.080
 the yellow card because it is in my view 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.980
 really push forward and I'm just making me 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.650
 bronze 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.060
 I know what you saw there but yes 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.440
 it will be a new game for us 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.750
 well prepare ours 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.520
 body care was a hard week and 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.770
 then we will plan it all out 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.770
 unfortunately, I'm 100 percent locked 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.320
 but yes I will push the thumb and 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.270
 hope then that we in a threesome 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.670
 we may still be missing next 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.200
 yes, I am self-confident, we are 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.730
 have enough experience in the team 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.360
 and we are self-confident how to do that 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.360
 next week clear
