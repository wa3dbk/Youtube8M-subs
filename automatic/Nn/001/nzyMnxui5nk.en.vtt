I don't think n but they're standing up
over<00:00:18.480> there<00:00:18.660> because<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.960> tables<00:00:19.320> broken

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
over there because the tables broken

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.310 
over there because the tables broken
because<00:00:19.980> he<00:00:20.220> tried<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.760> climb<00:00:21.510> up<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:21.990> threw

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
because he tried to climb up but I threw

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.529 
because he tried to climb up but I threw
him<00:00:22.350> off<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.859> he<00:00:23.010> went<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> table<00:00:23.539> so

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
him off and he went to the table so

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.060 
him off and he went to the table so
that's<00:00:24.840> pretty<00:00:25.109> much<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:25.740> Jim<00:00:25.890> Ross

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
that's pretty much it and then Jim Ross

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.700
