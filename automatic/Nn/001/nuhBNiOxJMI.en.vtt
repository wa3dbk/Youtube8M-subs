 I will try to talk about a defense 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.769
 super known central in this last 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.219
 most of you know you will have 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.860

 to the video and if guys is younes kaboul 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.230
 French central defense of the tottenham 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.450
 a bad beast as you are going to see and without 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.210
 more delay I'll teach you your 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.460
 better statistics and here we have you 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.110
 guys, how are you going to start with your 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.230
 biography as you always know in 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.420
 these chapters of catch it the player 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.910
 from tottenham tottenham hotspur from the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.760
 2010 if I remember correctly it is that it has 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.370
 three seasons in the tottenham of the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.520
 barclays is clear of the English league 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.050
 your french nationalities french 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 play central defense you'll know 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.680
 age is 27 years old attentive guys 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.810
 Uncle 191 to be central will go 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.420
 tremendous and I tell you his skin is good 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.880
 the right so he's right-handed his ratios 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.090
 of attack and defense are defense to 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.800
 medium and medium attack also would 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.530
 much better if the defense in this case 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.660
 It would be high but we do not have that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.940
 ease and good watermarks and bad foot 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.460
 2 as you see two fiber stars 23 of 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.930
 bad foot has nothing is not going to be 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.300
 Central not I give him a lot 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.550
 importance and finally its trait is 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.590
 free direct powerful tell this 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.230
 central boy is going to surprise you 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.690
 has 46 shot but in power in 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.060
 power tucked has 92 me what 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.490
 I recommend it will be a somewhere in the corner 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.200
 example you will find of rejection to kabul 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.120
 in the front and you do not want to lose 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.850
 I recommend you to stick the ball 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.550
 you can even sing goal in that shot 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.979
 and well let's move on with the five 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.229
 more important statistics than for me 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.180
 for this piece of 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.170
 and good, we started with the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.700
 aggressiveness 84 a good average for the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.260
 aggressiveness and aggressiveness know is 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.590
 bite as I say bite the rival 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.450
 be attentive to their movements and 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.610
 not let him breathe so to speak 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.920
 example that a central than a forward 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.810
 receive from behind and not give half 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.540
 back to be stuck not being stuck to 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.790
 central if we add to this its enormous 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.640
 force has 86 of force the truth that 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.269
 is 191 the help plays very well is very 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.239
 hard 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.030
 it is very easy to steal balls with force 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.680
 central mostly I put the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.510
 example of some of some means of 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.980
 some right half of some means 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.290
 left as you know your point 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.019
 strong is the speed but as soon as 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.629
 strength usually go usually tend to go more 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.150
 scarce if kabul is fighters and out he is 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.099
 hunt by force and develop cams at 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.410
 develop literally and the truth that 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.579
 that's going to help a lot to steal those 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.129
 balloons not in robots has 82 the truth 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.040
 that steals the ball very well already you know with 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.870
 the circle that's normal to be 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.139
 central so that 's pretty good that 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.650
 statistics and then two more statistics 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.139
 that the 1 head precision and jump the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.280
 true that has a pretty jump 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.380
 considerable and a head precision 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.970
 pretty good about everything 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.980
 you will notice the truth in the corners 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.139
 that tops goes up to finish the corners 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.230
 pretty good and as I said before 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.060
 that he was attentive to that 191 is going to 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.370
 help a lot because apart from having 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.500
 a big apparent jump apart from having 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.660
 a great head precision because 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.579
 many of you think that this does not 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.930
 It is important but already I say that 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.030
 it continues because there are centrals also that 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.620
 they are tall that they also have good 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.099
 jump but then head accuracy 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.930
 low in statistics is a bit low and 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.579
 the truth that this is then seen that can 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.220
 finish perfectly but you're going to 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.599
 the clouds or send it out and the truth 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.459
 that it is also important to have a 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.750
 good head accuracy like in this 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.670
 kabul case 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.130
 out of these five statistics that 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.480
 for me personally they are the most 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.610
 plus 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.799
 characteristics in your position as 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.320
 you know being central are I'm not going to 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.139
 put my short pass or other things to 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.419
 me these are honestly the most 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.990
 More features I would like me 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:31.199
 I would especially like to highlight your highlight 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.300
 rhythm has 77 rhythm and acceleration 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.639
 of I think you are for the pair too 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.030
 but is that thinking think guys that the 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:43.169
 uncle is a mastodon that measures 191 or 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.970
 that to measure 191 run that think that 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.250
 it's outrageous the truth that it's a 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.990
 tremendous barbarity and that's very 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.880
 indispensable in any team of a 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.699
 barclays or on any equipment too 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.740
 of French people will also do very well 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.490
 Lastly I would also like to highlight 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.289
 of this piece of plant is that 61 of 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.660
 pass is not bad not bad it could be 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.820
 more it is clear that it could be more like 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.710
 everything can be asked for more but the truth 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.930
 that this player also takes the ball 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.090
 very well from below played you already know 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.340
 I like playing touch and I like it 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.789
 how to get this one out of this player in the 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.249
 ball so as you have seen many 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.549
 much 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:24.079
 the global statistics that is not 

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:25.759
 highlights does not stand out in certain 

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:27.259
 statistics but for me it stands out in 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.659
 globally the truth that stands out in 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.029
 global and good assured that it's going to 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:35.580
 bring a piece of final note so 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:37.560
 let's move on with that note to see what 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.500
 that takes all of this younes kaboul 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.599
 and this great central in my opinion 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.689
 he takes a piece of nine with three 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.719
 as I said before it is very complete of 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:50.879
 speed for that 191 that already 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:54.419
 you know that the last one tends this fifa 13 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:56.699
 great great air play is indispensable 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.939
 above it has no very difficult rival 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:02.669
 very hard to beat him up at great 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:05.580
 strength to put body to the rivals and 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.080
 great ball steal so very complete 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.539
 everything you can ask of a 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.520
 central and above all everything that is 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.080
 You can ask a central for your price 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.449
 because the truth is that it's pretty 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.030
 cheap in the market I will leave it for 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.740
 here as always you already know that the 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.020
 Price varies according to the training and os 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.729
 I will leave the standard price and also you 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.039
 I'll leave as usual, I'll leave you 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:29.310
 as always the template in which I 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:31.620
 I use it now and good to say of this 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.090
 player that you have liked the 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.039
 video to give I like that help 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.620
 very much as always I tell you to leave 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.930
 Any comment commenting no 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.550

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.600
 younes kaboul I'm sure that 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.010

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.390
 also your opinion and I hope that 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.940
 be that it is caught from this great 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.100
 player you liked guys so 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.910
