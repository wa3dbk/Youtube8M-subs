00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.359
 hello girls welcome once again to me 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.220
 channel today I bring you other favorites in 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.680
 the previous video that I leave for you 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 here I brought you the bases of makeup 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.099
 favorites 2013 and this time I bring you the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.579
 favorite powder blushes illuminators 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.170
 of 2013 are not many so I will go 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.800
 quickie how pretty blusher 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.670
 shocking but I find it quite 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.790
 useful is this is from matt is the fever tone 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.220
 as you can see, it's quite serveis 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.080
 quite powerful but then according to the 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.290
 amount you put is super nice 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.269
 and according to the amount that you can 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.189
 Make a beautiful years makeup but 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.530
 in the makeup course thanks to this 

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:03.869
 simply beautiful color and what 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.549
 I recommend a lot is the few of 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:09.180
 mack so I recommend you have 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.549
 special matt tones as you see now I have 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.650
 applied a lot but good if it diffuses 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.380
 is very good with the brush if you take a 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.719
 he screamed for example 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.729
 it is very nice second blush that you 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.729
 I teach and that I have taught you in many 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.009
 looks is one of nash is in the love tone 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.000
 It is one of my favorites for the day to 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:33.439
 day is this ati as you see is very natural 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.810
 and being mate we can use it to 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.119
 the eastern day here 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.540
 and that is apart that diffuses 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.910
 perfectly 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.270
 if you do not have any rouge and you want 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.500
 and you want to invest that you would invest 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.300
 precisely in that third blusher that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.490
 I'm going to show you is from the flower brand more 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.710
 more flower is a quite economic brand 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.140
 and I find it super good for 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.240
 reelection for the relationship 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.680
 quality-price that this here has me 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.550
 I think I have the old packaging 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:09.040
 because they changed them a year ago or 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:11.920
 even more is the tone that 116 like that 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.660
 come two blushes good is a color 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.570
 more toasted and here you have one more color 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.760
 rosita this reason is not much and this 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.670
 yes it was noticeable enough and even for 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.310
 mark the cheek area a little bit 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.260
 super this one is totally matte and this one 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.700
 it has a purplish pigmentation but 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.530
 they are both precious 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.110
 and for the price it deserves a 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.569
 I'm worth the blusher quarter that I'm going to 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.180
 teach is one of the brand bobby braun 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.260
 this one does change the texture because it's 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.510
 a creamy texture is like that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.750
 the tone 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.230
 is this pink pay the number 11 I have tried 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.849
 enough blushes of these in cream and 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.110
 those of bobby braun on those who most 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.939
 I like I have these 6 and they are beautiful 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.980
 and I recommend it all amount to 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.040
 apply do not worry because it is 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.769
 super easy you can put it in so much 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.510
 blush as lips as shadow I os 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.879
 I recommend it for both lips and 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.799
 for rouge it diffuses very well 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.109
 you can apply well I apply it with the 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.400
 finger but you can also apply it with 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:23.459
 a skunk is perfectly here 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.030
 is one of the most beautiful that I think I have 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.519
 from bobby braun and nothing I really like the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.780
 separate result does not parch anything the 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.549
 skin I have super juices and is and for 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.799
 the day to day was last blusher 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.560
 I'm going to teach and I do not know if you see it 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.599
 you can find is one of kiko era of 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.970
 collection but I imagine it will go 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:49.680
 taking out because they are wonderful is 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:55.109
 to be here is velvet this plus is in the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.870
 Ringtone 05 Green Tweet is a bit rouge 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.420
 we can say yes yes now if this is 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.370
 the blusher and it is precious 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.480
 same as with bobby braun rouge 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.810
 we do not apply 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.780
 and we extend it with the finger is super 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.090
 beautiful 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.400
 I here I have spent applying but it is 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.200
 that is so beautiful here so beautiful and 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.230
 with a small amount it diffuses very 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.760
 well and it looks beautiful as blush 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.139
 I have to say that this does not dry out 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.630
 nothing the skin like bobby 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.760
 braun I need cream blushes 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.639
 because they are the ones that better harm me so much 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.710
 this like this are great both 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.780
 but of course this is much cheaper 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.310
 as powders you already know that I do not 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.889
 applied many for the same subject that 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.980
 I always explain my skin is very dry 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.070
 it flakes off and the powders the only thing that 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:49.169
 They do is resect me more and mark me more 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:51.990
 those dry areas then the only ones 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.870
 powders that I have noticed that they have not 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.060
 done that effect have been two these are 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.680
 the are the translucent ones that 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.180
 they know themselves super well the powder is super 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.130
 finite 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.050
 micro is a pass and is the only 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.110
 powders that leave me super soft skin 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.150
 and like a porcelain skin so 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.940
 you play and I love you did not do it 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.520
 every day because they forget me because I do not 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.930
 I need them but I do like them for 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.199
 when I have to last longer the 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.970
 makeup or I know that a bibi cream or a 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.800
 make-up base on one lasts the others 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.169
 powder that he always taught in each look 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.780
 are these bad flowers are going super good 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.710
 the only thing that I have to highlight is 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:41.580
 that the little ball that brings that is very 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.110
 rough and I think it's that I'm going to throw it away 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.300
 that I'm going to use one of mine 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.150
 they are super soft the dust is not so 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.840
 finite like the other but it is very 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.520
 well give me this so they give me color 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.130
 they have a little tanned tone by 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.610
 just picked one is my favorite 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.080
 always and it's a bit expensive but I think 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.509
 It is also worth investing in 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.880
 this is this one of nash mittens 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.350
 silencer here is pretty clear 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.470
 but I'm doing well 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:14.310
 it is totally mother beautiful is blurred 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:17.639
 very well and you do not notice the cut to 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.979
 tune the skin a bit and to 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:23.129
 to darken some areas of the face 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:25.139
 to play with the chiaroscuro 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:28.560
 super good and I'm super happy with 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:31.949
 they certainly do not regret it for 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.599
 nothing to have bought it and it is one of my 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.029
 good favorites up here the video from 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:37.379
