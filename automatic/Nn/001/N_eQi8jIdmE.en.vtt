00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
game so I already bought two cars but I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.620 
game so I already bought two cars but I
wanted<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.670> show<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.880> what<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.300> could<00:02:47.450> do

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
wanted to show you what you could do

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.810 
wanted to show you what you could do
with<00:02:47.660> tree<00:02:48.020> or<00:02:48.230> even<00:02:48.500> with<00:02:48.650> four<00:02:48.890> cars<00:02:49.130> I<00:02:49.430> know

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
with tree or even with four cars I know

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.400 
with tree or even with four cars I know
that<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.209> overkill<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.050> if<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.290> were

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
that this is overkill but if you were

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.720 
that this is overkill but if you were
playing<00:02:51.680> with<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.860> bunch<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.190> friends<00:02:52.490> than<00:02:52.700> you

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
playing with a bunch of friends than you

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.980 
playing with a bunch of friends than you
would<00:02:52.940> end<00:02:53.120> up<00:02:53.209> doing<00:02:53.270> something<00:02:53.690> like<00:02:53.930> this

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
would end up doing something like this

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.870 
would end up doing something like this
the<00:02:54.590> most<00:02:54.830> important<00:02:55.400> thing<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:55.760> have

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
the most important thing that you have

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.490 
the most important thing that you have
to<00:02:55.970> keep<00:02:56.209> in<00:02:56.360> mind<00:02:56.390> is<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.050> need<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.350> keep

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
to keep in mind is that you need to keep

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.949 
to keep in mind is that you need to keep
the<00:02:57.650> cars<00:02:57.920> in<00:02:58.130> good<00:02:58.310> shape<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.240> hop<00:02:59.420> in<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.810> out

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
the cars in good shape so hop in and out

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
so that you get run there you could keep

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.240

especially well as a criminal is
basically<00:05:16.490> in<00:05:16.639> between<00:05:17.000> your<00:05:17.180> spawn<00:05:17.570> and<00:05:17.780> the

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
basically in between your spawn and the

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.930 
basically in between your spawn and the
tanker<00:05:18.349> and<00:05:18.470> you<00:05:18.800> can<00:05:18.949> even<00:05:19.070> run<00:05:19.370> back<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:19.789> get

tanker and you can even run back to get
a<00:05:19.970> second<00:05:20.360> car<00:05:20.539> you<00:05:20.900> could<00:05:21.080> block<00:05:21.289> off<00:05:21.500> this

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
a second car you could block off this

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.320 
a second car you could block off this
entire<00:05:21.830> Road<00:05:22.280> just<00:05:22.520> on<00:05:22.699> your<00:05:22.849> own<00:05:23.000> from<00:05:23.120> this
