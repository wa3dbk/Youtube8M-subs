00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.719
 when it comes to expedition team cold weather 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.610
 We are always happy to advise you 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.480
 our longtime friend and partner 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.280
 arved fox 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.529
 he is a leading polar and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.189
 So climate research is an expert in it 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.650
 that you need the 610 conditions 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.699
 Arctic is a merciless teacher 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.500
 if I make an error 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.539
 no matter what, then I get everything 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.689
 always apply the receipt if you 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.949
 just sits in storage and will be cold 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.820
 because you have his body heat 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.820
 preserve 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.960
 we've got exactly the same one here 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.380
 data volume in this vessel we have the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.240
 700 down as well as in the polar ice parker 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.060
 in the second vessel we have ours 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.910
 standard de 550er the difference it 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.740
 actually only the bulk of the force in the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.240
 singing down we immediately recognize that 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.640
 the volume of the lever is higher 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.560
 As a result, this down has an extremely good 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.540
 put heat insulation on the shoulder 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.730
 We are down to our technical 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.560
 micro mapping through the more long 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.770
 Construction is again the pressure 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.850
 for example, at the cuxhaven 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.630
 The outer material fills several 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.820
 functions 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.619
 It is windproof a key factor 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.440
 when it comes to cooling the subject 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.660
 durable water repellent light yet 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.660
 very robust to the demands on tours 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.310
 on the one hand , you want to be one 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.930
 naturally warm and comfortable on 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.580
 you can not do the other side 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.530
 take any equipment with you 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.630
 everything has to be functional it has to be 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.369
 To be durable, you need something where you can 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.560
 Many bags have where you can get everything 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.329
 can stow in it 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.950
 together with work we also have the 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.530
 wattierten snowfall develops the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.450
 not only the wind from below lures 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.430
 but also the cold polar ice 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.070
 Parker is with more cold protection 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.549
 details equipped for example the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:54.259
 Deep oil hood through the fake fur 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.090
 edge is supported so if you have the 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.640
 Consider something like that in the last 20 years 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.200
 have developed at equipment 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.950
 We are really a very, very, very much today 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.950
 high standard
