see<00:04:02.480> from<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.290> battery<00:04:03.950> that's<00:04:04.280> absolutely

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
see from the battery that's absolutely

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.130 
see from the battery that's absolutely
fine<00:04:04.940> that's<00:04:05.239> good<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:05.599> that<00:04:05.750> means<00:04:05.930> that

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
fine that's good so that means that

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.789 
fine that's good so that means that
power<00:04:06.349> is<00:04:07.069> getting<00:04:07.489> into<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:08.180> iPhone<00:04:08.799> from

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
power is getting into the iPhone from

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.530 
power is getting into the iPhone from
the<00:04:09.920> battery<00:04:10.280> at<00:04:10.370> least<00:04:10.609> what<00:04:10.909> we<00:04:11.060> need<00:04:11.299> to<00:04:11.390> do

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
the battery at least what we need to do

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.210 
the battery at least what we need to do
is<00:04:11.690> just<00:04:11.840> wait<00:04:12.049> for<00:04:12.170> this<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.349> switch<00:04:12.680> on<00:04:12.950> and

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
is just wait for this to switch on and

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.050 
is just wait for this to switch on and
we<00:04:13.670> can<00:04:13.819> test<00:04:14.060> to<00:04:14.209> see<00:04:14.480> if<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:16.280> charges<00:04:16.579> and

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
we can test to see if it charges and

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.509 
we can test to see if it charges and
hopefully<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:17.900> will<00:04:18.019> ok<00:04:18.799> here<00:04:19.010> we<00:04:19.130> are<00:04:19.160> then

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
hopefully it will ok here we are then

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.570 
hopefully it will ok here we are then
the<00:04:20.060> phone<00:04:20.660> is<00:04:21.229> switched<00:04:21.650> on<00:04:22.070> as<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:22.280> can<00:04:22.400> see

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
the phone is switched on as you can see

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.180 
the phone is switched on as you can see
it<00:04:22.639> needs<00:04:22.820> activation<00:04:23.690> I<00:04:23.889> can't<00:04:24.889> really<00:04:25.010> go

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
it needs activation I can't really go

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.339 
it needs activation I can't really go
any<00:04:25.340> further<00:04:25.550> than<00:04:25.849> that<00:04:25.880> cost<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.599> phone<00:04:27.200> has

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
any further than that cost the phone has

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.350 
any further than that cost the phone has
got<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.560> passcode<00:04:28.039> on<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.430> that's<00:04:29.240> absolutely

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
got a passcode on it that's absolutely

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.510 
got a passcode on it that's absolutely
fine<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:29.960> don't<00:04:30.200> really<00:04:30.410> need<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.830> know<00:04:31.010> the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
fine I don't really need to know the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.430 
fine I don't really need to know the
passcode<00:04:32.000> or<00:04:32.479> need<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.870> know<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.200> that<00:04:33.229> the

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
passcode or need to know is that the

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.180 
passcode or need to know is that the
repair<00:04:33.880> has<00:04:34.880> fixed<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.720> problem<00:04:36.440> if<00:04:36.740> I<00:04:36.950> can

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
repair has fixed the problem if I can

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.629 
repair has fixed the problem if I can
get<00:04:37.340> focused<00:04:38.380> this<00:04:39.380> it<00:04:39.650> has<00:04:39.919> fixed<00:04:40.460> the

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
problem so we can see there the

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.159 
problem so we can see there the
batteries<00:04:43.430> got<00:04:43.520> 11<00:04:43.880> percent<00:04:44.150> in<00:04:44.330> it<00:04:44.449> and<00:04:44.660> it's

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
really like I've been saying the phone

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.159 
really like I've been saying the phone
obviously<00:04:52.270> powers<00:04:53.270> from<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:53.599> battery<00:04:53.930> again

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
obviously powers from the battery again

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.100 
obviously powers from the battery again
but<00:04:54.380> is<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:54.680> charging<00:04:55.220> as<00:04:56.150> we<00:04:56.240> can<00:04:56.360> see<00:04:56.510> yes<00:04:56.930> it

but is it charging as we can see yes it

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.469 
but is it charging as we can see yes it
is<00:04:57.289> so<00:04:57.680> that's<00:04:57.830> good<00:04:58.039> to<00:04:58.190> know
