00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.440 
writer I used a

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.950 
writer I used a
grabbing<00:02:49.970> just<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.420> hat<00:02:50.599> tip<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:50.950> the

so that I could get inside and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.000 
so that I could get inside and
cut<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.620> where<00:02:59.340> sticks<00:02:59.840> to<00:03:00.000> the
