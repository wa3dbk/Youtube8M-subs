 It is a search When you press this button magnifying glass 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.409

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.320
 Yes 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:04.659
 Then I want to go into the main subject 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:08.769
 What is it like online virgin 00:00 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.879
 I'm in the company of this file called chrome , but I open it 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.879
 As you understand 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.810
 This no drive 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.620
 This will be the google drive 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:26.690
 Well google drive is displayed in parallel in storage like this 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.040
 I will 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.540
 This is to be in the other online storage 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.540
 There is software that can 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.850
 In this way, have the web strike open 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.750
 File 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.110
 Facility 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.110
 game 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.740
 If you get hit, I already have those two but 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.660
 Three come out like this 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:06.910
 File system for dropbox fest ftp file system 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.910
 Enter system 4 &amp; live 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.980
 It is good to understand if you see the file 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.970
 In my case I also put dropbox 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.170
 Same as google drive If you are using dropbox 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.530
 By putting the software as before 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.530
 this 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.850
 Dropbox will be displayed as well as google drive 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.660
 I will 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:40.140
 I would like to go this one drive for that trial 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:44.800
 That one drive so that you know 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.810
 It becomes this line storage of microsoft system 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.300
 To this there 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.300
 It seems the least condition to register 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.110
 Well then 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.110
 Mount here 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.360
 Today 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.550
 Like this 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:19.910
 Who Yeah drive will come in 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:24.020
 That 's what I've been doing for the first time for me several times, so just with the mount button 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:30.300
 I received it, but if you are new to you 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:36.919
 You'll probably be prompted for an account and password if you're mounting 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.919
 If you enter the password for this password, it will look like this 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:52.719
 That's a lot of storage with this much You can compensate for various minutes 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.719
 I think there is a free part in this online storage, so I can compensate 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:02.270
 File system is it just that little bit of thought you're using me this 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:06.500
 dropbox is stable but with sftp 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.930
 It is 1 drive It is called sftp It is one that is used rental server 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.140
 I think I should use it if I have it 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.600
 Well among the Nde is bad around here a little stability 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.980
 I think it will be stable if you cut it 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:24.660
 I introduced that to 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.660

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.950

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:14.849

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:17.629
 This area is quite convenient 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.629
 think 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:28.449
 Well then today 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:28.449
