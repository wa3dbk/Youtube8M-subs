00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:26.570
 dear Santa Claus this year I was 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:33.140
 a little brat but I wanted to ask you a 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:39.480
 little gift to me and I'd love to 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:44.550
 want a green puppet of what 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:49.019
 he moves his arms remotely though 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:57.150
 it is not possible to settle for even 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:01:03.620
 that so many remote control rock sense 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.620
 Merry Christmas wishes Pierluigi 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.050
 good bye to all the scene you also have 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.510
 assisted a little while ago it was more or less a 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.000
 example of how he wrote a letter a 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.369
 Santa Claus when I was little because 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.400
 yes times have changed before there is 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.960
 satisfied with a few things for example if 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.130
 I had 7 years in 2013 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.040
 probably my letter to dad 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.060
 christmas would have been so dear dad 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.150
 Christmas 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.020
 the group behaved this year 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.460
 very well 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:06.240
 thulium point first ray of all costs 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:10.319
 a 27- inch imac with xbox one 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:16.020
 because now the exhibitions feel past 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:18.720
 the accused gta 5 for the xbox one pussy 14 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:25.790
 and after seasickness and finally 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.790
 the galaxy note 3.8 rimini forlÃ¬ and gps 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.400
 then Christmas as everything present 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.709
 on the face of the earth to so many things 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.870
 positive and many negative things 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.330
 the nice thing is that it feels good in 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.920
 family eats a pandori bang 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:47.459
 panettone is played tumor both do 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.310
 crib trees light cocks and decks but le 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.360
 many negative things, for example 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.730
 and I can't stand it in the city 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.340
 begin to put he gave us bar and 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.010
 the lace sets up shop windows with all the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.340
 things line this type already from the end of October 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.799
 that is, it ends mid-August and is already Christmas 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.530
 not to mention why so every 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.959
 year we say no anyway enough from 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.150
 next year no more gifts 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.150
 at the last moment and then on time 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:45.470
 success tricks for December 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.959
 with Christmas competitions then staying in 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.630
 theme gifts every person has their own 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.360
 kind of reaction when he opened a gift 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.890
 precisely I have divided these people into 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.780
 three categories of doubt the uncaring 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.840
 the exaggerated and I don't know how to react the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.030
 uncaring and he who whatever 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.640
 The presents do n't give a fuck 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.720
 regardless if you have a nice gift a 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.720
 shitty gift 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.009
 the exaggerated and the one who exaggerates 

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:43.219
 precisely even if maybe it is given as a present 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.139
 the saddest thing on the face 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:49.360
 of the earth that can be given to one 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:53.439
 person and god and what this race is 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.439
 but it 's fine Thursday 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.990
 the beautiful beautiful and full in the 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.100
 bill that I missed and beautiful 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.900
 yellow I missed just gianfra mile 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.300
 I don't know how fast and very beautiful 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.100
 probably react to the category 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.380
 which I belong too maybe 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:21.090
 have a gift may also like though 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:24.210
 type is that we don't know how to manifest 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.820
 to our emotion and therefore there 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.740
 we find ourselves looking like we're kind of 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:41.300
 reciting and in the end giving away 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:45.180
 like you didn't have to, however, it's beautiful 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:50.370
 thank you very much indeed but that you don't 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:53.250
 like beautiful and beautiful jokes 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.980
 no from which of any other thing I see 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.280
 there is night if what a beautiful one 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.190
 I really didn't want the theater to go 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.710
 well he teases me 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.380
 I knew you would be upset and 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.560
 finally another thing that surely there 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.500
 It comes to mind thinking of the amended birth 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.220
 cinepanettoni already the cinepanettoni 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:21.250
 I believe that to summarize them is enough 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:26.600
 this thing is happy is bordachev 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:29.090
 boxwood chopsticks grounded in medical bucio 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.460
 de ass anyway all in all the best 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:36.610
 like that because in the end let's face it 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.610
 makes everyone happier, all better 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.080
 apart from the grinch maybe we say it makes us 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.750
 almost all happier 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.090
 almost all more good and above all not 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.610
 I'm looking forward to eating a nice pandoro 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.400
 I go real when I greet luca 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.740
