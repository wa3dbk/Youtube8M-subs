00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
key to staying ahead of the game yeah we

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.720 
key to staying ahead of the game yeah we
used<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.079> use<00:01:02.289> this<00:01:02.410> dated<00:01:02.859> technology<00:01:03.489> called

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
used to use this dated technology called

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.930 
used to use this dated technology called
boom<00:01:04.270> microphones<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.830> problem<00:01:06.280> was<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.700> just

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
boom microphones the problem was it just

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.700 
boom microphones the problem was it just
wasted<00:01:07.360> so<00:01:07.600> much<00:01:07.720> time<00:01:07.780> because<00:01:08.200> it<00:01:08.350> would<00:01:08.500> get

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
wasted so much time because it would get

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.740 
wasted so much time because it would get
in<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:08.950> shot<00:01:09.280> then<00:01:09.759> it<00:01:09.880> was<00:01:09.970> just<00:01:10.149> such<00:01:10.330> a<00:01:10.360> pain

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
in the shot then it was just such a pain

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.249 
in the shot then it was just such a pain
in<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:10.960> ass<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.729> we<00:01:12.940> found<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.360> perfect<00:01:13.840> way

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
in the ass so we found the perfect way

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.219 
in the ass so we found the perfect way
to<00:01:14.320> hide<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.800> microphone<00:01:15.310> on<00:01:15.460> our<00:01:15.580> bodies<00:01:15.910> or<00:01:16.720> we

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
to hide a microphone on our bodies or we

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.620 
to hide a microphone on our bodies or we
went<00:01:17.410> one<00:01:17.619> step<00:01:17.770> further<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.250> hid<00:01:18.550> it<00:01:18.670> in<00:01:19.000> our

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
went one step further and hid it in our

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.350 
went one step further and hid it in our
bodies<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:21.280> we<00:01:21.610> have<00:01:21.759> these<00:01:21.880> microphones

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
bodies see we have these microphones

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.910 
bodies see we have these microphones
created<00:01:22.899> in<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.020> shape<00:01:23.229> of<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.440> third<00:01:23.740> nipple

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
created in the shape of a third nipple

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.730 
created in the shape of a third nipple
and<00:01:24.670> they<00:01:25.060> blend<00:01:25.420> in<00:01:25.539> perfectly<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:26.110> mean<00:01:26.380> you

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
and they blend in perfectly I mean you

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.290 
and they blend in perfectly I mean you
can't<00:01:26.950> even<00:01:27.039> tell<00:01:27.310> them<00:01:27.429> apart<00:01:27.520> from<00:01:28.149> my

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
can't even tell them apart from my

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.210 
can't even tell them apart from my
nipples<00:01:28.660> this<00:01:29.470> gives<00:01:29.710> us<00:01:29.860> a<00:01:29.979> lot<00:01:30.160> of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
nipples this gives us a lot of

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.160 
nipples this gives us a lot of
flexibility<00:01:30.880> with<00:01:31.090> our<00:01:31.270> audio<00:01:31.630> because<00:01:31.960> we

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
flexibility with our audio because we

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.569 
flexibility with our audio because we
were<00:01:32.290> actually<00:01:32.439> able<00:01:32.799> to<00:01:32.979> hide<00:01:33.369> these

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
were actually able to hide these

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.999 
were actually able to hide these
microphones<00:01:34.150> all<00:01:34.540> around<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.320> studio<00:01:35.530> and

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
microphones all around the studio and

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.280 
microphones all around the studio and
it's<00:01:36.369> crazy<00:01:36.729> because<00:01:37.060> it's<00:01:37.479> like<00:01:37.869> they're<00:01:38.110> not

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
it's crazy because it's like they're not

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.649 
it's crazy because it's like they're not
even<00:01:38.350> there<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:42.009> owe<00:01:42.250> most<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.850> our<00:01:42.909> success<00:01:43.149> to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
even there we owe most of our success to

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.200 
even there we owe most of our success to
