00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:35.590
 Bar answer to tie the game 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.380
 here in the beautiful gaza 2 for the cajias 2 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.330
 also for the guaratinguetá team 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.820
 My opinion I think it was not lacking right? 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.770
 I think it did on television there must have 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.970
 seen six thousand better but in my 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.160
 opinion I think it was not I was 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.660
 running here I did not even see him for what? 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.209
 they told him that the ball of the area had 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.459
 Philippe ran on top of me, the 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.550
 lived a little away from the pitch he 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.050
 interpreted that it was his fault but 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.000
 I think I had a free kick in 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.010
 game and I think it was very radical already 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.840
 but I think it's part of the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.970
 Soccer is ball forward, thank God. 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.840
 I managed to tie the game and had the 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.820
 chance to turn 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.799
 there has not ever forget this and ball 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.060
 think about the tupi né that took this generation 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.860
 from the second half the team came back very 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.979
 different than how was this conversation in the 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.140
 locker room I think it was more the part 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.450
 to put your hand in the awareness that the 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.450
 team was not well and had to 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.740
 come back for the result and it was 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.740
 this for the sake of conscience 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.100
