00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.160
 on July 16, 2013 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.200

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.610

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.180

 but here 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.170
 and two down 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:44.699

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.699
 every time when he bought these gifts 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.440
 and this I bought and lost 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.320
 some 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.510
 leaflets 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.800
 until it's up here I have it there 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.800
 to see if it opens something 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.220
 it's pretty but 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.090
 the leaves also more or less 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.090
 Again in its place 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.690
 but a friend 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.479
 and then it arrives I have the rosadita 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.479
 the yellow 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:36.750
 the port of departure the good I got it 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:40.640
 on the amazon amazon page such com 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.640
 this is another one that was very nice 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.090
 and behind there is another one that will be a color 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.090
 little weird 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.780
 in a shop called pp is 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.780
 here in Munich 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.630
 to the others 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.630
 You need me here 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.380
 it's here I worked on it in 2005 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.110
 Cuba 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.980
 the blood 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.650
 give one 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.350
 but before giving it away 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.330
 good 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.160
 in Cuba, people say there are plants 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.290
 that should not be given away 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.360
 in which here comes a kilito those ready 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.799
 and to be able to give it away but I do not know what 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.490
 it was what happened I gave away the plant 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.630
 thank you before I gave him 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:41.840
 I pulled out a leaf and my brother came 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:45.069
 brother who also started 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.080
 a bit and the shoulders in this flower pot 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.810
 and then later when I told him the piece 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.360
 of starting a little boy to my friend because I 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:01.090
 Kills the main mat it seems to me that 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:04.420
 the old ones when they say something is because of something 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.930
 for redundancy and here's the same 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.930
 plant 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.980
 this plant I think it's pretty much 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.450
 the same as it is 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.540
 I believe that I myself was the one who 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.540
 injuries 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.930
 I 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.290
 this my country I did in the bush of 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.290
 money but it is because this was 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:38.890
 a badness that without us 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.890
 a friend and there is the brand 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.790
 I know that she knows the name but I do not know 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.110
 and this fork that is back here 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.090
 there is planted there to see if it occurs 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.940
 this life 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.230
 panorama that gave him on Wednesdays 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.120
 Spain 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.099
 the magazine that is behind looks like 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.650
 has a machine a flower for I know that 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.310
 maybe it's not right this is fine 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.310
 is 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.120
 despair because I despair a little 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.930
 know what is web 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.930
 then I already have there 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.660
 you saw the hairpin port only 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.970
 It cost 20 euros it was not very good 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.130
 because we do not have space here for nothing 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.320
 that's the only part I have where I 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.020
 gives clarity and all the forks 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.220
 I had previously died 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.150
 Well, this thing that is here is a 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.470
 invention of mine 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.560
 how will they see this is 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:43.330
 a container of the 21 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.150
 on the chocolate side 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.039
 but I do not vote anything that you never know 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.180
 when are you going to need the things of the 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.800
 moment 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.800
 and I put it there for him 

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:58.420
 but because it's transparent 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.670
 and here below is an American one 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.400
 American lady caring for the garden 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.830
 He told me that orchids were given better 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.320
 the transparent containers so that 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.320
 be quite clear to the root 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.930
 sorry 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.580
 this is the part of orchids here 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:28.249
 I care very much for the other part 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.259
 outside you can see the balcony 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.259
 and here I have next to the curtain 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:47.210
 and it is already taking out that you are 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.210
 looking to get them out 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.670
 I do not know if it will be an evil of mine what I did 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:05.820
 but this plant was 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:09.009
 for the years of the years 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.099
 at my ex-husband's house 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:15.930
 and one day I got there to visit and I was 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.930
 the plant almost dead 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.150
 I liked it because that plant had 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.150
 bought already when we were married 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.990
 and I took it in a cart of those that 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.590
 people use for the converse that 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:37.960
 I was wearing it on a cord and why 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:42.550
 and there I put the plant is inside this one 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:45.390
 of state is white with this plant 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.230
 that someone promised inside the cart 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.009
 in my house now because I knew that I 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.199
 not the city 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.880
 nor did he himself see any side then 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:56.600
 well then 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.600
 I will be plant 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.759
 how do I steal them because it's very nice 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:08.129
 Well, there are my plants there 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.529

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:13.720

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:15.820
 and well, greetings to all 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.070
 Now I have to take my water 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:21.480
 plants to go in the prepared bucket 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.640

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:38.909
