00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.169
 without advancing again 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.979

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.979
 let's put on properties 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.229
 the window 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:43.339
 by default and in this way 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.779
 but I want to specify the interests that people are going to 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.829
 they will have inside the 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.449
 also depend 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.619

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.029
 on here 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.590
 my interests 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.479
 teams 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.180
 let's come 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.180
 no video and zero hour sanitation 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.069
 of 02 5 4 are putting here 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.799
 people 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.439
 the fabric of the parts that will connect in the region says final 120 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.159
 up to 130 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.849
 this will give feedback will be from 10 people comments can connect to the 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:24.999
 my 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:28.049
 My computer remembering that this 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.129
 this disinterest in the network units 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.579
 so you need to see the theft 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.579
 with the pedestrian range of running those values 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.429
 let's choose who 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:45.429
 and we will stay in allowing access 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.999
 bush minutes there 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.909
 your computer is already able to receive competitions 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:57.229
 free input 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:59.609
 it is 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.099
 in the near future and to learn from what you eat needs 6 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.429
