they come in as just a more as part of

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
being a part of the story as you do and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.310 
being a part of the story as you do and
the<00:00:47.130> game<00:00:47.280> just<00:00:47.490> adjusts<00:00:48.000> automatically<00:00:48.540> so

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the game just adjusts automatically so

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.660 
the game just adjusts automatically so
that's<00:00:49.620> much<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:49.950> built<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> game<00:00:50.490> from

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that's much as we built the game from

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.220 
that's much as we built the game from
the<00:00:50.730> ground<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.810> cooperative

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the ground up to be a cooperative

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.550 
the ground up to be a cooperative
experience<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.390> us<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.870> Diablo<00:00:55.290> as<00:00:55.440> an

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
experience so for us we see Diablo as an

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.960 
experience so for us we see Diablo as an
online<00:00:55.890> game<00:00:56.130> we<00:00:56.400> think<00:00:56.579> that's<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> best

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
online game we think that's the best

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.810 
online game we think that's the best
experience<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.110> give<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.950> players<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
experience we can give to players and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.580 
experience we can give to players and
that's<00:01:00.540> what<00:01:00.690> we're<00:01:00.810> focused<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> what's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
that's what we're focused on is what's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410 
that's what we're focused on is what's
the<00:01:01.740> best<00:01:01.950> possible<00:01:02.220> experience<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.210> give

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the best possible experience we can give

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.260 
the best possible experience we can give
you<00:01:04.049> know<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.739> look<00:01:05.369> at<00:01:05.460> any<00:01:05.610> game<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.060> say

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you know we can look at any game and say

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.870 
you know we can look at any game and say
you<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.829> look<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.040> Starcraft<00:01:08.490> 2<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
you know you can look at Starcraft 2 and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.929 
you know you can look at Starcraft 2 and
say<00:01:09.060> well<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> don't<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:10.049> RTS<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.680> how<00:01:11.009> I<00:01:11.640> would

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
say well I don't like RTS is how I would

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.210 
say well I don't like RTS is how I would
Starcraft<00:01:12.420> 2<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:12.750> me<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.439> answer<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.710> it's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
Starcraft 2 for me the answer is it's

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.680 
Starcraft 2 for me the answer is it's
probably<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.759> you

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
probably not for you

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.540 
probably not for you
but<00:01:16.170> because<00:01:16.590> then<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> choices<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.460> we

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
but because then the choices that we

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.040 
but because then the choices that we
made<00:01:17.760> in<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> type<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.180> game<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.690> we've

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
made in the type of game that we we've

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.170 
made in the type of game that we we've
chosen<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.530> mag<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.130> Diablo<00:01:20.610> we're

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
chosen to mag so with Diablo we're

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.850 
chosen to mag so with Diablo we're
really<00:01:21.360> focused<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.020> online<00:01:22.170> experience

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
really focused on that online experience

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.230 
really focused on that online experience
we<00:01:23.010> think<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> best<00:01:23.729> way<00:01:23.940> for<00:01:24.150> players

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
we think it's the best way for players

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.630 
we think it's the best way for players
to<00:01:24.479> play<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.979> realize<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.490> their

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
to play and we realize that their

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.420 
to play and we realize that their
sacrifices<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.350> have<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.620> that<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.340> have

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
sacrifices that have to be that we have

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.219 
sacrifices that have to be that we have
to<00:01:29.520> take<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.299> able<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.600> focus<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.170> that

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
to take on to be able to focus on that

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.180 
to take on to be able to focus on that
experience<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:32.010> a<00:01:32.270> designer<00:01:33.830> my<00:01:34.830> favorite

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
experience as a designer my favorite

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.360 
experience as a designer my favorite
class<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> monk<00:01:36.110> because<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.530> think<00:01:38.070> just

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
class is the monk because I think just

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.500 
class is the monk because I think just
because<00:01:38.520> he's<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.000> worked<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.330> most

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
because he's the one I worked the most

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.870 
because he's the one I worked the most
of<00:01:39.720> unlike<00:01:40.049> most<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.190> classes<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.760> had

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
of unlike most of the classes we had

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.670 
of unlike most of the classes we had
some<00:01:42.119> kind<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.420> shared<00:01:42.659> duty<00:01:43.049> owned<00:01:43.260> at<00:01:43.470> some

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
some kind of shared duty owned at some

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.410 
some kind of shared duty owned at some
point<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> monk<00:01:44.490> was<00:01:44.580> pretty<00:01:45.090> much<00:01:45.240> all

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
point but the monk was pretty much all

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.160 
point but the monk was pretty much all
all<00:01:45.750> me<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> I've<00:01:47.610> had<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.810> say<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
all me so I've had and that to say that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.960 
all me so I've had and that to say that
I<00:01:49.200> mean<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> initial<00:01:50.130> concept<00:01:50.580> being<00:01:50.760> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
I mean in the initial concept being and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.870 
I mean in the initial concept being and
the<00:01:51.060> conceding<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.720> skills<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.470> design

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
the conceding of skills and the design

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.029 
the conceding of skills and the design
of<00:01:53.329> that<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:54.079> know<00:01:54.170> once<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.439> gets<00:01:54.590> past<00:01:54.860> that

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
of that you know once it gets past that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.649 
of that you know once it gets past that
into<00:01:55.310> tuning<00:01:55.789> and<00:01:56.000> things<00:01:56.210> like<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:56.360> there's

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
into tuning and things like that there's

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.630 
into tuning and things like that there's
a<00:01:56.719> lot<00:01:56.869> more<00:01:56.899> people<00:01:57.380> involved<00:01:57.649> but<00:01:57.979> that<00:01:58.219> kind

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
a lot more people involved but that kind

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.029 
a lot more people involved but that kind
of<00:01:58.729> core<00:01:58.939> concept<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.659> class<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.380> you

of core concept of the class and and you

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.580 
of core concept of the class and and you
know<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.780> instrumental<00:02:02.780> decisions<00:02:03.259> on<00:02:03.409> how<00:02:03.560> I

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590

you know railed against it as being the

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.390 
you know railed against it as being the
not<00:02:44.269> innovative<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:44.870> ugly<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.349> remember<00:02:46.280> that

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
not innovative and ugly I remember that

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.839 
not innovative and ugly I remember that
was<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.579> really<00:02:47.150> really<00:02:47.450> world<00:02:48.230> Warcraft

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
was a really really world Warcraft

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.220 
was a really really world Warcraft
almost<00:02:49.849> every<00:02:50.060> one<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.299> our<00:02:50.420> games<00:02:50.630> people<00:02:50.989> say

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
almost every one of our games people say

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.009 
almost every one of our games people say
they're<00:02:52.069> not<00:02:52.160> innovative<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:52.849> I<00:02:53.510> feel<00:02:53.900> the

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
they're not innovative and I feel the

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.479 
they're not innovative and I feel the
reason<00:02:54.170> why<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.530> because<00:02:54.769> they're<00:02:55.220> looking

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
reason why is because they're looking

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.030 
reason why is because they're looking
for<00:02:55.670> innovation<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.239> be<00:02:56.420> in<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.739> big

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
for innovation to be in a in a big

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.759 
for innovation to be in a in a big
uppercut<00:02:59.030> punch<00:02:59.060> super<00:02:59.870> feature<00:03:00.079> you're

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
uppercut punch super feature you're

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.380 
uppercut punch super feature you're
looking<00:03:01.069> for<00:03:01.250> something

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
looking for something

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.770 
looking for something
one<00:03:03.019> thing<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.769> says<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.549> them<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:05.359> is<00:03:05.569> the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
one thing that says to them this is the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.140 
one thing that says to them this is the
next<00:03:06.230> greatest<00:03:06.500> thing<00:03:06.709> ever

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
next greatest thing ever

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.509 
next greatest thing ever
and<00:03:08.329> you<00:03:09.019> know<00:03:09.109> we<00:03:09.799> just<00:03:09.950> don't<00:03:10.130> think<00:03:10.220> that

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
and you know we just don't think that

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.280 
and you know we just don't think that
that's<00:03:10.639> the<00:03:11.060> way<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.209> make<00:03:11.420> games<00:03:11.690> like<00:03:11.989> we

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
that's the way to make games like we

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.789 
that's the way to make games like we
think<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.680> innovation<00:03:13.370> comes<00:03:14.090> in<00:03:14.799> perfect

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
think that innovation comes in perfect

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.890 
think that innovation comes in perfect
execution<00:03:16.130> like<00:03:16.819> we<00:03:17.329> have<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.480> saying<00:03:17.690> around

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
execution like we have a saying around

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.900 
execution like we have a saying around
the<00:03:18.139> office<00:03:18.440> would<00:03:18.889> you<00:03:19.040> if<00:03:19.250> if<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:19.760> had<00:03:19.880> a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
the office would you if if you had a

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.940 
the office would you if if you had a
choice<00:03:20.150> between<00:03:20.420> playing<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:21.200> perfectly

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
choice between playing a perfectly

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.250 
choice between playing a perfectly
innovated<00:03:22.579> game<00:03:22.760> or<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.060> perfectly<00:03:23.630> executed

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
innovated game or a perfectly executed

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.349 
innovated game or a perfectly executed
game<00:03:24.440> which<00:03:24.680> would<00:03:24.829> you<00:03:24.980> do<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:26.120> answer

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
game which would you do and the answer

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:27.970 
game which would you do and the answer
for<00:03:26.480> us<00:03:26.569> is<00:03:26.720> always<00:03:26.989> perfectly<00:03:27.380> executed

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
for us is always perfectly executed

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.680 
for us is always perfectly executed
because<00:03:28.340> an<00:03:28.459> innovative<00:03:29.000> game<00:03:29.180> that's<00:03:29.420> poorly

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
because an innovative game that's poorly

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.069 
because an innovative game that's poorly
executed<00:03:30.019> is<00:03:30.410> not<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.620> good<00:03:30.859> game<00:03:31.040> but<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:32.209> game

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
executed is not a good game but a game

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.009 
executed is not a good game but a game
that's<00:03:33.940> executed<00:03:34.940> very<00:03:35.209> very<00:03:35.480> well<00:03:35.720> it's

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
that's executed very very well it's

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.890 
that's executed very very well it's
always<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.410> great<00:03:36.620> game<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:38.060> for<00:03:38.569> us

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
always a great game so for us

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.050 
always a great game so for us
things<00:03:39.380> like<00:03:39.620> how<00:03:39.920> we<00:03:40.160> approach<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.700> combat

then<00:03:56.840> we<00:03:56.870> feel<00:03:57.200> that's<00:03:57.470> incredibly

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
then we feel that's incredibly

then we feel that's incredibly
innovative<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.700> way<00:03:58.970> harder<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.480> do<00:03:59.630> than

really have a problem with the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.100 
really have a problem with the
torchlight<00:04:10.850> comparisons<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.630> mean<00:04:11.810> obviously

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
torchlight comparisons I mean obviously

torchlight comparisons I mean obviously
the<00:04:12.470> games<00:04:12.650> are<00:04:12.800> similar<00:04:12.980> there<00:04:13.340> but<00:04:13.720> Diablo

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
the games are similar there but Diablo

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.430 
the games are similar there but Diablo
is<00:04:14.750> their<00:04:15.050> parent<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:16.250> just<00:04:16.790> don't<00:04:17.000> feel<00:04:17.270> that

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
is their parent I just don't feel that

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.229 
is their parent I just don't feel that
the<00:04:18.440> market<00:04:18.890> needs<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.400> be<00:04:19.580> reduced<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:20.060> just

torchlight 2 is better and you know

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.930 
torchlight 2 is better and you know
people<00:04:30.740> do<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:30.980> lot<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.340> justify<00:04:31.730> their

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
people do a lot to justify their

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.970 
people do a lot to justify their
purchases<00:04:32.420> and<00:04:32.660> then<00:04:32.780> more<00:04:33.320> power<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.590> them<00:04:33.830> if

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
purchases and then more power to them if

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.410 
purchases and then more power to them if
they<00:04:34.520> should<00:04:34.580> love<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.000> games<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.360> they

love I personally will play both and I

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.210 
love I personally will play both and I
think<00:04:38.660> most<00:04:39.050> players<00:04:39.230> who<00:04:39.500> love<00:04:39.680> this<00:04:39.860> genre

think most players who love this genre

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.430 
think most players who love this genre
will<00:04:40.400> -<00:04:40.580> I<00:04:40.610> think<00:04:41.090> as<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.330> genre<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.990> action<00:04:42.320> RPG

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
will - I think as a genre the action RPG

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.000 
will - I think as a genre the action RPG
has<00:04:43.280> been<00:04:43.550> vastly<00:04:44.110> under<00:04:45.110> populated<00:04:45.800> for

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
has been vastly under populated for

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.370 
has been vastly under populated for
years<00:04:46.370> so<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.060> finally<00:04:47.390> see<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.780> good<00:04:48.080> number<00:04:48.260> of

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
years so to finally see a good number of

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.110 
years so to finally see a good number of
titles<00:04:48.680> coming<00:04:49.130> out<00:04:49.280> four<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.790> are<00:04:49.850> high

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
titles coming out four that are high

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.080 
titles coming out four that are high
quality<00:04:50.200> I<00:04:51.200> say<00:04:51.830> hallelujah<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.490> think<00:04:52.790> that<00:04:52.940> to

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
quality I say hallelujah I think that to

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.590 
quality I say hallelujah I think that to
stand<00:04:53.960> next<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.950> each<00:04:55.040> other<00:04:55.160> quite<00:04:55.520> well<00:04:55.600> you

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
stand next to each other quite well you

stand next to each other quite well you
know<00:04:56.690> torchlight<00:04:57.110> is<00:04:57.290> is<00:04:57.520> definitely<00:04:58.520> a

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
know torchlight is is definitely a

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.940 
know torchlight is is definitely a
little<00:04:59.750> bit<00:04:59.840> more<00:05:00.050> on<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.290> cartoony<00:05:00.650> side

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
little bit more on the cartoony side

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.860 
little bit more on the cartoony side
there<00:05:01.460> they<00:05:01.850> made<00:05:02.300> some<00:05:02.540> very<00:05:02.690> different

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
there they made some very different

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.320 
there they made some very different
choices<00:05:03.370> from<00:05:04.370> what<00:05:04.580> we've<00:05:04.700> made<00:05:04.970> I<00:05:05.210> don't

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
choices from what we've made I don't

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.790 
choices from what we've made I don't
think<00:05:05.690> they're<00:05:05.810> invalid<00:05:06.260> choices<00:05:06.590> at<00:05:06.710> all

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
think they're invalid choices at all

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.950 
think they're invalid choices at all
they're<00:05:07.130> just<00:05:07.160> different<00:05:07.640> and<00:05:08.420> I<00:05:08.540> think<00:05:08.600> some

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
they're just different and I think some

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.120 
they're just different and I think some
players<00:05:09.170> will<00:05:09.320> really<00:05:09.590> appreciate<00:05:09.980> the

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
players will really appreciate the

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.250 
players will really appreciate the
choices<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.640> they've<00:05:10.820> made<00:05:10.960> in<00:05:11.960> some<00:05:12.140> ways

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
choices that they've made in some ways

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.720 
choices that they've made in some ways
it's<00:05:12.410> kind<00:05:12.560> of<00:05:12.590> nice<00:05:12.710> it's<00:05:12.980> like<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:13.370> can<00:05:13.550> say

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
it's kind of nice it's like you can say

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.390 
it's kind of nice it's like you can say
like<00:05:13.940> if<00:05:14.270> this<00:05:14.870> is<00:05:15.020> what<00:05:15.170> you<00:05:15.290> wanted<00:05:15.620> then

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
like if this is what you wanted then

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.920 
like if this is what you wanted then
you've<00:05:16.640> got<00:05:16.820> you've<00:05:17.150> got<00:05:17.330> this<00:05:17.480> game<00:05:17.720> if

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
you've got you've got this game if

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.450 
you've got you've got this game if
Diablo<00:05:18.530> 3<00:05:18.740> is<00:05:18.830> what<00:05:18.950> you<00:05:19.040> want<00:05:19.220> you've<00:05:19.430> got
