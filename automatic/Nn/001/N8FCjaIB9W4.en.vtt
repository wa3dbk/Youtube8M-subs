so let's have a quick look at the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.899 
so let's have a quick look at the
different<00:01:48.689> sections<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.729> main

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
different sections this is the the main

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.410 
different sections this is the the main
two<00:01:51.600> deck<00:01:51.840> section<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.500> two<00:01:52.679> decks<00:01:53.420> which

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
two deck section you get two decks which

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.590 
two deck section you get two decks which
is<00:01:54.920> okay<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.189> some<00:01:56.819> people<00:01:57.060> would<00:01:57.179> like<00:01:57.299> for

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
is okay it's some people would like for

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.889 
is okay it's some people would like for
I<00:01:57.840> don't<00:01:58.409> suspect<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.490> that<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> realistic

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I don't suspect that that is a realistic

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.779 
I don't suspect that that is a realistic
prospect<00:02:01.380> considering<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> processing

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
prospect considering the processing

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.730 
prospect considering the processing
power<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.719> required<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.439> run<00:02:04.619> these

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
power that is required just to run these
