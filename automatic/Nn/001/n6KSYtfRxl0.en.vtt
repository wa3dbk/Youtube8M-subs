here<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:33.389> they<00:03:33.630> near<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.810> f1<00:03:34.139> 2013<00:03:34.730> was<00:03:35.730> gonna

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
here so they near the f1 2013 was gonna

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.089 
here so they near the f1 2013 was gonna
have<00:03:36.420> less<00:03:36.660> cells<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.200> they<00:03:37.230> decided<00:03:37.590> hey<00:03:37.829> why

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
have less cells so they decided hey why

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.400 
have less cells so they decided hey why
not<00:03:38.730> have<00:03:39.000> classic<00:03:39.389> edition<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:40.079> we<00:03:40.200> can<00:03:40.290> make

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
not have classic edition so we can make

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.839 
not have classic edition so we can make
more<00:03:40.560> money<00:03:40.709> out<00:03:40.829> of<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.400> we<00:03:41.519> don't<00:03:41.669> lose

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
more money out of this so we don't lose

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.449 
more money out of this so we don't lose
any<00:03:42.299> money<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.530> pattern<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:44.370> I'm

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
any money and this pattern that I'm

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.789 
any money and this pattern that I'm
talking<00:03:44.579> about<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:45.000> shown<00:03:45.269> on<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.569> Xbox<00:03:46.530> graph

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
talking about is shown on the Xbox graph

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.470 
talking about is shown on the Xbox graph
and<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.069> ps3<00:03:47.340> graph<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.940> I've<00:03:48.060> made<00:03:48.269> here

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
and the ps3 graph that I've made here

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.110 
and the ps3 graph that I've made here
you<00:03:49.049> can<00:03:49.200> see<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:50.099> pattern<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:50.669> very

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
you can see that the pattern is very

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.509 
you can see that the pattern is very
similar<00:03:51.389> it's<00:03:51.840> almost<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.260> same<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:53.340> this

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
similar it's almost the same so this

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.729 
similar it's almost the same so this
proves<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:53.880> on<00:03:54.030> both<00:03:54.180> consoles<00:03:54.720> after<00:03:55.440> f1

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
proves that on both consoles after f1

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.300 
proves that on both consoles after f1
2010<00:03:56.209> every<00:03:57.209> new<00:03:57.359> f1<00:03:57.840> game<00:03:58.049> sold<00:03:58.650> less<00:03:58.950> than

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
2010 every new f1 game sold less than

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.710 
2010 every new f1 game sold less than
the<00:03:59.459> year<00:03:59.669> before<00:03:59.790> now<00:04:00.419> there<00:04:00.599> are<00:04:00.690> three

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
the year before now there are three

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.530 
the year before now there are three
major<00:04:01.139> reasons<00:04:01.349> why<00:04:02.069> this<00:04:02.130> has<00:04:02.430> happened

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
major reasons why this has happened

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.870 
major reasons why this has happened
first<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.690> all<00:04:03.810> people<00:04:04.650> do<00:04:04.919> get<00:04:05.099> bored<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:05.609> the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
first of all people do get bored of the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.940 
first of all people do get bored of the
game<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.299> basically<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.989> same<00:04:07.019> game<00:04:07.530> every

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
game is basically the same game every

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.280 
game is basically the same game every
single<00:04:08.370> year<00:04:08.609> and<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:09.630> rose<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.049> cars

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
single year and the rose and the cars

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.050 
single year and the rose and the cars
are<00:04:10.590> pretty<00:04:10.799> much<00:04:10.980> stayed<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.760> same

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
are pretty much stayed the same

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.420 
are pretty much stayed the same
throughout<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.989> years<00:04:13.260> another<00:04:14.160> major

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
throughout the years another major

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.150 
throughout the years another major
reason<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.090> codemasters<00:04:16.019> never<00:04:16.650> seem<00:04:16.919> to

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
reason is that codemasters never seem to

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.830 
reason is that codemasters never seem to
fix<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.669> issues<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.299> hit<00:04:18.389> that<00:04:18.450> are<00:04:18.720> in

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
fix the issues that I hit that are in

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.140 
fix the issues that I hit that are in
the<00:04:18.930> game<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.380> people<00:04:20.070> end<00:04:20.250> up<00:04:20.400> giving<00:04:20.640> up<00:04:20.940> and

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
the game so people end up giving up and

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150 
the game so people end up giving up and
not<00:04:22.109> buying<00:04:22.440> an<00:04:22.590> f1<00:04:22.860> game

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
not buying an f1 game

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.430 
not buying an f1 game
ever<00:04:23.280> again<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.690> third<00:04:24.900> reason<00:04:25.140> well

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
ever again and the third reason well

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.080 
ever again and the third reason well
actually<00:04:25.620> this<00:04:25.920> reason<00:04:26.310> actually<00:04:26.460> ties<00:04:26.850> into

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
actually this reason actually ties into

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.350 
actually this reason actually ties into
the<00:04:27.210> first<00:04:27.380> point<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.590> made<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.040> that<00:04:29.970> is

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
the first point that I made and that is

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.810 
the first point that I made and that is
the<00:04:30.600> fact<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:30.980> most<00:04:31.980> people<00:04:32.430> are<00:04:32.640> probably

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
the fact that most people are probably

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.210 
the fact that most people are probably
going<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.210> wait<00:04:33.390> until<00:04:33.710> when<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.920> game<00:04:35.070> is

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
going to wait until when the game is

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.190 
going to wait until when the game is
going<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.430> come<00:04:35.550> out<00:04:35.670> on<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.940> next<00:04:36.240> gen<00:04:36.510> since

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
going to come out on the next gen since

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.140 
going to come out on the next gen since
the<00:04:37.320> game<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.530> pretty<00:04:37.830> much<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.160> same<00:04:38.550> every

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
the game is pretty much the same every

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.300 
the game is pretty much the same every
single<00:04:39.480> year<00:04:39.660> most<00:04:40.170> people<00:04:40.590> realize<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.250> you

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
single year most people realize that you

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.010 
single year most people realize that you
know<00:04:41.340> F<00:04:41.580> 1<00:04:41.700> 2015<00:04:42.060> was<00:04:42.450> going<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.630> be<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.810> same

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
know F 1 2015 was going to be the same

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.100 
know F 1 2015 was going to be the same
so<00:04:43.860> therefore<00:04:44.370> hey<00:04:44.700> why<00:04:44.940> not<00:04:45.180> wait<00:04:45.420> until<00:04:45.660> f<00:04:45.960> 1

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
so therefore hey why not wait until f 1

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.320 
so therefore hey why not wait until f 1
2014<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:47.010> it's<00:04:47.610> true<00:04:47.730> you<00:04:47.850> know<00:04:47.970> because<00:04:48.210> you

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
2014 and it's true you know because you

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.850 
2014 and it's true you know because you
might<00:04:48.480> as<00:04:48.630> well<00:04:48.750> put<00:04:48.960> 40<00:04:49.320> pound<00:04:49.530> down<00:04:49.680> the

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
might as well put 40 pound down the

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.560 
might as well put 40 pound down the
drain<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.280> know<00:04:50.340> if<00:04:50.460> you're<00:04:50.610> not<00:04:50.700> how<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.300> of

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
drain you know if you're not how to of

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.670 
drain you know if you're not how to of
the<00:04:51.690> game<00:04:51.870> if<00:04:52.020> you're<00:04:52.110> not<00:04:52.170> happy<00:04:52.350> with<00:04:52.470> the

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
the game if you're not happy with the

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.610 
the game if you're not happy with the
way<00:04:52.950> it<00:04:52.980> plays<00:04:53.340> why<00:04:54.090> wasting<00:04:54.480> money<00:04:54.630> on<00:04:54.720> it<00:04:54.930> and

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
way it plays why wasting money on it and

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.410 
way it plays why wasting money on it and
like<00:04:55.860> I<00:04:56.040> said<00:04:56.100> in<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.580> last<00:04:56.700> video<00:04:57.000> this<00:04:57.240> is

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
like I said in the last video this is

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.990 
like I said in the last video this is
why<00:04:57.600> it's<00:04:57.870> so<00:04:57.960> crucial<00:04:58.650> for<00:04:59.070> codemasters<00:04:59.850> to

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
why it's so crucial for codemasters to

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.340 
why it's so crucial for codemasters to
get<00:05:00.210> this<00:05:00.360> next<00:05:00.660> game<00:05:00.900> right<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:02.340> know

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
get this next game right and you know

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.570 
get this next game right and you know
codemasters<00:05:04.350> themselves<00:05:04.920> they<00:05:05.070> may<00:05:05.250> deny

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
codemasters themselves they may deny

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.790 
codemasters themselves they may deny
this<00:05:05.640> but<00:05:06.060> they<00:05:06.210> know<00:05:06.390> for<00:05:06.630> a<00:05:06.660> fact<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:07.230> the

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
this but they know for a fact that the

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.130 
this but they know for a fact that the
cells<00:05:08.100> have<00:05:08.490> dropped<00:05:08.970> every<00:05:09.570> single<00:05:09.900> year<00:05:09.990> you

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
cells have dropped every single year you

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.140 
cells have dropped every single year you
know<00:05:10.230> you<00:05:10.320> can<00:05:10.470> go<00:05:10.680> show<00:05:11.280> this<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.730> them<00:05:11.910> and

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
know you can go show this to them and

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.820 
know you can go show this to them and
they<00:05:12.360> don't<00:05:12.870> agree<00:05:13.140> with<00:05:13.200> you<00:05:13.380> because<00:05:13.560> they

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
they don't agree with you because they

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.350 
they don't agree with you because they
know<00:05:13.860> these<00:05:14.370> these<00:05:14.400> figures<00:05:15.120> are<00:05:15.210> real

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
know these these figures are real

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.060 
know these these figures are real
they're<00:05:15.630> not<00:05:15.660> they're<00:05:16.230> not<00:05:16.260> fake<00:05:16.530> or<00:05:16.770> anything

2014<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:22.230> do<00:05:22.350> just<00:05:22.800> as<00:05:23.010> good<00:05:23.100> as<00:05:23.400> f1<00:05:23.970> 2011<00:05:24.810> I

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
2014 to do just as good as f1 2011 I

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.720 
2014 to do just as good as f1 2011 I
don't<00:05:25.980> figure<00:05:26.100> we'll<00:05:26.310> do<00:05:26.400> better<00:05:26.550> than<00:05:26.670> that

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
don't figure we'll do better than that

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.120 
don't figure we'll do better than that
for<00:05:26.880> 2010<00:05:27.330> but<00:05:27.870> will<00:05:27.960> do<00:05:28.080> as<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.350> think<00:05:28.860> just

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
for 2010 but will do as I think just

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.550 
for 2010 but will do as I think just
about<00:05:29.280> as<00:05:29.550> good<00:05:29.730> as<00:05:29.880> FN<00:05:30.420> 2011<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.170> I<00:05:31.260> tell<00:05:31.440> you

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
about as good as FN 2011 and I tell you

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.710 
about as good as FN 2011 and I tell you
why<00:05:31.710> it's<00:05:32.430> simply<00:05:32.670> because<00:05:32.790> of<00:05:33.090> these<00:05:33.480> new

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
why it's simply because of these new

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.750 
why it's simply because of these new
rules<00:05:33.930> these<00:05:34.170> new<00:05:34.350> changes<00:05:34.620> and<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.520> fact

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
rules these new changes and the fact

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.850 
rules these new changes and the fact
that<00:05:35.880> they<00:05:36.690> will<00:05:36.960> probably<00:05:37.350> make<00:05:37.500> this<00:05:37.560> game

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
that they will probably make this game

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.010 
that they will probably make this game
for<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.160> next<00:05:38.340> gen<00:05:38.490> however<00:05:38.820> they<00:05:39.630> will<00:05:39.810> make

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
for the next gen however they will make

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.240 
for the next gen however they will make
this<00:05:40.140> game<00:05:40.350> for<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.650> next<00:05:40.860> gen<00:05:41.040> but<00:05:41.220> I

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
this game for the next gen but I

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.900 
this game for the next gen but I
guarantee<00:05:41.490> you<00:05:41.940> will<00:05:42.120> be<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.450> last<00:05:43.380> gen<00:05:43.910> ported

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
guarantee you will be a last gen ported

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.340 
guarantee you will be a last gen ported
version<00:05:45.450> you<00:05:45.540> know<00:05:45.660> this<00:05:45.870> they<00:05:46.050> will<00:05:46.169> make

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
version you know this they will make

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.110 
version you know this they will make
this<00:05:46.470> game<00:05:46.650> for<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:46.890> last<00:05:46.919> gen<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:47.550> put<00:05:47.970> it

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
this game for the last gen and put it

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.870 
this game for the last gen and put it
over<00:05:48.210> to<00:05:48.930> the<00:05:49.200> next<00:05:49.560> gen<00:05:49.830> consoles<00:05:50.250> because

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
over to the next gen consoles because

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.520 
over to the next gen consoles because
why<00:05:51.090> not<00:05:51.120> I<00:05:51.360> mean<00:05:51.570> everyone<00:05:51.900> is<00:05:51.930> on<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.350> last

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
why not I mean everyone is on the last

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.680 
why not I mean everyone is on the last
gen<00:05:52.830> still<00:05:53.130> some<00:05:53.669> people<00:05:53.940> still<00:05:54.090> can't<00:05:54.330> afford

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
gen still some people still can't afford

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.360 
gen still some people still can't afford
to<00:05:54.780> go<00:05:54.870> into<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.169> next<00:05:55.260> gen<00:05:55.530> so<00:05:56.040> that's

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
to go into the next gen so that's

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.470 
to go into the next gen so that's
probably<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.760> reason<00:05:56.790> why<00:05:57.150> they're<00:05:57.300> going<00:05:57.419> to

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
probably the reason why they're going to

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.690 
probably the reason why they're going to
do<00:05:57.600> that<00:05:57.750> so<00:05:58.290> that<00:05:58.440> means<00:05:58.680> that<00:05:58.770> you<00:05:59.430> know<00:05:59.550> the

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
do that so that means that you know the

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.700 
do that so that means that you know the
game<00:05:59.880> isn't<00:06:00.240> going<00:06:00.540> to<00:06:00.600> be<00:06:00.690> as<00:06:00.900> amazing<00:06:01.290> as<00:06:01.680> it

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
game isn't going to be as amazing as it

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.220 
game isn't going to be as amazing as it
should<00:06:02.010> be<00:06:02.160> i<00:06:02.190> expect<00:06:02.669> f<00:06:02.850> 1<00:06:02.970> 2015<00:06:03.330> to<00:06:03.990> be<00:06:04.110> the

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
should be i expect f 1 2015 to be the

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.780 
should be i expect f 1 2015 to be the
better<00:06:04.380> game<00:06:04.680> due<00:06:05.070> to<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.250> fact<00:06:05.460> that's<00:06:05.669> going

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
better game due to the fact that's going

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.360 
better game due to the fact that's going
to<00:06:05.850> be<00:06:05.940> too<00:06:06.120> hard<00:06:06.450> for<00:06:07.070> codemasters<00:06:08.070> to<00:06:08.220> make

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
to be too hard for codemasters to make

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.280 
to be too hard for codemasters to make
the<00:06:08.490> physics<00:06:08.910> and<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.150> sounds<00:06:09.660> exactly<00:06:10.050> like

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
the physics and the sounds exactly like

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.030 
the physics and the sounds exactly like
how<00:06:10.650> it<00:06:10.800> is<00:06:10.919> in<00:06:11.720> f1<00:06:12.720> 2014<00:06:13.320> in<00:06:13.470> real<00:06:13.650> life<00:06:13.830> of

how it is in f1 2014 in real life of

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.110 
these new rules and the second attempt
with<00:06:16.860> these<00:06:16.980> new<00:06:17.160> rules<00:06:17.310> and<00:06:17.580> changes<00:06:17.940> are

with these new rules and changes are

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
with these new rules and changes are
going<00:06:18.270> to<00:06:18.360> obviously<00:06:18.480> going<00:06:18.750> to<00:06:18.810> be<00:06:18.900> much

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
going to obviously going to be much

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.020 
going to obviously going to be much
better<00:06:19.350> for<00:06:19.470> codemasters<00:06:20.160> they<00:06:20.610> should<00:06:20.820> have

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
better for codemasters they should have

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.060 
better for codemasters they should have
sorted<00:06:21.419> out<00:06:21.510> all<00:06:21.570> the<00:06:21.780> problems<00:06:22.050> from<00:06:22.110> f1<00:06:22.290> 2014

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
sorted out all the problems from f1 2014

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.580 
sorted out all the problems from f1 2014
and<00:06:23.370> also<00:06:24.120> will<00:06:24.360> be<00:06:24.390> on<00:06:24.540> the<00:06:24.780> next<00:06:24.990> gen<00:06:25.290> so<00:06:25.500> they

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
and also will be on the next gen so they

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.490 
and also will be on the next gen so they
get<00:06:25.710> to<00:06:25.770> add<00:06:26.100> a<00:06:26.130> lot<00:06:26.490> more<00:06:26.550> stuff<00:06:27.060> so<00:06:27.810> we<00:06:28.470> should

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
get to add a lot more stuff so we should

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.210 
get to add a lot more stuff so we should
see<00:06:28.919> the<00:06:29.100> absolute<00:06:29.880> perfect<00:06:30.270> game<00:06:30.870> in<00:06:31.050> f1<00:06:31.350> 2015

see the absolute perfect game in f1 2015
if<00:06:32.729> we<00:06:32.910> don't<00:06:33.150> then<00:06:33.570> it's<00:06:34.050> over<00:06:34.289> for

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
if we don't then it's over for

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.040 
if we don't then it's over for
codemasters<00:06:35.160> but

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
codemasters but

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.430 
codemasters but
f<00:06:36.379> on<00:06:36.530> 2014<00:06:37.159> is<00:06:37.340> definitely<00:06:37.840> it<00:06:38.840> should<00:06:39.169> be<00:06:39.199> the

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
f on 2014 is definitely it should be the

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.409 
f on 2014 is definitely it should be the
game<00:06:39.620> where<00:06:39.800> they<00:06:39.889> fix<00:06:40.129> the<00:06:40.280> issues<00:06:40.669> but<00:06:40.909> you

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
game where they fix the issues but you

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:43.210 
game where they fix the issues but you
know<00:06:41.539> we<00:06:41.990> won't<00:06:42.139> know<00:06:42.650> are<00:06:42.830> we<00:06:42.860> going<00:06:43.069> to<00:06:43.129> have

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
know we won't know are we going to have

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.770 
know we won't know are we going to have
to<00:06:43.340> see<00:06:43.550> I<00:06:43.759> personally<00:06:44.270> think<00:06:44.479> it's<00:06:44.629> going<00:06:44.720> to

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
to see I personally think it's going to

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.420 
to see I personally think it's going to
be<00:06:44.840> problems<00:06:45.349> here<00:06:45.650> and<00:06:45.740> there<00:06:45.800> but<00:06:45.949> I<00:06:46.159> think

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
be problems here and there but I think

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.129 
be problems here and there but I think
they're<00:06:46.520> going<00:06:46.639> to<00:06:46.729> bring<00:06:46.879> back<00:06:47.509> the<00:06:47.780> career

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
they're going to bring back the career

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.439 
they're going to bring back the career
mode<00:06:48.319> somehow<00:06:48.710> like<00:06:48.919> that<00:06:49.099> 2010<00:06:49.819> style<00:06:50.150> career

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
mode somehow like that 2010 style career
