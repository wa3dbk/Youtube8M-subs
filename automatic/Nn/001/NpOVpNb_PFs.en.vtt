00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.339
 Good evening, friends, went through the sore mouth, it's good, people are going to talk. 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.339
 here with the physiotherapist the fabled falcon efe 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.199
 important information 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.139
 for people suffering from cancer, for example, this person can have benefits 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:30.779
 Suffering it can be ameliorated with the help of physiotherapy which types 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.090
 of fabio cancer can be treated through northern physiotherapy 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.220
 all types of hunting can actually be accompanied by a physiotherapist 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.800
 and has some way the physiotherapy bring benefits to this patient 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.390
 mainly 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.530
 breast cancer the case of women and prostate cancer in the case of men 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.940
 what kind of follow-up done not all over the world from home 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.110
 the cd-rom loses the type of the cacém of the region that it affects 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.280
 ah some sequels can vary so for example the individual carrying a 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.750
 brain cancer 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.240
 he can have sequels is this 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.100
 ranging from loss of muscle strength 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.190
 but also the question of changing the balance 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.170
 and the patient 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.850
 also have memory impairment this is not in the area of ​​physiotherapy 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.630
 but also a lot of people a relationship 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.420
 why the universe of the physiotherapist's treatment accused courses that the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.970
 depends on an interaction with these patients. 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.610
 and such the exchange of the part 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.200
 to be concerned primarily with the issue of forcing 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.200
 maintenance of joint movement applications 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.260
 but to somehow improve this balance issue 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.049
 is an always-on 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.060
 the quality of life of the patient is one of the important things that the patient with 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.670
 cancer to depend 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.240
 of the type didi aggressiveness of the tumors suffered much of pain 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.330
 a generalized pain 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.010
 after another which is one of the professions - this is not the 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.290
 important in this regard to minimize 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.209
 age are these four months 4 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.400
 It is item 7 people work with greater intensity always aiming really a 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.869
 patient well-being 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.199
 You know the way 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.950
 the approach of the professional physiotherapist can be made 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.589
 to a cancer patient 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:26.390
 It is important to point out that I did not work. 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.649
 canopy sit with patient song 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:29.940
 Special' 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.510
 sine in the following sense he really needs an arc of an approach 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.510
 multidisciplinary study done by the oncologist 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:41.039
 by the physiotherapist by the social worker by the psychologist 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:45.239
 in short, all professionals must be involved in order to be able to understand 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.469
 that this patient is a patient 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:48.899
 what 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:49.739
 it is 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.700
 like the other rich as 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.780
 the following year, a patient who 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.959
 he has no problem beyond 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.129
 than an illness 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.239
 The point is that the case is still seen as a problem in the election comes to the 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.239
 over time 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.889
 palliative care means treating the patient 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:19.559
 not always aiming at the well-being and quality of life so that he lives with 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:20.480
 quality 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.280
 - these past few days the past few months and you never know for sure 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.529
 how long the patient will live but it is important that we always have 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:32.579
 life I made this question of the independence of patient autonomy 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.579
 Pass you have to feel 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.420
 even the carrier of the disease often cured 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.490
 then the approach than the therapist 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.490
 and always 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.320
 it is inconceivable to have a multidisciplinary team, but always aiming to 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.200
 patient's well-being becomes an ally and accompanying this patient is 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.290
 throughout this process is during the little treatment because a little 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.199
 a specific treatment in the case of chemotherapy and radiotherapy that I 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.460
 next question to those who do 15 thousand 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.840
 and radiotherapy exactly how physiotherapy works 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.929
 well as chemotherapy radiotherapy are treatments 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:13.929
 is somewhat aggressive in the cancer patient 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:20.059
 is the proof as this provoke in the also pain proof with burns 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:25.610
 and to physical therapy she has specific instruments treated silver and treats 

00:04:25.609 --> 00:04:26.960
 also the question 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.039
 give burn that proves that the scars then we make manuses 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.319
 no specific maneuvers on the skin 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.580
 of the individual aiming at restoring 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.770
 this function 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.790
 tomé and the patient because chemotherapy treatment 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.229
 other physical therapy 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.990
 snoring logic already exists eg some some place in salvador 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.090
 that is served by SUS by the public health system is the center 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.090
 of Palestinian rescuers 13 members 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.189
 it's bad you have the mind with a chemotherapy service too 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:05.319
 inserted in the teams so specific to treat patients with 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:10.360
 then back then 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.689
 is a 'keita center' and is very useful to the population 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:15.120
 then our meeting 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.840
 another fighter then fable hawk he who is physiotherapist then we already 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.789
 you know what you're fixing because you can help 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.229
 people who suffer from cancer back after studies of the translocator 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.870
 It's Bahia's talk with you, Emerson Joseph.
