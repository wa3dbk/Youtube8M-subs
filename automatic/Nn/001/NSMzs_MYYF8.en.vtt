00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.480 
that the glass body and the thin legs
are<00:02:18.480> quite<00:02:18.780> fragile<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.800> try<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.130> bend<00:02:20.340> them

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
are quite fragile so try and bend them

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.990 
are quite fragile so try and bend them
as<00:02:20.670> little<00:02:20.880> as<00:02:21.090> possible<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.430> tricky<00:02:23.670> part

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
as little as possible so the tricky part

does<00:05:55.040> need<00:05:55.310> to<00:05:55.340> be<00:05:55.490> super<00:05:55.940> tight<00:05:56.120> as<00:05:56.389> you<00:05:56.870> can

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
does need to be super tight as you can

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.990 
does need to be super tight as you can
easily<00:05:57.229> enter<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:58.010> heater<00:05:58.220> cartridge<00:05:58.460> this

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
easily enter the heater cartridge this

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.409 
easily enter the heater cartridge this
way<00:05:59.240> I<00:05:59.830> basically<00:06:00.830> tighten<00:06:01.729> it<00:06:01.850> until<00:06:02.270> the

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
way I basically tighten it until the

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.390 
way I basically tighten it until the
grub<00:06:02.630> screw<00:06:02.660> feels<00:06:03.199> like<00:06:03.470> it's<00:06:03.680> not<00:06:03.919> going<00:06:04.250> to

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
grub screw feels like it's not going to

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.260 
grub screw feels like it's not going to
fall<00:06:04.669> out<00:06:04.910> on<00:06:05.240> its<00:06:05.510> own<00:06:06.729> so<00:06:07.729> if<00:06:08.030> you're

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
fall out on its own so if you're

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.030 
fall out on its own so if you're
assembling<00:06:08.570> a<00:06:08.900> director<00:06:09.380> of<00:06:09.410> hot<00:06:09.650> end<00:06:09.860> the

assembling a director of hot end the

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.830 
assembling a director of hot end the
assembly<00:06:10.460> is<00:06:10.550> basically<00:06:10.940> done<00:06:11.270> at<00:06:11.389> this<00:06:11.540> point

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
assembly is basically done at this point

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.290 
assembly is basically done at this point
