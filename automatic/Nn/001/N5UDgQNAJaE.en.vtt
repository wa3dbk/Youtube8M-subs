00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.070
 Today I'm going to talk about one of the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.160
 most amazing constructions that 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.040
 they are going to create nowadays it's about 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.950
 a construction of the Russian firm of my 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.189
 I study a construction that is 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.909
 perfectly self-sustaining and that is 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:23.359
 able to withstand earthquakes 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:27.509
 floods is able to obtain 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:32.640
 food is able to obtain energy and 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:35.430
 without the need to have already say a 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.489
 nuclear power plant or something for the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.570
 style is a unique building that has been 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.390
 thought so if some kind happened 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.730
 of climate change in which it would be 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.129
 impossible to inhabit the surface 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.980
 terrestrial is a project without 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.289
 very ambitious doubt and for which it is going 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.100
 to need a lot of money and a lot 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.769
 investment at a technological level you can see 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.620
 the following pictures an idea of ​​what 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.720
 is going to be is a construction 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.390
 self-sustaining as I said has 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.510
 solar panels collection system 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.200
 heat and water use 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.990
 rain the design that at the moment is only 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.390
 conceptual as I said is the work of 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.360
 the Russian firm of rem and study 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.340
 and its creators say it can 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.330
 endure floods because their 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.270
 structure floats its structure of arches 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.880
 of wood and steel cables allows a 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.490
 redistribution of the weight that makes it 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.290
 immune to earthquakes something never seen 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.750
 previously its prefabricated frame 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.030
 facilitates its rapid construction 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.850
 is conceived as a name as a 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.900
 bioclimatic building in whose interior 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.270
 all kinds of plants can grow 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.080
 Stepped balconies serve as areas 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.340
 social and leisure 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.390
 the project was designed in conjunction with 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.260
 union here with the union of 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.110
 international architects within your 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.580
 architecture program for the relief of 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.040
 disasters no doubt a construction 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.780
 really effective that can help 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.350
 those countries that suffer more 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.920
 flood tsunamis earthquakes and others 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.070
 it is a very resistant building and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.050
 the most important thing does not pollute and not 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.180
 generates any type of expenditure of 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.459
 Maintenance is made with materials 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.910
 very strong and very durable and flexible 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.890
 a good idea that certainly if things 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.470
 continue like this if we continue to pollute the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.780
 planet and there are still this kind of 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.240
 natural disasters because maybe 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.240
 some country begins to develop
