and put them into bags but in this case
it's<00:00:40.440> fresh<00:00:40.739> from<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.460> garden<00:00:41.609> and<00:00:42.409> instead

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
it's fresh from the garden and instead

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.259 
it's fresh from the garden and instead
of<00:00:43.559> having<00:00:43.769> seed<00:00:44.159> as<00:00:44.339> I<00:00:44.460> mentioned<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.030> take

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
of having seed as I mentioned we take

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.379 
of having seed as I mentioned we take
cuttings<00:00:45.629> now<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> cuttings<00:00:47.129> our<00:00:47.339> nature<00:00:48.269> has

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:48.389 
cuttings now the cuttings our nature has

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:51.259 
cuttings now the cuttings our nature has
given<00:00:48.449> most<00:00:49.409> wonderful<00:00:50.219> opportunity<00:00:51.089> to<00:00:51.179> do

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
given most wonderful opportunity to do

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.750 
given most wonderful opportunity to do
this<00:00:51.389> because<00:00:51.749> the<00:00:52.620> little<00:00:52.920> branches<00:00:53.519> grow

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
this because the little branches grow

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.779 
this because the little branches grow
out<00:00:53.789> from<00:00:54.209> the<00:00:54.749> stem<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> cabbage<00:00:56.549> and

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
out from the stem of the cabbage and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.789 
out from the stem of the cabbage and
they're<00:00:57.329> nearly<00:00:57.569> little<00:00:58.139> cabbage<00:00:58.469> plants

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
they're nearly little cabbage plants

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.449 
they're nearly little cabbage plants
already<00:00:59.309> even<00:01:00.089> before<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.659> plant<00:01:00.929> them<00:01:01.459> so

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:02.459 
already even before we plant them so

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:04.539 
already even before we plant them so
what<00:01:02.729> we<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.239> take<00:01:03.479> a<00:01:03.539> few<00:01:03.839> of<00:01:03.899> these<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
what we do is take a few of these and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.720 
what we do is take a few of these and
then<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.060> become<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:07.350> basis<00:01:07.980> for<00:01:08.220> next

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
then they can become the basis for next

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.090 
then they can become the basis for next
year's<00:01:08.970> cabbage<00:01:09.420> plants<00:01:09.870> which<00:01:10.050> will<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.470> over

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
year's cabbage plants which will be over

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.860 
year's cabbage plants which will be over
on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> next<00:01:11.490> patch<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.300> as<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:12.690> said

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
on the next patch because as we said

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.240 
on the next patch because as we said
before<00:01:13.050> this<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:15.110> rotation<00:01:16.110> system<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.980> what

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
before this is a rotation system so what

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.370 
before this is a rotation system so what
was<00:01:17.430> cabbage<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.090> year<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.510> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.930> in

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
was cabbage this year is going to be in

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.800 
was cabbage this year is going to be in
there<00:01:19.860> next<00:01:20.190> year<00:01:20.370> so<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> plot<00:01:21.420> will<00:01:22.110> rotate

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
there next year so the plot will rotate

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:37.090 
there next year so the plot will rotate
there's<00:01:24.810> another<00:01:25.050> nice<00:01:25.550> plant<00:01:26.550> potential

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.780 
kind of heal there's already a natural
heal<00:02:33.850> on<00:02:34.060> this<00:02:34.269> which<00:02:35.170> probably<00:02:35.530> would<00:02:35.709> do<00:02:36.010> but

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
heal on this which probably would do but

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.050 
heal on this which probably would do but
just<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.480> give<00:02:37.630> more<00:02:38.430> expose<00:02:39.430> more<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.820> the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
just to give more expose more of the

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.250 
just to give more expose more of the
flesh<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.380> potato<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.390> cabbage<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.600> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
flesh of the potato the cabbage to the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.470 
flesh of the potato the cabbage to the
soil<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.310> just<00:02:45.819> going<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.239> take<00:02:46.450> it

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
soil and just going to take it

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.039 
soil and just going to take it
diagonally<00:02:47.319> so<00:02:48.069> we<00:02:48.220> have<00:02:48.430> there<00:02:48.840> what's<00:02:49.840> going

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
diagonally so we have there what's going

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.780 
diagonally so we have there what's going
to<00:02:50.140> become<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.620> root<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.780> cabbage

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
to become the root of the cabbage

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.479 
to become the root of the cabbage
another<00:02:54.790> idea<00:02:55.269> which<00:02:56.170> helps<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:57.040> take<00:02:57.250> off

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
another idea which helps is to take off

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.920 
another idea which helps is to take off
the<00:02:57.730> bottom<00:02:57.910> leaves<00:02:59.370> because<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.930> first

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
the bottom leaves because the first

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.920 
the bottom leaves because the first
thing<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.170> plant<00:03:02.590> us<00:03:02.799> to<00:03:02.950> do<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.570> form<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.720> root

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
thing that plant us to do is form a root

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.410 
thing that plant us to do is form a root
and<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.920> needs<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.190> put<00:03:06.370> its<00:03:06.519> energy<00:03:06.940> into

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
and it needs to put its energy into

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.740 
and it needs to put its energy into
forming<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.110> root<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.910> when<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.000> has<00:03:10.209> too

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
forming that root and when it has too

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.860 
forming that root and when it has too
many<00:03:10.930> leaves<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:12.370> actually<00:03:13.329> takes<00:03:13.660> energy

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
many leaves it actually takes energy

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.640 
many leaves it actually takes energy
away<00:03:14.140> from<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.739> root<00:03:14.920> forming<00:03:16.350> job<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.560> it

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
away from the root forming job that it

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.830 
away from the root forming job that it
has<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:17.890> do<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.459> give<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.420> couple<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.720> leaves

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
has to do so give it a couple of leaves

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.240 
has to do so give it a couple of leaves
to<00:03:19.989> be<00:03:20.140> going<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.500> with<00:03:20.709> sort<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.100> has<00:03:21.220> a

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
to be going on with sort of it has a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.100 
to be going on with sort of it has a
starch<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.940> can<00:03:22.120> turn<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.540> sunlight<00:03:22.930> into

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
starch and can turn the sunlight into

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.170 
starch and can turn the sunlight into
energy<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.799> then<00:03:24.730> we<00:03:25.180> just<00:03:26.160> gently<00:03:27.160> push<00:03:28.150> it

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
energy and then we just gently push it

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.819 
energy and then we just gently push it
in<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:29.739> its<00:03:29.980> position<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.989> go<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.049> put<00:03:32.230> two<00:03:32.500> in

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
in to its position I go to put two in

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.509 
in to its position I go to put two in
each<00:03:33.010> pot<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:34.120> again<00:03:34.570> this<00:03:34.720> is<00:03:34.900> just<00:03:35.140> really

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
each pot and again this is just really

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.060 
each pot and again this is just really
to<00:03:36.519> give<00:03:37.359> me<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.510> backup<00:03:38.019> so<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:38.650> one<00:03:38.829> doesn't

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
to give me a backup so if one doesn't

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.460 
to give me a backup so if one doesn't
work<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.609> have<00:03:39.970> at<00:03:40.209> least<00:03:40.390> some<00:03:40.690> something<00:03:41.200> to

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
work I have at least some something to

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.039 
work I have at least some something to
go<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.880> can<00:03:43.030> also<00:03:43.180> make<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.540> judgement

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
go on and I can also make a judgement

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.390 
go on and I can also make a judgement
call<00:03:45.090> which<00:03:46.090> is<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.329> healthier<00:03:46.720> plant<00:03:47.079> and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
call which is the healthier plant and

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.009 
call which is the healthier plant and
it's<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.640> healthier<00:03:49.060> plant<00:03:49.359> that<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:49.630> want<00:03:49.900> to

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
it's the healthier plant that I want to

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.430 
it's the healthier plant that I want to
continue<00:03:50.440> on<00:03:50.620> so<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.280> essentially<00:03:51.700> I'm

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
continue on so that essentially I'm

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.229 
continue on so that essentially I'm
using<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.709> lessons<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.130> Charles<00:03:54.519> Darwin<00:03:55.000> of

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
using the lessons of Charles Darwin of

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.810 
using the lessons of Charles Darwin of
natural<00:03:55.870> selection<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.340> healthiest

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
natural selection so the healthiest

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.680 
natural selection so the healthiest
plant<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.359> comes

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
plant that comes

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.350 
plant that comes
from<00:03:58.900> my<00:03:59.140> propagation<00:03:59.980> we'll<00:04:00.520> go<00:04:00.700> on<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:01.120> form

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
from my propagation we'll go on to form

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.510 
from my propagation we'll go on to form
hopefully<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:01.840> healthy<00:04:02.320> plant<00:04:02.590> next<00:04:02.890> year<00:04:03.040> and

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
hopefully a healthy plant next year and

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
hopefully a healthy plant next year and
I<00:04:03.880> just<00:04:04.420> keep<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.780> health<00:04:05.020> of<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.410> cabbage<00:04:06.540> as

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
I just keep the health of the cabbage as

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.310 
I just keep the health of the cabbage as
good<00:04:07.870> as<00:04:08.020> possible<00:04:08.820> from<00:04:09.820> year<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.210> year<00:04:10.320> well

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
good as possible from year to year well

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.770 
good as possible from year to year well
we<00:04:11.410> have<00:04:11.560> our<00:04:11.590> eight<00:04:11.950> cuttings<00:04:12.640> in<00:04:13.120> our<00:04:13.480> four

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
we have our eight cuttings in our four

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.140 
we have our eight cuttings in our four
parks<00:04:14.260> here<00:04:14.500> what<00:04:15.160> I've<00:04:15.280> got<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.490> do<00:04:15.670> is<00:04:15.850> bring

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
parks here what I've got to do is bring

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.199 
parks here what I've got to do is bring
them<00:04:16.330> to<00:04:16.630> a<00:04:16.660> place<00:04:16.930> where<00:04:17.260> they<00:04:17.440> can<00:04:17.680> hopefully

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
them to a place where they can hopefully

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.020 
them to a place where they can hopefully
settle<00:04:19.209> in<00:04:19.330> and<00:04:19.570> become<00:04:20.110> new<00:04:20.500> plants<00:04:21.040> and<00:04:21.250> it

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
settle in and become new plants and it

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.230 
settle in and become new plants and it
could<00:04:22.240> be<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.390> porch<00:04:22.840> or<00:04:23.290> somewhere<00:04:24.280> cool<00:04:24.520> out

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
could be a porch or somewhere cool out

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.810 
could be a porch or somewhere cool out
of<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.660> direct<00:04:26.050> weather<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:27.250> my<00:04:27.400> case<00:04:27.460> I

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
of the direct weather and in my case I

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.720 
of the direct weather and in my case I
have<00:04:28.000> a<00:04:28.030> small<00:04:28.960> greenhouse<00:04:29.460> which<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.580> more

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
have a small greenhouse which is more

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.870 
have a small greenhouse which is more
like<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.940> phone<00:04:31.210> box<00:04:31.450> really<00:04:32.010> but<00:04:33.010> it<00:04:33.250> does<00:04:33.730> the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
like a phone box really but it does the

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.170 
like a phone box really but it does the
job<00:04:34.090> nicely<00:04:36.270> follow<00:04:37.270> me<00:04:37.450> down<00:04:37.600> here<00:04:39.090> keep<00:04:40.090> an

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
job nicely follow me down here keep an

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:53.040 
job nicely follow me down here keep an
eye<00:04:40.330> on<00:04:40.360> them<00:04:40.690> for<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.900> next<00:04:41.170> couple<00:04:41.380> of<00:04:41.530> weeks

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
hopefully will start growing again we
