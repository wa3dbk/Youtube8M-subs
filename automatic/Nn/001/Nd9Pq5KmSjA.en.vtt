that I do want to know that I'm in I

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.469 
that I do want to know that I'm in I
don't<00:01:44.040> care<00:01:44.399> about<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.670> date<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.360> they're

don't care about the date that they're

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.300 
don't care about the date that they're
here<00:01:45.780> because<00:01:46.079> my<00:01:46.229> patient<00:01:46.680> list<00:01:46.860> only<00:01:47.009> shows

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
here because my patient list only shows

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.520 
here because my patient list only shows
one<00:01:47.549> day<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> don't<00:01:48.840> want<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> get<00:01:49.229> rid<00:01:49.500> of

one day so I don't want to get rid of
the<00:01:49.710> box<00:01:49.890> paper<00:01:50.250> appointment<00:01:50.880> date<00:01:51.030> though

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the box paper appointment date though

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.550 
the box paper appointment date though
because<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.720> system<00:01:52.079> won't<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.409> how<00:01:52.530> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
because the system won't know how to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.600 
because the system won't know how to
sort<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:54.030> want<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.540> move<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.140> down<00:01:55.610> so

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
sort so I want to just move this down so

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.520 
sort so I want to just move this down so
instead<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.000> getting<00:01:57.240> rid<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.810> box<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.350> can

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
instead of getting rid of a box you can

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.249 
instead of getting rid of a box you can
also<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:59.009> take<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.000> section<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.930> move<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
also just take that section and move it

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.560 
also just take that section and move it
