00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.519
 Hello UTB burn with fire and this is a pixel 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.950
 world channel for those who have a taste 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.200
 the end of the nineties we met at the school 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.309
 near was an abandoned factory and old 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.049
 children's swing 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.170
 he said he had a kalpa and 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.279
 I offered to play it, I asked again 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.539
 Well, let's play 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.650
 after that, before in gold, I thought and decided 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.400
 that he and his 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.560
 but would have agreed not to his home 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.780
 it turned out that in general I was not particularly 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.680
 upset dakar i always preferred 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.600
 the worm turned out to be some 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.300
 calculator and new license disk 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.480
 holton who immediately moved out 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.550
 boxing in sidyuk since at that time I and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.309
 except not particularly fond of well, except 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.020
 some poor races in with that is 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.809
 easily replaced by the monitor 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.910
 to my pipes after watching the game I 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.550
 I decided I could go home as she told me 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.829
 seemed just extremely difficult but 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.409
 I noticed that if I play it myself 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.119
 be sure to penetrate they say she is not 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.610
 such as the rest of the games in which I am up 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.580
 This game has probably only 2 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.840
 or 3 but it doesn't matter general he me 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.369
 has broken 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.710
 become that i was disappointed it is not 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.689
 say nothing that time I was not accustomed 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.850
 to games and weapons was not given even before 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.799
 birth character where the first marriage 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.429
 met after 30 minutes of normal 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.640
 gameplay 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:31.270
 I was terribly enraged by me terribly infuriated by me 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.890
 this trip in this fucking tram 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.270
 I was terribly enraged by these pride catastrophes 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.630
 run along the corridors 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:44.569
 because they were not funny of course 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.069
 there were a lot of fun in this game for example 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:51.319
 you can kill together in you 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:55.069
 characters cost us to stretch just 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.970
 blow grenades and use as 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.670
 walking machines 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.470
 I think many have tried and still 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.570
 pore trying to baptize the game from 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.730
 like funny moments though i'm not 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.880
 sure about the last point he's kind of 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.740
 as indicated by the intelligence of the game 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.990
 it's generally funny to hear that 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.800
 Halk called almost measure because 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.420
 the first shooter replaced the plot and 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.850
 The plot does not work for me more than 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.530
 direct another summer in konev time 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.850
 I thought another shooter that time 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:30.300
 trouble happened survived 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.550
 the path has a bright goal between come on goals 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.540
 there is an obstacle that anyway 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.540
 need cells 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.740
 in the end I just fell in love with this 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.550
 the game fell in love just because of all this 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.560
 cruelty 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.840
 I tried to find more and more every time 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.370
 short fast paths sometimes just 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.100
 skipping by half v level 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.000
 if this allowed the mystery a new idea that 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.520
 the more I tried the more spectacular 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.890
 more bloody ways of dealing with 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.660
 I liked the enemies to have the game 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.410
 many bugs that could be 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.700
 use for your own good 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.210
 necklace about what you spend yok mu 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.980
 the time of course this game too 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.080
 was one of those few things due 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.180
 whom I ran around friends and shoulders arms 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.090
 from after min to once again 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.940
 I decided my teeth is worth it to play this 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.470
 the game of course you like a few 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.280
 old shot doll you can kill 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.710
 all sorts of 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.270
 if you prefer intelligent 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:34.730
