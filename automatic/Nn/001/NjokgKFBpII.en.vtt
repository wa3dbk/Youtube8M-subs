00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.379 
walk to your shelves I'm going to be
doing<00:00:13.290> 3x3<00:00:14.099> rock<00:00:14.309> walk<00:00:14.759> through<00:00:15.000> Sol's

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
doing 3x3 rock walk through Sol's

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.720 
doing 3x3 rock walk through Sol's
I'm<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.590> some<00:00:16.680> background<00:00:16.890> information<00:00:17.310> I

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
I'm just some background information I

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.540 
I'm just some background information I
only<00:00:17.940> saw<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.900> white<00:00:19.140> cross<00:00:19.410> not<00:00:20.070> even<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
only saw the white cross not even the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.150 
only saw the white cross not even the
yellow<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.689> I'm<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> be

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
yellow so I'm just going to be

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.870 
yellow so I'm just going to be
demonstrating<00:00:23.850> using<00:00:24.029> white<00:00:24.720> cross<00:00:25.820> okay<00:00:26.820> so

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
demonstrating using white cross okay so

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.390 
demonstrating using white cross okay so
looking<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.750> our<00:00:27.779> first<00:00:28.050> scramble<00:00:28.439> oh<00:00:28.800> by<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
looking at our first scramble oh by the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.220 
looking at our first scramble oh by the
way<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.640> will<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.060> all<00:00:30.240> these<00:00:30.510> scrambles<00:00:31.109> in

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
way I will have all these scrambles in

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.620 
way I will have all these scrambles in
the<00:00:31.380> description<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.300> there's<00:00:33.300> only<00:00:33.450> gonna

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the description and there's only gonna

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.810 
the description and there's only gonna
be<00:00:33.750> three<00:00:33.840> solve<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.710> only<00:00:34.890> three<00:00:35.250> scrambles

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
be three solve so only three scrambles

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.450 
be three solve so only three scrambles
so<00:00:36.480> first<00:00:36.870> things<00:00:37.110> first<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.559> see<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.010> this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
so first things first I see this this

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.530 
so first things first I see this this
piece<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.620> supposed<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:42.300> then<00:00:42.480> I

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
piece is supposed to be here but then I

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.720 
piece is supposed to be here but then I
also<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.260> right<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.610> go

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
also see this right here which can go

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.330 
also see this right here which can go
opposite<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.780> rotate<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.860> that

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
opposite and if I rotate this here that

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.400 
opposite and if I rotate this here that
will<00:00:47.520> go<00:00:47.640> opposite<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.809> insert

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
will go opposite and then I can insert

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.770 
will go opposite and then I can insert
that<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> bring<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.690> over<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.410> down<00:00:53.780> bring

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
that so bring that over and down bring

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510 
that so bring that over and down bring
that<00:00:54.930> down<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.710> pairs<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
that down and then that pairs up so you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.650 
that down and then that pairs up so you
bring<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.969> down<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:59.010> rotate<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.480> then

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
bring that down you rotate and then

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.950 
bring that down you rotate and then
these<00:01:00.870> two<00:01:01.079> are<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.199> first<00:01:01.410> ones<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:05.960> then

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
these two are the first ones I see then

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.539 
these two are the first ones I see then
these<00:01:07.260> tail<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:10.159> then<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.490> these<00:01:11.729> two<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.520> i

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
these tail and then I see these two so i

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.380 
these tail and then I see these two so i
pair<00:01:14.880> them<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:16.310> there<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:17.850> insert

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
pair them up and there and then insert

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.560 
pair them up and there and then insert
then<00:01:19.049> these<00:01:19.229> two<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.560> connected

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
then these two are connected

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.020 
then these two are connected
so<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> disconnect<00:01:22.259> them<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.770> pair<00:01:23.460> them<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.759> I

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
so I disconnect them and pair them up I

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.179 
so I disconnect them and pair them up I
don't<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.110> Olo<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.920> really

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
don't know this Olo because I really

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
don't know this Olo because I really
don't<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:26.610> many<00:01:26.909> ELLs

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
don't know many ELLs

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.380 
don't know many ELLs
so<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.259> would<00:01:28.530> probably<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:30.240> I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
so I would probably do that and then I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.580 
so I would probably do that and then I
get<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:33.049> then<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.860> complete<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.590> do

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
get this and then to complete it you do

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
get this and then to complete it you do
this<00:01:38.659> PLL<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.890> that's<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.189> my<00:01:41.340> first<00:01:41.579> example

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this PLL so that's just my first example

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.210 
this PLL so that's just my first example
saw<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.259> any<00:01:43.439> advice<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.740> me<00:01:44.009> by<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
saw if you have any advice for me by the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.340 
saw if you have any advice for me by the
way<00:01:44.399> please<00:01:44.880> feel<00:01:45.030> free<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.509> leave<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
way please feel free to leave it in the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.749 
way please feel free to leave it in the
comment<00:01:46.890> section<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.640> definitely

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
comment section and I would definitely

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.870 
comment section and I would definitely
read<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.439> okay<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.189> second<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.610> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
read it okay so now for the second one I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.630 
read it okay so now for the second one I
this<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.840> these<00:01:52.110> two<00:01:52.290> paired<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.520> that

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
this you these two paired up I see that

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.859 
this you these two paired up I see that
I<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.909> easily<00:01:54.090> pair<00:01:54.479> these<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:57.540> what<00:01:57.840> I

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
I can easily pair these up so what I

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.630 
I can easily pair these up so what I
would<00:01:58.049> probably<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.100> go<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:01.640> rotate

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
would probably do is go like that rotate

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.310 
would probably do is go like that rotate
that<00:02:04.700> move<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.880> bottom<00:02:06.240> face<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.869> go<00:02:07.170> like

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
that move the bottom face and go like

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.359 
that move the bottom face and go like
this

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
this

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.460 
this
and<00:02:08.489> then<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.629> know<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.959> these<00:02:10.110> two<00:02:10.170> are

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and then I know that these two are

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.080 
and then I know that these two are
paired<00:02:10.709> up<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:12.510> there<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:14.090> you

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
paired up so there you have that you

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.540 
paired up so there you have that you
insert<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:16.250> then<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:19.550> what

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
insert that and then I see this and what

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.440 
insert that and then I see this and what
I<00:02:20.580> would<00:02:20.760> probably<00:02:20.970> do<00:02:21.629> just<00:02:21.959> go<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:22.830> that

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
I would probably do just go like that

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.800 
I would probably do just go like that
pair<00:02:24.450> them<00:02:24.629> up<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.230> insert<00:02:25.980> them<00:02:26.540> then<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.629> have

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
pair them up and insert them then I have

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.619 
pair them up and insert them then I have
this<00:02:27.989> already<00:02:28.349> paired<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:29.120> do<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.299> and

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
this already paired up so do that and

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.140 
this already paired up so do that and
then<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.379> last<00:02:31.410> one<00:02:31.920> can<00:02:32.250> easily<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.849> paired

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
then the last one can easily be paired

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.600 
then the last one can easily be paired
up<00:02:33.239> like<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.230> then<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:34.980> don't<00:02:35.310> know<00:02:35.370> this

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
up like that and then I don't know this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.930 
up like that and then I don't know this
algorithm<00:02:36.599> but<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.230> have<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> quick<00:02:38.640> way<00:02:38.819> of

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
algorithm but I have a quick way of

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.140 
algorithm but I have a quick way of
doing<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.360> just<00:02:39.650> by<00:02:40.650> doing<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.430> then

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
doing it just by doing that and then

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.130 
doing it just by doing that and then
here's<00:02:42.510> an<00:02:42.720> easy<00:02:43.940> PLL<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:48.360> that's<00:02:48.690> all<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:49.049> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
here's an easy PLL so that's all for the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.229 
here's an easy PLL so that's all for the
second<00:02:49.500> one<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:49.890> I'll<00:02:50.130> scramble<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.790> third

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
second one now I'll scramble the third

00:02:51.239 --> 00:03:07.819 
second one now I'll scramble the third
one<00:03:00.379> so<00:03:01.379> let's<00:03:01.769> see<00:03:01.920> what<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.160> have<00:03:02.370> here<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:07.530> in

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
one so let's see what we have here so in

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.150 
one so let's see what we have here so in
this<00:03:07.950> case<00:03:08.220> what<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.489> probably<00:03:08.760> would<00:03:09.120> do<00:03:09.299> is<00:03:10.160> I

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
this case what I probably would do is I

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.199 
this case what I probably would do is I
would<00:03:12.079> go<00:03:13.079> like<00:03:13.350> this

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
would go like this

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.210 
would go like this
two<00:03:15.209> pennies<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.780> up<00:03:15.930> then<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:16.769> one<00:03:16.980> got

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
two pennies to up then this one got

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.400 
two pennies to up then this one got
paired<00:03:17.459> up<00:03:17.579> in<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> back<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.299> then<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.380> would

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
paired up in the back and then I would

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.800 
paired up in the back and then I would
do<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.680> last<00:03:19.980> one<00:03:20.190> like<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.480> reason

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
do the last one like that and the reason

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.090 
do the last one like that and the reason
why<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.930> didn't<00:03:22.139> just<00:03:22.170> bring<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.530> down<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.829> cuz<00:03:23.010> I

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
why I didn't just bring it down is cuz I

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.240 
why I didn't just bring it down is cuz I
saw<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.430> piece<00:03:23.700> here<00:03:24.829> so<00:03:25.829> then<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.069> would

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
saw this piece here so then I would

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.809 
saw this piece here so then I would
those<00:03:26.700> two<00:03:26.940> would<00:03:27.030> be<00:03:27.180> paired<00:03:27.450> up<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:28.730> then<00:03:29.730> I

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
those two would be paired up and then I

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.720 
those two would be paired up and then I
see<00:03:30.030> these<00:03:30.269> two<00:03:30.299> right<00:03:30.750> here<00:03:31.370> which<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.579> would

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
see these two right here which I would

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.839 
see these two right here which I would
do<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.150> with<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.010> see<00:03:35.220> these<00:03:35.430> two<00:03:35.459> right

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
do that with and I see these two right

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.280 
do that with and I see these two right
here<00:03:35.880> so<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.510> would<00:03:36.599> actually<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.079> rotation

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
here so I would actually do a rotation

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.839 
here so I would actually do a rotation
and<00:03:38.000> then<00:03:39.000> pair<00:03:39.269> them<00:03:39.419> up<00:03:40.040> then<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.220> last<00:03:41.459> one

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
and then pair them up then the last one

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.860 
and then pair them up then the last one
I<00:03:42.090> would<00:03:42.540> go<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:44.569> there<00:03:45.569> you<00:03:45.599> have

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
I would go like that and there you have

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:53.949 
I would go like that and there you have
this<00:03:46.019> case<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:49.549> finally<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.880> have<00:03:51.019> this<00:03:52.639> PLL

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
this case and finally you have this PLL

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.900 
this case and finally you have this PLL
so<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.109> is<00:03:55.230> all<00:03:55.380> for<00:03:55.410> my<00:03:55.680> 3x3<00:03:56.340> walkthroughs

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
so that is all for my 3x3 walkthroughs

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.789 
so that is all for my 3x3 walkthroughs
hopefully<00:03:57.840> there<00:03:57.989> were<00:03:58.079> someone<00:03:58.349> helpful

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
hopefully there were someone helpful

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.740 
hopefully there were someone helpful
