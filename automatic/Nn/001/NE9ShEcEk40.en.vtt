really penetrate into the issues that

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.490 
really penetrate into the issues that
need<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:53.910> asked<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.200> a<00:00:55.230> very<00:00:55.379> good

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
need to be asked and to do a very good

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.590 
need to be asked and to do a very good
job<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:56.040> their<00:00:56.160> lighting<00:00:56.340> design<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.239> issues

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
job on their lighting design the issues

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.479 
job on their lighting design the issues
can<00:00:57.840> range<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.200> how<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> determine<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.280> size

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
can range from how to determine the size

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.180 
can range from how to determine the size
of<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.700> chandelier<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.780> let's<00:01:01.050> say<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> room

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
of a chandelier so let's say that a room

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.170 
of a chandelier so let's say that a room
is<00:01:02.340> 12<00:01:02.640> x<00:01:02.820> 12<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:04.379> add<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:05.250> 24<00:01:05.850> but

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
is 12 x 12 you add that up that's 24 but

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.180 
is 12 x 12 you add that up that's 24 but
actually<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.780> use<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.020> number<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.830> inches

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
actually you use that number in inches

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.789 
actually you use that number in inches
so<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.400> would<00:01:08.640> say<00:01:08.850> 24<00:01:09.210> inches<00:01:09.810> would<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.680> an

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
so you would say 24 inches would be an

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.280 
so you would say 24 inches would be an
appropriate<00:01:10.920> size<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.060> diameter<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
appropriate size for the diameter of the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.500 
appropriate size for the diameter of the
chandelier<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:13.979> dining<00:01:14.070> room<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:15.299> how<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
chandelier in the dining room to how to

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.660 
chandelier in the dining room to how to
light<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> room<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.409> large<00:01:16.650> windows<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
light a room with large windows that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.399 
light a room with large windows that
night<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> windows<00:01:18.659> don't<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.080> window

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
night if the windows don't have window

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.990 
night if the windows don't have window
covering<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.159> actually<00:01:20.400> see<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
covering what you actually see is a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.670 
covering what you actually see is a
reflection<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> room<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.260> almost<00:01:22.500> like

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
reflection of the room it's almost like

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.219 
reflection of the room it's almost like
a<00:01:22.710> mirror<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.970> very<00:01:24.510> good<00:01:24.780> technique<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
a mirror a very good technique to

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.109 
a mirror a very good technique to
resolve<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> problem<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.610> actually<00:01:26.790> add

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
resolve that problem is to actually add

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.850 
resolve that problem is to actually add
landscape<00:01:27.689> lighting<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.409> outside

landscape lighting on the outside

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
landscape lighting on the outside
because<00:01:29.159> once<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.670> put<00:01:29.909> light<00:01:30.119> outside<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
because once you put light outside of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.719 
because once you put light outside of
the<00:01:30.930> space<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:31.979> makes<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> window

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the space that actually makes the window

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.460 
the space that actually makes the window
disappear<00:01:33.299> now<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.170> kind<00:01:34.380> of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
disappear now you have this kind of

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.200 
disappear now you have this kind of

over<00:01:43.650> a<00:01:43.680> weekend<00:01:44.130> landscape<00:01:45.000> lighting

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
over a weekend landscape lighting

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.660 
over a weekend landscape lighting
typically<00:01:45.840> uses<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> low<00:01:46.439> voltage<00:01:46.590> system<00:01:47.280> so

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
typically uses a low voltage system so

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
typically uses a low voltage system so
it's<00:01:48.360> very<00:01:48.570> simple<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.229> simply<00:01:49.710> plug<00:01:49.950> in

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it's very simple to just simply plug in

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.069 
it's very simple to just simply plug in
a<00:01:50.250> transformer<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.000> then<00:01:51.150> run<00:01:51.390> your<00:01:51.420> cable<00:01:51.960> in

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
a transformer and then run your cable in

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.030 
the yard if you have interesting trees
you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.750> use<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> landscape<00:01:55.590> lighting<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
you can use the landscape lighting to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.429 
you can use the landscape lighting to
enhance<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> trees<00:01:56.930> oftentimes<00:01:57.930> with<00:01:58.320> the

fans and energy conservation what's
interesting<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.579> many<00:02:38.939> of<00:02:39.120> these<00:02:39.269> new

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
interesting is that many of these new

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.349 
interesting is that many of these new
energy-efficient<00:02:40.620> lighting<00:02:40.799> sources<00:02:41.359> are

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
energy-efficient lighting sources are

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.330 
energy-efficient lighting sources are
really<00:02:42.780> indistinguishable<00:02:43.709> from<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.069> older

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
really indistinguishable from the older

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.979 
really indistinguishable from the older
incandescent<00:02:44.790> sources<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.599> that<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
incandescent sources so that the

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.470 
incandescent sources so that the
consumer<00:02:46.560> can<00:02:46.950> place<00:02:47.700> these<00:02:47.969> sources<00:02:48.299> that

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
consumer can place these sources that

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.300 
consumer can place these sources that
are<00:02:48.540> typically<00:02:48.959> four<00:02:49.290> times<00:02:49.590> more<00:02:49.859> efficient

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
are typically four times more efficient

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.979 
are typically four times more efficient
so<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.489> other<00:02:50.609> words<00:02:50.849> they<00:02:51.060> would<00:02:51.239> be<00:02:51.389> spending

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
so in other words they would be spending

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.250 
so in other words they would be spending
about<00:02:52.340> 75%<00:02:53.340> less<00:02:53.909> on<00:02:54.209> their<00:02:54.419> electric

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
about 75% less on their electric

about 75% less on their electric
