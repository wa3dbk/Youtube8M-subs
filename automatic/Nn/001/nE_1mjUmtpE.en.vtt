 # Yes, my name is Link, old. # 

00:00:28.213 --> 00:00:29.788
 #I'm more known than Lil Wayne. # 

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:31.458
 #Oh, did you think my name was Zelda? # 

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:33.069
 # That's a p *** girls name! # 

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:34.593
 #I have saved the world like fifteen times ... # 

00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:36.203
 #and I saved the princess from death. # 

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:39.258
 # And I do it alone without help and without advice. # 

00:00:39.663 --> 00:00:40.756
 Hears! Look! Listen out! 

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:42.771
 # You hear, look, listen to jod *** annoying fairy! # 

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.656
 # I would rather be forced to listen to constant Katy Perry. # 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.137
 #I think it's time to have some recognition ... # 

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:49.070

 #Because he is L to I, to N, to K. # 

00:00:55.443 --> 00:00:58.807
 # Wear stockings all day, do not give a damn what you say. # 

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:01.992
 #He has balls bigger than Evel Knievel. # 

00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:05.423
 # And he will not stop until the world is free from evil. # 

00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:08.466
 # I will break all your vases and I hope not to hear you fucking. # 

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.133
 # I have the Triforce of Courage, bitch! # 

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.333

 #I am called the guerrilla and my bank account is at maximum. # 

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:18.531
 # I have 999 rupees and my leather wallet is full. # 

00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:20.262
 # You can not back down. You can not laze now. # 

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:21.762
 #The world needs me to attack now. # 

00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:23.089
 #However, I am forced to pay for the ass ... # 

00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:24.835
 Through these bombs in Castillo City. # 

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.458
 # Just give me some Heart Containers ... # 

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:28.039
 #and let me spit on my ocarina. # 

00:01:28.345 --> 00:01:31.563
 # So I can kick that idiot, Ganon, on his way to Argentina! # 

00:01:31.563 --> 00:01:34.460

 #Yo, fourth elf, do you need a trip to the north pole? # 

00:02:03.992 --> 00:02:05.350
 #Santa has one thing for the goblins ... # 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.942
 #to cancel your marriage. # 

00:02:06.942 --> 00:02:08.689
 # Do you really think that saving the princess ... 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.075
 #v to convince me that you are straight? # 

00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:13.339
 #The fashion of "uggs and skirt" is so 2008. # 

00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:16.488
 # Oh hell! It's Ganondorf trying to steal my style. 

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:18.358
 # Batman's cape? Lincoln beard? # 

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:19.729
 # Were you dressed by a child? # 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.005
 # You are a redhead without a soul and you look like a p *** troll # 

00:02:23.222 --> 00:02:26.188
 # Kidnapping helpless girls does not get a little old? # 

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:27.950
 # Do you think Zelda is stupid enough ... # 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.743
 #to be kidnapped so many times? # 

00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:32.910
 # She flees to my castle, to my room and begs to be locked up. # 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.080
 # Yes, she's tired of your Deku nuts and your gay female face. # 

00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:39.427
 # LINK? Better LINGay. # 

00:02:39.427 --> 00:02:42.543
 #Viejo, you should have been aborted like in Jersey Shore. # 

00:02:42.543 --> 00:02:45.870
 # It's a goddamn lie what you said about Zelda because she loves my Master Sword. # 

00:02:46.097 --> 00:02:47.454
 # It's a pity that your whole life is a complete waste ... # 

00:02:47.454 --> 00:02:48.982
