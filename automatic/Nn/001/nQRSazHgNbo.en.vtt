00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.700
 or the whole world of good craving them 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.860
 I bring a trick on the map of never and 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.080
 dawn zombies black ops 2 and good in this 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.469
 video I will teach you how to get on this 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.030
 roof 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.099
 first we have to be two players 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.390
 and there we see that the first one who does not 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.369
 do the trick will have to stay 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.150
 here and start spinning in the 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.800
 corner 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.930
 this makes a kind of combat that the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.269
 zombies when they approach will not hit us 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.949
 they will not kill us anymore, I recommend them 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.660
 Take titan because they can give you one or 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.730
 twice if then he can kill you like that 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.280
 which I recommend taking them worth then 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.020
 when I'm staying there trying 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.239
 kill our partner we 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.350
 we have to jump over here is worth it 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.590
 Only one thing to do is not to do 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.379
 no command of black ops 21 sorry what 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.789
 only thing to do is jump and in 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.379
 the knife moment now and we see that 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.440
 we are approaching little by little and there the 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.239
 wing I do not know how many times I try one 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.219
 minus two hundred times getting 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.280
 knives there and the truth that this trick 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.829
 it's done with patience and it's basically 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.969
 that much patience must be done 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.260
 because it is that if we will not go out 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.280
 first and it cost me half an hour 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.200
 we were I think 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.060
 and basically we can get on the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.010
 roof this this roof is not 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.310
 patched is after the patch since 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.960
 the first trick they did with a 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.430
 commanded that was made with the snake 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.710
 ilich that I could not upload it because 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.060
 gave me time and in which as I have already 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.580
 said they never do any command of 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.740
 black ops 1 or nothing only there is that 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.750
 to do is to sprint forward in the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.670
 moment to jump and knife is worth pointing 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.320
 to the zombie then I have that jump 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.820
 I recommend taking titan because if you put 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.250
 the jump and you do not get to go up in the 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.930
 this one you love you down you will kill 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.390
 It's good because putting is a tremendous leap and 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.910
 if it falls to the ground it will die in the second 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.039
 and one, I hope you liked the 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.140
 video is basically this to the trick and 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.270
