00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
they've been out of stock and then I

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.339 
they've been out of stock and then I
didn't<00:00:16.939> order<00:00:17.090> for<00:00:17.450> a<00:00:17.480> while<00:00:17.689> and<00:00:18.020> things<00:00:18.230> like

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.950 
something kind of extra strong and I
thought<00:00:37.910> this<00:00:38.059> would<00:00:38.239> be<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.540> way<00:00:38.630> to<00:00:38.660> go<00:00:38.840> i

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
thought this would be the way to go i

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.319 
thought this would be the way to go i
have<00:00:39.260> used<00:00:39.469> danny<00:00:39.770> is<00:00:40.040> very<00:00:40.309> very<00:00:40.489> strong<00:00:40.880> the

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
only thing I find with it and what I

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.819 
only thing I find with it and what I
haven't<00:00:43.430> actually<00:00:43.489> put<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.850> away<00:00:43.940> yet<00:00:44.270> but

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
haven't actually put it away yet but

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.110 
haven't actually put it away yet but
there's<00:00:45.829> no<00:00:45.980> kind<00:00:46.129> of<00:00:46.219> cap<00:00:46.460> on<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.700> because

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
there's no kind of cap on and because

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.760 
there's no kind of cap on and because
it's<00:00:47.270> such<00:00:47.450> strong<00:00:47.719> adhesive<00:00:47.960> I'm<00:00:48.350> unsure

it's such strong adhesive I'm unsure
whether<00:00:49.250> it<00:00:49.460> might<00:00:49.610> kind<00:00:49.910> of<00:00:49.940> catch<00:00:50.210> on

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
whether it might kind of catch on

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.510 
whether it might kind of catch on
something<00:00:50.840> in<00:00:50.930> my<00:00:51.050> drawer<00:00:51.350> but<00:00:52.129> we'll<00:00:52.340> see<00:00:52.489> how

of dyes and couple of stencils and some
stamps<00:02:18.879> as<00:02:19.000> well<00:02:19.180> first<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.959> all<00:02:20.079> I<00:02:20.319> did<00:02:20.530> end<00:02:20.739> up

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
stamps as well first of all I did end up

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.949

getting<00:02:20.980> these<00:02:21.430> stitch<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.970> rectangle<00:02:22.480> dies<00:02:22.629> I

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
getting these stitch to rectangle dies I

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.720 
getting these stitch to rectangle dies I
guess<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.709> probably<00:02:23.950> would<00:02:24.430> if<00:02:24.459> you've

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
guess that I probably would if you've

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.399 
guess that I probably would if you've
watched<00:02:24.970> my<00:02:25.150> whole<00:02:25.329> videos<00:02:25.599> in<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.870> past<00:02:26.049> I

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
watched my whole videos in the past I

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.020 
watched my whole videos in the past I
just<00:02:26.590> get<00:02:26.769> these<00:02:26.890> squares<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.549> circles

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
just get these squares in the circles

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.970 
just get these squares in the circles
and<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.689> thought<00:02:28.900> probably<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.379> would<00:02:29.530> end<00:02:29.860> up

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
and I thought probably I would end up

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.920 
and I thought probably I would end up
getting<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.400> creating<00:02:30.909> the<00:02:31.120> rectangles<00:02:31.810> as

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
getting this creating the rectangles as

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.080 
getting this creating the rectangles as
well<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.379> really<00:02:33.129> happy<00:02:33.430> i<00:02:33.579> did<00:02:33.670> i<00:02:34.030> do

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
well and really happy i did i do

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
really like the sizing of these and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.280 
really like the sizing of these and
we'll<00:02:46.930> definitely<00:02:47.230> be<00:02:47.440> using<00:02:47.560> these<00:02:47.859> a<00:02:47.920> lot<00:02:48.190> I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
we'll definitely be using these a lot I

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.949 
we'll definitely be using these a lot I
then<00:02:50.290> got<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.769> sketch<00:02:51.159> heart<00:02:51.609> die<00:02:52.180> again

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
then got to the sketch heart die again

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.660 
then got to the sketch heart die again
I've<00:02:53.170> seen<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.590> been<00:02:53.859> used<00:02:54.069> quite<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.400> few

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
I've seen this been used quite a few

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.430 
I've seen this been used quite a few
times<00:02:54.909> on<00:02:55.359> different<00:02:55.420> peoples<00:02:55.959> cards<00:02:56.290> I

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
times on different peoples cards I

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.710 
times on different peoples cards I
really<00:02:57.099> like<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.400> kind<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.819> sketchy<00:02:58.120> detail

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
really like this kind of sketchy detail

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.110 
really like this kind of sketchy detail
just<00:02:58.989> thought<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.290> was<00:02:59.379> quite<00:02:59.620> pretty<00:02:59.889> and<00:03:00.189> I

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
just thought it was quite pretty and I

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.550 
just thought it was quite pretty and I
think<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.599> would<00:03:01.659> be<00:03:01.750> useful<00:03:01.989> for<00:03:02.200> quite<00:03:02.530> a

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
think that would be useful for quite a

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.559 
think that would be useful for quite a
few<00:03:02.650> different<00:03:02.859> cards<00:03:03.689> and<00:03:04.689> then<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:06.540> got<00:03:07.540> a

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
few different cards and then I got a

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.990 
few different cards and then I got a
couple<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:08.139> stone<00:03:08.859> source<00:03:09.159> first<00:03:09.459> of<00:03:09.609> all<00:03:09.730> this

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
couple of stone source first of all this

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.360 
couple of stone source first of all this
is<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.359> grid<00:03:10.870> stencil<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.680> think<00:03:12.099> this<00:03:12.159> was

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
is the grid stencil I think this was

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.369 
is the grid stencil I think this was
from<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.700> hop<00:03:12.879> to<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.150> release<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.870> again

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
from the hop to it release and again

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:15.420 
from the hop to it release and again
I've<00:03:14.500> seen<00:03:14.650> those<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.950> different<00:03:15.340> examples

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
I've seen those of different examples

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.429 
I've seen those of different examples
using<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.450> thought<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.109> was<00:03:17.170> really

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
using this and thought it was really

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.470 
using this and thought it was really
really<00:03:17.560> pretty<00:03:17.799> so<00:03:18.669> thought<00:03:19.000> i<00:03:19.030> would<00:03:19.299> go

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
really pretty so thought i would go

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.080 
really pretty so thought i would go
ahead<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.750> buy<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.799> then<00:03:21.310> i<00:03:21.400> also<00:03:21.430> got

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
ahead and buy that and then i also got

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.920 
ahead and buy that and then i also got
the<00:03:22.480> tiny<00:03:23.230> dot<00:03:23.500> sense<00:03:23.889> or<00:03:24.129> distance<00:03:24.970> or<00:03:25.269> came

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
the tiny dot sense or distance or came

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.430 
the tiny dot sense or distance or came
out<00:03:26.109> with<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.470> sketched<00:03:27.310> dies<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.599> i<00:03:28.989> really

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
out with the sketched dies and i really

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.460 
out with the sketched dies and i really
at<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.889> time<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.699> didn't<00:03:31.659> quite<00:03:31.870> get<00:03:32.230> what<00:03:32.349> it

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
at the time I didn't quite get what it

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.750 
at the time I didn't quite get what it
was<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.650> actually<00:03:32.949> thought<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.430> was<00:03:33.579> something

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
was I actually thought it was something

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.069 
was I actually thought it was something
completely<00:03:33.970> different<00:03:34.389> I<00:03:34.540> didn't<00:03:34.750> realize<00:03:34.930> it

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
completely different I didn't realize it
