00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
really relevant to what we're about to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.180 
really relevant to what we're about to
do<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> want<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.890> want<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.070> come

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
over to my environment settings now

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
over to my environment settings now
notice<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.980> way<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.280> my<00:00:38.430> layout<00:00:38.760> is

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
notice that the way that my layout is

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.670 
notice that the way that my layout is
set<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:39.149> may<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.629> match<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.350> in

set up may not match what you have in
studio<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.610> okay<00:00:41.940> because<00:00:42.090> studio<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
studio that's okay because studio is a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.740 
studio that's okay because studio is a
highly<00:00:43.110> customizable<00:00:43.710> layout<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.480> have

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.390 
that from sky to image base now we're at
the<00:01:13.590> bat<00:01:13.740> we're<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> get<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.159> black

back<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.640> HDR<00:01:33.090> image<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> reason<00:01:34.049> why<00:01:34.110> is

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
back to HDR image and the reason why is

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.719 
back to HDR image and the reason why is
because<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.770> first<00:01:35.070> time<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.369> click<00:01:35.579> that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
because the first time we click that

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.630 
because the first time we click that
it's<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.570> load<00:01:36.900> an<00:01:37.290> EXR<00:01:37.920> file<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.549> we

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it's going to load an EXR file that we

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.700 
it's going to load an EXR file that we
have<00:01:38.939> by<00:01:39.210> default<00:01:39.630> when<00:01:40.200> we're<00:01:40.320> working<00:01:40.439> with

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
have by default when we're working with

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.350 
have by default when we're working with
HDR<00:01:41.100> studio<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.880> I'm<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.240> come

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
HDR studio so I'm just going to come

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.210 
HDR studio so I'm just going to come
over<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.930> I'm<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> choose<00:01:43.770> HDR

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
over here and I'm going to choose HDR

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.039 
over here and I'm going to choose HDR
light<00:01:44.369> studio<00:01:44.640> again<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.689> time<00:01:45.899> it's

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
light studio again and this time it's

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:46.969 
light studio again and this time it's
going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.229> stay<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.590> I'm<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
going to stay and I'm going to do the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.139 
going to stay and I'm going to do the
same<00:01:47.130> thing<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.399> all<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.820> these<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.090> I'm

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
same thing with all of these so I'm

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.120 
same thing with all of these so I'm
gonna<00:01:48.240> click<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.509> once<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:49.500> click<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> again

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
gonna click it once then click it again

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.980 
gonna click it once then click it again
to<00:01:50.430> make<00:01:50.640> sure<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.030> stays<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.630> then

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to make sure that that stays and then

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.560 
to make sure that that stays and then
click<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.590> once<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.090> click<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> again<00:01:54.420> now<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
click it once and click it again now the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.639 
click it once and click it again now the
reason<00:01:54.780> why<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> do<00:01:55.229> each<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.560> these

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
reason why you have to do each of these

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.830 
reason why you have to do each of these
channels<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.219> because<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.820> don't<00:01:57.119> then

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
channels is because if you don't then

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.090 
channels is because if you don't then
it's<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.170> pull<00:01:58.350> its<00:01:58.500> information<00:01:59.070> from

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it's going to pull its information from

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.730 
it's going to pull its information from
someplace<00:01:59.820> other<00:02:00.000> than<00:02:00.270> our<00:02:00.869> HDR<00:02:01.560> light

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
someplace other than our HDR light

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.139 
someplace other than our HDR light
studio<00:02:02.009> which<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.219> not<00:02:02.399> what<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:02.670> want<00:02:02.880> so

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
studio which is not what we want so

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.770 
studio which is not what we want so
we'll<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.110> once<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.770> then<00:02:05.130> twice

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
we'll just do that once and then twice

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.150 
we'll just do that once and then twice
now<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.840> won't<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.619> twice<00:02:07.770> after

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
now you won't have to do it twice after

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.619 
now you won't have to do it twice after
the<00:02:08.520> first<00:02:08.759> time<00:02:08.879> after<00:02:09.209> you've<00:02:09.330> done<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the first time after you've done it the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.479 
the first time after you've done it the
first<00:02:09.660> time<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.649> only<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.310> once

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
first time you only have to do it once

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.640 
first time you only have to do it once
and<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.760> will<00:02:11.879> remember<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.840> now<00:02:13.230> what<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.530> want

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and it will remember so now what we want

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.940 
and it will remember so now what we want
to<00:02:13.770> do

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
to do

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.770 
to do
we<00:02:14.069> want<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.310> actually<00:02:14.640> launch<00:02:14.910> HDR<00:02:15.599> light

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
we want to actually launch HDR light

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.910 
we want to actually launch HDR light
studio<00:02:16.080> which<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.349> this<00:02:16.440> button<00:02:16.680> right<00:02:16.890> here

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
studio which is this button right here

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.240 
studio which is this button right here
so<00:02:17.099> I'm<00:02:17.220> going<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.370> launch<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.920> now<00:02:19.920> that

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
so I'm going to launch that and now that

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.650 
so I'm going to launch that and now that
we're<00:02:20.400> working<00:02:20.730> here<00:02:20.849> with<00:02:21.000> an<00:02:21.120> HDR<00:02:21.450> light

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
we're working here with an HDR light

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.210 
we're working here with an HDR light
studio<00:02:21.959> live<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.349> can<00:02:22.500> see<00:02:22.650> immediately<00:02:22.950> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
studio live you can see immediately that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.400 
studio live you can see immediately that
our<00:02:23.430> fire<00:02:23.610> render<00:02:23.970> has<00:02:24.120> updated<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:24.840> what's

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
our fire render has updated and what's

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.650 
our fire render has updated and what's
gone<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.709> here<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.610> we're<00:02:27.209> now<00:02:27.360> using

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
gone on here is that we're now using

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.300 
gone on here is that we're now using
that<00:02:27.989> background<00:02:28.410> we're<00:02:28.590> no<00:02:28.680> longer<00:02:28.830> using

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that background we're no longer using

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.610 
that background we're no longer using
that<00:02:29.430> white<00:02:29.640> EXR<00:02:30.209> file<00:02:30.450> we're<00:02:30.630> now<00:02:30.750> using<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
that white EXR file we're now using the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.080 
that white EXR file we're now using the
background<00:02:32.069> information<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.700> if<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:32.880> start

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
background information and if I start

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.809 
background information and if I start
dropping<00:02:33.569> stuff<00:02:33.780> into<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.489> can

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
dropping stuff into this like so you can

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.430 
dropping stuff into this like so you can
see<00:02:35.970> that's<00:02:36.180> going<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.420> update<00:02:36.569> within<00:02:37.200> our

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
see that's going to update within our

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.740 
see that's going to update within our
max<00:02:37.650> well<00:02:37.830> fire<00:02:38.010> preview<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:39.330> at<00:02:39.540> this

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
max well fire preview so this at this

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.150 
max well fire preview so this at this
point<00:02:39.989> becomes<00:02:40.349> very<00:02:40.650> much<00:02:40.860> what<00:02:41.040> we've

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
point becomes very much what we've

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.369 
point becomes very much what we've
talked<00:02:41.430> about<00:02:41.549> in<00:02:41.790> previous<00:02:41.819> videos<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:42.750> we

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
talked about in previous videos so we

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.320 
talked about in previous videos so we
don't<00:02:43.530> really<00:02:43.590> need<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.890> cover<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.519> HDR<00:02:44.879> light

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
don't really need to cover the HDR light

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.600 
don't really need to cover the HDR light
Studio<00:02:45.690> Live<00:02:46.170> interface<00:02:47.160> because<00:02:47.489> I've

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
Studio Live interface because I've

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
Studio Live interface because I've
covered<00:02:47.849> all<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.269> I'm<00:02:48.330> just<00:02:48.360> going<00:02:48.540> to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
covered all that but I'm just going to

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.030 
covered all that but I'm just going to
go<00:02:48.690> ahead<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.110> just<00:02:49.230> do<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> few<00:02:49.620> things<00:02:49.650> to

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
go ahead and just do a few things to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.339 
go ahead and just do a few things to
this<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.910> make<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.299> pretty<00:02:51.870> clear<00:02:52.170> that

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
this to make this pretty clear that

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.720 
this to make this pretty clear that
we're<00:02:52.500> dealing<00:02:52.620> with<00:02:52.769> something<00:02:52.980> unique<00:02:53.310> like

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
we're dealing with something unique like

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.360 
we're dealing with something unique like
so<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:55.470> can<00:02:55.500> see<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:55.890> that's<00:02:56.040> going<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.250> be

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
so you can see that that's going to be

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.830 
so you can see that that's going to be
reflected<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:56.940> here<00:02:57.180> maybe<00:02:57.360> I'll<00:02:57.599> come<00:02:57.810> over

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
reflected in here maybe I'll come over

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.289 
reflected in here maybe I'll come over
and<00:02:58.230> turn<00:02:58.470> off<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.769> background<00:02:59.250> you<00:03:00.000> can<00:03:00.150> see

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
and turn off the background you can see

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.729 
and turn off the background you can see
that's<00:03:00.450> reflected<00:03:00.989> very<00:03:01.140> clearly<00:03:01.470> there

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
that's reflected very clearly there

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.640 
that's reflected very clearly there
maybe<00:03:01.980> I'll<00:03:02.160> come<00:03:02.310> over<00:03:02.340> here<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.819> grab<00:03:02.970> a

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
maybe I'll come over here and grab a

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:12.740 
maybe I'll come over here and grab a
spotlight<00:03:10.579> I'm<00:03:11.579> able<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:11.970> colorize<00:03:12.269> that

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
spotlight I'm able to colorize that

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.030 
spotlight I'm able to colorize that
maybe<00:03:13.440> with<00:03:13.590> an<00:03:13.709> orange<00:03:14.069> color<00:03:14.370> like<00:03:15.299> so<00:03:15.630> and

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
maybe with an orange color like so and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.220 
maybe with an orange color like so and
we'll<00:03:17.040> drop<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.700> somewhere<00:03:18.569> around<00:03:18.720> that

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
we'll drop that in somewhere around that

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.900 
we'll drop that in somewhere around that
neck<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.530> woods<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:19.889> we've<00:03:20.579> got<00:03:20.760> some

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
neck of the woods so we've got some

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.460 
neck of the woods so we've got some
interesting<00:03:21.090> lighting<00:03:21.480> going<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:21.900> back<00:03:22.109> here

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
interesting lighting going on back here

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.500 
interesting lighting going on back here
and<00:03:22.799> we've<00:03:23.100> also<00:03:23.280> got<00:03:23.670> our<00:03:23.940> background

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
and we've also got our background

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.180 
and we've also got our background
lighting<00:03:24.780> going<00:03:24.900> on<00:03:25.109> so<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.410> looks<00:03:26.010> good

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
lighting going on so that looks good

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.759 
lighting going on so that looks good
right<00:03:26.370> I'm<00:03:26.549> ready<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.150> go<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.720> now<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.380> want<00:03:28.680> to

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.180 
go ahead and do a final render because
I'm<00:03:30.450> done<00:03:30.780> tweaking<00:03:31.170> out<00:03:31.530> whatever<00:03:31.829> I<00:03:31.889> wanted

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190

I'm done tweaking out whatever I wanted
to<00:03:32.250> do<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.639> HDR<00:03:33.000> light<00:03:33.239> Studio<00:03:33.540> Live<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.109> I'm

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
to do in HDR light Studio Live and I'm

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.590 
to do in HDR light Studio Live and I'm
ready<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.190> go<00:03:35.430> ahead<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.880> exit<00:03:36.269> out<00:03:36.359> a<00:03:36.389> fire

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
ready to go ahead and exit out a fire

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.390

and actually press the render button to

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.759 
and actually press the render button to
render<00:03:38.670> out<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.209> Maxwell<00:03:39.690> now<00:03:39.840> if<00:03:40.049> I<00:03:40.440> wanted<00:03:40.709> to

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
render out of Maxwell now if I wanted to

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.319 
render out of Maxwell now if I wanted to
I<00:03:40.859> could<00:03:41.100> also<00:03:41.250> at<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.609> time<00:03:41.790> come<00:03:42.000> over<00:03:42.030> here

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
I could also at this time come over here

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.180 
I could also at this time come over here
to<00:03:42.389> camera<00:03:42.690> parameters<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.440> change

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
to camera parameters and change

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.819 
to camera parameters and change
something<00:03:44.489> like<00:03:44.910> say<00:03:45.510> our<00:03:45.540> Evie<00:03:46.260> value<00:03:46.680> to

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
something like say our Evie value to

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.520 
something like say our Evie value to
something<00:03:47.040> around<00:03:47.730> say<00:03:48.120> 9<00:03:48.359> to<00:03:49.139> get<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.290> lower

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
something around say 9 to get a lower

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.740 
something around say 9 to get a lower
exposure<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.880> maybe<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.150> like<00:03:51.359> that<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.569> little

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
exposure so maybe I like that a little

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.530 
exposure so maybe I like that a little
bit<00:03:51.840> better<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.139> we'll<00:03:52.260> leave<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.650> at<00:03:52.859> 9<00:03:53.540> but

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
bit better and we'll leave that at 9 but

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.670 
bit better and we'll leave that at 9 but
what<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:54.690> want<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:54.930> do<00:03:55.019> here<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.380> want<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.560> come

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
what I want to do here is I want to come

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.990 
what I want to do here is I want to come
over<00:03:55.799> here<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:56.280> upper<00:03:56.700> right<00:03:56.970> hand

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
over here to this upper right hand

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.580 
over here to this upper right hand
corner<00:03:57.329> I<00:03:57.540> want<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.750> click<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.139> render<00:03:58.560> button

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
corner I want to click the render button

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.259 
corner I want to click the render button
and<00:03:59.489> what<00:03:59.609> that's<00:03:59.760> going<00:03:59.849> to<00:03:59.910> do<00:04:00.030> is<00:04:00.120> it's

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
going to allow me to render out an EXR

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.789 
going to allow me to render out an EXR
file<00:04:02.910> or<00:04:03.209> an<00:04:03.359> HDR<00:04:03.690> file<00:04:03.959> whatever<00:04:04.170> I<00:04:04.349> want<00:04:04.650> to

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
so I'm going to choose EXR from this

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.490 
so I'm going to choose EXR from this
drop<00:04:06.420> down<00:04:06.450> if<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.810> don't<00:04:06.989> have<00:04:07.109> that<00:04:07.319> make

middle size and you can have larger
sizes<00:04:27.949> are<00:04:28.009> smaller<00:04:28.310> sizes<00:04:28.580> depending<00:04:29.060> upon

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
sizes are smaller sizes depending upon

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.870 
sizes are smaller sizes depending upon
what<00:04:30.080> it<00:04:30.169> is<00:04:30.320> that<00:04:30.590> you're<00:04:30.740> wanting<00:04:31.009> primarily

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
that's plenty of detail for what I'm

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.330 
that's plenty of detail for what I'm
looking<00:04:35.870> for<00:04:36.320> so<00:04:36.470> I'm<00:04:36.530> going<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.740> be<00:04:36.830> really

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340

looking for so I'm going to be really
happy<00:04:37.580> with<00:04:37.699> that<00:04:37.850> now<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.660> interesting

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
happy with that now the interesting

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.290 
happy with that now the interesting
thing<00:04:39.110> here<00:04:39.500> is<00:04:39.620> that<00:04:39.650> if<00:04:39.979> you<00:04:40.460> don't<00:04:40.759> do<00:04:41.120> this

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
thing here is that if you don't do this

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.420 
thing here is that if you don't do this
next<00:04:41.570> step<00:04:41.720> every<00:04:42.620> time<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:43.009> you<00:04:43.130> go<00:04:43.370> to

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
next step every time that you go to

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.219 
next step every time that you go to
render<00:04:43.729> you're<00:04:44.030> going<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.240> have<00:04:44.389> to<00:04:44.509> rerender

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
render you're going to have to rerender

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.050 
render you're going to have to rerender
out<00:04:45.410> that<00:04:45.650> export<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.400> this<00:04:46.520> is<00:04:46.669> not<00:04:46.820> going<00:04:46.970> to

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
out that export and this is not going to

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.939 
out that export and this is not going to
be<00:04:47.180> good<00:04:47.360> so<00:04:47.660> what<00:04:48.320> I<00:04:48.350> would<00:04:48.560> recommend<00:04:48.650> that

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
be good so what I would recommend that

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.260 
be good so what I would recommend that
you<00:04:49.100> do<00:04:49.220> at<00:04:49.340> this<00:04:49.490> point<00:04:49.729> because<00:04:49.910> remember

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
you do at this point because remember

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.900 
you do at this point because remember
we're<00:04:50.539> ready<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:51.080> render<00:04:51.560> out<00:04:51.800> of<00:04:52.039> Maxwell

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
we're ready to render out of Maxwell

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.700 
we're ready to render out of Maxwell
completely<00:04:53.389> so<00:04:53.870> come<00:04:54.020> over<00:04:54.110> here<00:04:54.350> to<00:04:54.410> project

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
completely so come over here to project

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.879 
completely so come over here to project
and<00:04:55.250> say<00:04:55.820> save<00:04:56.330> project<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.380> just<00:04:57.530> name<00:04:57.860> it

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
and say save project and just name it

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.250 
and say save project and just name it
something<00:04:58.340> like<00:04:58.370> test<00:04:59.150> one<00:04:59.360> now<00:04:59.870> this<00:05:00.110> won't

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
something like test one now this won't

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.469 
something like test one now this won't
be<00:05:00.470> an<00:05:00.590> EXR<00:05:01.010> this<00:05:01.160> will<00:05:01.280> be<00:05:01.370> an<00:05:01.460> HDI<00:05:01.940> file<00:05:02.300> which

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
be an EXR this will be an HDI file which

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.600 
be an EXR this will be an HDI file which
is<00:05:02.630> basically<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.320> setup<00:05:03.560> for<00:05:04.070> working<00:05:04.490> with

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
is basically the setup for working with

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.430 
is basically the setup for working with
in<00:05:04.760> this<00:05:04.880> live<00:05:05.240> dialog<00:05:05.810> so<00:05:05.990> I'm<00:05:06.169> going<00:05:06.289> to<00:05:06.320> hit

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
in this live dialog so I'm going to hit

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.860 
in this live dialog so I'm going to hit
save<00:05:06.740> and<00:05:07.070> then<00:05:07.100> I<00:05:07.910> come<00:05:08.030> over<00:05:08.120> here<00:05:08.270> a<00:05:08.330> project

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
save and then I come over here a project

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.090 
save and then I come over here a project
and<00:05:09.020> I'm<00:05:09.080> just<00:05:09.110> like<00:05:09.289> clear<00:05:09.620> lighting<00:05:09.979> and

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
and I'm just like clear lighting and

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.170 
and I'm just like clear lighting and
that's<00:05:10.220> basically<00:05:10.490> going<00:05:10.669> to<00:05:10.729> bring<00:05:10.910> us<00:05:11.030> back

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
that's basically going to bring us back

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.750 
that's basically going to bring us back
to<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.389> blank<00:05:11.810> canvas<00:05:12.410> now<00:05:12.650> what's<00:05:13.580> going<00:05:13.729> to

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
to a blank canvas now what's going to

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.460 
to a blank canvas now what's going to
happen<00:05:14.120> is<00:05:14.240> you'll<00:05:14.389> also<00:05:14.600> notice<00:05:15.050> if<00:05:15.229> we<00:05:15.320> come

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
happen is you'll also notice if we come

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.290 
happen is you'll also notice if we come
back<00:05:15.560> over<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:15.889> environment<00:05:16.460> settings<00:05:16.729> that

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
back over to environment settings that

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.390 
back over to environment settings that
these<00:05:17.510> have<00:05:17.690> all<00:05:17.810> changed<00:05:18.169> over<00:05:18.380> to<00:05:18.500> HDR<00:05:19.039> image

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
these have all changed over to HDR image

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.010 
these have all changed over to HDR image
see<00:05:19.789> they're<00:05:19.940> all<00:05:20.060> HDR<00:05:20.539> image<00:05:20.750> they're<00:05:20.870> not

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
see they're all HDR image they're not

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.800 
see they're all HDR image they're not
HDR<00:05:21.530> lights<00:05:21.919> to<00:05:22.160> do<00:05:22.310> any<00:05:22.520> longer<00:05:22.789> and<00:05:23.030> they're

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
HDR lights to do any longer and they're

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.740 
HDR lights to do any longer and they're
listing<00:05:24.199> test<00:05:24.500> one<00:05:24.889> EXR<00:05:25.669> as<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:26.330> file<00:05:26.539> that

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
listing test one EXR as the file that

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.790 
listing test one EXR as the file that
they're<00:05:26.900> getting<00:05:27.110> their<00:05:27.229> information<00:05:27.259> from

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
they're getting their information from

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.249 
they're getting their information from
if<00:05:27.979> that's<00:05:28.580> not<00:05:28.759> happening<00:05:28.820> on<00:05:29.449> yours<00:05:29.900> then

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
if that's not happening on yours then

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:32.650 
if that's not happening on yours then
it's<00:05:30.410> not<00:05:30.530> working<00:05:30.949> properly<00:05:31.360> but<00:05:32.360> now<00:05:32.479> that

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
it's not working properly but now that

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.960 
it's not working properly but now that
we<00:05:32.750> have<00:05:32.780> that<00:05:33.229> information<00:05:33.349> I<00:05:33.919> can<00:05:34.430> stop<00:05:34.699> fire

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
we have that information I can stop fire

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.460 
we have that information I can stop fire
because<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.389> don't<00:05:35.570> need<00:05:35.690> fire<00:05:35.900> rendering<00:05:36.349> any

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
because I don't need fire rendering any

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.379 
because I don't need fire rendering any
longer<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:36.949> I<00:05:37.400> can<00:05:37.430> go<00:05:37.580> ahead<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:37.880> hit<00:05:38.060> render

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
longer and I can go ahead and hit render

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.210 
longer and I can go ahead and hit render
now<00:05:38.780> the<00:05:39.229> thing<00:05:39.410> is<00:05:39.440> it's<00:05:39.650> going<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:39.800> ask<00:05:39.979> me<00:05:40.130> to

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
now the thing is it's going to ask me to

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.210 
now the thing is it's going to ask me to
re<00:05:40.520> render<00:05:40.820> that<00:05:41.270> generate<00:05:42.050> HDR<00:05:42.560> image<00:05:42.830> dialog

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
re render that generate HDR image dialog

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.730 
re render that generate HDR image dialog
will<00:05:43.400> pop<00:05:43.430> up<00:05:43.610> but<00:05:44.599> we<00:05:45.260> don't<00:05:45.440> need<00:05:45.530> to<00:05:45.590> re

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
will pop up but we don't need to re

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.930 
will pop up but we don't need to re
render<00:05:45.919> because<00:05:46.159> there's<00:05:46.430> nothing<00:05:46.729> on<00:05:46.849> the

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
render because there's nothing on the

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.189 
render because there's nothing on the
canvas<00:05:47.120> remember<00:05:47.539> we<00:05:47.630> cleared<00:05:47.900> it<00:05:47.990> so<00:05:48.110> you

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
canvas remember we cleared it so you

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.860 
canvas remember we cleared it so you
just<00:05:48.229> hit<00:05:48.440> cancel<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:49.300> what<00:05:50.300> will<00:05:50.419> happen<00:05:50.510> is

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
just hit cancel and what will happen is

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.529 
just hit cancel and what will happen is
it<00:05:51.020> will<00:05:51.110> pull<00:05:51.680> up<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:52.010> proper<00:05:52.550> EXR<00:05:53.120> file<00:05:53.330> that

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
it will pull up the proper EXR file that

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.300 
it will pull up the proper EXR file that
we're<00:05:53.659> looking<00:05:53.870> for<00:05:54.289> when<00:05:54.560> it<00:05:54.680> comes<00:05:54.830> time<00:05:55.250> to

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
we're looking for when it comes time to

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.159 
we're looking for when it comes time to

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
nice fast renders and we have this very

nice fast renders and we have this very
flexible<00:06:12.650> lighting<00:06:13.610> setup<00:06:14.210> but<00:06:14.960> again<00:06:15.289> if<00:06:15.409> you

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
flexible lighting setup but again if you
