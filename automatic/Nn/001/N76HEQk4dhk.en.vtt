that happens even with fine hair it's

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.229 
that happens even with fine hair it's
not<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.620> thick<00:00:34.890> hair<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.340> if<00:00:35.850> you're<00:00:36.000> working

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
not just thick hair is if you're working

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.420 
not just thick hair is if you're working
from<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.690> side<00:00:36.930> part<00:00:37.350> there's<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.130> kind<00:00:38.309> of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
from a side part there's this kind of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
from a side part there's this kind of
chicken<00:00:38.850> or<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.000> egg<00:00:39.270> kind<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.780> conversation

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
chicken or the egg kind of conversation

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.099 
chicken or the egg kind of conversation
that<00:00:40.530> has<00:00:40.770> always<00:00:40.980> gone<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.429> in<00:00:41.670> hairdressing

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
that has always gone on in hairdressing

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.470 
that has always gone on in hairdressing
do<00:00:43.109> you<00:00:43.199> balance<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.980> layers<00:00:44.219> side<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.210> side

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
do you balance the layers side to side

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.049 
do you balance the layers side to side
and<00:00:45.780> allow<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:47.010> little<00:00:47.190> shorter<00:00:47.670> layer<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and allow for a little shorter layer to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.540 
and allow for a little shorter layer to
sit<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.480> your<00:00:48.870> heavy<00:00:49.109> side<00:00:49.500> or<00:00:50.179> do<00:00:51.179> you<00:00:51.269> detach

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
sit on your heavy side or do you detach

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.849 
sit on your heavy side or do you detach
longer<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.359> side<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.230> when<00:00:55.379> they<00:00:55.499> fall

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
longer on this side so when they fall

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.599 
longer on this side so when they fall
they<00:00:56.460> fall<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.850> an<00:00:57.149> even<00:00:57.539> point<00:00:57.949> now<00:00:58.949> here's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
they fall to an even point now here's

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.369 
they fall to an even point now here's
kind<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> the<00:00:59.999> negatives<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.629> positives<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
kind of the negatives and positives to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.399 
kind of the negatives and positives to
both<00:01:01.589> approaches<00:01:02.659> let's<00:01:03.659> say<00:01:03.839> we<00:01:03.989> go<00:01:04.110> from<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
both approaches let's say we go from a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.250 
both approaches let's say we go from a
side<00:01:04.620> part<00:01:04.980> and<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:06.060> detach<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:07.110> go<00:01:07.230> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
side part and we detach it we go a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.830 
side part and we detach it we go a
little<00:01:07.440> shorter<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:08.940> go<00:01:09.060> longer<00:01:09.450> on

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
little shorter here and we go longer on

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.960 
little shorter here and we go longer on
this<00:01:10.409> side<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.830> part<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> heavy<00:01:11.520> side<00:01:11.820> of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
this side of the part the heavy side of

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.350 
this side of the part the heavy side of
the<00:01:12.030> part<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.480> this<00:01:13.259> Falls<00:01:14.090> let's<00:01:15.090> say<00:01:15.240> it

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
the part as this Falls let's say it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.620 
the part as this Falls let's say it
falls<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:16.079> and<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.829> Falls<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.369> here<00:01:17.729> now

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
falls to here and this Falls to here now

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.030 
falls to here and this Falls to here now
we<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.899> an<00:01:19.020> even<00:01:19.530> point<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:21.259> origination<00:01:22.259> for

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
we have an even point of origination for

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.209 
we have an even point of origination for
those<00:01:23.610> layers<00:01:23.960> but<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.350> also<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.189> a

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
those layers but what we also have is a

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.789 
those layers but what we also have is a
little<00:01:26.610> heaviness<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.780> here<00:01:28.290> which

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
little heaviness right here which

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.190 
little heaviness right here which
usually<00:01:29.369> honestly<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:30.450> end<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.719> coming<00:01:31.170> back

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
usually honestly we end up coming back

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
usually honestly we end up coming back
in<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.770> taking<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.130> lot<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.460> density<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
in and taking a lot of that density and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.499 
in and taking a lot of that density and
weight<00:01:33.180> out<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:35.360> occasionally<00:01:36.360> you're

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
weight out of so occasionally you're

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.719 
weight out of so occasionally you're
going<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> guest<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.799> specifically

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
going to have a guest that specifically

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.450 
going to have a guest that specifically
wants<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.570> though<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
wants that though I know I do I have a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.160 
wants that though I know I do I have a
few<00:01:41.759> ladies<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.299> chair<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.049> they

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
few ladies in my chair that they

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.779 
few ladies in my chair that they
specifically<00:01:43.829> want<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> see<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.640> those

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
specifically want to see that those

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.910 
specifically want to see that those
layers<00:01:45.060> start<00:01:45.539> exactly<00:01:45.990> at<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.320> same<00:01:46.500> point

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
layers start exactly at the same point

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.149 
layers start exactly at the same point
so<00:01:47.579> part<00:01:47.789> of<00:01:47.820> its<00:01:47.969> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.210> client<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
so part of its going to be client and

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.580 
so part of its going to be client and
what<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.430> want<00:01:50.729> from<00:01:50.939> their<00:01:51.149> hair<00:01:51.530> now<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
what they want from their hair now the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.980 
what they want from their hair now the
other<00:01:52.890> direction<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.789> to<00:01:54.390> cut<00:01:54.630> your<00:01:54.780> layers

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
other direction is to cut your layers

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.770 
other direction is to cut your layers
balanced<00:01:55.859> across<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> top<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.630> they're

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
balanced across the top so if they're

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.050 
balanced across the top so if they're
balanced<00:01:58.500> what's<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.859> to<00:01:58.890> happen<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.520> this

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
balanced what's going to happen is this

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.179 
balanced what's going to happen is this
one's<00:02:00.329> going<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.539> fall<00:02:00.810> higher<00:02:01.109> and<00:02:01.530> this

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
one's going to fall higher and this

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.539 
one's going to fall higher and this
one's<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.609> fall<00:02:02.880> lower<00:02:03.289> so<00:02:04.549> visually

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
one's going to fall lower so visually

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.870 
one's going to fall lower so visually
where<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.570> layer<00:02:06.840> originates<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.130> not<00:02:08.640> going

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
where the layer originates is not going

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.850 
where the layer originates is not going
to<00:02:08.970> be<00:02:09.060> balanced<00:02:09.509> what<00:02:10.140> will<00:02:10.350> be<00:02:10.500> more

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
to be balanced what will be more

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.890 
to be balanced what will be more
balanced<00:02:11.490> though<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.630> weight

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
balanced though is the weight

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.020 
balanced though is the weight
distribution<00:02:13.380> because<00:02:13.980> more<00:02:14.310> layers<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.880> this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
distribution because more layers on this

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.630 
distribution because more layers on this
side<00:02:15.360> means<00:02:16.080> more<00:02:16.470> leonis<00:02:17.190> through<00:02:17.520> this

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
side means more leonis through this

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.910 
side means more leonis through this
corner<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.720> see<00:02:18.930> where<00:02:19.050> we're<00:02:19.230> at<00:02:19.350> right<00:02:19.380> I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
corner you see where we're at right I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.430 
corner you see where we're at right I
know<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.850> do

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
know you do

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.730 
know you do
so<00:02:22.710> it's<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.550> tough<00:02:23.820> question<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.390> answer<00:02:24.740> which

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
so it's a tough question to answer which

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.160 
so it's a tough question to answer which
one<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.190> should<00:02:26.220> do<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:27.480> thicker<00:02:27.840> hair

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
one you should do and on thicker hair

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.230 
one you should do and on thicker hair
especially<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.490> do<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.820> detachment

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
especially if you do that detachment

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.180 
especially if you do that detachment
you're<00:02:31.020> just<00:02:31.260> going<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.710> realize

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
you're just going to have to realize

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.160 
you're just going to have to realize
that<00:02:32.610> there's<00:02:33.330> going<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.630> lot<00:02:33.900> more

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
that there's going to be a lot more

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.290 
that there's going to be a lot more
weight<00:02:34.380> sitting<00:02:34.740> on<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:34.980> side<00:02:35.280> than<00:02:36.000> if<00:02:36.150> you

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
weight sitting on this side than if you

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.680 
weight sitting on this side than if you
had<00:02:36.390> done<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.810> balanced<00:02:37.440> layer<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.760> here's<00:02:39.630> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
had done the balanced layer so here's a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.620 
had done the balanced layer so here's a
suggestion<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> great<00:02:41.520> conversation<00:02:41.850> a
