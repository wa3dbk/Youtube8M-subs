than is asked of you this journey is
what<00:04:01.769> gives<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.280> metabolic<00:04:03.409> equilibrium

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
what gives you the metabolic equilibrium

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.030 
what gives you the metabolic equilibrium
to<00:04:05.459> run<00:04:06.090> faster<00:04:06.659> and<00:04:06.930> have<00:04:07.319> better<00:04:07.560> run<00:04:07.919> the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
to run faster and have better run the

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.280 
to run faster and have better run the
economy<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:09.030> that's<00:04:09.840> what<00:04:09.989> you're<00:04:10.139> going

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
economy and that's what you're going

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.800 
economy and that's what you're going
through<00:04:10.409> right<00:04:10.590> now<00:04:10.979> and<00:04:11.340> your<00:04:11.879> max<00:04:12.090> vo2<00:04:12.540> up<00:04:12.659> to

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
through right now and your max vo2 up to

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.710 
through right now and your max vo2 up to
take<00:04:12.989> workouts<00:04:13.729> you<00:04:14.729> know<00:04:14.909> I'm<00:04:15.659> a

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
take workouts you know I'm a

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.270 
take workouts you know I'm a
physiologist<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.949> I<00:04:17.940> know<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.389> there<00:04:18.630> is<00:04:18.810> a

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
physiologist and I know that there is a

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.430 
physiologist and I know that there is a
cardiac<00:04:20.280> threshold<00:04:21.000> but<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:21.900> also<00:04:22.019> think<00:04:22.349> that

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
cardiac threshold but I also think that

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.279 
cardiac threshold but I also think that
there's<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.800> respiratory<00:04:23.190> threshold<00:04:24.289> when

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
there's a respiratory threshold when

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.500 
there's a respiratory threshold when
you're<00:04:25.440> running<00:04:25.830> out<00:04:25.979> there<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:27.180> run<00:04:27.389> your

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
you're running out there you run your

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.610 
you're running out there you run your
two<00:04:27.690> miles<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.229> you<00:04:28.349> go

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
two miles and you go

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.590 
two miles and you go
can<00:04:28.830> you<00:04:29.160> repeat<00:04:29.490> miles<00:04:29.760> that's<00:04:30.449> a

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
can you repeat miles that's a

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.230 
can you repeat miles that's a
respiratory<00:04:30.990> threshold<00:04:31.889> you<00:04:32.610> increase<00:04:33.090> that

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
respiratory threshold you increase that

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.060 
respiratory threshold you increase that
level<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.630> little<00:04:33.840> bit<00:04:33.930> more<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.650> believe<00:04:34.949> me

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
level a little bit more and believe me

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.370 
level a little bit more and believe me
you'll<00:04:35.490> start<00:04:35.760> getting<00:04:35.880> PRS<00:04:36.660> but<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.139> got<00:04:37.290> to

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
you'll start getting PRS but you got to

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.930 
you'll start getting PRS but you got to
put<00:04:37.560> out<00:04:37.710> but<00:04:38.370> you<00:04:38.490> got<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.699> put<00:04:38.850> out

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
put out but you got to put out
