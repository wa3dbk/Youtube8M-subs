00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.780
 Serbian all web icicles 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.490
 Arctic welcome today in this video 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.500
 special to thank you for the 4 thousand 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.410
 members we are here in the company of 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.360
 matteo fire boys and we're here together 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.830
 because exactly as you read from the title 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.160
 We have finally released the UGL 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.720
 schult 2.0.0 has also been released 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.040
 within this version are 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.350
 Several new things have been added 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.880
 really important that now will tell you me 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.530
 matteo will say we added the textures 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.410
 of all those new blocks that they are 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.120
 have been included in 1.7 and we have 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.790
 modified many of the textures 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.770
 previous but leaving the textures that 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.880
 let's say they had characterized the first 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.530
 version of the glaciar pac 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.260
 the most important thing was the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.229
 conversion by many items that 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.260
 they are used for the 128 x combat 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.150
 or in hd in such a way as to render more 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.060
 defined the whole instrument in question 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.520
 point to make it more beautiful 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.410
 in use also and when we aim 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.870
 with the bow we still left the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.540
 loading of the arc precisely for per 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.700
 who plays the pd fico is favored is 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.000
 also when we launched the arrow 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.000
 we can see the cia that it 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.610
 release that this time unlike 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.590
 of the old version was 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.450
 recolored in a brighter blue 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.040
 the strong point of this texture made 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.500
 which can be used both by 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.690
 players who practice ppp is ad 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.760
 other players who develop them 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.160
 started from on minecraft devoting himself 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.190
 in fact we only have to design 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.180
 modernized most of the blocks 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.930
 used by builders such as 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.880
 the quartz the coop lessor nelson bric e 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.739
 the last clay I wanted to give you 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.080
 information precisely concerning the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.900
 texture that is optimized for the 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.160
 1.7 point 4, however, is backwards compatible either 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.940
 with other versions of minecraft 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.560
 or 1.6.4 and so on 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.260
 it is also this full of the best 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.989
 textures designed for those who use shaders 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.830
 fashions and therefore I did not stay on the banks 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.180
 nothing else 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.769
 download it and let me know 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.310
 simply in the comments what it is 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.780
 think 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.519
 ok guys we forgot to tell you 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.230
 that the link and description let us know 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.820
 what do you think below with a 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.410
 commentary on some styles 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.940
 mulch bug we can alternate it in 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.380
 any time so you can do 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.120
 all in front 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.120
 when I was there at the studio
