00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
of feathery coating so I began to look

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.010 
of feathery coating so I began to look

started<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.039> assemble<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.459> reference<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
started to assemble this reference to

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.720 
started to assemble this reference to
get<00:02:09.300> an<00:02:09.390> idea<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.660> how<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.110> might<00:02:10.440> skin<00:02:11.280> this

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
get an idea of how we might skin this

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.320 
get an idea of how we might skin this
new<00:02:11.910> fossil<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.420> Paul<00:02:12.720> found<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.700> also

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
new fossil that Paul found and and also

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.760 
new fossil that Paul found and and also
I<00:02:15.360> did<00:02:15.569> some<00:02:15.750> sketches<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:16.470> show<00:02:16.650> them

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
I did some sketches just to show them

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.770 
I did some sketches just to show them
some<00:02:16.920> some<00:02:17.459> color<00:02:17.700> ideas<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.300> kind<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.599> see

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
some some color ideas to kind of see

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.930 
some some color ideas to kind of see
what<00:02:19.110> might<00:02:19.590> be<00:02:19.709> interesting<00:02:19.920> visually<00:02:20.730> for

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
what might be interesting visually for

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.360 
what might be interesting visually for
this<00:02:21.060> animal<00:02:21.420> as<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.200> reconstructed<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.190> gave

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
this animal as I reconstructed it I gave

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.510 
this animal as I reconstructed it I gave
it<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.580> bright<00:02:23.819> blue<00:02:24.500> bottle<00:02:25.500> or<00:02:25.709> or<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.160> dewlap

under<00:02:26.819> its<00:02:26.940> throat<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.989> is<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> feature

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
under its throat and this is a feature

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.800 
under its throat and this is a feature
that<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.950> do<00:02:29.250> see<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.550> many<00:02:30.060> modern<00:02:30.360> animals

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
that you do see in many modern animals

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.780 
that you do see in many modern animals
when<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.050> think<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.410> animal<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.519> a<00:02:32.550> lizard

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
when you think of animal like a lizard

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.970 
when you think of animal like a lizard
like<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> chameleon<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.840> has<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> display

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980

dewlap<00:02:35.760> which<00:02:36.629> is<00:02:36.780> bright<00:02:36.959> red<00:02:37.230> many<00:02:37.920> birds

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
dewlap which is bright red many birds

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.580 
dewlap which is bright red many birds
also<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.870> different<00:02:39.870> kinds<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.140> displays

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
also have different kinds of displays

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.589 
also have different kinds of displays
structures<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.190> waddles<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.150> found<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.540> a

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
structures and waddles and I found in a

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.589 
structures and waddles and I found in a
number<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.870> them<00:02:43.080> from<00:02:43.739> turkeys<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.580> pheasants

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
number of them from turkeys to pheasants

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.410 
number of them from turkeys to pheasants
and<00:02:45.810> even<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.590> large<00:02:47.280> bird<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.670> cassowary<00:02:48.060> that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
and even the large bird a cassowary that

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.690 
and even the large bird a cassowary that
have<00:02:48.569> bright<00:02:48.900> blue<00:02:48.950> skin<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.160> might<00:02:50.310> serve

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
have bright blue skin that might serve

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.190 
have bright blue skin that might serve
as<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:50.879> visual<00:02:51.239> display<00:02:51.390> structure<00:02:52.019> and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
as a visual display structure and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.040 
as a visual display structure and
typically<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:54.060> paleo<00:02:54.720> art<00:02:54.900> the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
typically the the paleo art the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.470 
typically the the paleo art the
reconstructions<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.830> do<00:02:55.950> are<00:02:56.670> sculptural

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
reconstructions that I do are sculptural

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.250 
reconstructions that I do are sculptural
and<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.590> typically<00:02:59.250> start<00:02:59.400> with<00:02:59.640> clay<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.870> I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
and so I typically start with clay and I

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.380 
and so I typically start with clay and I
use<00:03:01.440> an<00:03:01.709> oil-based<00:03:02.340> clay<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.970> doesn't<00:03:03.209> dry

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
use an oil-based clay that doesn't dry

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.390 
use an oil-based clay that doesn't dry
out<00:03:03.420> we'll<00:03:03.690> use<00:03:03.840> various<00:03:04.500> casting<00:03:04.980> residents

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
out we'll use various casting residents

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.160 
out we'll use various casting residents
plastic<00:03:05.879> resins<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.420> make<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.629> lightweight

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
plastic resins to make a lightweight

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.729 
plastic resins to make a lightweight
replica<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.459> clay<00:03:08.640> sculpture<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.739> to

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
replica of the clay sculpture and to

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.350 
replica of the clay sculpture and to
paint<00:03:10.950> those<00:03:11.129> to<00:03:11.370> make<00:03:11.489> them<00:03:11.640> look<00:03:11.760> lifelike

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
paint those to make them look lifelike

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.640 
paint those to make them look lifelike
and<00:03:12.599> alive<00:03:12.870> I'll<00:03:13.409> use<00:03:13.800> acrylic<00:03:14.670> paint<00:03:14.940> and

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
and alive I'll use acrylic paint and

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.770 
and alive I'll use acrylic paint and
glass<00:03:16.650> eyes<00:03:16.890> from<00:03:17.280> taxidermy<00:03:17.940> suppliers<00:03:18.330> the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
glass eyes from taxidermy suppliers the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.420 
glass eyes from taxidermy suppliers the
the<00:03:19.080> color<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.560> eyes<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.129> color<00:03:20.310> of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
the color of the eyes and the color of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.949 
the color of the eyes and the color of
the<00:03:20.519> paint<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.909> we<00:03:21.000> apply<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.330> is

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
the paint that we apply is is

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.050 
the paint that we apply is is
speculative<00:03:22.500> it's<00:03:22.890> we're<00:03:23.430> always<00:03:23.550> guessing

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
speculative it's we're always guessing

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.289 
speculative it's we're always guessing
but<00:03:24.769> we're<00:03:25.769> basing<00:03:26.129> it<00:03:26.220> on<00:03:26.340> animals<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.150> we

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
but we're basing it on animals that we

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.880 
but we're basing it on animals that we
see<00:03:27.450> today<00:03:27.569> so<00:03:27.750> it's<00:03:28.080> it's<00:03:28.379> at<00:03:28.530> least<00:03:28.650> within

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
see today so it's it's at least within
