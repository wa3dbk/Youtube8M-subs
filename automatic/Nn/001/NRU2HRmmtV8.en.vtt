three things for the motor to run really
for<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.279> takes<00:00:29.580> air<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.449> air<00:00:30.630> comes<00:00:31.019> in

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
for one is it takes air the air comes in

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.350 
for one is it takes air the air comes in
through<00:00:31.470> here<00:00:32.040> goes<00:00:32.640> through<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.030> air

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
through here goes through the air

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.270 
through here goes through the air
cleaner<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.590> goes<00:00:34.800> through<00:00:34.829> these

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
cleaner and then goes through these

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.520 
cleaner and then goes through these
tubes<00:00:35.809> into<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.579> throttle<00:00:38.579> body<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.350> is
