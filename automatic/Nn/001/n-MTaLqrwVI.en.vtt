00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.870
 Hi girls 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.929
 today I come with a video 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.120
 makeup for hired maintenance 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.860
 the day was so suddenly I told myself 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.859
 Come on, I'm going to film them and that's 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.590
 same time one stone two shots 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.789
 that's how I'll introduce myself 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.109
 something relatively unobtrusive 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.800
 I put on the eyelid 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.820
 the flow of the fifteenth of the fifteenth 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.469
 anniversary of urban decay I have 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.170
 put 10 fars I do not know how she 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.510
 says of this palette book of shadows 4 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.390
 after I made the banana with the naked 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.550
 an elana qe2 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.110
 So here I invite you if you 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.110
 interested continued to follow 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.850
 after putting the bases etc 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.140
 so I go with a little point of his 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.270
 places on the eyelid 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.460
 this color she's slightly fishing this 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:27.860
 I wanted it was the desired effect 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:29.030
 so I called him everywhere with the same 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.340
 brush that I like very little 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.740
 cleaned on paper I support it I 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.640
 the bottom on the pech and I go back 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.030
 Well, that's what it gives to 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:48.770
 look not an effect but it brings 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:51.650
 a light touch to break on the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.750
 banana i apply to get tired on mate who 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.990
 is a team that is very close to my 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.990
 complexion 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.790
 with a pencil brush I apply nautiz 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.740
 it's a color it's still a brown 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.080
 but which slightly when you can 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.610
 see by plum but a little violated a little 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.520
 wet 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.540
 I know to darken but still dark 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.010
 slightly because a make-up 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.989
 maintenance is something 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.030
 discreet that must be done so here we go 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.350
 I apply with his brush because he 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.620
 is relatively accurate while 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.620
 blurring 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.379
 I also apply it below 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.989
 gesture one can for a melt the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.879
 colors between them and below it's 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.500
 to remove the excess of marauders who 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.500
 would bequeath a little your good 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.709
 so an iridescent white his arcade 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.349
 eyebrow to enlarge also the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:11.560
 look we mix the colors between 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.560
 they 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.260
 we are in maintenance mode so in 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.590
 the mucosa 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.030
 we will apply apply a Belgian is 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.989
 certainly not black the north of 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.049
 healer or more that narrows the the the 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.420
 black just to make the facts and 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:37.310
 lennar but discreet you will see 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.430
 it's rather discreet I'm going to turn it off 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.470
 with this small beveled brush you 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.390
 go see that I turn frank this 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.670
 man there I let you down in this 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.769
 sense there I go back to his body's 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.390
 the other side for it is extended from 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.390
 the other side but it's not rocket science 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.090
 I knew the remains from above underneath 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.090
 story of a little bit 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.819
 he 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.819
 he 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.480
 we can stop at this stage but 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:35.620
 I decided to go for it by putting double 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:38.650
 agree on it and the final number 48 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.580
 from home make up for ever to do the 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:53.440
 lip contour 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:54.880
 I placed the angel inside and 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.760
 here is the final look 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.200
 I hope you enjoyed this tutorial 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.540

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.590
 there in a few hours to my 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.570
