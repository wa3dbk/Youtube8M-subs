00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.430
 and it's everybody 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.439
 so today video on gta 5 in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.760
 this video we will show you some 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.269
 little hiding places to find people 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.369
 online mode so the first broken two 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.680
 are right here right next to a 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.640
 hairdresser but it's not otherwise it's not 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.960
 dancing right next door 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.020
 not very nice apartment at 4.5 will not beat me 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.610
 very far in addition here there are quite a few 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.120
 people who are killing each other here you 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.930
 upset 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.980
 you can troll them and 1 then you 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.530
 show how to get in 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.260
 you just go here and skip a 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.570
 done is automatically in you 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.969
 can still jumped cold and you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.289
 show that one can well shot at 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.109
 the outside you see and you can 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.830
 also go there latos right in front the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.790
 concrete here is also these fossat games 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.650
 best location 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.380
 after here come here you kill them 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.450
 you did not see the police no longer 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.580
 you do not see it's really a good 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.470
 spot so everything went to second to 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.290
 the second hiding place then the second 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.790
 If this is is right here is 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.259
 here next to the three houses 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.259
 the cottages on the left is in store 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.189
 that's it then either you go up by the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.579
 it's either it's easier 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.299
 this is how simple it is 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.880
 did we come across by chance but the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.770
 only problem is that if we look 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.930
 pulls it goes through dad against the 1st 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.939
 may have gone past that one what's a 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.920
 problem a little but good for you 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.299
 hide if you're fed up that the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.340
 people kill you it's a good question 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.799
 yeah but it's weird because 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.720
 once we say is this really before yeah 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.310
 it goes and I do not know or if they have 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.750
 not sure I know what but well 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.870
 anyway it's a good hiding place for 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.670
 that you are fed up with having killed you 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.130
 so we end up for role the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.340
 third cache is then the third 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.950
 class and is right here next to the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.709
 ls custom there here and next to the store 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.220
 of arms as good there it's right here 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:34.340
 so for those there you have to have a 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.910
 vehicle and push that trash to the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.209
 to paste the deck against you 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.590
 sticks well when you go out go out 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.530
 of the vehicle and you do like us 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.549
 how are we going to do it 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.870
 then you go there if you stick to it 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.620
 be you sticks well and you jump to 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.140
 after a while it's going to go 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.200
 normally have to try to find the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.530
 good point here but this spot is 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.799
 really great because it's all 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.739
 looked at his ussel screw and savvis everywhere 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.230
 everything here you can aim while here 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.269
 it's a road in fact it's really 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.889
 super cons we must not go too much 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.470
 away because otherwise you fell 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.150
 here was a lot there was here one 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.549
 not fall but if we go further to 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.100
 there we will fall and so that's the 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.799
 only way out i think look 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.690
 we run down and there we fall and 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.079
 flying and after savoring appalled just at 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.950
 side 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:33.620
 we will now go fourth cache 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:38.170
 is then the fourth cassette found 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.760
 right here she's not very far from 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.109
 the treasure airport in fact it's in 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.380
 store you are going to see it's right at 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.840
 side 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.569
 it's here it's in a house actually 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.060
 we will show you how to do so 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:55.150
 first of all you have to take 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.150
 a soul is exposed well the glass 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:02.239
 really all fart even the youngest ones 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.480
 tips that remains that bothers you and that has 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.590
 just a window is the one on the right 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.819
 after you put your car like this 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.910
 I hope it's enough that she is 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:18.500
 pretty big sail at will on your 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.130
 car and you and you go up here 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.109
 here 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.090
 and there you go up here and there you are 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.520
 in the house it's not really a 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.889
 however to civilize but it can be 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.110
 a good hiding place one because we see 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.660
 not really at first me it can be 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.240
 a good hiding place for mamors 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.100
 or with your friends you get that 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.110
 can be not bad look you can 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.850
 even fired for example there are people here 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.650
 you shoot it can be really good 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.040
 cut to be like that if you 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.919
 do not know it's good I think it's good 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.419
 will now move to fifth 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:56.240
 last at the adar hiding then the end 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:01.880
 that even break is right here then 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:04.880
 next to the clothes shop here these voices 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.450
 there you see the very gray it's just at 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.150
 his right 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.190
 here she saw well normally 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.990
 so what are you there you just have to 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.490
 go 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.550
 it's super simple there is no manipulation 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.979
 you go that and semur essence 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.010
 piercing this is it is this is 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:24.039
 what on the other hand as the second 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.970
 hiding does not want to shoot outside 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.120
 it was a pity 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.889
 watch it shoot does not cross but 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.780
 on the other hand it can be great hiding 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.389
 if you're fed up with being killed or 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.039
 if the police are looking for you 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:42.289
 do not know where to go or be like that 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:44.570
 it's really great we have when 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:47.780
 even left but still show you 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:51.620
 a small bonus for the end of bonuses 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:54.550
 I hope you'll like it then for 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.310
 the bonus is in a party building 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.950
 in the building 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.470
 ja it's a bit more complicated when 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.450
 even you see her head she's a little 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.090
 weird do not know if you see well I 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.840
 think not deserve it's going to be hard but I 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:15.570
 it's actually mining 3d 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:20.340
 from them windows then you see they 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:22.110
 are going there she is a plus 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.660
 high plus two windsurfing makes there 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.670
 I would have little ones I do not know 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:34.620
 how to say you're going to see her 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:36.540
 it is in the lacks of aaa and this to 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.030
 through this very well snipe you 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.580
 can have legion and where and how to 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.950
 the west it's true that it's not bad 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.200
 must aim well anyway after 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.760
 too far you can no longer target but 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.690
 when they are on the highway while 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:55.260
 like that it's not bad that even finds it 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:59.520

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:02.100
