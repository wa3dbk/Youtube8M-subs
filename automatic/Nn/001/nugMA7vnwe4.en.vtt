okay<00:00:04.560> we're<00:00:05.310> going<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.790> make<00:00:06.000> an<00:00:06.299> origami

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
okay we're going to make an origami

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.980 
okay we're going to make an origami
fighter<00:00:07.770> jet<00:00:08.160> Pet<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:09.120> can<00:00:09.330> fly

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
fighter jet Pet you can fly

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.039 
fighter jet Pet you can fly
so<00:00:10.530> first<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.519> take<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:12.090> fighter<00:00:12.420> jet<00:00:12.719> paper

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
so first you take a fighter jet paper

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.650 
so first you take a fighter jet paper
that<00:00:13.380> looks<00:00:13.590> like<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:15.210> turn<00:00:15.509> it

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
that looks like this and you turn it

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.230 
that looks like this and you turn it
over<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.740> word<00:00:16.920> top<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.640> facing<00:00:18.090> up

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
over so that the word top is facing up

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.330 
over so that the word top is facing up
and<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.660> pattern<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> bottom<00:00:19.770> so

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and the pattern is on the bottom so

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.279 
and the pattern is on the bottom so
first<00:00:20.580> we're<00:00:20.789> going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.090> take<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.449> full<00:00:21.630> in

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
first we're going to take it full in

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.340 
first we're going to take it full in
half<00:00:22.619> along<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.279> dotted<00:00:23.580> line<00:00:23.930> okay<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:24.960> we

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
half along this dotted line okay so we

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.220 
half along this dotted line okay so we
take<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:25.890> left<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:27.869> fold

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
take it from left to right and we fold

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.540 
take it from left to right and we fold
it<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.560> half<00:00:30.560> give<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.800> nice<00:00:32.009> crease<00:00:34.250> then<00:00:35.250> we

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
it in half give it a nice crease then we

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.470 
it in half give it a nice crease then we
open<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.030> back<00:00:36.180> up<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:37.640> then<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.760> take<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.239> two

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
open it back up and then we take the two

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.010 
open it back up and then we take the two
top<00:00:39.510> outer<00:00:40.379> edges<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.879> fold<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.480> into<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
top outer edges and we fold it into the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
top outer edges and we fold it into the
middle<00:00:44.030> along<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.090> dotted<00:00:45.510> line<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> we

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
middle along the dotted line so we

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.290 
middle along the dotted line so we
crease<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:50.370> take<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.789> top<00:00:51.059> edge

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
crease it here you take this top edge

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.380 
crease it here you take this top edge
and<00:00:51.329> fold<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.140> inwards<00:00:53.719> here<00:00:56.090> make<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> nice

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and fold it inwards here make a nice

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
and fold it inwards here make a nice
crease<00:00:59.180> then<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.510> fold<00:01:00.780> along<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.980> dotted

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
crease then we fold along this dotted

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.299 
crease then we fold along this dotted
line<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.960> take<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.320> outer<00:01:04.619> edge<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.159> we

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
line so we take this outer edge and we

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
line so we take this outer edge and we
fold<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.729> into<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.299> middle<00:01:06.810> along<00:01:07.260> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
fold it into the middle along that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.050 
fold it into the middle along that
dotted<00:01:07.950> line<00:01:09.799> get<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> nice<00:01:11.750> triangle<00:01:12.750> edge<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
dotted line get a nice triangle edge and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.969 
dotted line get a nice triangle edge and
then<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.270> dotted<00:01:15.900> line<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.380> take<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.770> outer

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
then this dotted line we take this outer

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.620 
then this dotted line we take this outer
edge<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.220> fold<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.729> into<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> middle

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.520 

triangle<00:01:26.630> shape<00:01:27.070> all<00:01:28.070> together<00:01:28.750> net<00:01:29.750> we<00:01:30.230> flip

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
triangle shape all together net we flip

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.060 
triangle shape all together net we flip
it<00:01:30.560> over<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:32.050> we<00:01:33.050> also<00:01:33.200> take<00:01:33.530> these<00:01:33.830> outer

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
it over and we also take these outer

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.870 
it over and we also take these outer
edges<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.700> fold<00:01:35.000> it<00:01:35.210> into<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.570> middle<00:01:35.800> so

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
edges and fold it into the middle so

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.520 
edges and fold it into the middle so
carefully<00:01:37.880> making<00:01:38.510> sure<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.960> keep<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.260> point

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
carefully making sure to keep the point

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.930 
carefully making sure to keep the point
at<00:01:40.190> this<00:01:40.490> end<00:01:40.790> very<00:01:41.210> pointy<00:01:41.780> we<00:01:42.650> fold<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.130> in

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.680 

and<00:01:46.940> crease<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.950> we<00:01:49.070> take<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.430> side<00:01:49.690> and

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
and crease it and we take the side and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.220 
and crease it and we take the side and
we<00:01:50.900> fold<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:52.040> in<00:01:52.190> towards<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.760> middle<00:01:56.230> okay

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
we fold it in towards the middle okay

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.010 
we fold it in towards the middle okay
now<00:01:58.070> our<00:01:58.100> jet<00:01:58.700> fighter<00:01:59.210> jet<00:01:59.540> is<00:01:59.660> almost

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
now our jet fighter jet is almost

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.130 
now our jet fighter jet is almost
finished<00:02:00.470> we<00:02:01.010> take<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:01.760> we<00:02:01.820> flip<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:02.960> over

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
finished we take it and we flip it over

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.990 
finished we take it and we flip it over
and<00:02:03.560> we<00:02:04.430> fold<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:05.030> in<00:02:05.330> half<00:02:05.979> like<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.040> then

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
and we fold it in half like this then

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000 
and we fold it in half like this then
you<00:02:08.479> take<00:02:08.690> your<00:02:08.869> hand<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.320> you<00:02:09.410> slip<00:02:09.710> it<00:02:09.860> into

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
you take your hand and you slip it into

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.290 
you take your hand and you slip it into
the<00:02:10.160> middle<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.810> take<00:02:12.110> out<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.920> sides

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
the middle and you take out the sides

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.560 
the middle and you take out the sides
and<00:02:14.650> your<00:02:15.650> fighter<00:02:15.950> jet<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:16.520> finished<00:02:17.240> and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
and your fighter jet is finished and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.700 
and your fighter jet is finished and
ready<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.260> fly<00:02:18.700> we
