your fill tank that way when the body is
on<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.330> can<00:03:25.480> pretty<00:03:25.750> much<00:03:25.840> just<00:03:26.080> reach<00:03:26.320> in

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
on you can pretty much just reach in

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.530 
on you can pretty much just reach in
through<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:26.860> hole<00:03:27.040> lift<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.880> up<00:03:28.030> with<00:03:28.270> ease

and refill you can do the same for your
body<00:03:32.350> clips<00:03:34.170> I'll<00:03:35.170> have<00:03:35.350> one<00:03:35.500> right<00:03:35.620> here<00:03:37.560> do

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
body clips I'll have one right here do

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.380 
body clips I'll have one right here do
that<00:03:38.740> for<00:03:38.920> all<00:03:39.040> four<00:03:39.340> if<00:03:39.580> you<00:03:39.880> look<00:03:40.030> over<00:03:40.180> here

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
that for all four if you look over here

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:48.000 
that for all four if you look over here
at<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.660> receiver<00:03:40.990> box<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:47.470> can<00:03:47.590> see<00:03:47.620> that

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
at the receiver box you can see that

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.470 
at the receiver box you can see that
these<00:03:48.130> are<00:03:48.280> smaller<00:03:48.610> I<00:03:48.730> made<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.150> couple<00:03:49.330> of

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
these are smaller I made it a couple of

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.060 
these are smaller I made it a couple of
smaller<00:03:49.780> ones<00:03:49.870> especially<00:03:50.320> this<00:03:50.680> one<00:03:50.860> it's

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
smaller ones especially this one it's

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.230 
smaller ones especially this one it's
hard<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.370> get<00:03:51.490> into<00:03:51.670> if<00:03:51.910> you're<00:03:52.060> going<00:03:52.150> to

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
hard to get into if you're going to

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.330 
hard to get into if you're going to
change<00:03:52.480> out<00:03:52.630> your<00:03:52.660> receiver<00:03:53.080> batteries<00:03:53.560> so

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
change out your receiver batteries so

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.300 
change out your receiver batteries so
it's<00:03:54.490> really<00:03:54.700> nice<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:55.420> have<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:56.160> grip<00:03:57.160> on

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
it's really nice to just have a grip on

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.150 
it's really nice to just have a grip on
your<00:03:57.520> clip<00:03:58.140> really<00:03:59.140> easy<00:03:59.350> to<00:03:59.530> pull<00:03:59.740> out<00:03:59.920> and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
your clip really easy to pull out and

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.460 
your clip really easy to pull out and
reinstall<00:04:00.810> all<00:04:01.810> right<00:04:01.960> so<00:04:02.080> that<00:04:02.200> pretty<00:04:02.350> much
