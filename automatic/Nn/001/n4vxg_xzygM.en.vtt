included in the kit as you can see so

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.680 
included in the kit as you can see so
you<00:02:10.160> will<00:02:10.310> need<00:02:10.460> to<00:02:10.580> connect<00:02:10.759> this<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.300> a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
you will need to connect this to a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.160 
you will need to connect this to a
standard<00:02:12.970> three-pin<00:02:13.970> mains<00:02:14.420> charger<00:02:14.990> and

then<00:02:15.770> there's<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.100> little<00:02:16.360> sort<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.420> getting

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
then there's a little sort of getting

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.390 
then there's a little sort of getting

back<00:02:28.370> cover<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.760> can<00:02:29.000> see<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.510> it's

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
back cover you can see that it's

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.699 
back cover you can see that it's
basically<00:02:30.680> identical<00:02:32.110> albeit<00:02:33.110> it's<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.500> little

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
basically identical albeit it's a little

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.040 
basically identical albeit it's a little
bit<00:02:33.830> thicker<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:34.459> we<00:02:34.580> pull<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:35.030> off<00:02:35.270> we

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
bit thicker so if we pull this off we

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.530 
bit thicker so if we pull this off we
can<00:02:36.200> see<00:02:36.410> how<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.709> differs<00:02:37.100> on<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.459> inside<00:02:37.880> so

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
can see how it differs on the inside so

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.000 
can see how it differs on the inside so
you<00:02:38.570> can<00:02:38.780> see<00:02:39.020> there<00:02:39.410> on<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.800> wireless

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010

terms of weight difference there's

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.110 
terms of weight difference there's
course<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.800> little<00:02:52.100> bit<00:02:52.280> but<00:02:52.430> it's<00:02:52.550> only<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.820> few

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
course a little bit but it's only a few

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.240 
course a little bit but it's only a few
grams<00:02:53.390> not<00:02:53.780> particularly<00:02:54.320> heavy<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:55.070> in

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
terms of thickness well you'll be hard

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.600 
terms of thickness well you'll be hard

pushed to really tell the difference of

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.550 
pushed to really tell the difference of
course<00:02:58.790> there<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.209> difference<00:02:59.720> but<00:03:00.350> you'd

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
course there is a difference but you'd

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.800 
course there is a difference but you'd
be<00:03:00.680> really<00:03:00.950> hard<00:03:01.190> pushed<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:01.700> actually<00:03:02.510> tell

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.110 
be really hard pushed to actually tell
that<00:03:02.989> difference<00:03:03.500> just<00:03:04.310> peel<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.670> cover<00:03:04.880> off

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
that difference just peel the cover off

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.600 
that difference just peel the cover off
there<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.770> other<00:03:06.890> thing<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.190> can<00:03:07.310> see<00:03:07.489> is

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
there the other thing you can see is

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.630 
there the other thing you can see is
actually<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.380> logo<00:03:09.380> on<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.620> back<00:03:09.770> on<00:03:10.340> the

actually the logo on the back on the
original<00:03:11.150> cover<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.170> bit<00:03:12.320> more<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.560> a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
original cover it's a bit more of a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.229 
original cover it's a bit more of a
shiny<00:03:13.549> silver<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.390> on<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:16.239> wireless

charging cover it's a duller to the grey
color<00:03:20.900> it's<00:03:21.110> just<00:03:21.140> printed<00:03:21.739> on<00:03:21.890> there<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:23.030> you

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
color it's just printed on there so you

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.940 
color it's just printed on there so you
don't<00:03:23.630> need<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.840> make<00:03:23.930> any<00:03:23.989> other<00:03:24.350> alterations

all<00:03:30.380> line<00:03:30.620> up<00:03:30.860> like<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:33.280> then<00:03:34.280> we've<00:03:34.459> got

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
all line up like so and then we've got

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.900 
all line up like so and then we've got
the<00:03:35.000> wireless<00:03:35.390> charging<00:03:35.750> pad<00:03:36.670> which<00:03:37.670> will

just<00:03:38.150> connect<00:03:38.450> up<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:38.630> power<00:03:39.190> ok<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:40.250> we've<00:03:40.610> got

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
just connect up to power ok so we've got

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.940 
just connect up to power ok so we've got
the<00:03:40.820> wireless<00:03:41.390> charging<00:03:41.810> pad<00:03:42.049> connected<00:03:42.799> to
