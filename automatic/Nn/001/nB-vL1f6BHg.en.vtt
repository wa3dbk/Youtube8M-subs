tone and I'm going to kind of just do

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.580 
tone and I'm going to kind of just do
the<00:04:33.160> same<00:04:33.370> thing<00:04:33.640> that<00:04:33.850> I<00:04:33.910> did<00:04:34.000> with<00:04:34.590> the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
the same thing that I did with the

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.110 
the same thing that I did with the
bottom<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.870> bottom<00:04:38.050> part<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.590> my<00:04:38.830> eyebrows<00:04:39.400> so

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
bottom the bottom part of my eyebrows so

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.890 
bottom the bottom part of my eyebrows so
I'm<00:04:40.270> just<00:04:40.540> concealing<00:04:41.410> that<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.070> just<00:04:42.900> kind

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
I'm just concealing that and just kind

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.780 
I'm just concealing that and just kind
of<00:04:43.960> carving<00:04:44.380> out<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.680> guess<00:04:45.070> you<00:04:45.430> can<00:04:45.580> call<00:04:45.730> it

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
of carving out I guess you can call it

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.380 
of carving out I guess you can call it
that<00:04:47.190> so<00:04:48.190> after<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.550> do<00:04:48.760> this<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.090> want<00:04:49.270> to

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
that so after you do this you want to

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.910 
that so after you do this you want to
just<00:04:49.540> make<00:04:49.720> sure<00:04:49.960> that<00:04:49.990> you<00:04:50.260> blend<00:04:50.500> it<00:04:50.770> out

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
just make sure that you blend it out

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.060 
just make sure that you blend it out
really<00:04:51.520> well<00:04:51.700> um<00:04:52.090> you<00:04:52.810> could<00:04:53.020> stop<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:53.830> you

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
really well um you could stop and you

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.570 
really well um you could stop and you
don't<00:04:54.250> have<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.580> do<00:04:54.760> this<00:04:54.970> part<00:04:56.280> you<00:04:57.280> can<00:04:57.460> just

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
