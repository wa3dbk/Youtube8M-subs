00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
so it's not like I'm struggling with a

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.680 
so it's not like I'm struggling with a
Wi-Fi<00:03:23.280> connection<00:03:26.240> there's<00:03:27.240> plenty<00:03:27.660> of

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
Wi-Fi connection there's plenty of

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.740 
Wi-Fi connection there's plenty of
bandwidth<00:03:28.290> speed<00:03:29.180> that's<00:03:30.180> really<00:03:30.600> not

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
bandwidth speed that's really not

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.510 
bandwidth speed that's really not
something<00:03:30.959> there's<00:03:31.590> an<00:03:31.709> issue<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:32.250> was

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
something there's an issue I was

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.260 
something there's an issue I was
probably<00:03:32.760> about<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.209> third<00:03:33.420> gig<00:03:34.880> broadband<00:03:35.880> I

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
probably about the third gig broadband I

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.600 
probably about the third gig broadband I
think<00:03:36.990> it<00:03:37.110> comes<00:03:37.290> out<00:03:37.500> about<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.770> sixth<00:03:38.220> gig<00:03:38.430> per

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
think it comes out about a sixth gig per

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.340 
think it comes out about a sixth gig per
second<00:03:39.440> it's<00:03:40.440> currently<00:03:40.860> running<00:03:41.459> out<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.090> I

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
second it's currently running out so I

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.960 
second it's currently running out so I
really<00:03:43.350> not<00:03:43.500> struggling<00:03:43.920> with<00:03:45.290> my<00:03:46.290> connection

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970
