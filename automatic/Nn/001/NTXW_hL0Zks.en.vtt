00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
things in development we could sit here

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.240 
things in development we could sit here
for<00:03:51.300> 19<00:03:51.750> hours<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.320> show<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.530> stuff<00:03:52.860> right<00:03:53.100> we

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.819 

what<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.299> future<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.900> mean<00:03:59.200> what<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.620> not

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
what is the future I mean what is not

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.500 
what is the future I mean what is not
the<00:04:00.099> future<00:04:00.250> I<00:04:00.459> mean<00:04:00.760> again<00:04:01.030> when<00:04:01.209> you've<00:04:01.360> got

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
the future I mean again when you've got

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.569 
the future I mean again when you've got
your<00:04:01.569> ps3<00:04:01.989> which<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:02.379> still<00:04:02.709> firmly<00:04:03.040> believe<00:04:03.430> is

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
your ps3 which I still firmly believe is

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.429

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 
still hitting its stride rite I think

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.170 
still hitting its stride rite I think
there's<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.650> lot<00:04:06.069> of<00:04:06.129> juice<00:04:06.610> left<00:04:06.760> in<00:04:07.060> that

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
there's a lot of juice left in that

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.470 
there's a lot of juice left in that
machine<00:04:07.390> then<00:04:08.319> you've<00:04:08.470> got<00:04:08.680> Vita<00:04:09.250> which<00:04:10.239> can

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
you when I say you've got developers

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.879 
you when I say you've got developers
that<00:04:15.310> are<00:04:15.489> just<00:04:15.939> literally<00:04:16.419> salivating

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
waiting to figure out what it is they

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.599 
waiting to figure out what it is they
can<00:04:19.449> do<00:04:19.690> right<00:04:20.139> how<00:04:20.680> they<00:04:20.889> can<00:04:21.070> interact<00:04:21.250> how

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
they can come up with unique social

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.860 
they can come up with unique social
interactions<00:04:23.830> utilizing<00:04:24.490> 3g<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.630> sky's<00:04:25.840> the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
interactions utilizing 3g the sky's the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.760 
interactions utilizing 3g the sky's the
limit<00:04:27.330> we<00:04:28.330> are<00:04:28.570> putting<00:04:28.840> functionality<00:04:29.650> into

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
limit we are putting functionality into

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.560 
limit we are putting functionality into
a<00:04:29.919> lot<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.370> our<00:04:30.490> core<00:04:30.760> games<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.330> think

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
a lot of our core games and I think

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.090 
a lot of our core games and I think
that's<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.810> really<00:04:31.840> important<00:04:32.740> thing<00:04:32.919> to

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
that's a really important thing to

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.129 
that's a really important thing to
remember<00:04:33.220> this<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.240> not<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.449> platform<00:04:35.080> where

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
remember this is not a platform where

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.450 
remember this is not a platform where
you're<00:04:35.440> not<00:04:35.590> going<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:35.860> be<00:04:35.979> able<00:04:36.010> to<00:04:36.250> play<00:04:36.370> a

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
you're not going to be able to play a

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.580 
you're not going to be able to play a
shooter<00:04:36.850> with<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.330> move<00:04:37.510> right<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:38.110> mean<00:04:38.440> we've

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
shooter with the move right I mean we've

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.320 
shooter with the move right I mean we've
already<00:04:38.770> shown<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.729> when<00:04:40.090> you're<00:04:40.210> going

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.210 
already shown that and when you're going
to<00:04:40.419> see<00:04:40.570> it<00:04:40.660> in<00:04:40.780> resistance<00:04:41.260> 3<00:04:41.500> for<00:04:41.770> example

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
to see it in resistance 3 for example

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.890 
to see it in resistance 3 for example
that's<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.550> fun<00:04:42.729> way<00:04:42.940> to<00:04:42.970> play<00:04:43.210> move<00:04:43.419> for<00:04:43.690> some

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
that's a fun way to play move for some

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.810 
that's a fun way to play move for some
