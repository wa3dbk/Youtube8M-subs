knitting videos some simple lessons and
I<00:00:10.469> think<00:00:10.679> it's<00:00:10.830> very<00:00:11.010> important<00:00:11.670> as<00:00:11.880> we<00:00:12.120> go

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
I think it's very important as we go

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.079 
I think it's very important as we go
through<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.660> castoffs<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:14.219> talk<00:00:14.460> about<00:00:14.670> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
through the castoffs to talk about the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.170 
through the castoffs to talk about the
option<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.839> using<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.320> crochet<00:00:16.890> hook<00:00:17.180> taking

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
crocheting along the cast-off edge so

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.370
