00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
unfortunately I can't really test this

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.880 
unfortunately I can't really test this
properly<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.659> while<00:01:16.200> indoors<00:01:16.650> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
properly here because while indoors I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.679 
properly here because while indoors I
don't<00:01:17.580> need<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> screen

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
don't need it I can see the screen

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.770 
don't need it I can see the screen
anyway<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> even<00:01:19.920> outdoors<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:21.030> quite<00:01:21.479> dull

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
anyway and even outdoors it's quite dull

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.170 
anyway and even outdoors it's quite dull
and<00:01:21.810> cloudy<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.130> come<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.340> Turkey<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.000> see

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and cloudy so I come to Turkey to see

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
and cloudy so I come to Turkey to see
what<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.990> I've<00:01:25.920> been<00:01:26.100> using<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
what it's really like I've been using it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.920 
what it's really like I've been using it
for<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> few<00:01:26.729> days<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.540> really<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
for a few days and it's really not that

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.530 
for a few days and it's really not that
bad<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:29.100> already<00:01:29.189> mentioned<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.880> feels<00:01:30.210> very

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
bad as I already mentioned it feels very

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.880 
bad as I already mentioned it feels very
cheap<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.320> hasn't<00:01:31.590> been<00:01:31.770> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
cheap but that hasn't been a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.340 
cheap but that hasn't been a
deal-breaker<00:01:32.329> it<00:01:33.329> attaches<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> camera

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
deal-breaker it attaches to the camera

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.289 
deal-breaker it attaches to the camera
using<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.920> magnet<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.400> take<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.850> piece<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
using a magnet you take this piece and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.120 
using a magnet you take this piece and
you<00:01:36.630> screw<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.079> onto<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> bottom<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you screw it onto the bottom of the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.859 
you screw it onto the bottom of the
camera<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:40.759> this<00:01:41.759> adds<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.180> metal<00:01:42.509> frame

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
camera and this adds a metal frame

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.289 
camera and this adds a metal frame
around<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.470> screen<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.850> makes<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> really

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
around the screen this makes it really

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.600 
around the screen this makes it really
easy<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.720> purchase<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.470> viewfinder<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
easy to purchase the viewfinder on and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.069 
easy to purchase the viewfinder on and
off<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.390> better<00:01:48.540> than<00:01:48.780> some<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
off and this is better than some of the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.359 
off and this is better than some of the
alternatives<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.979> doesn't<00:01:50.220> leave

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
alternatives because it doesn't leave

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.670 
alternatives because it doesn't leave
anything<00:01:50.670> behind<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.659> camera<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
anything behind on the camera and you

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.050 
anything behind on the camera and you
can<00:01:52.710> put<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.040> viewfinder<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.549> either<00:01:53.759> way<00:01:54.000> so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
can put the viewfinder on either way so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.880 
can put the viewfinder on either way so
you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.420> use<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.840> either<00:01:55.020> eye<00:01:55.380> this

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
you can use it with either eye this

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.370 
you can use it with either eye this
metal<00:01:56.310> frame<00:01:56.549> has<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.210> thread<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> bottom

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
metal frame has a thread on the bottom

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
metal frame has a thread on the bottom
so<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:58.920> still<00:01:59.159> mount<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.520> camera<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.850> a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so you can still mount the camera on a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.179 
so you can still mount the camera on a
tripod<00:02:00.259> it<00:02:01.259> will<00:02:01.469> prevent<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> use<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.009> a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
tripod it will prevent the use of a

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.800 
tripod it will prevent the use of a
battery<00:02:02.520> grip<00:02:02.549> pill<00:02:02.939> or<00:02:03.119> any<00:02:03.329> other<00:02:03.509> accessory

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
battery grip pill or any other accessory

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.170 
battery grip pill or any other accessory
which<00:02:04.170> needs<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.799> touch<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.310> bottom<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
which needs to touch the bottom of the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.240 
which needs to touch the bottom of the
camera<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.409> can<00:02:07.530> still<00:02:07.710> access<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.129> battery

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
camera you can still access the battery

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.729 
camera you can still access the battery
compartment<00:02:08.729> without<00:02:09.420> taking<00:02:10.200> anything<00:02:10.500> off

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
compartment without taking anything off

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.440 
compartment without taking anything off
you<00:02:11.190> might<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.520> some<00:02:11.670> concerns<00:02:12.209> about

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
you might have some concerns about

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.440 
you might have some concerns about
putting<00:02:13.110> and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
putting and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.050 
putting and
so<00:02:14.110> close<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.680> camera<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.280> share<00:02:15.910> those

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
so close to the camera I share those

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.479 
so close to the camera I share those
concerns<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.200> think<00:02:17.590> only<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.190> viewfinder

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
concerns but I think only the viewfinder

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.330 
concerns but I think only the viewfinder
has<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> magnet<00:02:19.569> in<00:02:19.690> not<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.590> metal<00:02:20.920> frame

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
has a magnet in not the metal frame

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.490 
has a magnet in not the metal frame
which<00:02:21.580> sits<00:02:21.910> around<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.270> screen<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.200> as<00:02:23.319> long

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
which sits around the screen so as long

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.479 
which sits around the screen so as long
as<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.650> don't<00:02:23.770> leave<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.069> on<00:02:24.160> for<00:02:24.220> an<00:02:24.400> extended

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
as you don't leave it on for an extended

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.360 
as you don't leave it on for an extended
period<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.330> time<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.840> should<00:02:26.170> be<00:02:26.380> okay<00:02:26.680> one

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
period of time it should be okay one

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.740 
period of time it should be okay one
point<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.700> raise<00:02:27.849> here<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.390> magnet

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
point to raise here is that the magnet

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.540 
point to raise here is that the magnet
never<00:02:28.959> totally<00:02:29.319> touches<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.130> screen<00:02:30.400> because

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
never totally touches the screen because

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.490 
never totally touches the screen because
it<00:02:30.790> leaves<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.090> small<00:02:31.239> gap<00:02:31.690> now<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.170> metal

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
it leaves a small gap now the metal

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.470 
it leaves a small gap now the metal
frame<00:02:32.739> is<00:02:32.950> actually<00:02:33.520> adjustable<00:02:33.610> it'll<00:02:34.360> move

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
frame is actually adjustable it'll move

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.180 
frame is actually adjustable it'll move
forwards<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.050> backwards<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.470> little<00:02:35.500> bit<00:02:35.739> to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
forwards and backwards a little bit to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.650 
forwards and backwards a little bit to
accommodate<00:02:36.489> cameras<00:02:37.209> with<00:02:37.360> slightly

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
accommodate cameras with slightly

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.360 
accommodate cameras with slightly
different<00:02:37.780> depths<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.010> still<00:02:39.220> get<00:02:39.310> a

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
different depths but you still get a

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.740 
different depths but you still get a
problem<00:02:39.760> where<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:39.970> frame<00:02:40.180> doesn't<00:02:40.450> actually

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
problem where the frame doesn't actually

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.750 
problem where the frame doesn't actually
touch<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.380> screen<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.830> seems<00:02:42.069> like<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.580> the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
touch the screen it seems like that the

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.390 
touch the screen it seems like that the
corner<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.540> not<00:02:44.050> quite<00:02:44.349> at<00:02:44.650> 90<00:02:45.040> degrees

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
corner of it is not quite at 90 degrees

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.850 
corner of it is not quite at 90 degrees
so<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.700> top<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.120> further<00:02:47.019> away<00:02:47.319> from<00:02:47.350> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
so the top is further away from the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.470 
so the top is further away from the
bottom<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.819> get<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> bit<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.180> movement

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
bottom and you get a bit of movement

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.990 
bottom and you get a bit of movement
there<00:02:49.810> now<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.739> causes<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.489> couple<00:02:51.940> of

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
there now this causes a couple of

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.150 
there now this causes a couple of
problems<00:02:52.209> firstly<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.260> lets<00:02:53.470> some<00:02:53.709> light<00:02:53.980> in

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
problems firstly it lets some light in

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.729 
problems firstly it lets some light in
I'm<00:02:54.700> not<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.090> lot<00:02:55.269> but<00:02:55.569> enough<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:56.019> diminish<00:02:56.560> the

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
I'm not a lot but enough to diminish the

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.160 
I'm not a lot but enough to diminish the
effects<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.549> viewfinder<00:02:58.150> it's<00:02:58.930> still

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
effects of the viewfinder it's still

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.229 
effects of the viewfinder it's still
better<00:02:59.350> than<00:02:59.530> not<00:02:59.650> having<00:02:59.709> it<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.310> at<00:03:00.430> all<00:03:00.640> but

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
better than not having it on at all but

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.449 
better than not having it on at all but
it's<00:03:01.420> far<00:03:01.660> from<00:03:01.690> perfect<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.410> secondly<00:03:03.310> you

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
it's far from perfect and secondly you

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.550 
it's far from perfect and secondly you
get<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.640> very<00:03:03.880> slightly<00:03:04.299> warped<00:03:04.720> image<00:03:05.200> because

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
get a very slightly warped image because

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.530 
get a very slightly warped image because
it's<00:03:05.709> not<00:03:05.860> straight<00:03:06.280> it's<00:03:06.519> not<00:03:06.580> parallel<00:03:07.510> with

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
it's not straight it's not parallel with

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.930 
it's not straight it's not parallel with
the<00:03:07.870> screen<00:03:08.230> but<00:03:08.950> I<00:03:09.040> think<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.430> also<00:03:09.549> due

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
the screen but I think this is also due

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.449 
the screen but I think this is also due
to<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.330> cheap<00:03:10.660> glass<00:03:10.959> inside<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.769> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
to the cheap glass inside of the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.330 
to the cheap glass inside of the
viewfinder<00:03:13.110> this<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:14.260> noticeable<00:03:14.920> at<00:03:15.160> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
viewfinder this is noticeable at the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.460 
viewfinder this is noticeable at the
edges<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.880> image<00:03:16.209> it's<00:03:16.480> all<00:03:16.569> just<00:03:16.780> tiny

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
edges of the image it's all just tiny

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.460 
edges of the image it's all just tiny
little<00:03:17.709> bit<00:03:17.980> warped<00:03:18.900> speaking<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:20.260> glass

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
little bit warped speaking of the glass

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.470 
little bit warped speaking of the glass
inside<00:03:21.100> of<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.340> viewfinder<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:22.090> provides

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
inside of the viewfinder it provides

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.259

according to the Amazon description and

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.810 
according to the Amazon description and
I<00:03:28.329> have<00:03:28.450> no<00:03:28.630> reason<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:29.109> disbelieve<00:03:29.320> that

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
I have no reason to disbelieve that

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.860 
I have no reason to disbelieve that
magnification<00:03:30.820> is<00:03:30.940> good<00:03:31.180> because<00:03:31.570> it<00:03:31.690> really

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
magnification is good because it really

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.990 
magnification is good because it really
helps<00:03:32.170> you<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.440> get<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.709> focus<00:03:33.010> right<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:33.640> found

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
helps you to get the focus right I found

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.300 
helps you to get the focus right I found
that<00:03:34.120> 2.8<00:03:34.690> times<00:03:34.930> is<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.230> little<00:03:35.709> too<00:03:35.890> much<00:03:36.100> for

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
that 2.8 times is a little too much for

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.759 
that 2.8 times is a little too much for
my<00:03:36.430> liking<00:03:36.640> because<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.269> can't<00:03:37.600> quite<00:03:37.900> see<00:03:38.200> the

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
my liking because I can't quite see the

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.349 
my liking because I can't quite see the
whole<00:03:39.010> screen<00:03:39.519> without<00:03:39.850> having<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.239> look

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
whole screen without having to look

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.060 
whole screen without having to look
around<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.840> little<00:03:40.959> bit<00:03:41.170> inside<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.890> the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
around a little bit inside of the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.120 
around a little bit inside of the
viewfinder<00:03:43.049> this<00:03:44.049> is<00:03:44.200> not<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.380> huge<00:03:44.709> problem

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
viewfinder this is not a huge problem

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.220 
viewfinder this is not a huge problem
but<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:45.850> just<00:03:46.030> makes<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.510> little<00:03:46.720> bit<00:03:46.930> harder

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
but it just makes it a little bit harder

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.170 
but it just makes it a little bit harder
to<00:03:47.350> frame<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.890> composed<00:03:48.430> shots<00:03:48.820> also

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
to frame and composed shots also

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.670 
to frame and composed shots also
remember<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:49.810> while<00:03:49.959> you're<00:03:50.140> magnifying

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
remember that while you're magnifying

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.500 
remember that while you're magnifying
the<00:03:50.950> screen<00:03:51.310> you're<00:03:51.459> not<00:03:51.579> increasing<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
the screen you're not increasing the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.750 
the screen you're not increasing the
number<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:52.989> pixels<00:03:53.320> so<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.070> lose<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.489> sharp

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
number of pixels so you lose the sharp

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.360 
number of pixels so you lose the sharp
crisp<00:03:55.269> quality<00:03:55.570> that<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.530> image<00:03:56.739> has<00:03:56.769> when

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
crisp quality that the image has when

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.699 
crisp quality that the image has when
you<00:03:57.549> look<00:03:57.730> at<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:57.940> screen<00:03:58.269> directly<00:03:58.720> this

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
you look at the screen directly this

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.319 
you look at the screen directly this

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
some sort of attachment like this on the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.620 
some sort of attachment like this on the
viewfinder<00:04:25.300> so<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:25.840> could<00:04:26.020> attach<00:04:26.260> it

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
viewfinder so I could attach it

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.420 
viewfinder so I could attach it
camera<00:04:26.900> or<00:04:27.080> hang<00:04:27.290> it<00:04:27.410> around<00:04:27.470> my<00:04:27.650> neck<00:04:27.680> but

camera or hang it around my neck but

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.860 
camera or hang it around my neck but
there's<00:04:28.850> nothing<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.300> sides<00:04:29.540> are<00:04:29.810> just

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
there's nothing the sides are just

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.560 
there's nothing the sides are just
smooth<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:31.100> is<00:04:31.340> it<00:04:31.490> worth<00:04:31.640> buying<00:04:31.670> this<00:04:32.180> for<00:04:32.390> 10

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
smooth so is it worth buying this for 10

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.470 
smooth so is it worth buying this for 10
pounds<00:04:32.800> yes<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:34.100> does<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.490> job<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:34.940> provides

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
pounds yes it does the job it provides

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.930 
pounds yes it does the job it provides
magnification<00:04:36.350> for<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.680> screen<00:04:36.980> and<00:04:37.160> it

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
magnification for the screen and it

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.510 
magnification for the screen and it
increases<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.750> visibility<00:04:39.320> in<00:04:39.530> bright<00:04:40.160> light

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
increases the visibility in bright light

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.890 
increases the visibility in bright light
I've<00:04:40.760> been<00:04:40.940> able<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.150> get<00:04:41.300> some<00:04:41.510> really<00:04:41.690> nice

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
I've been able to get some really nice

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.960 
I've been able to get some really nice
shots<00:04:42.170> here<00:04:42.410> in<00:04:42.560> Turkey<00:04:42.920> in<00:04:43.250> direct<00:04:43.760> sunlight

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
shots here in Turkey in direct sunlight

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.940 
shots here in Turkey in direct sunlight
which<00:04:44.300> would<00:04:44.450> have<00:04:44.540> otherwise<00:04:44.630> been

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
which would have otherwise been

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.890 
which would have otherwise been
impossible<00:04:45.950> it's<00:04:46.520> not<00:04:46.730> perfect<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:47.420> it<00:04:47.720> has

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
impossible it's not perfect and it has

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.110 
impossible it's not perfect and it has
some<00:04:48.170> missing<00:04:48.500> features<00:04:48.920> but<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.730> is

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
some missing features but it is

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.490 
some missing features but it is
significantly<00:04:50.900> cheaper<00:04:51.140> than<00:04:51.410> the

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
significantly cheaper than the

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.190 
significantly cheaper than the
competition<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:52.160> if<00:04:52.610> like<00:04:53.270> me<00:04:53.510> you<00:04:53.840> have<00:04:54.050> an

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
competition and if like me you have an

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.590 
competition and if like me you have an
entry-level<00:04:54.530> DSLR<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.360> you're<00:04:56.360> mainly

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
entry-level DSLR and you're mainly

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.320 
entry-level DSLR and you're mainly
shooting<00:04:57.440> video<00:04:57.740> just<00:04:58.070> for<00:04:58.280> fun<00:04:58.460> I<00:04:58.640> really

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
shooting video just for fun I really

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.760 
shooting video just for fun I really
don't<00:04:59.510> think<00:04:59.570> it's<00:04:59.810> worth<00:04:59.990> spending<00:05:00.290> as<00:05:00.710> much

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
don't think it's worth spending as much

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.070 
don't think it's worth spending as much
on<00:05:01.280> a<00:05:01.370> viewfinder<00:05:02.060> as<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.270> did<00:05:02.450> on<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.750> camera

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
on a viewfinder as you did on the camera

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.990 
on a viewfinder as you did on the camera
and<00:05:03.230> finally<00:05:03.890> I<00:05:03.920> accidentally<00:05:04.580> dropped<00:05:04.820> this

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
and finally I accidentally dropped this

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.540 
and finally I accidentally dropped this
yesterday<00:05:05.480> it<00:05:05.930> didn't<00:05:06.380> suffer<00:05:07.070> any<00:05:07.190> damage

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
yesterday it didn't suffer any damage

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.670 
yesterday it didn't suffer any damage
but<00:05:08.300> if<00:05:08.420> it<00:05:08.540> had<00:05:08.750> out<00:05:08.930> of<00:05:08.960> being<00:05:09.230> really<00:05:09.500> glad

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
but if it had out of being really glad

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.280 
but if it had out of being really glad
that<00:05:10.160> I<00:05:10.190> chose<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.760> cheap<00:05:11.000> option<00:05:11.450> since<00:05:12.050> it's

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
that I chose the cheap option since it's

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.200 
that I chose the cheap option since it's
just<00:05:12.380> a<00:05:12.620> magnet<00:05:12.920> it<00:05:13.160> can<00:05:13.580> come<00:05:13.820> off<00:05:13.910> quite

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
just a magnet it can come off quite

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.210 
just a magnet it can come off quite
easily<00:05:14.240> so<00:05:14.750> that's<00:05:14.870> something<00:05:15.170> to<00:05:15.500> bear<00:05:15.950> in

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
easily so that's something to bear in

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.850 
easily so that's something to bear in
mind<00:05:16.300> again<00:05:17.300> this<00:05:17.450> is<00:05:17.630> the<00:05:17.780> V<00:05:17.960> 3<00:05:18.290> LCD

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
mind again this is the V 3 LCD

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.150 
mind again this is the V 3 LCD
viewfinder<00:05:19.670> or<00:05:19.790> LCD<00:05:20.480> v3<00:05:21.110> I<00:05:21.290> really<00:05:21.860> don't<00:05:22.040> know

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
viewfinder or LCD v3 I really don't know

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.130 
viewfinder or LCD v3 I really don't know
either<00:05:22.670> way<00:05:22.970> I'd<00:05:23.180> recommend<00:05:23.690> it<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:23.840> anyone

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
either way I'd recommend it to anyone

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.740 
either way I'd recommend it to anyone
