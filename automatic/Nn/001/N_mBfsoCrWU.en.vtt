00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.870
 hello everyone with you, the face of crazy motion and 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.630
 Today we are waiting for a review on Lego not quite 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.210
 standard but on the screen saver to this 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.869
 video I think many may have guessed in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.859
 In general , we have such a group 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.260
 VKontakte and some time ago 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.260
 month that years ago I wo n't say for sure 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.980
 overall someone posted a photo of one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.989
 figurines 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.110
 batman in such a little purple 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.140
 dress a whole bunch and purple and i 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.670
 wondered at all where did this 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.210
 character because in sets i'm so 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.730
 I don’t remember a little bit like that 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.890
 I guys threw a link that turns out 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.500
 there is a certain one and 9 with a cartoon where a 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.260
 as a bonus, lego puts such 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.869
 exclusive figure well, I rummaged 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.060
 I rummaged in Russia and I am on sale 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.930
 I did not find and do not know what is officially such 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.920
 the cartoon was delivered or not and i 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.030
 turned 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.780
 Naturally, but online auction type 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.939
 ebay and here I do not remember the mind whether amazon 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.000
 either beat but from somewhere you are general 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.400
 I got a parcel and I decided all the same 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.170
 show this most exclusive figure 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.170
 then hide the package 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:44.250
 and get here is such a cartoon league 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.770
 equity so this is a report inside 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.200
 It means clearly says that I bought it 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:55.770
 still on amazon lama umbrella on 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:59.579
 amazon doesn't matter so here he is a league disc 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.920
 justice bizzare league clues 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.100
 justice versus bizarre am i this 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.459
 cartoon and did not look I do not know when he 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.459
 released 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:22.110
 in general, somehow from me so little 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.360
 slipped written 2015 year now 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.310
 we march we go I do not know maybe it's true 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.870
 came out may be quite new I'm on 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.239
 actually came in recently in one 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.440
 shopping mall to shop which 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.660
 sells movies and games and music and 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.299
 asked one of the guys showed the packaging 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.620
 said such here 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.350
 sold you he said no 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.810
 It never was and in my opinion but do not expect 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.540
 given that the seller was very 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.250
 so sluggish and judging by his external 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.400
 He had not slept for three weeks 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.180
 so his answer for the truth, I still 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.220
 I decided not to count well, maybe write then 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.690
 There is in Russia such a disk where it is or not 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.120
 I would buy in Russian 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.359
 look at what to see in English 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.370
 but honestly a big wish 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.049
 no cartoon language he's specific 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.480
 a lot of certain vocabulary will 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.669
 specific so I can and can’t 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.400
 understand it will probably hurt something to spend 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:23.430
 time so let's open the disk 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.489
 the disc itself is quite a bit interesting for me 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.810
 more interesting 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.030
 interesting here is this figure 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.019
 exclusive which will replenish my 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.680
 superhero collection and so drive 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:41.720
 includes limited edition 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:48.230
 exclusive baht figure behind the wheel of it 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:54.400
 bad zara look how it is packed 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:56.540
 so we have the box itself with 9 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.440
 invitation to legoland 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.440
 I will think of a bunch of ads 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:12.080
 drive itself try to see later 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.880
 later Russian wall will not find me at 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.109
 it seems that on the internet it is for sure 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.989
 It should already be in there treasured 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.260
 the figurine itself is due to which all this 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:31.310
 and the packaging was done not to tear the hunt 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:34.900
 in another way probably not to get to with 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.900
 the other side of the husband will try to pull out 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.300
 yes yes yes there is the possibility of cheers without 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.610
 rupture packing 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:49.610
 got it means here it is our strange 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:52.940
 Batman seems not Batman is not difficult to judge 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.510
 who so everything is glued over Che will 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.890
 to get 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:00.490
 Okay, it's a pity of course to get out 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.490
 store packaging 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:14.189
 get acquainted it is not clear what someone can 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.800
 looked and know who this such here 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:23.249
 here is the specific 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:27.439
 batman what kind face such a night 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:30.029
 dream but she is also bilateral 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:32.009
 and I can not say so focus where 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.469
 left focus cant say she 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:39.150
 very different 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:40.849
 there is such a vampire grin face something 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.039
 reminds 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:49.770
 darth vader in part 6 before dying and 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:52.830
 here, too, grin but already with such as 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.610
 screaming is not clear whether rage whether 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:01.439
 frightened progyan cloak upturned 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.479
 bat like in the photo with 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:08.879
 which I learned all about it super heroes 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:10.469
 he is such a great violet 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:13.439
 funny figure seems to me for 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:17.279
 collections will even go to my 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:19.860
 closed case for rare figures so I 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:21.080
 I also started this figure recently 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.259
 I consider rare 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.360
 I hope so it is well actually 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.310
 my issue was specifically devoted to 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.110
 of this figure so we looked at it 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.360
 about the figure tell me more 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.479
 because i'm a cartoon i don't know any 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.569
 I don't know the background 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.310
 and they will understand what kind of hero is not 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:43.889
 now I just have to look because 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.110
 what on even if someone is from a guest 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.149
 come watch my collection of figures 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.509
 and the meter will not say anything about 

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:53.729
 it will be a shame everything will start the figure goes away 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:58.439
 back to your case 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:07:01.990
 my close this side we closed 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:03.640
 that's how we close everything 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.070
 if neither of you knew about 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:10.330
 the existence of this figure then i'm glad that 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:13.600
 we now learned and learned how she 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.570
 looks closer congratulations to me 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:21.280
