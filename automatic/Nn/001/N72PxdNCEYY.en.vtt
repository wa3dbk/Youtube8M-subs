though<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.409> made<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> wool<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.280> obviously<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
though it's made of wool so obviously it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.899 
though it's made of wool so obviously it
can't<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.659> too<00:01:42.840> realistic<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.670> here's

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
can't be too realistic but right here's

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.490 
can't be too realistic but right here's
the<00:01:45.119> real<00:01:45.270> secret<00:01:45.509> part<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.290> little

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the real secret part just a little

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.170 
the real secret part just a little
button<00:01:46.680> there<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.130> opens<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.640> staircase<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
button there it opens up a staircase and

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.830 
button there it opens up a staircase and
you<00:01:48.659> go<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.229> through<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.540> right<00:01:51.540> here

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you go on through that and right here

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.679 
you go on through that and right here
you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.020> see<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> little<00:01:52.939> sleeping<00:01:53.939> room<00:01:54.210> area

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
you can see a little sleeping room area

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.120 
you can see a little sleeping room area
sort<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.200> thing

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
sort of thing

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.730 
sort of thing
it's<00:01:56.700> apparently<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.659> night<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.409> can't

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
it's apparently not night so I can't

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.350 
it's apparently not night so I can't
show<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.880> how<00:02:00.000> badges

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
show you that but you know how badges

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.690 
show you that but you know how badges
work<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.040> yeah<00:02:02.040> we're<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.549> going

work and yeah we're going to be going

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.880 
work and yeah we're going to be going
down<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.329> now<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.409> where<00:02:04.560> stuff

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
down here now and this is where stuff

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.499 
down here now and this is where stuff
starts<00:02:05.219> getting<00:02:05.520> interesting<00:02:06.030> guys<00:02:06.210> it's

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
starts getting interesting guys it's

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.650 
starts getting interesting guys it's
these<00:02:06.659> levels<00:02:07.170> here<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.390> what

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
these levels here that really are what

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.780 
these levels here that really are what
took<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.020> most<00:02:10.259> time<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> lot<00:02:11.760> of

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
took the most time you can see a lot of

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.070 
took the most time you can see a lot of
it's<00:02:12.000> not<00:02:12.209> done

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
it's not done

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.690 
it's not done
the<00:02:13.230> walls<00:02:13.440> are<00:02:13.650> still<00:02:13.860> made<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.160> stone<00:02:14.430> and

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
the walls are still made of stone and

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.340 
the walls are still made of stone and
dirt<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.240> will<00:02:15.570> be<00:02:15.690> replacing<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.290> with

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
dirt and I will be replacing that with

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.100 
dirt and I will be replacing that with
iron<00:02:16.590> later<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:18.630> know<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.780> had<00:02:18.870> some

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
iron later on and you know I had some

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.320 
iron later on and you know I had some
lava<00:02:19.350> stuff<00:02:19.950> just<00:02:20.190> for<00:02:20.400> decoration<00:02:20.850> purposes

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
lava stuff just for decoration purposes

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.120 
lava stuff just for decoration purposes
you<00:02:21.990> know<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:22.290> supposed<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.680> look<00:02:22.800> kind<00:02:23.100> of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
you know it's supposed to look kind of

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.830 
you know it's supposed to look kind of
like<00:02:23.280> tubes<00:02:23.670> or<00:02:24.000> something<00:02:24.030> like<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.660> you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
like tubes or something like that you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
like tubes or something like that you
know<00:02:24.960> something<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.470> would<00:02:25.560> see<00:02:25.710> in<00:02:25.800> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
know something that you would see in a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.280 
know something that you would see in a
lab<00:02:26.070> but<00:02:26.910> right<00:02:27.450> here<00:02:27.630> we're<00:02:27.750> just<00:02:27.780> going<00:02:28.140> down

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
lab but right here we're just going down

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.130 
lab but right here we're just going down
to<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.560> next<00:02:28.590> level<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.600> this<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:30.720> actually

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
to the next level and this is actually

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.140 
to the next level and this is actually
the<00:02:31.260> lowest<00:02:31.620> level<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.970> on

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the lowest level that that I have on

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.810 
the lowest level that that I have on
this<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:33.540> far<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:35.100> right<00:02:35.280> there<00:02:35.460> just<00:02:35.610> goes

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
this so far that right there just goes

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.670 
this so far that right there just goes
down<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.180> bedrock<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.810> put<00:02:36.990> some<00:02:37.170> lava<00:02:37.410> down

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
down to bedrock I put some lava down

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.440 
down to bedrock I put some lava down
there<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.070> stuff<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> feature

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
there and stuff and this is a feature

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.810 
there and stuff and this is a feature
that<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.870> want<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.500> incorporate<00:02:41.100> into<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.640> lab

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
that I want to incorporate into the lab

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.500 
that I want to incorporate into the lab
area<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.720> call<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.020> serve<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.470> biomes<00:02:44.510> not

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
area and I call it serve like biomes not

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.200 
area and I call it serve like biomes not
like<00:02:45.870> actual<00:02:46.290> biomes<00:02:46.830> but<00:02:47.100> basically<00:02:48.000> just

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
like actual biomes but basically just

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.600 
like actual biomes but basically just
like<00:02:48.360> little<00:02:48.980> showcases<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.010> different

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
like little showcases of different

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.640 
like little showcases of different
environments<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.330> one<00:02:51.600> was<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> ice<00:02:52.050> one<00:02:52.410> it

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
environments that one was the ice one it

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.500 
environments that one was the ice one it
had<00:02:52.860> like<00:02:53.130> snow<00:02:53.490> everywhere<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.270> one's

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
had like snow everywhere and this one's

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.110 
had like snow everywhere and this one's
kind<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.810> like<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.050> jungle<00:02:55.650> type<00:02:56.040> thing<00:02:56.340> with

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
kind of like a jungle type thing with

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.540 
kind of like a jungle type thing with
the<00:02:57.630> pigs<00:02:57.900> running<00:02:58.320> around<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.130> lava<00:02:59.340> and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
the pigs running around in the lava and

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.060 
the pigs running around in the lava and
water<00:02:59.810> supposed<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.530> know<00:03:01.620> set<00:03:01.920> off<00:03:02.040> a

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
water supposed to you know set off a

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.790 
water supposed to you know set off a
kind<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.670> tropical<00:03:03.060> feel<00:03:03.600> there<00:03:03.900> over<00:03:04.620> there

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
kind of tropical feel there over there

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.260 
kind of tropical feel there over there
I'm<00:03:04.920> not<00:03:04.950> sure<00:03:05.340> what<00:03:05.520> I'm<00:03:05.610> going<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.820> put<00:03:06.030> yet

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
I'm not sure what I'm going to put yet

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.470 
I'm not sure what I'm going to put yet
I'm<00:03:06.510> thinking<00:03:07.080> maybe<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.380> desert<00:03:07.890> or<00:03:08.480> volcano

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
I'm thinking maybe a desert or volcano

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.120 
I'm thinking maybe a desert or volcano
something<00:03:09.930> along<00:03:10.170> those<00:03:10.380> lines<00:03:10.530> I'm<00:03:10.980> not

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
something along those lines I'm not

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.220 
something along those lines I'm not
really<00:03:11.280> sure<00:03:11.750> maybe<00:03:12.750> I'll<00:03:12.959> think<00:03:13.080> of

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
really sure maybe I'll think of

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.960 
really sure maybe I'll think of
something<00:03:13.590> completely<00:03:14.160> different<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.790> just

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
something completely different and just

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.640 
something completely different and just
surprise<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.510> with<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.870> don't<00:03:16.320> know<00:03:16.440> really

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
surprise you with it I don't know really

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.820 
surprise you with it I don't know really

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
yet but um yeah right over here is

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.340 
yet but um yeah right over here is
another<00:03:20.519> area<00:03:20.790> where<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.870> know<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:21.989> just<00:03:22.200> like

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
another area where you know I just like

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.650 
another area where you know I just like
to<00:03:22.500> torture<00:03:22.769> pigs<00:03:23.190> sometimes<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.360> can<00:03:24.480> see

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
to torture pigs sometimes so you can see

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.530 
to torture pigs sometimes so you can see
them<00:03:24.750> spawning<00:03:25.110> in<00:03:25.410> there<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.209> I'm<00:03:27.209> going<00:03:27.510> to

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
them spawning in there and I'm going to

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.120 
them spawning in there and I'm going to
get<00:03:27.780> back<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.080> what<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.350> lever<00:03:28.620> does<00:03:28.890> in<00:03:29.040> a

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
get back to what that lever does in a

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.979 
get back to what that lever does in a
second<00:03:29.550> here<00:03:29.790> but<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.330> is<00:03:30.510> just<00:03:30.750> another

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
second here but this is just another

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.930 
second here but this is just another
thing<00:03:31.290> in<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.650> area<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.070> them<00:03:32.250> trying<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.820> do

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
thing in the area of them trying to do

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.580 
thing in the area of them trying to do
and<00:03:33.150> it's<00:03:33.269> kind<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.540> like<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.720> block<00:03:34.080> display

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
and it's kind of like a block display

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.860 
and it's kind of like a block display
type<00:03:34.860> thing<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.340> don't<00:03:35.910> know<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.330> just<00:03:36.570> made<00:03:36.810> it

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
type thing I don't know I just made it

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.750 
type thing I don't know I just made it
really<00:03:37.080> quick<00:03:37.470> with<00:03:37.800> some<00:03:37.830> Pistons<00:03:38.489> and

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
really quick with some Pistons and

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.449 
really quick with some Pistons and
obsidian<00:03:39.090> there<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.950> back<00:03:40.950> here<00:03:41.250> I'm<00:03:41.340> not

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
obsidian there and back here I'm not

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.009 
obsidian there and back here I'm not
gonna<00:03:41.700> actually<00:03:41.850> keep<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.300> portal<00:03:42.959> I'm

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
gonna actually keep that portal I'm

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.180 
gonna actually keep that portal I'm
probably<00:03:43.350> what<00:03:43.440> changed<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.010> something

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
probably what changed it to something

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.370 
probably what changed it to something
else<00:03:44.550> I'm<00:03:45.300> not<00:03:45.510> sure<00:03:45.690> what<00:03:45.840> I'm<00:03:45.959> gonna<00:03:46.110> put<00:03:46.200> in

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
else I'm not sure what I'm gonna put in

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.220 
else I'm not sure what I'm gonna put in
there<00:03:46.620> yet<00:03:46.830> I'm<00:03:47.040> thinking<00:03:47.070> maybe<00:03:47.550> like<00:03:48.230> some

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
there yet I'm thinking maybe like some

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.949 
there yet I'm thinking maybe like some
sort<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:50.269> don't<00:03:51.269> know<00:03:51.420> what<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.570> call<00:03:51.780> it

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
sort of I don't know what you call it

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.530 
sort of I don't know what you call it
like<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.370> testing<00:03:53.370> environment<00:03:54.000> where<00:03:54.450> you

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
like a testing environment where you

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.000 
like a testing environment where you
guys<00:03:54.660> just<00:03:54.930> go<00:03:55.050> through<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.440> series<00:03:55.980> of

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
guys just go through a series of

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.610 
guys just go through a series of
obstacles<00:03:56.730> or<00:03:57.150> something<00:03:57.510> right<00:03:58.140> here<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.350> pull

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
obstacles or something right here I pull

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.990 
obstacles or something right here I pull
the<00:03:58.739> lever<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.310> can<00:03:59.459> see<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.760> pigs

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
the lever and you can see the pigs

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.930 
the lever and you can see the pigs
falling<00:04:00.450> right<00:04:00.630> into<00:04:00.840> my<00:04:01.080> trap<00:04:01.410> there<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:01.980> a

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
falling right into my trap there and a

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.850 
falling right into my trap there and a
couple<00:04:03.239> more<00:04:03.450> will<00:04:03.780> be<00:04:03.900> spawning<00:04:04.230> here<00:04:04.650> yeah

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
couple more will be spawning here yeah

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.860 
couple more will be spawning here yeah
there's<00:04:05.340> another<00:04:05.580> one<00:04:05.850> you<00:04:06.090> know<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.750> going

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
there's another one you know just going

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.390 
there's another one you know just going
to<00:04:06.930> keep<00:04:07.110> pulling<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.620> lever<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.040> burning

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
to keep pulling the lever and burning

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.120 
to keep pulling the lever and burning
them<00:04:08.550> it's<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.239> very<00:04:10.170> entertaining<00:04:10.650> you

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
them it's a very entertaining you

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.410 
them it's a very entertaining you
wouldn't<00:04:11.370> think<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.580> would<00:04:11.700> be<00:04:11.790> that<00:04:11.970> fun<00:04:12.209> to

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
wouldn't think it would be that fun to

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.600 
wouldn't think it would be that fun to
just<00:04:12.630> kill<00:04:12.900> some<00:04:13.140> pigs<00:04:13.440> but<00:04:13.769> you'd<00:04:14.459> be

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
just kill some pigs but you'd be

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.840 
just kill some pigs but you'd be
surprised<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.239> simple<00:04:15.690> joys<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:17.700> can

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
surprised the simple joys and you can

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.789 
surprised the simple joys and you can
see<00:04:18.060> they're<00:04:18.239> just<00:04:18.269> keep<00:04:18.810> spawning<00:04:19.200> here<00:04:19.590> and

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
see they're just keep spawning here and

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.680 
see they're just keep spawning here and
I<00:04:19.979> think<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.340> will<00:04:20.489> kill<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.790> couple<00:04:21.180> more<00:04:21.390> here

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
I think I will kill a couple more here

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.940 
I think I will kill a couple more here
just<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.229> for<00:04:22.470> my<00:04:22.620> own<00:04:22.650> pleasure<00:04:22.979> but

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
just just for my own pleasure but

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.020 
just just for my own pleasure but
yeah<00:04:24.340> there<00:04:24.610> goes<00:04:24.640> some<00:04:25.060> there<00:04:26.010> but<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.910> know

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
yeah there goes some there but you know

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.760 
yeah there goes some there but you know
I<00:04:28.060> think<00:04:28.390> that's<00:04:28.600> pretty<00:04:28.870> much<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.380> for<00:04:29.560> that

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
I think that's pretty much it for that

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.010 
I think that's pretty much it for that
and<00:04:30.070> then<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.730> last<00:04:30.880> one<00:04:31.180> they're<00:04:31.480> just<00:04:31.870> going

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
and then the last one they're just going

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.560 
and then the last one they're just going
to<00:04:32.080> close<00:04:32.290> it<00:04:32.530> up<00:04:32.650> and<00:04:33.060> yeah<00:04:34.060> now<00:04:34.240> I'm<00:04:34.300> going<00:04:34.510> to

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
to close it up and yeah now I'm going to

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.880 
to close it up and yeah now I'm going to
show<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.960> thing<00:04:35.140> that<00:04:35.170> took<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.650> most

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
show you the thing that took the most

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.160 
show you the thing that took the most
time<00:04:36.040> in<00:04:36.430> here<00:04:36.730> and<00:04:36.940> I'm<00:04:37.360> still<00:04:37.660> working<00:04:37.840> on

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
time in here and I'm still working on

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.550 
time in here and I'm still working on
right<00:04:39.070> now<00:04:39.100> it's<00:04:39.730> not<00:04:40.270> really<00:04:40.690> close<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.350> being

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
right now it's not really close to being

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.430 
right now it's not really close to being
done<00:04:42.060> but<00:04:43.060> you<00:04:43.180> can<00:04:43.330> get<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.720> idea<00:04:44.110> of<00:04:44.230> what

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
done but you can get the idea of what

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.810 
done but you can get the idea of what
I'm<00:04:44.560> what<00:04:44.950> I'm<00:04:45.040> going<00:04:45.220> to<00:04:45.250> be<00:04:45.340> doing<00:04:45.640> with<00:04:45.790> it

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
I'm what I'm going to be doing with it

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.960 
I'm what I'm going to be doing with it
and<00:04:46.120> basically<00:04:46.780> it's<00:04:47.230> a<00:04:47.320> giant<00:04:47.620> crater<00:04:48.070> I'm

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
and basically it's a giant crater I'm

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.740 
and basically it's a giant crater I'm
not<00:04:49.180> sure<00:04:49.420> the<00:04:49.570> size<00:04:49.780> I<00:04:50.020> think<00:04:50.080> it's<00:04:50.350> 32<00:04:51.340> wide

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
not sure the size I think it's 32 wide

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.540 
not sure the size I think it's 32 wide
not<00:04:52.750> sure<00:04:52.960> how<00:04:53.200> far<00:04:53.440> back<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.950> goes<00:04:53.980> I'm<00:04:54.340> going

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
not sure how far back it goes I'm going

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.300 
not sure how far back it goes I'm going
to<00:04:54.610> have<00:04:54.730> to<00:04:54.880> measure<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.330> later<00:04:55.660> but<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.860> have

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
to have to measure that later but I have

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.300 
to have to measure that later but I have
mined<00:04:57.580> out<00:04:57.790> all<00:04:58.060> this<00:04:58.360> legit<00:04:58.990> with<00:04:59.680> my<00:04:59.890> pickaxe

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
mined out all this legit with my pickaxe

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.730 
mined out all this legit with my pickaxe
there<00:05:00.790> and<00:05:01.060> it's<00:05:01.390> it's<00:05:01.690> all<00:05:01.900> taken<00:05:02.500> forever

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
there and it's it's all taken forever

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.040 
there and it's it's all taken forever
you<00:05:03.190> know<00:05:03.310> just<00:05:03.940> doing<00:05:04.210> two<00:05:04.390> layers<00:05:04.660> of<00:05:04.780> that

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
you know just doing two layers of that

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.530 
you know just doing two layers of that
almost<00:05:05.350> takes<00:05:05.620> an<00:05:05.800> hour<00:05:05.950> so<00:05:06.340> pretty<00:05:07.120> much<00:05:07.300> what

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
almost takes an hour so pretty much what

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.300 
almost takes an hour so pretty much what
I've<00:05:07.660> been<00:05:07.750> doing<00:05:08.140> to<00:05:08.350> get<00:05:08.470> that<00:05:08.650> cleared<00:05:09.010> was

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
I've been doing to get that cleared was

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.910 
I've been doing to get that cleared was
spending<00:05:09.850> like<00:05:10.090> you<00:05:10.930> know<00:05:11.020> just<00:05:11.290> a<00:05:11.500> little<00:05:11.800> bit

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
spending like you know just a little bit

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.860 
spending like you know just a little bit
of<00:05:12.160> every<00:05:12.670> couple<00:05:13.000> days<00:05:13.150> just<00:05:13.210> coming<00:05:13.840> down

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
of every couple days just coming down

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.380 
of every couple days just coming down
here<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:14.380> mining<00:05:14.740> some<00:05:14.980> stone<00:05:15.040> out<00:05:15.670> and<00:05:15.940> I

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
here and mining some stone out and I

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.090 
here and mining some stone out and I
will<00:05:16.570> show<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:16.930> leaderboards<00:05:17.500> later<00:05:17.740> on<00:05:17.920> in

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
will show the leaderboards later on in

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.740 
will show the leaderboards later on in
this<00:05:18.190> video<00:05:18.400> show<00:05:18.760> that's<00:05:19.000> all<00:05:19.240> 100%

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
this video show that's all 100%

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.220 
this video show that's all 100%
legitimate<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:21.460> didn't<00:05:22.090> use<00:05:22.210> TNT<00:05:22.720> or<00:05:22.930> any<00:05:23.080> of

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
legitimate I didn't use TNT or any of

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.860 
legitimate I didn't use TNT or any of
that<00:05:23.380> to<00:05:23.530> clear<00:05:23.770> any<00:05:23.950> of<00:05:24.070> this<00:05:24.190> out<00:05:24.570> it<00:05:25.570> was<00:05:25.690> all

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
that to clear any of this out it was all

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.840 
that to clear any of this out it was all
done<00:05:26.080> just<00:05:26.440> by<00:05:26.620> hand<00:05:26.980> pretty<00:05:27.340> much<00:05:27.580> by<00:05:27.820> myself

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
done just by hand pretty much by myself

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.380 
done just by hand pretty much by myself
no<00:05:28.660> one<00:05:28.810> else<00:05:28.990> came<00:05:29.290> in<00:05:29.350> this<00:05:29.620> world<00:05:30.240> you<00:05:31.240> know

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
no one else came in this world you know

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.000 
no one else came in this world you know
everything<00:05:31.930> was<00:05:32.110> done<00:05:32.290> by<00:05:32.350> me<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:32.710> here

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
everything was done by me and here

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.520 
everything was done by me and here
pretty<00:05:33.190> much<00:05:33.280> and<00:05:33.760> how<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:34.720> was<00:05:34.990> doing<00:05:35.170> it<00:05:35.440> was

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
pretty much and how I was doing it was

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.290 
pretty much and how I was doing it was
just<00:05:35.560> like<00:05:35.950> layer<00:05:36.220> by<00:05:36.430> layer<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:37.000> right<00:05:37.150> here

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
just like layer by layer so right here

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.610 
just like layer by layer so right here
I'm<00:05:37.360> just<00:05:37.420> going<00:05:37.600> to<00:05:37.690> cut<00:05:37.870> down<00:05:38.080> basically

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
I'm just going to cut down basically

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.740 
I'm just going to cut down basically
just<00:05:38.950> like<00:05:39.100> this<00:05:39.280> you<00:05:39.580> know<00:05:39.730> two<00:05:40.450> at<00:05:40.600> a<00:05:40.630> time

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
just like this you know two at a time

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.220 
just like this you know two at a time
and<00:05:41.290> it<00:05:42.160> takes<00:05:42.430> forever<00:05:42.730> guys<00:05:43.090> like<00:05:43.480> you<00:05:44.080> might

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
and it takes forever guys like you might

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.840 
and it takes forever guys like you might
not<00:05:44.410> think<00:05:44.650> that<00:05:44.890> would<00:05:45.040> take<00:05:45.190> as<00:05:45.370> long<00:05:45.580> as<00:05:45.730> it

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
not think that would take as long as it

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.870 
not think that would take as long as it
does<00:05:46.060> but<00:05:46.720> just<00:05:46.870> imagine<00:05:47.050> clearing<00:05:47.770> that<00:05:47.950> all

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
does but just imagine clearing that all

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.000 
does but just imagine clearing that all
the<00:05:49.120> way<00:05:49.240> down<00:05:49.480> you<00:05:49.870> know<00:05:49.990> it<00:05:50.290> takes<00:05:50.800> forever

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
the way down you know it takes forever

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.950 
the way down you know it takes forever
basically<00:05:51.820> but<00:05:52.060> right<00:05:52.660> here<00:05:52.690> I'm<00:05:52.930> just

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
basically but right here I'm just

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.590 
basically but right here I'm just
showing<00:05:53.170> the<00:05:53.470> leaderboards<00:05:54.100> um<00:05:54.570> not<00:05:55.570> exactly

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
showing the leaderboards um not exactly

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.260 
showing the leaderboards um not exactly
sure<00:05:56.440> how<00:05:56.860> much<00:05:57.070> blocks<00:05:57.400> it<00:05:57.610> says<00:05:57.790> there<00:05:58.060> I

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
sure how much blocks it says there I

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.640 
sure how much blocks it says there I
don't<00:05:58.720> know<00:05:58.810> if<00:05:58.900> you<00:05:58.990> guys<00:05:59.110> will<00:05:59.290> be<00:05:59.320> able<00:05:59.410> to

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
don't know if you guys will be able to

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.500 
don't know if you guys will be able to
see<00:05:59.740> that<00:05:59.890> but<00:06:00.130> it's<00:06:00.490> in<00:06:00.670> the<00:06:00.820> thousands<00:06:01.330> it's

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
see that but it's in the thousands it's

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.840 
see that but it's in the thousands it's
like<00:06:01.660> sixty<00:06:02.110> thousand<00:06:02.620> something<00:06:02.890> you<00:06:03.730> know

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
like sixty thousand something you know

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.060 
like sixty thousand something you know
it's<00:06:04.030> just<00:06:04.210> some<00:06:04.450> ridiculous<00:06:05.320> number<00:06:05.350> it's

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
it's just some ridiculous number it's

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.420 
it's just some ridiculous number it's
pretty<00:06:06.760> huge<00:06:07.090> but<00:06:07.560> yet<00:06:08.560> that's<00:06:08.830> pretty<00:06:09.220> much

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
pretty huge but yet that's pretty much

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.420 
pretty huge but yet that's pretty much
it<00:06:09.820> so<00:06:10.600> far<00:06:10.930> that<00:06:11.620> I've<00:06:11.740> done<00:06:11.890> in<00:06:12.040> this<00:06:12.190> lab

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
it so far that I've done in this lab

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.740 
it so far that I've done in this lab
area<00:06:12.850> what<00:06:13.090> I<00:06:13.120> think<00:06:13.390> I'm<00:06:13.480> going<00:06:13.630> to<00:06:13.660> be

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
area what I think I'm going to be

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.140 
area what I think I'm going to be
putting<00:06:13.990> down<00:06:14.320> here<00:06:14.680> is<00:06:14.950> a<00:06:14.980> sort<00:06:15.850> of<00:06:15.970> like<00:06:16.120> a

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
putting down here is a sort of like a

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.690 
putting down here is a sort of like a
village<00:06:16.660> type<00:06:17.050> thing<00:06:17.380> I'm<00:06:17.950> not<00:06:18.130> sure<00:06:18.190> exactly

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
village type thing I'm not sure exactly

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.790 
village type thing I'm not sure exactly
I<00:06:18.940> might<00:06:19.150> do<00:06:19.270> some<00:06:19.480> pixel<00:06:19.900> arts<00:06:20.140> down<00:06:20.350> here

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
I might do some pixel arts down here

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.950 
I might do some pixel arts down here
something<00:06:21.670> along<00:06:21.880> those<00:06:22.120> lines<00:06:22.300> I<00:06:22.810> don't

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
something along those lines I don't

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.660 
something along those lines I don't
really<00:06:23.170> like<00:06:23.350> the<00:06:23.530> idea<00:06:23.830> of<00:06:23.890> having<00:06:24.100> pixel

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
really like the idea of having pixel

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.430 
really like the idea of having pixel
arts<00:06:24.880> just<00:06:25.030> floating<00:06:25.510> around<00:06:25.600> my<00:06:25.900> world<00:06:26.110> so<00:06:26.380> I

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
arts just floating around my world so I

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.260 
arts just floating around my world so I
kind<00:06:26.920> of<00:06:26.950> got<00:06:27.160> the<00:06:27.310> idea<00:06:27.340> that<00:06:27.700> you<00:06:28.150> know

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
kind of got the idea that you know

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.200 
kind of got the idea that you know
making<00:06:28.510> an<00:06:28.720> underground<00:06:29.110> might<00:06:29.380> be<00:06:29.500> cool<00:06:29.710> and

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
making an underground might be cool and

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.730 
making an underground might be cool and
that<00:06:31.210> was<00:06:31.270> before<00:06:31.720> I<00:06:31.750> realized<00:06:32.050> how<00:06:32.560> much

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
that was before I realized how much

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.400 
that was before I realized how much
space<00:06:33.040> pixel<00:06:33.520> arts<00:06:33.760> actually<00:06:34.240> need<00:06:34.480> and

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
space pixel arts actually need and

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.870 
space pixel arts actually need and
it's<00:06:35.590> it's<00:06:35.950> a<00:06:36.070> lot<00:06:36.220> more<00:06:36.460> than<00:06:36.640> you<00:06:36.760> would

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
it's it's a lot more than you would

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.460 
it's it's a lot more than you would
think<00:06:36.910> there's<00:06:37.270> a<00:06:37.330> reason<00:06:37.690> why<00:06:37.810> everyone<00:06:38.140> does

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
think there's a reason why everyone does

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.610 
think there's a reason why everyone does
it<00:06:38.590> above<00:06:38.830> ground<00:06:39.060> but<00:06:40.060> yes<00:06:40.960> I'm<00:06:41.290> thinking

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
it above ground but yes I'm thinking

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.680 
it above ground but yes I'm thinking
maybe<00:06:41.800> might<00:06:42.550> make<00:06:42.730> a<00:06:42.760> little<00:06:43.060> village<00:06:43.270> down

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
maybe might make a little village down

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.420 
maybe might make a little village down
there<00:06:43.750> with<00:06:44.170> a<00:06:44.200> mansion<00:06:44.740> or<00:06:44.920> something<00:06:45.280> like
