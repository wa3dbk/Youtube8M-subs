00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.140
 video 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.420
 for the first design that is very easy 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.250
 of doing and for all the designs are going 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.079
 to apply a protective base to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
 protect the enamel nails that we 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.100
 we are going to put over then they are going to 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.320
 apply a back in black 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.570
 can use any is parts that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.790
 you have in your house are going to 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.800
 apply one or two layers to me I always 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.570
 like to apply two layers of enamel 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.910
 for him to stand out even more 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.220
 with a thin brochita what they are going to 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.430
 do is going to dip the enamel 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.890
 red to make the mouth and to do it 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.050
 in clients are going to use a paint 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.629
 white acrylic can also 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.460
 use white enamel is very to your liking not 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.710
 forget to apply a protective shine 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.130
 so that this design lasts a lot 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.130
 more time 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.170
 for design number 2 which is very easy 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.870
 of doing are going to be unique with 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.310
 blood and for this design the first thing that 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.350
 they will do is apply their base 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.540
 protective we are going to apply a 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.550
 enamel in white and go to the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.460
 dotted region immerse it in enamel 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.950
 red make like a wheel and drag 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.540
 the container down like so that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.600
 it seems that the blood is draining 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.310
 that and for the other fingers is a step 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.220
 optional can do another design 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.960
 different are going to get Vaseline or tape 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.750
 adhesive so they will not stain 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.770
 all the fingers are going to dip their straw 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.630
 in bismarck of red and they will blow you 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.850
 then the adhesive tape will be removed 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.310
 and they are going to clean their fingers very well 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.310
 so that the ones hooked with the enamel 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.470
 for the third design that is very easy 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.020
 to do and very fun to apply 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.360
 its protective base then accumulated and it 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.399
 they are going to apply a white enamel 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.069
 at the edge of their nails are going to 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:14.450
 apply enamel in black and with a 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.700
 brush and an acrylic paint sconce and 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.540
 also for the little eyes they will use a 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.090
 striker and for the center of the eyes 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.360
 they are going to use white enamel and again 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.269
 that with the smallest counter they can 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.190
 use a black polish again to 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.709
 that the eyes look a little more real 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.140

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.330

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.430

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.610
