00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.800

we're not all aware of where all of that
came<00:00:40.420> from<00:00:40.450> and<00:00:40.960> it's<00:00:41.410> a<00:00:41.530> story<00:00:41.830> that's<00:00:41.950> really

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
came from and it's a story that's really

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:53.020 
came from and it's a story that's really
particular<00:00:43.210> to<00:00:43.360> this<00:00:43.480> country

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.660 

I'm<00:00:54.020> a<00:00:54.079> cyclist<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:54.739> I<00:00:54.829> wasn't<00:00:55.100> aware<00:00:55.340> of<00:00:55.399> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
I'm a cyclist and I wasn't aware of the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.910 
I'm a cyclist and I wasn't aware of the
fact<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.449> bicycle<00:00:56.840> as<00:00:56.930> we<00:00:57.110> know<00:00:57.350> it<00:00:57.559> the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
fact that the bicycle as we know it the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.979 
fact that the bicycle as we know it the
design<00:00:58.280> for<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:58.850> was<00:00:59.059> actually<00:00:59.420> invented<00:00:59.840> in

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
design for it was actually invented in

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.170 
design for it was actually invented in
Coventry<00:01:00.649> in<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.829> late<00:01:00.980> 19th<00:01:01.460> century<00:01:01.550> and

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
Coventry in the late 19th century and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.030 
Coventry in the late 19th century and
let's<00:01:02.390> just<00:01:02.570> down<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.930> road<00:01:03.079> from<00:01:03.320> me<00:01:03.559> that

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
let's just down the road from me that

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.950 
let's just down the road from me that
made<00:01:04.220> me<00:01:04.339> think<00:01:04.489> well<00:01:04.820> if<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.390> don't<00:01:05.449> know<00:01:05.720> that

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
made me think well if I don't know that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.359 
made me think well if I don't know that
there's<00:01:06.320> probably<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.619> lot<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:06.799> other<00:01:06.979> people

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
there's probably a lot of other people

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.260 
there's probably a lot of other people
who<00:01:07.670> don't<00:01:07.820> know<00:01:08.030> it<00:01:08.150> either<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:13.149> think<00:01:14.149> we're

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
who don't know it either I think we're

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.760 
who don't know it either I think we're
making<00:01:14.450> something<00:01:14.840> that's<00:01:15.020> quite<00:01:15.320> unique

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
making something that's quite unique

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.340 
making something that's quite unique
there's<00:01:16.490> quite<00:01:16.729> definitive<00:01:17.360> it's<00:01:18.140> going<00:01:18.290> to

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
there's quite definitive it's going to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.380 
there's quite definitive it's going to
be<00:01:18.409> full<00:01:18.710> of<00:01:18.740> some<00:01:19.130> very<00:01:19.430> special<00:01:19.610> things<00:01:20.119> and

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
be full of some very special things and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.389 
be full of some very special things and
I<00:01:20.600> think<00:01:20.659> it<00:01:20.869> will<00:01:20.960> appeal<00:01:21.290> right<00:01:21.950> across<00:01:22.190> the

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
I think it will appeal right across the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.609 
I think it will appeal right across the
board<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.820> both<00:01:23.000> keen<00:01:23.690> cyclists<00:01:24.350> but<00:01:24.470> also

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
board to both keen cyclists but also

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.200 
board to both keen cyclists but also
those<00:01:24.950> who<00:01:25.009> are<00:01:25.220> just<00:01:25.399> intrigued<00:01:25.940> about

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
those who are just intrigued about

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.760 
those who are just intrigued about
what's<00:01:27.140> all<00:01:27.289> this<00:01:27.470> stuff<00:01:27.649> about<00:01:27.770> cycling<00:01:29.770> well

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
what's all this stuff about cycling well

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.800 
what's all this stuff about cycling well
we<00:01:30.890> like<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.220> have<00:01:31.369> heroes<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:32.090> films<00:01:32.420> don't<00:01:32.659> we

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
we like to have heroes in films don't we

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.630 
we like to have heroes in films don't we
and<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.229> think<00:01:33.440> our<00:01:33.590> hero<00:01:33.830> is<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.250> bicycle

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
and I think our hero is the bicycle

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.980 
and I think our hero is the bicycle
that's<00:01:34.909> our<00:01:35.119> lead<00:01:35.330> character<00:01:35.659> if<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.289> like

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
that's our lead character if you like

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.330 
that's our lead character if you like
there<00:01:38.990> are<00:01:39.080> three<00:01:39.259> sort<00:01:39.710> of<00:01:39.740> course<00:01:40.009> strands

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
there are three sort of course strands

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.090 
there are three sort of course strands
to<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.759> film<00:01:41.000> which<00:01:41.270> are<00:01:41.479> design<00:01:41.899> sport<00:01:42.800> and

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
to the film which are design sport and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.340 
to the film which are design sport and
transport<00:01:43.819> and<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.270> bike<00:01:44.450> cuts<00:01:44.899> across<00:01:45.110> all

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
transport and the bike cuts across all

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.020 
transport and the bike cuts across all
of<00:01:45.560> those<00:01:45.740> things<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:46.640> what<00:01:46.789> we'll<00:01:46.909> be

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
of those things and so what we'll be

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.180 
of those things and so what we'll be
doing<00:01:47.360> is<00:01:47.479> taking<00:01:47.899> people<00:01:48.110> who<00:01:48.500> are<00:01:48.890> involved

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
doing is taking people who are involved

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.029 
doing is taking people who are involved
in<00:01:49.550> those<00:01:49.729> areas<00:01:50.330> today<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.140> telling<00:01:51.800> their
