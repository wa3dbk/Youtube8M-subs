first<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.179> all<00:00:15.240> how<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.540> works<00:00:15.780> or<00:00:16.560> how<00:00:16.619> i

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
first of all how it works or how i

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.790 
first of all how it works or how i
believe<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.850> supposed<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> work<00:00:18.800> and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
believe it's supposed to work and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.910 
believe it's supposed to work and
actually<00:00:20.189> what<00:00:20.340> happened<00:00:21.619> for<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.740> not

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
actually what happened for it not

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.800 
function in a sense this is this is two
separate<00:00:26.640> circuits<00:00:27.060> there's<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.390> circuit<00:00:27.750> on

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
separate circuits there's a circuit on

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.019 
separate circuits there's a circuit on
the<00:00:27.869> left<00:00:28.019> hand<00:00:28.170> side<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.460> which<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
switches this transistor on okay that

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.869 
switches this transistor on okay that
there<00:00:43.680> should<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> voltage<00:00:44.309> between<00:00:44.460> here

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
there should be a voltage between here

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.340 
there should be a voltage between here
and<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.210> which<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.570> enough<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.840> turn<00:00:46.200> this

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
transistor on Venus transistor turns on

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.650 
transistor on Venus transistor turns on
it<00:00:49.020> makes<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.379> conduction<00:00:49.739> part<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> switch

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
it makes a conduction part like a switch

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.590 
it makes a conduction part like a switch
across<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:52.070> okay<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.820> allows<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
across here okay and that allows the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.380 
across here okay and that allows the
voltage<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> capacitor<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.699> come<00:00:57.090> through

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
voltage in the capacitor to come through

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.520 
voltage in the capacitor to come through
this<00:00:57.510> transistor<00:00:58.160> which<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.309> also<00:00:59.460> turned<00:00:59.850> on

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
this transistor which is also turned on

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.130 
this transistor which is also turned on
by<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> fact<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.010> one's<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:03.140> down

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
by the fact that this one's on down

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140 
by the fact that this one's on down
through<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.650> transistor<00:01:05.129> down<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.939> one

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
through this transistor down to this one

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.080 
through this transistor down to this one
which<00:01:06.270> turns<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.630> transistor<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.909> okay<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
which turns this transistor on okay and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.460 
which turns this transistor on okay and
these<00:01:09.180> two<00:01:09.390> transistors<00:01:09.600> being<00:01:10.140> turned<00:01:10.380> on

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
these two transistors being turned on

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.810 
these two transistors being turned on
that<00:01:13.470> allows<00:01:13.740> current<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.159> flow<00:01:14.220> from<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
that allows current to flow from the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.480 
that allows current to flow from the
capacitor<00:01:15.330> down<00:01:15.890> through<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> transistor

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
capacitor down through the transistor

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.980 
capacitor down through the transistor
through<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> coil<00:01:18.060> through<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> second

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
through the coil through the second

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.170 
through the coil through the second
transistor<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.280> back<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> capacitor

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
transistor and back to the capacitor

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.450 
transistor and back to the capacitor
okay<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.560> basically<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
okay so basically what you get is a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.800 
okay so basically what you get is a
pulse<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.150> which<00:01:24.390> turns<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
pulse in here which turns this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.080 
pulse in here which turns this
transistor<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:26.130> transistor<00:01:26.520> turning<00:01:26.970> on

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
transistor on that transistor turning on

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.749 
transistor on that transistor turning on
turns<00:01:27.540> these<00:01:27.780> two<00:01:27.990> transistors<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.650> those<00:01:29.490> two

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
turns these two transistors on those two

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.280 
turns these two transistors on those two
transistors<00:01:30.180> allow<00:01:30.600> current<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> flow

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
transistors allow current to flow

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.249 
transistors allow current to flow
through<00:01:31.650> here<00:01:31.890> switching<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> coil<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:34.049> coil

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
through here switching the coil the coil

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
through here switching the coil the coil
then<00:01:34.500> produces<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> pulse<00:01:35.220> which<00:01:35.460> repels<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
then produces a pulse which repels the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.719 
then produces a pulse which repels the
magnet<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.439> brief<00:01:37.799> magnetic<00:01:38.250> field<00:01:38.460> pulse

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
magnet it's a brief magnetic field pulse

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.819 
magnet it's a brief magnetic field pulse
repels<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> magnet<00:01:40.020> sends<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> motor<00:01:40.530> off<00:01:40.619> on

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
repels the magnet sends the motor off on

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.100 
repels the magnet sends the motor off on
its<00:01:40.979> way<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:42.119> collapse<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.659> field<00:01:42.960> as

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.389 
actually achieve turning this transistor
on<00:02:00.509> maybe<00:02:01.049> because<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.680> coil<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.250> too

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
on maybe because the coil is just too

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.880 
on maybe because the coil is just too
small<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.990> had<00:02:03.990> maybe<00:02:04.200> three<00:02:04.619> or<00:02:04.649> four<00:02:04.799> hundred

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
small I had maybe three or four hundred

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 
small I had maybe three or four hundred
turns<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.520> whole<00:02:05.759> perhaps<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.329> requires

turns on the whole perhaps it requires

turns on the whole perhaps it requires
several<00:02:07.110> thousand<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.680> don't<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.190> just

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
several thousand I don't know I just

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.460 
several thousand I don't know I just
couldn't<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.539> enough<00:02:09.660> energy<00:02:09.810> out<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.349> to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
couldn't get enough energy out this to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.140 
couldn't get enough energy out this to

turn this transistor on

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.490

so<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.300> circuit<00:02:14.630> didn't<00:02:14.810> get<00:02:14.930> started<00:02:15.350> so

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
so the circuit didn't get started so

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.160 
so the circuit didn't get started so
what<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.650> did<00:02:15.740> was<00:02:16.570> actually<00:02:17.570> applied<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.840> small

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
what I did was actually applied a small

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.930 
what I did was actually applied a small
voltage<00:02:18.530> across<00:02:18.680> here<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.640> turn<00:02:19.820> the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
voltage across here to turn the

transistor<00:02:20.390> on<00:02:20.510> manually<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.490> when<00:02:22.490> I<00:02:22.520> did

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
transistor on manually and when I did

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.690 
transistor on manually and when I did
that<00:02:22.820> what<00:02:23.480> happens<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.340> thing<00:02:25.550> broke

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
that what happens is the thing broke

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.990 
that what happens is the thing broke
into<00:02:26.120> what's<00:02:26.270> called<00:02:26.330> parasitic<00:02:27.050> oscillation

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
what happened was that the trigger

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.270 
what happened was that the trigger
circuit<00:02:35.150> over<00:02:35.540> here<00:02:35.810> triggered<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.070> main

ended<00:02:51.020> up<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.320> parasitic<00:02:51.800> oscillation<00:02:52.250> which

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
ended up the parasitic oscillation which

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.000 
ended up the parasitic oscillation which
just<00:02:52.610> drained<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.090> capacitor<00:02:53.800> which<00:02:54.800> was

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
just drained the capacitor which was

I<00:03:02.180> think<00:03:02.330> if<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:02.660> don't<00:03:02.960> mean<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.410> can<00:03:03.560> see

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
I think if you don't mean that I can see

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.090 
I think if you don't mean that I can see
no<00:03:03.920> reason<00:03:04.040> why<00:03:04.190> they<00:03:04.370> shouldn't<00:03:04.610> work

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
no reason why they shouldn't work

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.200 
no reason why they shouldn't work
personally<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.130> think<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.370> prefer<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.820> use<00:03:07.940> Fe

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
personally I think I prefer to use Fe

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.680 
personally I think I prefer to use Fe
tease<00:03:08.390> rather<00:03:08.720> than<00:03:08.930> bipolar<00:03:09.620> transistors<00:03:10.690> if

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
tease rather than bipolar transistors if

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.330 
tease rather than bipolar transistors if
i<00:03:11.870> was<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.050> redesign<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.680> which<00:03:12.800> I'm<00:03:12.950> not<00:03:13.130> going

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
i was to redesign it which I'm not going

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.670 
i was to redesign it which I'm not going
to<00:03:13.400> spend<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.670> time<00:03:13.820> do<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:17.230> again<00:03:18.230> an<00:03:18.350> f<00:03:18.440> ET

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
to spend the time do and again an f ET

on<00:03:18.770> they<00:03:18.920> would<00:03:19.010> probably<00:03:19.250> help<00:03:19.340> as<00:03:19.550> well<00:03:19.670> so

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
on they would probably help as well so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.729 
on they would probably help as well so
and<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.780> course<00:03:20.810> something<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.260> bit<00:03:21.350> larger<00:03:21.709> so

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
and of course something a bit larger so

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.130 
and of course something a bit larger so
you<00:03:21.890> can<00:03:22.010> take<00:03:22.160> much<00:03:22.310> more<00:03:22.340> current<00:03:22.850> and

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
you can take much more current and

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.460 
you can take much more current and
perhaps<00:03:24.140> start<00:03:24.500> with<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> higher<00:03:24.830> voltage<00:03:26.470> but

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
perhaps start with a higher voltage but

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.440 
perhaps start with a higher voltage but
I'm<00:03:28.130> not<00:03:28.340> convinced<00:03:28.520> I<00:03:28.850> think<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.180> was<00:03:29.300> you

I'm not convinced I think it was you

I'm not convinced I think it was you

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
know it was an interesting experiment

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.580 
know it was an interesting experiment
and<00:03:31.300> and<00:03:32.300> didn't<00:03:32.840> didn't<00:03:33.170> actually<00:03:33.290> work<00:03:34.239> and

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
and and didn't didn't actually work and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.960 
and and didn't didn't actually work and
what<00:03:36.590> fundamentally<00:03:37.130> I<00:03:37.160> bought<00:03:37.340> two<00:03:37.370> cause<00:03:37.760> of

what fundamentally I bought two cause of

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.630 
what fundamentally I bought two cause of
wire<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.180> our<00:03:38.510> driveway<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:38.989> several<00:03:39.290> coils

from<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.880> wire<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.060> bought<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.890> last<00:03:43.100> coil

from the wire I bought and the last coil
which<00:03:43.520> I<00:03:43.640> showed<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:43.970> my<00:03:44.090> last<00:03:44.120> video<00:03:44.709> was<00:03:45.940> was

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
which I showed you my last video was was

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.520 
which I showed you my last video was was
almost<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.360> end<00:03:47.450> of<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.690> court<00:03:47.900> of<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.140> you

almost the end of the court of the you

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.920 
almost the end of the court of the you
know<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.739> cause<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:48.920> wire<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:49.550> I<00:03:49.810> don't<00:03:50.810> have

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
know the cause of wire so I don't have

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.360 
know the cause of wire so I don't have
in<00:03:50.989> your<00:03:51.080> wire<00:03:51.380> anyway<00:03:51.530> even<00:03:51.739> if<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.070> wanted<00:03:52.310> to

in your wire anyway even if I wanted to

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.310 
in your wire anyway even if I wanted to
build<00:03:52.520> another<00:03:52.730> one<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:53.000> try<00:03:53.209> again<00:03:53.330> but<00:03:54.230> I've

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
build another one and try again but I've

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.130 
build another one and try again but I've
kind<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.530> given<00:03:54.620> up<00:03:54.800> for<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.040> now<00:03:56.050> but<00:03:57.050> I

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
kind of given up for that now but I

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.390 
kind of given up for that now but I
thought<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.350> should<00:03:57.530> just<00:03:57.739> explain<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.280> you

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
thought I should just explain to you

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.100 
thought I should just explain to you
what<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:59.180> problem<00:03:59.209> was<00:03:59.540> so<00:03:59.720> if<00:03:59.780> you<00:03:59.870> are<00:03:59.989> going

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
what the problem was so if you are going

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.320 
what the problem was so if you are going
to<00:04:00.200> do<00:04:00.260> this<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:01.670> might<00:04:01.790> want<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:01.970> spend<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.209> lot

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
to do this you might want to spend a lot

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.770 
to do this you might want to spend a lot
of<00:04:02.360> time<00:04:02.450> making<00:04:03.200> sure<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.739> these<00:04:03.830> coils

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
of time making sure that these coils

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.410 
of time making sure that these coils
have<00:04:05.780> lots<00:04:06.020> of<00:04:06.140> turns<00:04:06.380> on<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.970> did<00:04:07.970> try<00:04:08.120> putting

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
have lots of turns on I did try putting

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.759 
have lots of turns on I did try putting
some<00:04:08.450> iron<00:04:08.780> in<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:08.989> center<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.380> course<00:04:09.620> as

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
some iron in the center of the course as

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.500 
some iron in the center of the course as
well<00:04:09.800> all<00:04:10.100> that<00:04:10.280> did<00:04:10.430> was<00:04:10.459> cause<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.090> magnets

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
well all that did was cause the magnets

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.810 
well all that did was cause the magnets
to<00:04:11.600> be<00:04:11.720> attracted<00:04:12.080> to<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.200> coil<00:04:12.470> and<00:04:13.130> given

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
to be attracted to the coil and given

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.949 
to be attracted to the coil and given
that<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:14.030> purpose<00:04:14.330> of<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.510> coil<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:14.840> to

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
that the purpose of the coil is to

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.840 
that the purpose of the coil is to
repeal<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.200> magnets<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:15.850> wasn't

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
repeal the magnets that wasn't

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.990 
repeal the magnets that wasn't
stunningly<00:04:17.239> useful<00:04:18.700> so<00:04:19.700> that<00:04:19.850> was

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
stunningly useful so that was

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.290 
stunningly useful so that was
unsuccessful

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
unsuccessful

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.600 
unsuccessful
and<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:24.350> only<00:04:24.470> conclusion<00:04:24.710> I<00:04:25.070> can<00:04:25.130> draw<00:04:25.280> is

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
and the only conclusion I can draw is

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.510 
and the only conclusion I can draw is
that<00:04:25.930> it<00:04:26.930> could<00:04:27.199> possibly<00:04:27.380> work<00:04:27.770> with<00:04:28.430> the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
that it could possibly work with the

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.730 
that it could possibly work with the
right<00:04:28.669> size<00:04:28.880> coil<00:04:29.180> but<00:04:30.139> I'm<00:04:30.260> very<00:04:30.440> worried

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
right size coil but I'm very worried

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.900 
right size coil but I'm very worried
about<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.010> feedback<00:04:31.340> path<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.820> the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
about the feedback path and the

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.890 
about the feedback path and the
parasitic<00:04:32.360> oscillation<00:04:34.389> which<00:04:35.389> basically

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
parasitic oscillation which basically

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.629 
parasitic oscillation which basically
makes<00:04:36.199> activates<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:36.979> circuit<00:04:37.310> without<00:04:37.370> the

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
makes activates the circuit without the

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.790 
makes activates the circuit without the
Magnus<00:04:37.910> being<00:04:38.150> present<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:39.410> that<00:04:39.470> in<00:04:39.710> itself

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
Magnus being present and that in itself

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.189 
Magnus being present and that in itself
drains<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.639> energy<00:04:41.030> from<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.510> power<00:04:41.930> source

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
drains the energy from the power source

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.659 
drains the energy from the power source
rather<00:04:42.590> than<00:04:42.770> providing<00:04:43.160> energy<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.639> the

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
rather than providing energy to the

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.750 
rather than providing energy to the
power<00:04:43.970> source<00:04:45.010> so<00:04:46.010> if<00:04:46.100> it<00:04:46.190> did<00:04:46.340> have<00:04:46.460> any<00:04:46.550> hope

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
power source so if it did have any hope

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.030 
power source so if it did have any hope
of<00:04:46.880> working<00:04:47.060> you'd<00:04:47.419> have<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:47.720> somehow<00:04:48.040> prevent

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
of working you'd have to somehow prevent

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.210 
of working you'd have to somehow prevent
it<00:04:49.340> from<00:04:49.460> oscillating<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.990> guess<00:04:51.620> by<00:04:51.800> slugging

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
it from oscillating I guess by slugging

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.870 
it from oscillating I guess by slugging
some<00:04:52.430> pot<00:04:52.610> circuit<00:04:53.150> made<00:04:53.360> with<00:04:53.540> a<00:04:53.570> capacitor

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.279 

maybe<00:04:58.880> by<00:04:59.090> having<00:04:59.360> two<00:04:59.510> separate<00:04:59.840> circuits

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
maybe by having two separate circuits

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.640 
maybe by having two separate circuits
which<00:05:01.250> are<00:05:01.370> independent<00:05:01.580> of<00:05:01.910> each<00:05:02.000> other<00:05:02.180> and

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
which are independent of each other and

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.840 
which are independent of each other and
some<00:05:03.650> sort<00:05:03.889> of<00:05:03.979> delay<00:05:04.220> in<00:05:04.370> between<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.699> two

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
some sort of delay in between the two

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.550 
some sort of delay in between the two
but<00:05:05.330> I<00:05:05.360> did<00:05:05.690> quite<00:05:05.870> like<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.199> idea<00:05:06.229> actually

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
but I did quite like the idea actually

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.650 
but I did quite like the idea actually
of<00:05:06.830> having<00:05:07.070> these<00:05:07.220> these<00:05:07.639> two<00:05:07.910> cords<00:05:08.240> entirely

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
of having these these two cords entirely

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.379 
of having these these two cords entirely
separate<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:10.190> advantage<00:05:10.610> of<00:05:10.760> separating<00:05:11.270> is

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
separate the advantage of separating is

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:12.730 
separate the advantage of separating is
you<00:05:11.510> don't<00:05:11.630> get<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:11.960> transformer<00:05:12.440> action<00:05:12.560> you

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
you don't get the transformer action you

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.310 
you don't get the transformer action you
don't<00:05:12.919> get<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.160> feedback<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:14.139> so<00:05:15.139> if<00:05:15.260> you

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
don't get the feedback and so if you

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.719 
don't get the feedback and so if you
have<00:05:15.470> won<00:05:15.620> call<00:05:15.650> here<00:05:16.039> and<00:05:16.130> one<00:05:16.280> call<00:05:16.460> here

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
have won call here and one call here

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.340 
have won call here and one call here
mounted<00:05:17.060> directly<00:05:17.240> opposite<00:05:17.750> a<00:05:17.810> bit<00:05:18.020> like<00:05:18.139> my

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
mounted directly opposite a bit like my

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.060 
mounted directly opposite a bit like my
call<00:05:18.860> on<00:05:19.039> my<00:05:19.190> paper<00:05:19.400> clips<00:05:19.729> which<00:05:19.940> on<00:05:20.510> my<00:05:21.470> my

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
call on my paper clips which on my my

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.270 
call on my paper clips which on my my
second<00:05:22.430> version<00:05:23.080> that<00:05:24.080> would<00:05:24.350> give<00:05:24.979> you<00:05:25.070> much

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
second version that would give you much

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.690 
second version that would give you much
more<00:05:25.490> chance<00:05:25.789> of<00:05:25.940> making<00:05:26.240> this<00:05:26.330> thing<00:05:26.389> work

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
more chance of making this thing work

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.379 
more chance of making this thing work
and<00:05:28.700> you<00:05:28.820> wouldn't<00:05:29.000> get<00:05:29.120> the<00:05:29.210> feedback

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
and you wouldn't get the feedback

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.680 
and you wouldn't get the feedback
problem<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.400> I<00:05:31.400> don't<00:05:31.910> maybe<00:05:32.180> I<00:05:32.270> forget<00:05:32.539> board

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
problem and I don't maybe I forget board

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.260 
problem and I don't maybe I forget board
i'll<00:05:32.810> try<00:05:32.960> that<00:05:32.990> but<00:05:33.729> that<00:05:34.729> to<00:05:34.940> me<00:05:34.970> would<00:05:35.210> be

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
i'll try that but that to me would be

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.640 
i'll try that but that to me would be
the<00:05:35.360> way<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.539> do<00:05:35.750> it<00:05:35.780> because<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.289> feedback

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
the way to do it because the feedback

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.260 
the way to do it because the feedback
causes<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.160> oscillation<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:37.820> that<00:05:38.030> just

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
causes the oscillation and that just

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.990 
causes the oscillation and that just
kills<00:05:38.510> the<00:05:38.630> whole<00:05:38.750> thing<00:05:38.960> stone<00:05:39.200> dead<00:05:40.000> so

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
kills the whole thing stone dead so

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.950 
kills the whole thing stone dead so
something<00:05:41.330> here<00:05:41.479> with<00:05:41.599> a<00:05:41.630> high<00:05:41.750> impedance

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
something here with a high impedance

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.500 
something here with a high impedance
input<00:05:42.289> maybe<00:05:42.650> an<00:05:42.800> f<00:05:42.889> et<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.490> drive<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:44.180> circuit

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
input maybe an f et to drive the circuit

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.110 
input maybe an f et to drive the circuit
in<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:44.630> first<00:05:44.810> place<00:05:45.789> separate<00:05:46.789> the<00:05:46.880> quills

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
in the first place separate the quills

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.520 
in the first place separate the quills
and<00:05:47.389> I<00:05:47.510> think<00:05:47.720> it<00:05:47.810> probably<00:05:48.050> might<00:05:48.200> stand<00:05:48.440> the

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
and I think it probably might stand the

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.719 
and I think it probably might stand the
chance<00:05:49.090> but<00:05:50.090> just<00:05:50.389> giving<00:05:50.990> you<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.729> benefit

chance but just giving you the benefit

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.890 
chance but just giving you the benefit
of<00:05:52.820> some<00:05:52.970> personal<00:05:53.270> experience<00:05:53.720> and<00:05:55.780> best<00:05:56.780> of

of some personal experience and best of
