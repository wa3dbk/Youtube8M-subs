00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:22.380
 it's history in fact the childhood of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.359
 my father who is there in poland and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.480
 who saw in the beginning a childhood all to 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.830
 normal with parents with 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.199
 people who thought they were a super high 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.450
 after and discover that it's not those 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.030
 preparing his real biological mother 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.239
 take him to France leaves him in a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.950
 communist orphanage so and from 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:47.039
 hence that's what the first change 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.350
 of life but live many because his 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.600
 mother who is in the resistance has to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.980
 so hide him sometimes he hides 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.449
 with her sometimes it's too hard she 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.789
 judge it's too dangerous 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.940
 so she hides somewhere else at a certain 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.340
 given moment they even change from 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.189
 the identity changes name and even with this 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.470
 new name there he's changing stories of 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.180
 lives depend tomorrow a given moment it 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.400
 is in normandy then there is a version 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.799
 of his life as a roger hoe 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.450
 after that he goes off somewhere else then a 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.100
 other version of his life than as 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.840
 that foreign binet of praise is that so 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.470
 it's really a child who has to 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.020
 examine his child sure that the policy 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.329
 to stop his life from the beginning his 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.869
 parents can not keep it because 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.990
 of a request from the Communist Party if its 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.990
 mother also resumes it's still a 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.680
 communist party order because his 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.260
 father was arrested in russia 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.120
 long Stalinist detour he's going to have a 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.510
 education around that he will participate 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.610
 at very young events and for 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.410
 it's very important there is an image 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.340
 of what is right of what is happening 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.340
 just very young 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.250
 it's really a life of change 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.020
 that's what made me want to 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:12.590
 to describe it too is the side it's the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.870
 incredible beauty of all this the side I 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.750
 would not have invented I would have felt 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.850
 I would have thought it a bit exaggerated 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.000
 this story but it's true so 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.000
 we can hope too much to write it
