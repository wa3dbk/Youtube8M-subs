00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.379 
crevice and little Ridge I guess you
could<00:03:22.530> say<00:03:22.680> under<00:03:22.949> the<00:03:23.069> water<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.729> this<00:03:23.879> Bay<00:03:24.150> in

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
could say under the water in this Bay in

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.659 
could say under the water in this Bay in
the<00:03:24.479> game<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.019> it<00:03:25.680> goes<00:03:25.859> on<00:03:26.010> for<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.220> while<00:03:26.430> and

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
the game and it goes on for a while and

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.280 
the game and it goes on for a while and
it's<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:26.940> really<00:03:27.150> cool<00:03:27.389> because<00:03:27.750> upon<00:03:28.049> doing

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
it's just really cool because upon doing

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.869 
it's just really cool because upon doing
some<00:03:28.440> research<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:29.069> is<00:03:29.250> actually<00:03:29.699> like<00:03:29.849> I

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
some research this is actually like I

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.250 
some research this is actually like I
said<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.150> reference<00:03:30.599> to<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.900> San<00:03:31.079> Andreas

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
said a reference to the San Andreas

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.830 
said a reference to the San Andreas
Fault<00:03:31.560> Line<00:03:31.889> as<00:03:32.250> well<00:03:32.940> as<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.120> San<00:03:33.299> Fierro<00:03:33.510> I

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
Fault Line as well as in San Fierro I

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.479 
Fault Line as well as in San Fierro I
never<00:03:34.319> really<00:03:34.530> paid<00:03:34.680> attention<00:03:34.739> but<00:03:35.340> there's

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
never really paid attention but there's

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.580 
never really paid attention but there's
a<00:03:35.579> lot<00:03:35.729> of<00:03:35.849> destroyed<00:03:36.269> buildings<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.109> I

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
a lot of destroyed buildings and I

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.680 
a lot of destroyed buildings and I
believe<00:03:37.889> there's<00:03:38.099> a<00:03:38.159> destroyed<00:03:38.729> overpass<00:03:39.359> and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
believe there's a destroyed overpass and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.960 
believe there's a destroyed overpass and
I<00:03:39.989> never<00:03:40.199> really<00:03:40.680> pieced<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.400> together<00:03:41.519> to

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
I never really pieced it together to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.210 
I never really pieced it together to
realize<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.709> actually<00:03:43.889> a

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
realize that this is actually a

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.030 
realize that this is actually a
reference<00:03:44.699> to<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.269> earthquakes<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:46.109> in<00:03:46.500> the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
reference to the earthquakes in in the

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.860 
reference to the earthquakes in in the
fault<00:03:47.280> line<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.120> course<00:03:48.299> that

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
fault line that that of course that

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.800 
fault line that that of course that
appears<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.500> runs<00:03:49.739> through<00:03:50.120> San<00:03:51.120> Francisco

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
appears and runs through San Francisco

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.849 
appears and runs through San Francisco
so<00:03:52.079> I<00:03:52.109> thought<00:03:52.379> that<00:03:52.500> was<00:03:52.590> really<00:03:52.739> interesting

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
so I thought that was really interesting

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.979 
so I thought that was really interesting
it<00:03:53.370> was<00:03:53.459> something<00:03:53.760> new<00:03:53.939> that<00:03:54.479> I<00:03:54.510> discovered

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
it was something new that I discovered

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.899 
it was something new that I discovered
now<00:03:55.319> coming<00:03:55.949> in<00:03:56.099> at<00:03:56.189> number<00:03:56.370> two<00:03:56.519> we've<00:03:56.729> got

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
now coming in at number two we've got

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.860 
now coming in at number two we've got
the<00:03:57.090> atrium<00:03:57.750> Easter<00:03:58.290> Egg<00:03:58.470> which<00:03:58.859> basically<00:03:59.870> it

Golden Gate Bridge and go to the top of
it<00:04:47.039> and<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.340> don't<00:04:47.400> believe<00:04:47.850> there's<00:04:48.660> air<00:04:48.930> at

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
it and I don't believe there's air at

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.510 
it and I don't believe there's air at
least<00:04:49.289> it's<00:04:49.530> really<00:04:49.770> hard<00:04:49.949> to<00:04:50.009> get<00:04:50.100> up<00:04:50.220> on<00:04:50.370> top

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
least it's really hard to get up on top

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.189 
least it's really hard to get up on top
of<00:04:50.580> this<00:04:50.789> without<00:04:51.120> cheats<00:04:51.419> using<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.900> jetpack

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
of this without cheats using a jetpack

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.930 
of this without cheats using a jetpack
or<00:04:52.740> I'm<00:04:53.160> sure<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.550> could<00:04:53.669> land<00:04:53.789> a<00:04:53.880> helicopter

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
or I'm sure you could land a helicopter

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.029 
or I'm sure you could land a helicopter
next<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:54.900> jump<00:04:55.080> out<00:04:55.169> but<00:04:55.350> basically<00:04:55.830> if

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
next to it and jump out but basically if

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030

now<00:05:01.710> so<00:05:02.250> that's<00:05:02.910> really<00:05:03.300> funny<00:05:03.539> I<00:05:03.660> think<00:05:04.320> that

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
now so that's really funny I think that

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.129 
now so that's really funny I think that
it<00:05:05.010> just<00:05:05.039> reminds<00:05:05.520> me<00:05:05.580> of<00:05:05.699> the<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.330> literal

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
it just reminds me of the the literal

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.040

chocolate<00:05:07.680> Easter<00:05:08.039> egg<00:05:08.190> from<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.789> Vice<00:05:09.510> City<00:05:09.750> in

chocolate Easter egg from a Vice City in

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.779 
chocolate Easter egg from a Vice City in
the<00:05:10.080> fact<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.710> it<00:05:10.919> was<00:05:11.039> a<00:05:11.070> literal<00:05:11.280> Easter

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789
