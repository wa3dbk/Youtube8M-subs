since we're not scuffing it up since

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.940 
since we're not scuffing it up since
that's<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.789> transparent<00:01:41.390> paint<00:01:41.920> we<00:01:42.920> need

bond to this metal so we're going to use

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.190 
bond to this metal so we're going to use
this<00:01:47.060> adhesion<00:01:47.509> promoter<00:01:47.869> which<00:01:48.080> is

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
this adhesion promoter which is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.039 
this adhesion promoter which is
basically<00:01:48.560> like<00:01:48.860> glue<00:01:49.430> for<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.700> paint<00:01:49.960> so<00:01:50.960> I'm

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
basically like glue for the paint so I'm

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.779 
basically like glue for the paint so I'm
going<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.200> hit<00:01:51.320> that<00:01:51.530> nice<00:01:52.070> little<00:01:52.280> dusting

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
going to hit that nice little dusting

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.169 
going to hit that nice little dusting
and<00:01:52.909> then<00:01:53.030> let<00:01:53.180> him<00:01:53.210> go<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.899> all<00:01:54.890> right

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
and then let him go to it all right

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.219 
and then let him go to it all right
looks<00:01:56.179> like<00:01:56.240> brian<00:01:56.569> has<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.750> adhesion

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
looks like brian has the adhesion

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.290 
looks like brian has the adhesion
promoter<00:01:57.259> laid<00:01:57.740> down<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.490> what's<00:01:58.670> next<00:01:58.909> is<00:01:59.149> the

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
promoter laid down so what's next is the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.809 
promoter laid down so what's next is the
metal<00:01:59.840> cast<00:02:00.050> here<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:00.979> metal<00:02:01.280> cast<00:02:01.460> comes<00:02:01.700> in

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
metal cast here this metal cast comes in

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.669 
metal cast here this metal cast comes in
a<00:02:01.880> variety<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.240> different<00:02:02.360> colors<00:02:02.659> comes<00:02:03.530> in

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
a variety of different colors comes in

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.700 
a variety of different colors comes in
smoke<00:02:03.979> as<00:02:04.190> what<00:02:04.610> word<00:02:04.759> use<00:02:05.000> here<00:02:05.270> comes<00:02:06.080> in<00:02:06.259> red

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
smoke as what word use here comes in red

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.150 
smoke as what word use here comes in red
blue<00:02:07.549> orange<00:02:08.239> purple<00:02:08.690> green<00:02:09.259> as<00:02:09.440> well<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.830> the

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
blue orange purple green as well and the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.240 
blue orange purple green as well and the
base<00:02:10.340> coat<00:02:10.610> which<00:02:10.940> we<00:02:11.060> mentioned<00:02:11.360> earlier

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
base coat which we mentioned earlier

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.590 
base coat which we mentioned earlier
basically<00:02:13.250> what<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:13.519> is<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.000> tinted<00:02:14.420> clear

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
basically what this is is a tinted clear

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.809 
basically what this is is a tinted clear
coat<00:02:14.930> it's<00:02:15.290> transparent<00:02:15.799> paint<00:02:16.160> which

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
coat it's transparent paint which

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.370 
coat it's transparent paint which
whatever<00:02:17.030> surface<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.600> spray<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:17.959> on<00:02:18.110> it's

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
whatever surface you spray this on it's

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.380 
whatever surface you spray this on it's
going<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.590> show<00:02:18.830> right<00:02:19.010> through<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.150> since

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
now the smoke color isn't as drastic as

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.460 
now the smoke color isn't as drastic as
the<00:03:32.950> as<00:03:33.460> the<00:03:34.360> other<00:03:34.450> metalcast<00:03:34.840> color<00:03:35.200> so

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
the as the other metalcast color so

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.770 
the as the other metalcast color so
you're<00:03:35.590> not<00:03:35.709> going<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:35.980> see<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:37.209> know<00:03:37.330> the

why you want to use the enamel is

to get the wrinkle plus effect really

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.950 
to get the wrinkle plus effect really
it's<00:04:46.670> going<00:04:46.850> to<00:04:46.910> crinkle<00:04:47.240> up<00:04:47.300> on<00:04:47.510> you<00:04:47.720> and

ready<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.710> paint<00:04:57.830> this<00:04:57.980> car<00:04:58.160> we<00:04:58.310> want<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.520> start

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
ready to paint this car we want to start

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.100 
ready to paint this car we want to start
thinking<00:04:59.300> about<00:04:59.510> what<00:04:59.660> we're<00:04:59.780> to<00:04:59.840> do<00:04:59.930> with<00:05:00.020> the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
thinking about what we're to do with the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.810 
thinking about what we're to do with the
trim<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.590> we<00:05:01.040> came<00:05:01.220> up<00:05:01.250> with<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.460> couple<00:05:01.670> of

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
trim and we came up with a couple of

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.250 
trim and we came up with a couple of
different<00:05:02.060> options<00:05:02.150> because<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.750> trim<00:05:03.050> was

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
different options because the trim was

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.540 
different options because the trim was
in<00:05:03.410> such<00:05:03.590> poor<00:05:03.800> condition<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:04.280> lot<00:05:04.430> of

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
in such poor condition a lot of

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.130 
in such poor condition a lot of
scratches<00:05:04.850> and<00:05:05.060> scrapes<00:05:05.300> in<00:05:05.600> this<00:05:05.720> trim<00:05:05.960> work

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
scratches and scrapes in this trim work

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.800 
scratches and scrapes in this trim work
so<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.770> other<00:05:07.190> option<00:05:07.310> we<00:05:07.640> have<00:05:07.820> is<00:05:08.000> spraying

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
so the other option we have is spraying

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.960 
so the other option we have is spraying
it<00:05:08.960> with<00:05:08.990> a<00:05:09.080> metal<00:05:09.320> cast<00:05:09.620> giving<00:05:10.460> it<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.700> dark

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
it with a metal cast giving it a dark

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.690 
it with a metal cast giving it a dark
cast<00:05:11.300> look<00:05:11.660> and<00:05:12.310> except<00:05:13.310> we<00:05:13.430> had<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.580> little

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
cast look and except we had a little

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.320 
cast look and except we had a little
twist<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.090> it

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
twist to it

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.700 
twist to it
once<00:05:14.570> you<00:05:14.630> talk<00:05:14.780> about<00:05:15.020> it<00:05:15.110> Brian<00:05:15.320> well

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
once you talk about it Brian well

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.250 
once you talk about it Brian well
basically<00:05:16.220> since<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.670> trim<00:05:17.060> is<00:05:17.270> in<00:05:17.450> such<00:05:17.750> old

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
basically since the trim is in such old

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.860 
basically since the trim is in such old
and<00:05:18.770> battered<00:05:19.190> shape<00:05:19.730> we<00:05:20.240> can't<00:05:20.480> really<00:05:20.630> use

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
and battered shape we can't really use

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.690 
and battered shape we can't really use
metal<00:05:21.260> cast<00:05:21.500> on<00:05:21.740> its<00:05:21.920> own<00:05:22.100> because<00:05:22.370> it's<00:05:22.610> going

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
metal cast on its own because it's going

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.310 
metal cast on its own because it's going
to<00:05:22.790> show<00:05:23.000> all<00:05:23.180> those<00:05:23.330> imperfections<00:05:23.630> so<00:05:24.200> what

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
to show all those imperfections so what

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.980 
to show all those imperfections so what
we<00:05:24.410> came<00:05:24.590> up<00:05:24.650> with<00:05:25.300> was<00:05:26.300> using<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:26.720> scotch

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
we came up with was using the scotch

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.830 
we came up with was using the scotch
brite<00:05:27.290> pad<00:05:27.320> and<00:05:27.890> if<00:05:28.340> we<00:05:28.490> scuff<00:05:29.210> it<00:05:29.360> all<00:05:29.570> in<00:05:29.750> the

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
brite pad and if we scuff it all in the

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.300 
brite pad and if we scuff it all in the
same<00:05:29.870> direction<00:05:30.290> it's<00:05:30.740> going<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:30.920> give<00:05:31.040> us<00:05:31.160> a

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
same direction it's going to give us a

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.020 
same direction it's going to give us a
nice<00:05:31.520> brushed<00:05:32.060> look<00:05:32.420> so<00:05:33.610> we're<00:05:34.610> going<00:05:34.700> to<00:05:34.790> test

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
nice brushed look so we're going to test

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.150 
nice brushed look so we're going to test
that<00:05:35.180> out<00:05:35.420> and<00:05:35.600> see<00:05:35.780> how<00:05:35.960> it<00:05:35.990> works<00:05:36.320> we<00:05:36.860> do<00:05:37.010> have

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
that out and see how it works we do have

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.680 
that out and see how it works we do have
a<00:05:37.220> piece<00:05:37.430> that<00:05:37.490> we<00:05:37.730> tested<00:05:38.120> right<00:05:38.330> there<00:05:38.540> and

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
a piece that we tested right there and

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.970 
a piece that we tested right there and
it<00:05:38.750> did<00:05:38.900> come<00:05:39.050> out<00:05:39.110> pretty<00:05:39.440> well<00:05:39.530> we're<00:05:39.890> going

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
it did come out pretty well we're going

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.170 
it did come out pretty well we're going
to<00:05:40.040> see<00:05:40.160> how<00:05:40.280> it<00:05:40.370> works<00:05:40.550> with<00:05:40.670> the<00:05:40.790> other<00:05:40.910> stuff

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
to see how it works with the other stuff

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.330 
to see how it works with the other stuff
before<00:05:41.390> we<00:05:41.600> decide<00:05:41.930> which<00:05:42.740> one<00:05:42.980> or<00:05:43.100> the<00:05:43.190> other

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
before we decide which one or the other

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.150 
before we decide which one or the other
we're<00:05:43.520> going<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:43.700> go<00:05:43.850> with<00:05:44.030> now<00:05:44.300> typically

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
we're going to go with now typically
