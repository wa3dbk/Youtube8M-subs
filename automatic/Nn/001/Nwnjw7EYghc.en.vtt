00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.920
 on the fifty-first turn of the valley 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.139
 d'Aosta is still a party for the team 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.519
 colpack on the Swiss finish line of 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.710
 lehmann and cooked in fact to raise the 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.869
 arms to the sky was again 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.869
 undoubtedly the green for manuel 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.659
 the Romagna is stronger than the group 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.269
 released from the own yellow jersey group 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.949
 at the top of the penultimate grand prize of 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.230
 downhill mountain has reached a 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.960
 very brave simone andretta author 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.699
 of a solitary escape of over 50 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.379
 kilometers even though it was 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.480
 victim of a puncture succeeded in 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.410
 resist the return of the best of the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.649
 general classification 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.870
 stage and shirt for manuel senni he has 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.039
 can now look directly to the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.620
 climb of lese set 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.350
 on the podium of the mans coat they also go up 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.539
 9 jazz and kings and the Austrian bossman 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.300
 long on the run all day 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.659
 while five seconds are expensive 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.090
 Colombian suasa rank who will now have to 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:09.649
 chase in the last two fractions that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.649
 separate us from the final goal 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.200
 manuel senni an amazing and now 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.690
 it's yellow shirt is yes finally knit 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.700
 yellow was a very hard stage 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.000
 also from the mental point of view why 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.980
 today I was very well I was there that 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.540
 he waited for fun he was starting to leave 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.540
 I found the opportunity when he left 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.530
 the Colombian at the top of the second 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.300
 climb 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.130
 I left a few meters to see 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.050
 what the others did did not answer 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.330
 I didn't go downhill to get it 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.780
 tried the downhill stretch and after 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.880
 managed until arrival as a student 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.440
 manuel will mark a good climber from 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.770
 juniors was a promise 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.610
 today an important confirmation has arrived 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.880
 but yes I was lucky to be 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.170
 of one of a religious a part of one 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.490
 romagna region where cycling 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.010
 safeguards many young people I ran for 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.110
 a team as a student the fiumicinese 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.570
 that must be pulled up well did not claim 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.489
 so much it made me amuse and also 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.980
 from equal juniors he practically has us 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.019
 made cycling like the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.780
 better than games and that's how 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.510
 must do now is coming out the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.940
 work done by young rossella di leo 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.650
 there is only waiting for the time trial 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.420
 a stop to check the colpack team 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.910
 and proved to have the most team 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.850
 fort of the 2014 Aosta Valley Tour 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.580
 however, it will be a difficult task but look 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.690
 I personally speak from dehors she 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.930
 I'm so happy 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.360
 in the sense that the podium of martinelli la 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.000
 first stop there was good then the two 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.370
 stages 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.770
 I am so pleased especially for 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.050
 manuel because it has been confirmed 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.240
 perhaps a climber has always been 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.550
 he needed more self-confidence 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.890
 same now a fourth year must only 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.410
 go on like this the third stage tomorrow 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.120
 will start from chatel to reach 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.070
 on the law ramps s 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.560
 a stage that on paper is suitable for 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.180
 escapes but also attention to the blows of 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.190
 then the boys of the colpack 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.600
 will have to be good at maintaining the 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.460
 manuel senni's lead in the standings 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.490
 to play then everything in the 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.490
 Sunday time trial from morion to ss
