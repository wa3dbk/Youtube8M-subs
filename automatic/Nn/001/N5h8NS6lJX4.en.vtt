released by steam I'm quite excited by

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.289 
released by steam I'm quite excited by
this<00:00:13.620> because<00:00:13.920> I've<00:00:14.219> always<00:00:14.400> liked<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> idea

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
this because I've always liked the idea

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.590 
this because I've always liked the idea
especially<00:00:15.839> when<00:00:16.139> an<00:00:16.850> Nvidia<00:00:17.850> released<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
especially when an Nvidia released the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.950 
especially when an Nvidia released the
gaming<00:00:19.500> handset<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.010> shield<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.960> because

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
gaming handset the shield and because

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.150 
gaming handset the shield and because
I've<00:00:22.080> always<00:00:22.289> liked<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> idea<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.859> being<00:00:22.920> able

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
I've always liked the idea of being able

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.529 
I've always liked the idea of being able
to<00:00:23.279> lie<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.519> bed<00:00:23.760> because<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.180> lazy<00:00:24.330> bastard

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
to lie in bed because I'm a lazy bastard

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.830 
to lie in bed because I'm a lazy bastard
and<00:00:24.960> set<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.710> play<00:00:25.890> my<00:00:26.609> games<00:00:26.880> when<00:00:27.090> my<00:00:27.180> PC<00:00:27.599> does

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
and set in play my games when my PC does

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.890 
and set in play my games when my PC does
over<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.949> main<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.150> work<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
over the main you know work of it and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.970 
over the main you know work of it and
then<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.050> streams<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.619> simple<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
then just streams it simple to the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
then just streams it simple to the
handheld<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> didn't<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.210> about<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
handheld what I didn't like about the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.639 
handheld what I didn't like about the
shield<00:00:33.840> or<00:00:34.050> was<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.820> Nvidia<00:00:35.820> only<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.390> B<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
shield or was a Nvidia only and B at the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.020 
shield or was a Nvidia only and B at the
time<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.160> did<00:00:38.370> actually<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.320> GTX<00:00:40.320> 580<00:00:41.030> but

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
time I did actually have a GTX 580 but

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.990 
time I did actually have a GTX 580 but
unfortunate<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:43.070> supported<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.760> not

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
unfortunate I was not supported so not

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.279 
unfortunate I was not supported so not
only<00:00:45.090> would<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.300> had<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.570> spend<00:00:45.809> three<00:00:46.020> hundred

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
only would I had to spend three hundred

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.160 
only would I had to spend three hundred
pounds<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.800> buying<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.250> shield<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:48.020> would<00:00:49.020> then

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
pounds on buying the shield I would then

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.869 
pounds on buying the shield I would then
have<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.620> spent<00:00:49.890> another<00:00:50.250> three<00:00:50.610> four

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
have to have spent another three four

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.450 
have to have spent another three four
hundred<00:00:51.059> quid<00:00:51.449> buying<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.469> new<00:00:52.680> or<00:00:53.010> newer

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
hundred quid buying a new or newer

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.430 
hundred quid buying a new or newer
Nvidia<00:00:54.270> graphics<00:00:54.420> card<00:00:54.899> I'd<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.199> able<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
Nvidia graphics card I'd be able to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.830 
Nvidia graphics card I'd be able to
support<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.910> was<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> bit<00:00:57.300> disappointing

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
support so that was a bit disappointing

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.290 
support so that was a bit disappointing
and<00:00:57.960> kind<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.820> dampen<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> spirits<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> bit

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and kind of dampen the spirits a bit

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
and kind of dampen the spirits a bit
there<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.020> heard<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.680> steam<00:01:02.100> were

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
there but then I heard that steam were

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.189 
there but then I heard that steam were
working<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.730> doing<00:01:02.940> something<00:01:03.539> similar<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
working on doing something similar and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.630 
working on doing something similar and
so<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.710> thought<00:01:04.890> I'd<00:01:04.979> make<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.159> quick<00:01:05.220> video<00:01:05.460> clip

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
so I thought I'd make a quick video clip

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.039 
so I thought I'd make a quick video clip
in<00:01:05.939> testing<00:01:06.330> around<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.810> morning

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
in testing around with it this morning

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.340 
in testing around with it this morning
and<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> quite<00:01:08.909> promising<00:01:09.330> actually<00:01:09.869> so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and there is quite promising actually so

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.620 
and there is quite promising actually so
basically<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.850> make

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
basically all you have to do is make

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.170 
basically all you have to do is make
sure<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:12.960> steam<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.470> fully<00:01:13.770> updated<00:01:14.000> go<00:01:15.000> into

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
sure your steam is fully updated go into

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.670 
sure your steam is fully updated go into
the<00:01:15.270> settings<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.990> then<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.290> in-home

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
the settings and then you have in-home

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.980 
the settings and then you have in-home
streaming<00:01:17.180> at<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> moment<00:01:18.600> there's<00:01:18.720> nothing

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
streaming at the moment there's nothing

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.080 
streaming at the moment there's nothing
there<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:20.070> don't<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.400> my<00:01:20.549> laptop<00:01:20.700> on

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
there because I don't have my laptop on

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.090 
there because I don't have my laptop on
when<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.479> switch<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> my<00:01:22.350> webcam<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> minute

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
when I switch to my webcam in a minute

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.179 
when I switch to my webcam in a minute
to<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.310> our<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.640> say<00:01:24.390> by<00:01:24.570> side<00:01:25.070> comparison<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
to do our I say by side comparison to

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.060 
to do our I say by side comparison to
show<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.400> how<00:01:26.549> well<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.829> so<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.920> can

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
show you how well it is and so you can

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.940 
show you how well it is and so you can
limit<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:30.090> kind<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.360> speed<00:01:30.630> you've<00:01:30.780> got<00:01:31.079> you

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
limit what kind of speed you've got you

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.859 
limit what kind of speed you've got you
can<00:01:31.979> limit<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> framerate<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:33.030> need<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.299> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
can limit the framerate if need be and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.710 
can limit the framerate if need be and
you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.740> also<00:01:34.890> set<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> resolution<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:36.689> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you can also set the resolution and I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.660 
you can also set the resolution and I
just<00:01:37.079> said<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.290> 720p<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.460> that's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
just said it for 720p because that's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.240 
just said it for 720p because that's
what<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> need<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.240> raise<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.750> my<00:01:40.070> laptop<00:01:41.070> is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
what the need to raise of my laptop is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.889 
what the need to raise of my laptop is
so<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.790> don't<00:01:41.939> really<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.240> point<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.659> trying

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
so I don't really see a point in trying

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.960 
so I don't really see a point in trying
to<00:01:42.990> stream<00:01:43.200> anything<00:01:43.590> higher<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.670> stream

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
to stream anything higher you can stream

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.550 
to stream anything higher you can stream
higher<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.630> stream<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.960> ninja<00:01:46.259> type<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
higher you can stream like ninja type a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.620 
higher you can stream like ninja type a
1080<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.060> automatically

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
1080 and then it would automatically

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.539 
1080 and then it would automatically
then<00:01:48.869> scale<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> fit<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> Rays<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
then scale it to fit the Rays of the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.960 
then scale it to fit the Rays of the
laptop<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:52.130> other<00:01:53.130> related<00:01:53.399> point<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
laptop and other related point in the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.359 
laptop and other related point in the
height<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> wall<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:55.219> resolution<00:01:56.219> to

height of the wall just resolution to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.039 
height of the wall just resolution to
720p<00:01:57.090> anyway<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.409> am<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.670> yeah<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.689> give<00:02:00.930> me<00:02:01.020> a

for<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.930> webcam<00:02:23.260> quality<00:02:23.650> probably<00:02:24.220> won't<00:02:24.370> be

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
for the webcam quality probably won't be

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.370 
for the webcam quality probably won't be
the<00:02:24.550> best<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.600> will<00:02:25.690> give<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:25.990> good

idea you'll be able to see the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.970

tell because my webcam is only 30 frames
a<00:06:07.430> second<00:06:07.820> and<00:06:08.510> obviously<00:06:08.870> solves<00:06:09.170> YouTube

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
a second and obviously solves YouTube

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.980 
a second and obviously solves YouTube
but<00:06:10.870> will<00:06:11.870> give<00:06:12.080> you<00:06:12.110> an<00:06:12.290> idea<00:06:12.710> just<00:06:13.570> how

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
but will give you an idea just how

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.380 
but will give you an idea just how
how<00:06:16.990> well<00:06:17.290> this<00:06:17.500> works<00:06:17.860> considering<00:06:18.520> as<00:06:18.610> still

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
how well this works considering as still

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.930 
how well this works considering as still
only<00:06:19.690> an<00:06:20.790> an<00:06:21.790> early<00:06:22.180> beta<00:06:22.390> stage<00:06:23.310> so<00:06:24.310> I<00:06:24.340> really

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
only an an early beta stage so I really
