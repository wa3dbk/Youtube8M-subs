through two checkpoints we knew it was

a<00:03:22.510> stinger<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.739> we<00:03:23.980> were<00:03:24.069> hopeful<00:03:24.459> that<00:03:24.489> that

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
a stinger so we were hopeful that that

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.120 
a stinger so we were hopeful that that
was<00:03:24.849> been<00:03:25.569> in<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.780> process<00:03:25.959> within<00:03:26.410> organized

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
was been in the process within organized

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.129 
was been in the process within organized
we<00:03:28.000> were<00:03:28.090> monitoring<00:03:28.359> the<00:03:28.569> radio<00:03:28.660> as<00:03:28.900> much<00:03:29.019> as

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
we were monitoring the radio as much as

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.240 
we were monitoring the radio as much as
we<00:03:29.230> could<00:03:29.410> but<00:03:29.739> there<00:03:29.859> was<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:29.980> lot<00:03:30.220> of

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
we could but there was a lot of

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.250 
we could but there was a lot of
conversation<00:03:30.760> going<00:03:31.299> on<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.840> radio<00:03:32.019> so<00:03:32.230> we

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
conversation going on on the radio so we

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.170 
conversation going on on the radio so we
were<00:03:32.500> just<00:03:32.650> trying<00:03:32.889> to<00:03:32.919> concentrate<00:03:33.579> and<00:03:33.849> tend

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
were just trying to concentrate and tend

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.309 
were just trying to concentrate and tend
to<00:03:34.239> second-guess<00:03:34.599> where<00:03:34.780> this<00:03:34.930> fellow<00:03:35.169> was
