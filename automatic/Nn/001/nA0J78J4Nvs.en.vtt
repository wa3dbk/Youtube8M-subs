this spawner minecart now if I give this
spawner<00:00:10.830> minecart<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> little<00:00:11.370> nudge

spawner minecart a little nudge

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.759 
spawner minecart a little nudge
we'll<00:00:11.940> see<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.389> actually<00:00:12.750> moves<00:00:13.019> along<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.530> it

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
we'll see it actually moves along and it

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.210 
we'll see it actually moves along and it
starts<00:00:14.070> laying<00:00:14.429> its<00:00:14.639> own<00:00:14.820> rail<00:00:15.500> if<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.770> it's

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
starts laying its own rail if I it's

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.590 
starts laying its own rail if I it's
gonna<00:00:17.369> keep<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:17.970> direction<00:00:18.029> if<00:00:18.480> I

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
gonna keep going in that direction if I

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.240 
gonna keep going in that direction if I
put<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> rail<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.320> top<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.619> here<00:00:19.740> it'll<00:00:19.890> even<00:00:20.039> go

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
put a rail on top of here it'll even go

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.330 
put a rail on top of here it'll even go
over<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.910> hump<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.470> put<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.980> rail

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
over a hump like that if I put a rail

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.189 
over a hump like that if I put a rail
off<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> side<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.060> its<00:00:24.180> path<00:00:24.390> it'll<00:00:24.960> form<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
off to the side of its path it'll form a

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.380 
off to the side of its path it'll form a
curved<00:00:25.410> track<00:00:25.710> section<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.340> it'll<00:00:27.240> actually

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
curved track section and it'll actually

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.320 
curved track section and it'll actually
go<00:00:28.140> around<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> curve<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.429> basically

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
go around a curve and I can basically

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.930 
go around a curve and I can basically
control<00:00:30.720> its<00:00:31.080> direction<00:00:31.650> by<00:00:31.949> placing<00:00:32.790> down

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
control its direction by placing down

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940 
control its direction by placing down
these<00:00:33.149> rails<00:00:33.510> wherever<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.290> want<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> curve

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
these rails wherever I want it to curve

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.950 
these rails wherever I want it to curve
just<00:00:35.700> off<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.120> side<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.480> track

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
just off to the side of the track

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.130 
just off to the side of the track
very<00:00:37.800> very<00:00:37.980> cool<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.670> works<00:00:38.910> by<00:00:39.180> using<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
very very cool it works by using a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.840 
very very cool it works by using a
spawner<00:00:40.440> minecart<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.070> spawning<00:00:41.309> falling

spawner minecart that's spawning falling
sand<00:00:42.120> which<00:00:42.960> has<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.500> ID<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.940> rails<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
sand which has the ID of the rails and

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.750 
sand which has the ID of the rails and
it<00:00:46.800> spawns<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:47.280> kind<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> right

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
it spawns it with kind of the right

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.400 
it spawns it with kind of the right
velocity<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.539> everything<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> make<00:00:49.320> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
velocity and everything just to make it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.799 
velocity and everything just to make it
work<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.940> within<00:00:51.180> 16<00:00:51.510> blocks

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
work and you have to be within 16 blocks

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.600 
work and you have to be within 16 blocks
of<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.140> order<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> make<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.559> work<00:00:52.620> it'll<00:00:53.460> go

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
of it in order to make it work it'll go

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.459 
of it in order to make it work it'll go
down<00:00:53.879> hills<00:00:54.180> automatically<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.140> order<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.410> go
