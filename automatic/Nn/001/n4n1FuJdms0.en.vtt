00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.019
 exxon replay in the dolphin emulator as 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.090
 you will know this emulator allows us 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.269
 play through images made the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.580

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.239
 two versions of 'resident evil' from 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.489

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.590
 emulator we appreciate a game banner 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.020

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.370

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.450
 use and finally we click on close 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.790
 to show them that the codes 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.340

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.630
 game by double clicking or if you prefer 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.630
