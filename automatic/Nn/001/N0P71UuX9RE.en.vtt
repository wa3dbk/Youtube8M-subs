a mini review or whatever so as far as
the<00:01:46.390> quality<00:01:46.929> I<00:01:47.229> think<00:01:47.770> it's<00:01:47.950> nice<00:01:49.079> hmm<00:01:50.079> um<00:01:50.289> I'm

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
the quality I think it's nice hmm um I'm

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:55.380 
the quality I think it's nice hmm um I'm
a<00:01:51.310> little<00:01:51.520> bit<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.450> wanted<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.289> to<00:01:53.530> be<00:01:53.679> flat<00:01:54.390> see

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
a little bit I wanted it to be flat see

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.370 
a little bit I wanted it to be flat see
how<00:01:55.569> you<00:01:55.630> can<00:01:55.960> kind<00:01:56.469> of<00:01:56.770> see<00:01:56.829> the<00:01:57.670> raised<00:01:58.380> just

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
how you can kind of see the raised just

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.800 
how you can kind of see the raised just
scrolling<00:01:59.799> and<00:02:00.219> I<00:02:00.429> thought<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.240> was<00:02:01.390> gonna<00:02:01.600> be

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
scrolling and I thought it was gonna be

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.260 
scrolling and I thought it was gonna be
more<00:02:01.990> like<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:02.380> black<00:02:02.679> and<00:02:03.069> super<00:02:03.759> duper<00:02:03.969> shiny

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
more like a black and super duper shiny

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.679 
more like a black and super duper shiny
which<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.960> is<00:02:05.049> shiny<00:02:05.380> but<00:02:05.999> you<00:02:06.999> can<00:02:07.240> see<00:02:07.509> the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
which it is shiny but you can see the

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.600 
which it is shiny but you can see the
edges<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:11.890> can<00:02:12.010> see<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.250> edges<00:02:12.400> of

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
edges of the so you can see the edges of

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.670 
edges of the so you can see the edges of
the<00:02:12.760> e<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.510> there<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.260> thought<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.590> was

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
the e in there and I thought it was

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.140 
the e in there and I thought it was
going<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.890> be<00:02:14.980> flat

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
going to be flat

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.890 
going to be flat
but<00:02:16.360> i<00:02:16.629> would<00:02:17.230> say<00:02:17.560> out<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.040> 5<00:02:18.819> stars<00:02:19.299> i<00:02:19.750> would

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
but i would say out of 5 stars i would

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.199 
but i would say out of 5 stars i would
give<00:02:20.049> it<00:02:20.079> like<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:23.010> 4.3<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.760> thought<00:02:25.030> if

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
give it like a 4.3 and I thought if

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.970 
give it like a 4.3 and I thought if
everything<00:02:25.720> else<00:02:25.810> turned<00:02:26.260> out<00:02:26.379> nice<00:02:26.560> as<00:02:26.769> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
everything else turned out nice as the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.970 
everything else turned out nice as the
