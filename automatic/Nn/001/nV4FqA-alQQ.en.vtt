00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.080
 germany germany 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.529
 I thought it was great 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.939
 this defeat that already had this defeat 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.570
 from 3 to 0 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.020
 I want to follow certain 71 was too much 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.969
 at the same time he mentioned some things 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.800
 so that they are Brazilian becomes something to 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.399
 be commercially exploited or 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.469
 engagement of capital and consumption and 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.289
 I do not see that people need size being 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.539
 experience that the plate wins sweet 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.329
 at the time it's explored 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.620
 football is important to us that of Brazil 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.890
 It's very true nobody wants to see the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.960
 importance of sound and it is very data is 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.920
 something like that football is no longer 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.320
 one thing a social importance 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.920
 to be a thing to be completely 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.939
 a consumption is the fan ceased to be a 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.619
 fan 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.470
 this new lode has become a supporter 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.320
 consumer is the face that the last

 spectacularization of form until you me 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.149
 For example, today we had 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.060
 The reports you have from Brazil 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.820
 who earns at least 50 is an account of a

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.350
 vexation that Brazil has said today 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.420
 It's much better than Brazil already 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.770
 produced all football stadiums 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.679
