00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 in the last video we have the first one 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.240
 looked at trimester of pregnancy 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.280
 and now we come to the second part 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:17.160
 the pregnancy months four to 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:19.529
 six in the second trimester only occur 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.880
 rarely nausea or vomiting 1 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.250
 and the probability of one 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.750
 Miscarriage is very low from this 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.189
 The majority of women feel at home 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.529
 calmer and more relaxed 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.609
 one often speaks of the most beautiful time 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.769
 the pregnancy 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.840
 In addition, the movements of the fetus 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.579
 gradually the bond became noticeable 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.530
 between mother and child even further 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.739
 increasingly includes the fourth month 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.390
 the pregnancy weeks 13 to 16 the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.820
 child is developing very fast and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.430
 now takes about 250 grams per week 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.649
 all organs continue to develop and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.329
 the eyelids close open 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.940
 they will be back in three 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.219
 Months too slow put spontaneous 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.289
 movements of a head arms and legs 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.719
 and the beating musculature evolved 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.030
 the salivary glands of the stomach are 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.760
 viruses and the enteric already worked as 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.950
 Breathing breathes the photos of amniotic fluid 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.950
 On and off that can hiccup 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.330
 but which is not worth considering 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.070
 also the development of the genitals 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.020
 set in and with a bit of luck 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.520
 one can already do that with the ultrasound 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.080
 Sex recognize what you have 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.360
 I prefer a boy later for a child 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.500
 or a girl or both writes 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.869
 us in the comments 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.030
 after the 16 week of pregnancy 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.159
 the child is already ten centimeters tall 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.140
 and weighs about 100 grams 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.180
 now begins the fifth month 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.430
 he goes from the seventeenth to the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.590
 Twentieth week the uterus is closed 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.020
 this time about the size of one 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.820
 honey melon the fetus continues to grow and 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.009
 His movements are already as 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.740
 easy to feel fine skripal 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.399
 his size is now 14 to 16 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.159
 centimeters and its weight 150 to 300 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.360
 The sixth month is from the 21st 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.310
 until the 24th 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.409
 week of pregnancy the breasts of the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.240
 mother are now enlarging under hormone 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.700
 influence on the playing time 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.009
 prepare the photos now forms a 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.259
 fat layer under and on his skin 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.390
 the layer on the skin allows 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.380
 later a lighter glide through the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.690
 birth canal 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.850
 Fingers and toenails are now complete 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.620
 developed and now the hair starts to grow 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.240
 to grow 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.580
 besides, the skeleton ossifies 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.920
 and the brain grows fast 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.110
 reacted towards the end of the sixth month 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.380
 the child already on external acoustic 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.570
 and optical stimuli such as light tune 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.280
 or singing the photos in this one 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.990
 already perceive pain 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.210
 is still a controversial 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.140
 topic in medicine the child now measures 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.270
