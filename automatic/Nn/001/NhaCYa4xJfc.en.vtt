00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.410 
videos out I've got a video about me
shooting<00:01:43.799> rifle<00:01:44.549> slugs<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.210> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
shooting rifle slugs out of this and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.139 
shooting rifle slugs out of this and
some<00:01:45.540> pretty<00:01:45.689> good<00:01:45.840> ranges<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.970> say<00:01:47.970> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
some pretty good ranges and I say it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.940 
some pretty good ranges and I say it
shoots<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.600> flat<00:01:48.960> out<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.290> about<00:01:49.439> 50<00:01:49.799> yards

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
shoots really flat out to about 50 yards

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.620 
shoots really flat out to about 50 yards
and<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.399> after<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.000> does<00:01:51.149> drop<00:01:51.390> off<00:01:51.600> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and then after that it does drop off a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.569 
and then after that it does drop off a
bit<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> compensate<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.460> I'm

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
bit and you have to compensate but I'm

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.050 
bit and you have to compensate but I'm
telling<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:55.049> right<00:01:55.229> hands<00:01:55.850> this<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
telling you in the right hands this is a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.160 
telling you in the right hands this is a
very<00:01:57.329> deadly<00:01:58.219> be<00:01:59.219> very<00:01:59.460> deadly<00:01:59.729> at<00:02:00.170> great

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
very deadly be very deadly at great

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.249 
very deadly be very deadly at great
distances<00:02:01.799> more<00:02:02.810> greater<00:02:03.810> than<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.140> you

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
distances more greater than what you

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.840 
distances more greater than what you
would<00:02:04.350> expect<00:02:04.680> from<00:02:04.799> shotgun<00:02:05.310> anyways<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.790> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
would expect from shotgun anyways and I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.569 
would expect from shotgun anyways and I
told<00:02:06.299> him<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.509> said<00:02:06.890> I'll<00:02:07.890> show<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.190> I'll<00:02:08.399> make

told him I said I'll show you I'll make

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.869 
told him I said I'll show you I'll make
a<00:02:08.610> video<00:02:08.790> I'll<00:02:09.269> take<00:02:09.929> my<00:02:10.110> kel-tec<00:02:10.470> KSG<00:02:10.550> out<00:02:11.550> -

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
a video I'll take my kel-tec KSG out -

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.670 
a video I'll take my kel-tec KSG out -
thus<00:02:12.060> far<00:02:12.390> as<00:02:12.510> my<00:02:12.660> range<00:02:12.900> will<00:02:13.080> go<00:02:13.200> which<00:02:13.470> is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
thus far as my range will go which is

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.260 
thus far as my range will go which is
just<00:02:14.489> about<00:02:14.700> 200<00:02:14.970> yards<00:02:15.360> not<00:02:15.629> quite

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
just about 200 yards not quite

alright<00:03:16.390> guys<00:03:16.540> there<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.900> go<00:03:17.020> you<00:03:17.230> saw<00:03:17.520> hit

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
alright guys there you go you saw hit

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.160 
alright guys there you go you saw hit
that<00:03:18.760> gong<00:03:19.000> up<00:03:19.270> there<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.780> hill

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
that gong up there on the hill

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.310 
that gong up there on the hill
I<00:03:20.200> say<00:03:20.980> that's<00:03:21.190> just<00:03:21.250> about<00:03:21.520> 200<00:03:22.180> yards<00:03:22.330> had<00:03:23.140> to

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
I say that's just about 200 yards had to

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.490 
I say that's just about 200 yards had to
compensate<00:03:23.650> aim<00:03:24.160> just<00:03:24.930> slightly<00:03:25.930> above<00:03:26.170> it

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
compensate aim just slightly above it

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.350 
compensate aim just slightly above it
but<00:03:26.710> you<00:03:27.190> know<00:03:27.280> what<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.550> red<00:03:27.730> dot<00:03:27.970> made<00:03:28.270> it

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
but you know what the red dot made it

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.730 
but you know what the red dot made it
quite<00:03:28.540> easy<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.050> was<00:03:29.200> shooting<00:03:29.380> with<00:03:29.500> no

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
quite easy and that was shooting with no

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.970 
quite easy and that was shooting with no
support<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:31.510> could<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.350> hit<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.530> every<00:03:32.680> time

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
support and could I hit it every time

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.940 
support and could I hit it every time
that<00:03:33.490> this<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:33.820> probably<00:03:34.120> not<00:03:34.390> but<00:03:34.750> if<00:03:35.650> I<00:03:35.800> had

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
that this is probably not but if I had

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.430 
that this is probably not but if I had
