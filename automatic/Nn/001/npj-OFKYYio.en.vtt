little bit in the summer
oh<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.890> probably<00:02:20.890> before<00:02:24.000> before<00:02:25.000> we<00:02:25.030> have

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
oh and so probably before before we have

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.960 
oh and so probably before before we have
hit<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.430> road

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.949 
hit the road
they<00:02:28.330> were<00:02:28.390> probably<00:02:28.780> be<00:02:30.900> one<00:02:31.900> more<00:02:32.110> new<00:02:32.349> video

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959
