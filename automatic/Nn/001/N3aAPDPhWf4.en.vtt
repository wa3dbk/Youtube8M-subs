00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.260 

I<00:03:17.530> might<00:03:18.160> have<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.460> do<00:03:18.580> that<00:03:18.610> thing<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.030> I

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
I might have to do that thing that I

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.820 
I might have to do that thing that I
p.m.<00:03:19.600> then<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:19.990> do<00:03:20.110> that<00:03:20.290> thing<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.770> do

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
p.m. then you do that thing that I do

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.280 
p.m. then you do that thing that I do
all<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.190> time<00:03:21.390> whenever<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.600> can't<00:03:22.870> find<00:03:23.080> out

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
all the time whenever I can't find out

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.720 
all the time whenever I can't find out
how<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:23.830> do<00:03:24.100> something<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.640> just<00:03:24.850> stop<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.960> and

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
how to do something I just stop it and

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.060 
how to do something I just stop it and
you'll<00:03:27.730> see<00:03:27.970> in<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.150> next<00:03:28.270> video<00:03:28.890> this<00:03:29.890> is

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
you'll see in the next video this is

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.830 
you'll see in the next video this is
ignore<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.580> long<00:03:30.910> time<00:03:31.210> and<00:03:31.240> it's<00:03:31.570> probably

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
ignore a long time and it's probably

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.490 
ignore a long time and it's probably
taking<00:03:32.170> up<00:03:32.290> most<00:03:32.470> fear<00:03:32.860> useful<00:03:33.550> time<00:03:33.760> but<00:03:34.030> I

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
taking up most fear useful time but I
