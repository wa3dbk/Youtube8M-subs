designed and we brought you here so that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.769 
designed and we brought you here so that
we<00:00:29.640> could<00:00:29.759> talk<00:00:29.880> about<00:00:29.939> decorative<00:00:30.599> concrete

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
we could talk about decorative concrete

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.200 
we could talk about decorative concrete
and<00:00:31.230> good<00:00:31.529> design<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.129> how<00:00:32.550> important<00:00:33.090> good

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and good design and how important good

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.069 
and good design and how important good
design<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.170> any<00:00:34.500> project<00:00:35.180> now<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.900> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
design is to any project now one of the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.110 
design is to any project now one of the
biggest<00:00:37.620> aspects<00:00:38.100> about<00:00:38.250> good<00:00:38.579> design<00:00:38.610> is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
biggest aspects about good design is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.439 
biggest aspects about good design is
form<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.839> function<00:00:40.589> and<00:00:40.769> how<00:00:41.460> important<00:00:42.180> that

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
form and function and how important that

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.530 
form and function and how important that
two<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:43.260> linked<00:00:43.680> together<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.339> don't<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
two are linked together I don't like to

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.639 
two are linked together I don't like to
have<00:00:47.030> projects<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.540> reduce<00:00:49.199> do<00:00:49.409> some

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
have projects that just reduce do some

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.649 
have projects that just reduce do some
crazy<00:00:49.860> form<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.850> always<00:00:51.059> has<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
crazy form it always has to have a

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.869 
crazy form it always has to have a
function<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.350> here's<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> perfect<00:00:53.429> example<00:00:53.519> of

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
function and here's a perfect example of

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.599 
function and here's a perfect example of
that<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.329> tea<00:00:54.629> bar<00:00:54.840> itself<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.370> tea

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
that in the tea bar itself now the tea

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
that in the tea bar itself now the tea
bar<00:00:56.820> was<00:00:57.269> shaped<00:00:57.660> according<00:00:58.589> to<00:00:59.160> this<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.960> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
bar was shaped according to this in this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.690 
bar was shaped according to this in this
shape<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.160> teapot<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:04.519> that<00:01:05.519> was

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
shape of this teapot here and that was

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.320 
shape of this teapot here and that was
the<00:01:05.820> inspiration<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.509> it<00:01:07.250> when<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.399> approach

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the inspiration for it when you approach

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.469 
the inspiration for it when you approach
the<00:01:09.509> tea<00:01:09.690> bar<00:01:09.929> that<00:01:10.920> cantilever<00:01:11.550> helps<00:01:12.030> with

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the tea bar that cantilever helps with

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.660 
the tea bar that cantilever helps with
your<00:01:12.509> knee<00:01:12.780> space<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.649> has<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> practical

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
your knee space so it has a practical

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.779 
your knee space so it has a practical
aspect<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.750> well<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.050> alluding<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.550> shape

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
aspect as well as alluding to the shape

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.260 
aspect as well as alluding to the shape
of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> tea<00:01:18.270> cup<00:01:19.190> when<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.220> client<00:01:20.729> comes<00:01:20.909> here

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
of the tea cup when a client comes here

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.450 
of the tea cup when a client comes here
and<00:01:21.450> they're<00:01:21.600> gonna<00:01:21.690> sample<00:01:22.020> tea<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:23.340> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
and they're gonna sample tea in a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.940 
and they're gonna sample tea in a
classical<00:01:24.030> Chinese<00:01:24.270> way<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> take

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
classical Chinese way you have to take

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.179 
classical Chinese way you have to take
the<00:01:26.159> hot<00:01:26.369> water<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:27.149> and<00:01:27.439> pour<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.619> over<00:01:28.799> all

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the hot water here and pour it over all

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.929 
the hot water here and pour it over all
the<00:01:29.220> vessels<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.729> to

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the vessels like this and that is to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.990 
the vessels like this and that is to
keep<00:01:33.149> an<00:01:33.420> even<00:01:33.780> temperature<00:01:34.549> over<00:01:35.549> all<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
keep an even temperature over all the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.780 
keep an even temperature over all the
utensils<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.439> take<00:01:37.680> these<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.219> then<00:01:38.640> we

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
utensils so we take these and then we

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.780 
utensils so we take these and then we
pour<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.450> water<00:01:39.659> out<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:41.250> has<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.579> have

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
pour the water out and it has to have

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.770 
pour the water out and it has to have
some<00:01:42.119> place<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.799> devised<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
some place to go so I devised this

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.200 
some place to go so I devised this
copper<00:01:45.780> plate<00:01:46.140> here<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:47.040> drain<00:01:47.579> board<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
copper plate here as a drain board and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.480 
copper plate here as a drain board and
then<00:01:48.840> we<00:01:49.049> shape<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.560> concrete<00:01:50.039> after<00:01:50.219> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
then we shape the concrete after the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.090 
then we shape the concrete after the
pour<00:01:50.789> to<00:01:51.329> allow<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> water<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.170> run<00:01:52.380> back<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
pour to allow the water to run back and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.529 
pour to allow the water to run back and
into<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.630> drain<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.789> the

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
into the drain so that's the the

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.620 
into the drain so that's the the
rationale<00:01:58.110> behind<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.890> shape<00:01:59.420> aside<00:02:00.420> from

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
rationale behind this shape aside from

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.069 
rationale behind this shape aside from
that<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:01.110> creates<00:02:01.979> some<00:02:02.310> very<00:02:02.340> nice<00:02:03.180> nuances

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
that it creates some very nice nuances

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.370 
that it creates some very nice nuances
here<00:02:04.109> in<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.520> form<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.780> all<00:02:07.020> has<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
here in the form but it all has a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.190 
here in the form but it all has a
practical<00:02:07.950> purpose<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.789> entire<00:02:09.239> plate<00:02:09.630> can

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
practical purpose this entire plate can

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.949 
practical purpose this entire plate can
lift<00:02:10.739> up<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.579> you<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.820> clean<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.269> out<00:02:12.390> so

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
lift up so that you can clean it out so

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.470 
lift up so that you can clean it out so
it<00:02:13.049> is<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.290> suspended<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.850> tapered

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
it is just suspended here it's tapered

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.110 
it is just suspended here it's tapered
slight<00:02:15.840> angle<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.829> tapers<00:02:17.280> back<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.790> then

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
slight angle this tapers back and then

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.780 
slight angle this tapers back and then
the<00:02:18.239> water<00:02:18.450> can<00:02:18.750> flow<00:02:18.780> through<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:20.190> when

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the water can flow through so when

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.479 
the water can flow through so when
someone<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.299> client<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.079> certain<00:02:22.829> get<00:02:23.100> served

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
someone a client is certain get served

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.870 
someone a client is certain get served
the<00:02:23.940> tea<00:02:24.470> they<00:02:25.470> see<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.920> ritual<00:02:26.400> take<00:02:26.609> place

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
the tea they see this ritual take place

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.879 
the tea they see this ritual take place
in<00:02:27.060> front<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.390> them<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.870> then<00:02:28.230> they<00:02:28.380> serve<00:02:28.709> the

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:28.889 
in front of them and then they serve the
