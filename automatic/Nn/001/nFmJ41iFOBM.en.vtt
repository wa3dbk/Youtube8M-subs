00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
the slap back delay so I'm gonna do that

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.180 
the slap back delay so I'm gonna do that
and<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.690> other<00:00:38.840> thing<00:00:38.870> was<00:00:39.170> I<00:00:39.379> mentioned

towards<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.460> end<00:00:40.579> of<00:00:40.699> it<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:41.000> you<00:00:41.420> know<00:00:41.540> you

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
towards the end of it that you know you

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.990 
towards the end of it that you know you
could<00:00:41.840> use<00:00:42.079> like<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:42.380> major<00:00:43.010> pentatonic<00:00:43.520> sound

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
could use like a major pentatonic sound

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.760 
could use like a major pentatonic sound
or<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.150> major<00:00:44.360> blues<00:00:44.720> sound<00:00:45.050> over<00:00:45.290> this<00:00:45.440> and

or a major blues sound over this and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.110 
or a major blues sound over this and
that<00:00:46.040> it<00:00:46.130> would<00:00:46.250> sound<00:00:46.370> really<00:00:46.489> cool<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.090> I

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
that it would sound really cool so I

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.030 
that it would sound really cool so I
thought<00:00:47.390> well<00:00:47.570> I<00:00:47.600> better<00:00:47.750> do<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.079> new<00:00:48.290> new<00:00:48.800> video

thought well I better do a new new video

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.729 
thought well I better do a new new video

off the reverb there's actually still a

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.190 
off the reverb there's actually still a
little<00:01:16.850> bit<00:01:17.030> going<00:01:17.619> but<00:01:18.639> notice<00:01:19.639> that<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.569> sort

little bit going but notice that it sort

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.410 
little bit going but notice that it sort
of<00:01:21.259> ends<00:01:21.649> almost<00:01:21.889> right<00:01:22.219> away<00:01:22.340> if<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:23.179> turn<00:01:23.389> on

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
the slap back it actually echoes back to

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.609 
the slap back it actually echoes back to
me<00:01:28.310> I<00:01:28.459> have<00:01:28.729> I<00:01:28.909> have<00:01:29.149> the<00:01:29.299> delay<00:01:29.600> set<00:01:29.959> at<00:01:30.170> a

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
me I have I have the delay set at a

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.730 
me I have I have the delay set at a
hundred<00:01:31.279> and<00:01:31.779> sixteen<00:01:32.779> milliseconds<00:01:33.590> which

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
hundred and sixteen milliseconds which

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.899 
hundred and sixteen milliseconds which
is<00:01:33.770> almost<00:01:34.369> instant<00:01:36.130> it's<00:01:37.130> almost<00:01:37.490> instantly

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
is almost instant it's almost instantly

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.459 
is almost instant it's almost instantly
comes<00:01:38.149> right<00:01:38.359> back<00:01:38.509> I<00:01:38.749> have<00:01:38.899> it<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.109> repeat

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
comes right back I have it to repeat

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.910 
comes right back I have it to repeat
only<00:01:39.649> one<00:01:40.159> time<00:01:40.459> and<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:41.840> have<00:01:42.109> the<00:01:42.380> mix<00:01:42.649> which

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
only one time and I have the mix which

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.609 
only one time and I have the mix which
is<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.340> amount<00:01:43.789> of<00:01:44.090> delayed<00:01:44.539> signal<00:01:44.899> that

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
is the amount of delayed signal that

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.469 
is the amount of delayed signal that
comes<00:01:45.859> in<00:01:46.039> with<00:01:46.219> the<00:01:46.549> original<00:01:46.999> guitar<00:01:47.090> signal

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
comes in with the original guitar signal

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.500 
comes in with the original guitar signal
fairly<00:01:48.349> low<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:48.859> if<00:01:49.310> I

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.420 

if<00:01:52.510> I<00:01:52.660> play<00:01:52.900> without<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:55.830> it's<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.980> very<00:01:57.160> subtle

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
if I play without it it's a very subtle

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.100 
if I play without it it's a very subtle
thing<00:01:57.580> if<00:01:57.910> you<00:01:58.000> don't<00:01:58.180> hear<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.780> that's

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
thing if you don't hear it that's

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.410 
thing if you don't hear it that's
alright<00:01:59.440> particularly<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.340> know

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
alright particularly you know

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
alright particularly you know
compressing<00:02:01.420> videos<00:02:01.720> over<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.020> internet<00:02:02.350> and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
compressing videos over the internet and

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.990 
compressing videos over the internet and
stuff<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.950> audio<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.310> not<00:02:03.340> always<00:02:03.580> crystal

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
stuff the audio is not always crystal

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000 
stuff the audio is not always crystal
clear<00:02:04.180> but<00:02:04.690> it's<00:02:04.870> a<00:02:04.960> nice<00:02:05.110> little<00:02:05.140> touch<00:02:05.590> it's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
clear but it's a nice little touch it's

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.320 
clear but it's a nice little touch it's
something<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:06.430> like<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.760> use<00:02:06.790> when<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.120> play

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
something that I like to use when I play

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.719 
something that I like to use when I play
country<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:07.900> you<00:02:08.770> know<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:08.950> just<00:02:08.979> gives<00:02:09.550> it

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
country and you know it just gives it

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
there's a there's a certain pattern that

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.880 
there's a there's a certain pattern that
I<00:02:33.130> use<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.370> lot<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.090> from<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.840> root<00:02:35.110> in<00:02:35.740> this

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
I use a lot and from the root in this

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.000 
I use a lot and from the root in this
case<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.400> root<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.730> my<00:02:36.880> G<00:02:37.180> at<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.110> eighth<00:02:38.620> fret

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
case the root is my G at the eighth fret

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.660 
case the root is my G at the eighth fret
of<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.400> second<00:02:39.880> string<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.860> go<00:02:41.860> up<00:02:42.100> two<00:02:42.370> frets

of the second string I go up two frets
and<00:02:43.060> then<00:02:43.300> slide<00:02:43.630> up<00:02:43.660> two<00:02:43.930> frets<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.670> get

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
and then slide up two frets and I get

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.820 
and then slide up two frets and I get
the<00:02:46.030> first<00:02:46.330> second<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.870> third<00:02:47.170> notes<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.739> the

know way down here at the low G when I
get<00:03:30.010> done<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.459> starts<00:03:30.760> again

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
this is just another example of that but

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.900 
this is just another example of that but
it<00:04:43.930> gives<00:04:44.080> it<00:04:44.169> that<00:04:44.230> cool<00:04:44.470> sound<00:04:44.800> two<00:04:45.130> three

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
four and then I just go down to the e at

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.980 
four and then I just go down to the e at
the<00:04:51.130> ninth<00:04:51.310> fret<00:04:51.520> of<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:51.910> third<00:04:52.240> string<00:04:52.270> and

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
now what's cool is that for the next

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.100 
now what's cool is that for the next

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
chord progression starts with G and then

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:56.320 
chord progression starts with G and then
goes<00:05:47.960> down<00:05:47.990> to<00:05:48.169> C<00:05:50.860> and<00:05:51.860> then<00:05:51.979> it<00:05:52.070> goes<00:05:52.220> to<00:05:52.250> D<00:05:55.330> and

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
then it comes back to G and then it does

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.029 
then it comes back to G and then it does
