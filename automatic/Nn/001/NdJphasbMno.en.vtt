00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 What a beauty and heleninha this Russian video 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:11.300
 You fight fourth best way 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:21.050
 I'm going to hit two cards short 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:21.050
 Envelopes รณ Wait letter places so 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.660
 the start but the beat can not be 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.100
 so it has to be so the artist 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:39.530
 come out right here in the strongest match and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.530
 two out I'll try to turn one more 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.570
 right now has one more but I think 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:01:03.199
 that with four I can not turn well 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:01:03.199
 certain rock I will turn two to 12 with a 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:11.360
 beating normal 24 hit knot too 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:23.909
 choose not to take a goal there is no more 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:27.330
 hard and now I even slapstick after having 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.060
 it is when you put your hand like this 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.920
 I have not been training too long yet 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.150
 The pastel I think is one of the ways 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.150
 harder to beat 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.280
 first one or two 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.909
 important that the house is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.899
 right side and even canoes 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.299
 There are people who hit like this doing here. 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:59.939
 I do not know how this work is like this. 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:02.189
 so and no give'm sending my parents and 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.530
 students, it is important to let the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.530
 side letter and go 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.769
 under one just can not you then not 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.489
 thinks very bad then the push and that is 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:22.280
 Pull pulls when you hit is normal 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.730
 right on the other hand is a very 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:32.599
 easy to beat a wind one two three 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:34.310

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:40.239
