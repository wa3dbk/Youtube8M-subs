so<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:01.650> here<00:00:01.829> with<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.100> dell<00:00:02.429> latitude<00:00:03.120> xt

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
so we're here with the dell latitude xt

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.380 
so we're here with the dell latitude xt
which<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.650> an<00:00:04.770> only<00:00:05.009> dallas<00:00:05.339> first<00:00:05.609> tablet<00:00:06.210> but

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
which is an only dallas first tablet but

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.150 
which is an only dallas first tablet but
is<00:00:06.540> one<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.899> first<00:00:07.109> tablets<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.799> include

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
is one of the first tablets to include

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.600 
is one of the first tablets to include
capacitive<00:00:08.880> touchscreen<00:00:09.750> technology<00:00:10.519> but<00:00:11.519> we

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
capacitive touchscreen technology but we

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.310 
capacitive touchscreen technology but we
do<00:00:11.730> really<00:00:11.910> like<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.269> laptop<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:13.170> has<00:00:13.290> a

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
do really like the laptop it has a

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.589 
do really like the laptop it has a
really<00:00:13.530> nice<00:00:13.679> form<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.250> nice<00:00:14.400> feel<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:15.000> but

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
really nice form a nice feel to it but

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.150 
really nice form a nice feel to it but
we<00:00:15.690> do<00:00:15.839> want<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.049> focus<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.590> capacitive

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
we do want to focus on the capacitive

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.769 
we do want to focus on the capacitive
touch<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.940> screens<00:00:18.240> that's<00:00:18.510> what<00:00:18.660> really

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
touch and the screens that's what really

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.019 
touch and the screens that's what really
sets<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.170> apart<00:00:19.320> from<00:00:19.650> other<00:00:20.189> laptop<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:20.910> we're

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
sets it apart from other laptop so we're

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.939 
sets it apart from other laptop so we're
going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> compare<00:00:21.390> some<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> capacitive

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
going to compare some of the capacitive

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.160 
going to compare some of the capacitive
screen<00:00:23.310> technology<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> resistive<00:00:25.170> screen

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
screen technology to a resistive screen

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.099 
screen technology to a resistive screen
technology<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.369> toshiba<00:00:26.880> protege<00:00:27.390> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
technology in this toshiba protege and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.359 
technology in this toshiba protege and
one<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.590> first<00:00:28.800> things<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.130> we've

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
one of the first things that we've

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.220 
one of the first things that we've
noticed<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:29.970> using<00:00:30.570> your<00:00:30.689> finger<00:00:30.990> for

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
noticed is that using your finger for

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.310 
noticed is that using your finger for
swiping<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.740> pictures<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.340> very<00:00:32.669> easy<00:00:33.320> on

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
swiping and pictures is very easy on

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.010 
swiping and pictures is very easy on
this<00:00:34.590> capacitive<00:00:35.579> touchscreen<00:00:36.149> whereas<00:00:36.870> on

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
this capacitive touchscreen whereas on

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.510 
this capacitive touchscreen whereas on
the<00:00:37.050> resistive<00:00:37.559> touchscreen<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.399> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the resistive touchscreen you have to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.910 
the resistive touchscreen you have to
give<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.790> little<00:00:38.969> bit<00:00:39.180> more<00:00:39.300> give<00:00:39.829> but<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
give it a little bit more give but it

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.400 
give it a little bit more give but it
does<00:00:41.070> work<00:00:41.100> fairly<00:00:41.579> well<00:00:42.140> it's<00:00:43.140> actually

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
does work fairly well it's actually

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.510 
does work fairly well it's actually
working<00:00:43.530> very<00:00:43.800> well<00:00:43.890> right<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
working very well right now in the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.950 
working very well right now in the
toshiba<00:00:45.350> but<00:00:46.350> we've<00:00:46.500> noticed<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:48.629> work<00:00:48.780> in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
toshiba but we've noticed it to work in

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.680 
toshiba but we've noticed it to work in
a<00:00:49.200> few<00:00:49.410> different<00:00:49.500> areas<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:51.090> capacitive

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
a few different areas on the capacitive

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.630 
a few different areas on the capacitive
touch<00:00:51.920> something<00:00:52.920> else<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.190> really<00:00:53.460> like

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
touch something else you really like

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.889 
touch something else you really like
about<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.969> capacitive<00:00:54.449> touch<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
about the capacitive touch is the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.450 
about the capacitive touch is the
ability<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.350> maneuver<00:00:55.590> through<00:00:55.739> windows<00:00:56.280> with

palm of my fingertip here that's the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.920 
palm of my fingertip here that's the
word<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.880> whereas<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.060> resistive

with<00:01:15.299> my<00:01:15.420> my<00:01:15.810> nail<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.290> my<00:01:16.409> palm<00:01:16.650> isn't<00:01:17.009> going

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
with my my nail at my palm isn't going

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.410 
with my my nail at my palm isn't going
to<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> palm<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> my<00:01:17.700> fingers<00:01:18.030> not<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to the palm of my fingers not going to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.010 
to the palm of my fingers not going to
work<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> tip<00:01:18.930> isn't<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> work<00:01:21.020> so

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
work the tip isn't going to work so

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.660 
work the tip isn't going to work so
that's<00:01:22.380> really<00:01:22.619> cool<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> save<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> lot<00:01:23.610> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that's really cool and can save a lot of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
that's really cool and can save a lot of
time<00:01:23.790> when<00:01:24.150> you're<00:01:24.270> flipped<00:01:24.600> into<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> tablet

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
time when you're flipped into the tablet

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.350 
time when you're flipped into the tablet
mode<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:26.250> complete<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:26.759> keyboard<00:01:27.240> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
mode and your complete your keyboard is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.899 
mode and your complete your keyboard is
covered<00:01:28.040> something<00:01:29.040> else<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.340> also<00:01:29.520> really

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
covered something else we also really

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.550 
covered something else we also really
like<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.479> ability<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.990> scroll<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.409> web

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
like is the ability to scroll in web

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.010 
like is the ability to scroll in web
pages<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.460> your<00:01:32.610> finger<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.630> not<00:01:33.900> you

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
pages with your finger and not you

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.749 
pages with your finger and not you
simply<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.920> don't<00:01:35.070> even<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> put

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
simply you don't even have to put

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.510 
simply you don't even have to put
pressure<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.290> small<00:01:37.710> flick

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
pressure on it it's just a small flick

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.859 
pressure on it it's just a small flick
which<00:01:39.299> which<00:01:39.869> vista<00:01:40.229> caused<00:01:40.439> us<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.829> flixx

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
which which vista caused us to flixx

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.569 
which which vista caused us to flixx
whereas<00:01:42.869> here<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.280> give<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
whereas here you have to give it a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.550 
whereas here you have to give it a
little<00:01:44.729> more<00:01:44.850> give<00:01:46.340> see

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
little more give see

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
I'm going to work but if I give it a

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.240 
I'm going to work but if I give it a
little<00:01:51.549> give<00:01:52.479> with<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.710> going<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:56.979> work<00:01:57.100> a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
little give with it it's going to work a

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.429 
little give with it it's going to work a
batch<00:01:57.399> away<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.659> we<00:01:58.750> have<00:01:58.899> we've<00:01:59.079> had<00:01:59.229> good

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
batch away and we have we've had good

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.109 
batch away and we have we've had good
success<00:01:59.649> with<00:01:59.950> this<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.369> especially<00:02:00.549> just

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
success with this and especially just

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.029 
success with this and especially just
you<00:02:01.299> know<00:02:01.390> doing<00:02:01.600> with<00:02:01.810> your<00:02:01.930> fingernail<00:02:02.829> on

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
you know doing with your fingernail on

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.520 
you know doing with your fingernail on
here<00:02:03.580> works<00:02:03.820> well<00:02:04.119> but<00:02:04.869> this<00:02:05.020> works<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.409> lot

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
here works well but this works a lot

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.430 
here works well but this works a lot
better<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:07.570> can<00:02:07.689> simply<00:02:07.990> just<00:02:08.050> kind<00:02:08.380> of

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
better and you can simply just kind of

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.919 
better and you can simply just kind of
tap<00:02:08.679> where<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:08.979> want<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.310> end<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.509> we<00:02:10.599> like<00:02:10.780> on

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
tap where you want to end and we like on

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.640 
tap where you want to end and we like on
YouTube<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:11.709> can<00:02:11.830> simply<00:02:12.040> just<00:02:12.190> hit<00:02:12.519> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
YouTube to you can simply just hit the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.160 
YouTube to you can simply just hit the
hit<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.800> play<00:02:15.010> button<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.640> kind<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.630> look<00:02:17.080> at

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
hit the play button and kind of look at

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.729 
hit the play button and kind of look at
the<00:02:17.260> comments<00:02:18.959> when<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.110> video<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.410> playing

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
the comments when the video is playing

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.070 
the comments when the video is playing
which<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.850> not<00:02:21.970> something<00:02:22.180> that's<00:02:22.660> very<00:02:22.810> easy

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
which is not something that's very easy

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.160 
which is not something that's very easy
to<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:23.560> on<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.769> resistive<00:02:24.220> touchscreen<00:02:25.170> and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
to do on the resistive touchscreen and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.140 
to do on the resistive touchscreen and
then<00:02:26.290> kind<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.530> lastly<00:02:26.950> there's<00:02:27.790> some<00:02:27.970> really

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
then kind of lastly there's some really

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.030 
then kind of lastly there's some really
good<00:02:28.450> functionality<00:02:28.959> built<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.500> capacitive

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
good functionality built in capacitive

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.690 
good functionality built in capacitive
touch<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:31.000> vistas<00:02:31.450> tablet<00:02:31.989> mode<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.250> we

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
touch and vistas tablet mode and we

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.100 
touch and vistas tablet mode and we
really<00:02:33.970> like<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.299> ability<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:34.870> kind<00:02:35.049> of

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
really like the ability to just kind of

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.039 
really like the ability to just kind of
flick<00:02:35.349> through<00:02:35.500> windows<00:02:35.890> here<00:02:36.220> by<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:37.750> slip

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
flick through windows here by just slip

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.820 
flick through windows here by just slip
simply<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.890> was<00:02:39.040> my<00:02:39.430> finger<00:02:39.880> mess<00:02:40.390> up<00:02:40.599> but

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
simply that was my finger mess up but

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.289 
simply that was my finger mess up but
simply<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.310> know<00:02:42.400> stroking<00:02:43.000> along<00:02:43.180> the

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
simply just you know stroking along the

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.780 
simply just you know stroking along the
top<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.830> screen<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.190> being<00:02:45.519> able<00:02:45.580> to

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
top of the screen and being able to

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.699 
top of the screen and being able to
maneuver<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.180> your<00:02:46.269> windows<00:02:46.599> or<00:02:46.930> as<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
maneuver to your windows or as in the

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.850 
maneuver to your windows or as in the
resistive<00:02:48.160> touch<00:02:48.370> it's<00:02:48.849> not<00:02:48.880> as<00:02:49.239> easy<00:02:49.860> not

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
resistive touch it's not as easy not

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.110 
resistive touch it's not as easy not
easy<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.220> get<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.549> those<00:02:51.700> little<00:02:52.090> things

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
easy to get to those little things

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.849 
easy to get to those little things
either<00:02:53.040> much<00:02:54.040> easier<00:02:54.370> with<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.549> stylus<00:02:54.910> that

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
either much easier with the stylus that

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:05.870 
either much easier with the stylus that
comes<00:02:56.859> along<00:02:57.040> with<00:02:57.190> it

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.490 

but<00:03:06.920> here<00:03:07.920> that's<00:03:08.130> just<00:03:08.370> not<00:03:08.730> possible<00:03:08.760> and

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
but here that's just not possible and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.500 
but here that's just not possible and
here<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.710> lot<00:03:10.890> easier<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.430> do<00:03:11.610> especially

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
here it's a lot easier to do especially

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.270 
here it's a lot easier to do especially
just<00:03:13.020> getting<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.410> things<00:03:13.620> with<00:03:13.800> your<00:03:13.920> fingers

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
just getting to things with your fingers

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.270 
just getting to things with your fingers
as<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.460> can<00:03:14.700> see<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> lot<00:03:15.300> easier<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.780> do<00:03:16.280> as

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
as you can see is a lot easier to do as

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.810 
as you can see is a lot easier to do as
is<00:03:17.580> flicking<00:03:17.970> things<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:19.340> yeah<00:03:20.340> we<00:03:20.670> really

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
is flicking things so yeah we really

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.030 
is flicking things so yeah we really
like<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.210> capacitive<00:03:21.750> screen<00:03:22.350> technology<00:03:22.590> in

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
like the capacitive screen technology in

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.710 
like the capacitive screen technology in
this<00:03:23.160> there<00:03:23.580> are<00:03:23.610> obviously<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.240> few<00:03:24.450> places

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
this there are obviously a few places

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.300 
this there are obviously a few places
where<00:03:24.930> we're<00:03:25.440> still<00:03:25.680> reaching<00:03:26.040> for<00:03:26.220> the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
where we're still reaching for the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.750 
where we're still reaching for the
stylus<00:03:26.730> which<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.480> included<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:27.960> this<00:03:28.110> machine

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
stylus which is included in this machine

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.100 
stylus which is included in this machine
but<00:03:29.760> overall<00:03:30.180> there's<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.870> lot<00:03:31.080> more

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
but overall there's a lot more

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.720 
but overall there's a lot more
functionality<00:03:31.920> with<00:03:32.040> your<00:03:32.160> fingers<00:03:32.520> built

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
functionality with your fingers built

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.170 
functionality with your fingers built
into<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.150> screen<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:34.260> overall<00:03:34.740> it's<00:03:35.180> were

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
into the screen and overall it's were

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.330 
into the screen and overall it's were
coming<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.510> long<00:03:36.630> way<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:36.930> touch<00:03:37.470> technology

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
coming a long way with touch technology

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.150 
coming a long way with touch technology
and<00:03:38.490> tablets
