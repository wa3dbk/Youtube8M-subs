right<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.600> we're<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.719> to<00:01:33.780> see<00:01:33.929> that<00:01:34.109> at

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
right here we're going to see that at

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.779 
right here we're going to see that at
the<00:01:34.350> very<00:01:34.380> top<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:35.219> I<00:01:35.310> actually<00:01:35.429> have<00:01:35.700> in

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
the very top here and I actually have in

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.370 
the very top here and I actually have in
the<00:01:35.909> open<00:01:36.149> position<00:01:36.299> it'll<00:01:37.049> come<00:01:37.200> by<00:01:37.319> default

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the open position it'll come by default

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.139 
the open position it'll come by default
closed<00:01:38.039> like<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.819> is<00:01:38.969> the

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
closed like this so this is the

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.999 
closed like this so this is the
Kensington<00:01:39.329> lock<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> little<00:01:40.679> switch

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
Kensington lock but that little switch

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.639 
Kensington lock but that little switch
that<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.219> just<00:01:42.030> saw<00:01:42.179> me<00:01:42.329> flip<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.319> flip<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that you just saw me flip if I flip it

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.980 
that you just saw me flip if I flip it
down<00:01:43.920> that'll<00:01:44.520> unlock<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.090> top<00:01:45.299> cover<00:01:45.539> so<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
down that'll unlock the top cover so the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.349 
down that'll unlock the top cover so the
top<00:01:46.170> cover<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.459> ahead<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.819> just<00:01:47.999> snap

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
top cover you can go ahead and just snap

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.499 
top cover you can go ahead and just snap
right<00:01:48.389> off<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.969> then<00:01:50.969> you'll

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
right off just like that and then you'll

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.929 
right off just like that and then you'll
see<00:01:51.749> that<00:01:51.779> we<00:01:52.499> have<00:01:52.709> the<00:01:53.039> 500<00:01:53.579> gig<00:01:53.729> hard<00:01:53.759> drive

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
see that we have the 500 gig hard drive

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.940 
see that we have the 500 gig hard drive
that<00:01:54.240> comes<00:01:54.420> standard<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.959> the<00:01:55.200> sell<00:01:55.380> Ron<00:01:55.560> ni<00:01:55.770> 3

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that comes standard in the sell Ron ni 3

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.440 
that comes standard in the sell Ron ni 3
versions<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.639> then<00:01:56.819> we<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.029> a<00:01:57.060> 1<00:01:57.270> terabyte

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
versions and then we have a 1 terabyte

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.209 
versions and then we have a 1 terabyte
hard<00:01:57.749> drive<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.170> comes<00:01:58.319> standard<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.799> i5

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
what we see right here is we have a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.000 
what we see right here is we have a
little<00:02:15.420> door<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.870> I'm<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.740> go<00:02:16.860> ahead

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
little door and I'm going to go ahead

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.120 
little door and I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:17.130> lay<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.340> flat<00:02:17.490> for<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.820> sec

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
and lay this flat for a sec

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:28.110 
and lay this flat for a sec
I'm<00:02:18.340> going<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.610> open<00:02:18.760> up<00:02:18.970> this<00:02:19.120> door<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:27.120> then

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
I'm going to open up this door and then

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.460 
I'm going to open up this door and then
we<00:02:28.270> will<00:02:28.390> see<00:02:28.570> here<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.020> we<00:02:29.170> have<00:02:29.200> just

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
we will see here that we have just

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.860 
we will see here that we have just
accessed<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.070> memory<00:02:30.370> module<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.660> takes

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
accessed the memory module so this takes

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.410 
accessed the memory module so this takes
sodium<00:02:32.260> memory<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.740> by<00:02:33.430> default<00:02:33.670> all<00:02:34.090> three

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
sodium memory and by default all three

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.720 
sodium memory and by default all three
versions<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.020> vivo<00:02:35.440> PC<00:02:35.830> will<00:02:36.040> have<00:02:36.220> 4<00:02:36.550> gigs

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
versions of the vivo PC will have 4 gigs

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.980 
versions of the vivo PC will have 4 gigs
of<00:02:36.880> memory<00:02:36.910> installed<00:02:37.450> but<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.870> is

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
of memory installed but it is

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.110 
of memory installed but it is
upgradeable<00:02:38.500> up<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.770> 16<00:02:39.250> gigs<00:02:39.490> of<00:02:39.580> memory<00:02:39.640> so

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
upgradeable up to 16 gigs of memory so

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.580 
upgradeable up to 16 gigs of memory so
if<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.690> really<00:02:40.840> want<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.170> pick<00:02:41.260> up<00:02:41.410> one<00:02:41.560> of

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
if you really want to pick up one of

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.080 
if you really want to pick up one of
these<00:02:41.710> you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.040> go<00:02:42.400> ahead<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.670> trick<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:42.970> out

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
these you can go ahead and trick it out

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.580 
these you can go ahead and trick it out
with<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.330> really<00:02:43.540> big<00:02:43.720> hard<00:02:43.930> drive<00:02:44.170> or<00:02:44.410> really

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
with a really big hard drive or really

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.800 
with a really big hard drive or really
fast<00:02:44.800> SSD<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.640> then<00:02:45.970> add<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.180> bunch<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.570> memory

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
fast SSD and then add a bunch of memory

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.260 
fast SSD and then add a bunch of memory
to<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.080> as<00:02:47.200> well<00:02:47.410> easy<00:02:48.280> as<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.790> which<00:02:49.090> just

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
to it as well easy as that which just

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.970 
to it as well easy as that which just
takes<00:02:49.420> 30<00:02:49.750> seconds<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.230> get<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.500> there<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.860> can

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
takes 30 seconds to get in there you can

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.830 
takes 30 seconds to get in there you can
add<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> hard<00:02:51.370> drive<00:02:51.610> add<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.330> memory<00:02:52.660> and

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
add a hard drive add the memory and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.240 
add a hard drive add the memory and
you're<00:02:53.410> good<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.560> go<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.770> you<00:02:53.980> can<00:02:54.100> go<00:02:54.190> ahead

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
you're good to go and you can go ahead

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.760 
you're good to go and you can go ahead
and<00:02:54.490> reboot<00:02:54.810> ok<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:55.870> there<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.320> have<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.500> this

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
and reboot ok so there you have it this

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.830 
and reboot ok so there you have it this
has<00:02:56.980> been<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.370> vivo<00:02:57.700> PC<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.300> we've<00:02:58.450> taken<00:02:58.630> a
