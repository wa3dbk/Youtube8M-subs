00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Shrimp fried rice

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.560
One of you guys asked me to do a shrimp fried rice a couple of weeks back.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.680
So that is the dish I am doing today OK

00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:16.917
fried rice basically lot of them are the same... same technique

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.540
you use the rice that has been cool down

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.540
and just fried it with chicken, or pork or whatever you are using

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.560
but today is a shrimp fried rice..or king prawn fried rice

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.700
I am going to show you a technique to prepare the prawns

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.840
so it look a bit nicer..OK

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.180
I got a bowl of boiled rice that's been cooled down

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.000
I mean strictly speaking it's best to use fresh rice

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.420
but I haven't got time to make it and leave it to cool slightly

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640
so this is ..last nights

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.060
just some spring onions and some peas.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.980
normally when you see people do their fried rice dishes

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.080
they put lots of stuff in..you know like carrots or sweet corns and mushrooms and everything

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:19.380
it looked really.... condense..or crowded

00:01:19.607 --> 00:01:23.127
I prefer to have one or two vegetables

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.620
some you can taste the rice and prawns..instead of other stuff

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.720
massive prawns, I think it's 8-12

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.740
you get I think about 20 in a block or not even that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.251
so it's quite expensive

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.180
it's got the shell on

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.192
I buy this type of prawns especially for this video

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.300
first we take the shell off

00:01:54.707 --> 00:01:57.827
this is not the type I use for the shop obviously

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.160
..because it's so expensive

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.000
to prepare the prawns..we take this bit

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.300
from the back..just cut about 3-4 millimeters in

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.720
to open it up

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.430
when it cooks, it just spreads out..it look really nice

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.040
if there's any ..bit..guts or whatever

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.000
take them out

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.800
so it look nice and clean

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.310
just take one cut from the top

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.940
all the way down

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.260
another one

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.520
this ..I don't know this black bit.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.720
the guts..or vein

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.440
wait for the water to boil

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.940
cook the prawns first

00:02:56.764 --> 00:02:59.644
boil it for about 3-4 minutes just to cook it

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.440
egg goes in

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.380
if you see any lumps like this..just gently tap it

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.100
so it breaks up OK

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.960
after about one minute when the rice starts to heat up

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.900
add the prawns

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.020
just a bit of dark soy sauce

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.840
light spy sauce

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.998
you don't need that much soy sauce

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.140
be about 1 gram

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.820
or just few drops

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.020
about half teaspoon maybe

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:22.329
salt is the same yeah..just tiny amount

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.860
MSG ..same amount as the salt

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.280
not even half a teaspoon

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.400
some garlic oil

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.120
a dash of pepper

00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:13.223
now we are done..you can add the spring onions into it

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.620
prawns is too heavy..it's not sitting on the rice

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.360
simple king prawn fried rice..or shrimp fried rice
