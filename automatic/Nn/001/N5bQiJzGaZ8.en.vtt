 raining uncle when they are still 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.020
 Look, I was looking at myself so I would not 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.430

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.080

 kind of because today I bring you a new 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.400
 video in which you see me here that I'm 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.900
 with my super mega ultra motorcycle there in plan 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.010
 with my super blue helmet that does not paint 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.170
 not at all with the color of the car but 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.610
 well I am super special and good 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.740
 Well let's go for our garage 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.960
 because the trick is going to develop and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 inside the mind I want to upload a trick 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.410
 in the town they taught how to be able 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.820
 drive inside the garage and in this 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.500
 trick will not be for less wished 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.780
 doing it will basically do the same 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.149
 but being able to accelerate forward 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.410
 ok since you already know that in the trick 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.300
 yesterday only only could you 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.980
 drive through the garage but accelerating 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.630
 for behind and good as my person 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.420
 he removed the helmet and magically I do not know are 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.649
 the typical books dgt to 55 rare but 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.480
 good to see if I get the first one because 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.190
 the truth is that he is trying to make a 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.930
 ratillo and I came out perfectly but 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.370
 now he knew that this happened all the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.170
 youtubers that when we started recording 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.440
 Well, it does not come out, but we're going to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.870

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.930

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.880

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.970
 well you know when we accelerate for him 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.670
 garage if what the screen is going 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.440

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.120
