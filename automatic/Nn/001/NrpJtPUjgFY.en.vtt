00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.850
 years of weights i'm in anaheim 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.700
 by sight I hope to see here 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.960
 any of you i love you i don't 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.120
 can marry you all yet if i 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.869
 I want to make you an offer of what 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.430
 precious i could make this ring 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.680
 gold silver platinum 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.210
 it's clear but I want to know which one 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.980
 rare material on earth 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.960
 this material should be enough 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.719
 durable to safe so i can 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.570
 make a ring of it if it werenâ€™t for sure 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.460
 mean or places a part I was recently 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.090
 at university but quiet by coolio with 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.870
 sewing periodic videos and 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.329
 experiments on some elements 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.809
 to begin with an example from the creation of zinc in 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.969
 ways 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.370
 this thing is a beautiful sign tight 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.480
 heavy it is liquid metal yes it's cool 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.300
 on steeper only human urine 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.199
 thanks, okay thing is liquid solutions 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.949
 vanadium metal and when we mix 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.460
 vanadium 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:12.990
 days and mercury helps son 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.030
 give away electrons vanadium u as 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.729
 he gets more and more 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.280
 electrons in nadia mi will now 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.990
 Violet 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 summarize publicity before shaking it over 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.250
 rubs me off guard 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.250
 for heavy you look 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:42.439
 thanks I was cool color for a day not 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.220
 so rare i am still something more 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.840
 precious how about more 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.149
 precious of my own for me as 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.429
 my dad he is a chemical engineer 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:57.350
 dota with elements and has patent 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:59.060
 As for his sulfu sulfur course 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.030
 funny what sulphur can do 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.860
 we give hair like a dog 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.780
 what are we going to do we take 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.720
 glass tube and fillable 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.569
 laughing gas nitrous oxide n2 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.780
 we pour some water into the tube to 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.230
 damp and protect the pipe and then 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.269
 we pour carbon disulfide it's very volatile 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.120
 will evaporate giving us a mixture of gases 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.610
 inside the pipe at the end I will bring fire 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.890
 at the top of the tube carbon disulfide will burn 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.440
 along with this temperature and pressure 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.930
 inside the tube increases the reaction 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:43.970
 passes faster faster fire 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:46.750
 accelerates and then take a look at gray on 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.180
 pipe walls 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.090
 I have a different cool reaction 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.430
 purpose and even if you think that sulfur 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.950
 dear and dear to my heart and in general 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.530
 the mind is not so rare so let's 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.470
 introduced to extremes and talk about becoming 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.349
 and become so rare on earth that we 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.019
 don't even know what it looks like if you 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.090
 collect atoms stay enough 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.010
 to see your eyes immediately 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.430
 evaporator itself due to radioactive 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.620
 radiation is radioactive 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.959
 means that it is not suitable for the ring 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.980
 so let's take something a little 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.870
 more standard 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.420
 gold gold of course is known for its 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.709
 inertness that's why she can do 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.319
 you richer if you have a lot of gold 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.989
 lying around most likely on mixed with 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.120
 other elements but its solubility 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.269
 or corrosion is actually zero 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.750
 except for some special solutions in 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.910
 particular one opened in 1300 with 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.519
 psy the name of the royal vodka 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.900
 made from hydrochloric and nitric acid 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.760
 which are done now thanks not from 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.560
 periodic videos we use 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.690
 protective masks because evaporation 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.569
 which is obtained from nitric acid 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.280
 very dangerous is it us and on 2 or borax wasps 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.680
 if you inhale it 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.319
 nitric acid or strong vodka will 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.239
 form your lungs and so instead 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.280
 of this we will put a piece of gold in 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.160
 aqua regia for example we use this 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.500
 ancient priceless public experience as 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.950
 of how things dissolve and go 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.990
 gas formed gold 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.150
 hydrochloric acid and ric from 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.190
 latin word gold that's why 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.800
 gold symbol of the periodic system 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.000
 table elements and you 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.480
 very sad to watch how 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.640
 gold dissolves 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.010
 I would like to know meta how to get 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.410
 gold from other things i know you 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.900
 think michael is just chemistry on 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.120
 chemistry is quite real modern 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.910
 accelerators we can connect particles 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.580
 creating elements of the accelerator us 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.970
 dj site colliders can create 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.330
 gold combining particles at a speed of 2 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:05.640
 million atoms every second nothing 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:08.790
 then how do we know well then we just 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.130
 incredibly baby they are so small think 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.650
 only if jeans can produce 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:18.740
 2,000,000 new atoms of gold each 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.740
 second they will spend 50 million years 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:30.000
 to withdraw one gram of gold gold 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.100
 rare precious expensive gold by 40 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.480
 percent more than Merida 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.670
 and plastically ready incredibly he is not 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.500
 dissolved in aqua regia on him not 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.980
 impact molten metal and 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.620
 high temperature silicates 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.320
 cool on not like the kings who 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.750
 react under heat 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.790
 emitting small sparks by continuing 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.560
 journey searching for the rarest and 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.730
 substances to make a ring of him 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.520
 need to consider 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.440
 office is an eternity only rarely that her 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.410
 contains less than one particle per 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.530
 billion of our earth's crust but we are not 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:10.410
 finished and ready and about the media both in the family 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:13.140
 mendeleev's platinum tables and if you 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.960
 look at platinum and much more 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.020
 than iridium or about the media for something more 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.750
 elegant we need to consider 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.330
 stable isotope here is one of the isotopes 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.810
 leggings finish my story dress on 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.660
 190 is a steady period mash 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.550
 half-life over a million years he's not 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.100
 radioactive you correspond to ours 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.930
 criterion ring made of rare 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.880
 strong enough neri active 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.890
 substances so it would be great 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.680
 ring now you probably wonder 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.409
 why i experimented elephant one 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.199
 sulfur 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:49.330
 gold is my goal that's what's interesting for 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:55.860
 him on the elements in the periodic table 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.860
 and as always thanks for watching
