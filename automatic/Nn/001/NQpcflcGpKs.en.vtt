a lot of you may have seen that spread
of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> cube<00:00:22.830> case<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:23.850> something

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
of the cube case and it's something

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
of the cube case and it's something
they're<00:00:24.390> very<00:00:24.420> similar<00:00:25.320> they<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.680> I'm<00:00:26.130> not

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
they're very similar they are I'm not

they're very similar they are I'm not
going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.580> lie<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.330> there<00:00:27.510> are<00:00:27.660> some<00:00:28.019> major

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
going to lie but there are some major

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.490 
going to lie but there are some major
differences<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.699> instance<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:31.140> front

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
differences like for instance the front

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
differences on the front the top is this

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.849 
differences on the front the top is this
one<00:00:59.129> only<00:00:59.280> has<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.579> fan<00:01:00.239> controller<00:01:00.859> whereas

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
one only has one fan controller whereas

one only has one fan controller whereas
the<00:01:02.129> X<00:01:02.280> part<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.670> cube<00:01:02.940> had<00:01:03.180> two<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:04.229> of

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the X part of the cube had two we of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
the X part of the cube had two we of
course<00:01:04.589> still<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> nice<00:01:05.309> power<00:01:05.670> button

notice that it's on the top path because

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.020 
notice that it's on the top path because
the<00:01:43.649> bottom<00:01:44.040> half<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.820> where<00:01:45.000> we

because<00:02:37.590> as<00:02:37.709> we<00:02:37.830> all<00:02:38.010> know<00:02:38.220> heat<00:02:38.519> rises<00:02:39.150> so

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
because as we all know heat rises so

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.120 
because as we all know heat rises so
whether<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.019> lot<00:02:40.200> or<00:02:40.380> not<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.739> can<00:02:40.890> still
