00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
doe foot applicator just like a lip

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.440 
doe foot applicator just like a lip
gloss<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.679> they<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:31.890> dry<00:00:32.369> matte<00:00:32.700> after<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> few

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
gloss but they do dry matte after a few

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.660 
gloss but they do dry matte after a few
minutes<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.079> they<00:00:34.500> do<00:00:34.559> take<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> bit<00:00:35.100> longer<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
minutes so they do take a bit longer to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.670 
minutes so they do take a bit longer to
dry<00:00:35.850> than<00:00:35.940> some<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.510> my<00:00:36.540> other<00:00:36.690> lip<00:00:37.020> creams<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
dry than some of my other lip creams and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.560 
dry than some of my other lip creams and
they<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.980> thick<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.700> i<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.000> scrape<00:00:39.329> off

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
they are thick so i have to scrape off

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:50.800 
they are thick so i have to scrape off
the<00:00:39.600> access<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.280> they<00:00:41.640> apply<00:00:41.910> smooth

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:01:03.100 

I<00:01:00.820> found<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.180> best<00:01:02.390> way<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.630> apply<00:01:02.960> these

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
I found that the best way to apply these

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.350 
I found that the best way to apply these
is<00:01:03.590> to<00:01:03.740> use<00:01:03.920> as<00:01:04.070> little<00:01:04.220> product<00:01:04.640> as<00:01:04.790> possible

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
is to use as little product as possible

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.240 
is to use as little product as possible
so<00:01:05.810> just<00:01:06.020> spread<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.410> on<00:01:06.590> your<00:01:06.620> bottom<00:01:06.920> lip

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
so just spread it on your bottom lip

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.030 
so just spread it on your bottom lip
press<00:01:08.060> your<00:01:08.090> lips<00:01:08.360> together<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:09.170> fill<00:01:09.740> in<00:01:09.860> all

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
press your lips together and fill in all

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.010 
press your lips together and fill in all
the<00:01:10.340> spaces<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:11.210> missed<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:14.450> these<00:01:14.660> take

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
the spaces that you missed so these take

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.110 
the spaces that you missed so these take
a<00:01:15.230> little<00:01:15.590> bit<00:01:15.800> longer<00:01:16.070> than<00:01:16.490> my<00:01:16.610> other<00:01:16.640> lip

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
a little bit longer than my other lip

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.360 
a little bit longer than my other lip
creams<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.660> dry<00:01:17.990> as<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.740> can<00:01:18.890> see<00:01:19.070> it's<00:01:19.220> sort

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
creams to dry as you can see it's sort

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.150 
creams to dry as you can see it's sort
of<00:01:19.490> sticky<00:01:19.910> here<00:01:20.450> but<00:01:20.960> after<00:01:21.170> about<00:01:21.740> five

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
of sticky here but after about five

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:30.940 
of sticky here but after about five
minutes<00:01:22.190> it<00:01:22.730> doesn't<00:01:23.060> do<00:01:23.150> that<00:01:23.300> anymore<00:01:29.950> out

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
minutes it doesn't do that anymore out

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.370 
minutes it doesn't do that anymore out
of<00:01:31.130> all<00:01:31.340> of<00:01:31.369> these<00:01:31.700> colors<00:01:32.030> I<00:01:32.360> think<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.050> red

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
of all of these colors I think the red

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.020 
of all of these colors I think the red
one<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:33.710> my<00:01:33.860> favorite<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.580> purple<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.000> my

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
one is my favorite and the purple is my

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.660 
one is my favorite and the purple is my
second<00:01:35.510> favorite<00:01:35.960> those<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.830> apply<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.460> little

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
second favorite those to apply a little

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.060 
second favorite those to apply a little
bit<00:01:37.820> more<00:01:38.030> smooth<00:01:38.570> compared<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.320> atomic<00:01:39.680> I

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
bit more smooth compared to atomic I

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.700 
bit more smooth compared to atomic I
find<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.610> atomic<00:01:40.940> is<00:01:41.300> a<00:01:41.330> bit<00:01:41.600> thick<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.320> a

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
find that atomic is a bit thick and a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.650 
find that atomic is a bit thick and a
little<00:01:43.040> bit<00:01:43.190> harder<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:43.550> work<00:01:43.970> with<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.390> little

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
little bit harder to work with a little

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.450 
little bit harder to work with a little
bit<00:01:44.869> less<00:01:45.050> forgiving<00:01:45.350> because<00:01:45.800> of<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.220> color

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
bit less forgiving because of the color

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:57.760 
bit less forgiving because of the color
as<00:01:46.729> well

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.020 

here<00:01:58.770> I'm<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:58.950> showing<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.490> how<00:01:59.789> they're

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
here I'm just showing you how they're

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.420 
here I'm just showing you how they're
sort<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.450> smudge<00:02:00.899> proof<00:02:01.200> once<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.159> start

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
sort of smudge proof once you start

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.520 
sort of smudge proof once you start
eating<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.210> wear<00:02:03.450> off<00:02:03.659> especially<00:02:04.380> in

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
eating they do wear off especially in

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.130 
eating they do wear off especially in
the<00:02:04.649> middle<00:02:04.979> which<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.909> know<00:02:05.939> normal<00:02:06.539> but

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the middle which is you know normal but

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.109 
the middle which is you know normal but
yeah<00:02:08.039> they're<00:02:08.220> pretty<00:02:08.310> good<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.700> terms<00:02:08.880> of

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
yeah they're pretty good in terms of

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.270 
yeah they're pretty good in terms of
lasting<00:02:09.569> power<00:02:09.780> better<00:02:10.319> than<00:02:10.590> Nixon<00:02:10.979> terms

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
lasting power better than Nixon terms

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.580 
lasting power better than Nixon terms
anyway<00:02:11.750> however<00:02:12.750> they<00:02:12.900> are<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> little<00:02:13.380> bit

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
anyway however they are a little bit

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.130 
anyway however they are a little bit
more<00:02:13.709> sticky<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.400> last<00:02:14.670> smooth<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.780> next

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
more sticky and last smooth the next

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.750 
more sticky and last smooth the next
whipped<00:02:16.349> cream<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:16.980> these<00:02:17.459> are<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.670> three

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
whipped cream so these are the three

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.360 
whipped cream so these are the three
that<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.150> got<00:02:18.540> there<00:02:18.810> are<00:02:19.019> five<00:02:19.530> new<00:02:19.769> collection

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
that I got there are five new collection

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.940 
that I got there are five new collection
