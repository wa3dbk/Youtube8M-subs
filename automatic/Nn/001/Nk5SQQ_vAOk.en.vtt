00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.000

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.479
 but take it easy with force 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.970
 open here and then close again 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.670
 because you can take the things in there 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.290
 a real little suitcase a lot 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.350

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.060
 Herzchen then I'll continue here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.710
 that the three eyewear frames so the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.409
 is the frame up and there you can 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.920
 the different glasses on it 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.920
 stick 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.290
 so easy to put in from the front 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.290
 pull there 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.530
 blue with two flowers can be 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.770
 really just stuck and 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.850
 also deduct again 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.509
 and then we have another star 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.509
 join in 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.130
 that were the glasses ever 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.880
 here's another headband or something like that 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.390
 hairband and there you can get this lamp 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.390
 turn it on 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.180
 The lamp is here in front so are snaps 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.659
 i just do the kit but now 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.659
 very front and michelle room 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.620
 it does not work 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.930
 not with that but there you have to 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.830
 apparently love still turning 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.020
 change 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.020
 Three small batteries come in there 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.209
 then there is something so that you can 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.209
 life has been so peevish 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:20.690
 that's called well 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:24.030
 Photo Paul Nosko's concept is glitter 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.510
 as well as dying the handle 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.580
 on the suitcase then suitably have 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.260
 I should have such a vial again 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.130
 Buses and hops turn to be 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.410
 now you can even screw on and 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.739
 that is exactly a pipette right here 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.739
 even 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.610
 It's soft up here so you can 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.560
 press and then you see that here 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.560
 below also comes out as ordnungs 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.110
 maybe you can do so over water 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.130
 of course, test again 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.880
 I have water up here now 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.160
 filled in and then we want the whole thing 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.980
 let's try it so make it down 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.580
 let it be aware now it is pressing 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.140
 hopefully with water pumped up and 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.030
 I have high here I will be there 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.400
 give me a try 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.150
 works great so you can with 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.160
 use 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.390
 of course you can not do it at the game 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.240
 really make an ear 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.480
 but a little hippie metal water 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.920
 record that makes really fun 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.510
 Then there is an eye patch with 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.800
 there is a little glasses with 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.260
 eyes sign off 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.180
 the whole thing is in the heart tree from the 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.660
 Soft oxygen and that's something you can do 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.400
 so make a soaking and then did 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.490
 I just discovered that is one 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.430
 See how that sometimes happens 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.740
 ophthalmologist has to make it to the top 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.330
 big choice 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.669
 and depending on how good your eyes are 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.940
 So far you can tell if it is not down 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.610
 long a little bee and a fish 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.800
 are little beetles and that is one 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.320
 sticker sheet so you can see the sticker 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.610
 can deduct and of course, too 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.440
 to do the sight test 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.980
 Overall, I think that's all 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.570
 nicely made here, too, these glitter 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.290
 elements this is really for 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:20.340
 children very nice everything ajar to the 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:23.190
 series max meet and yes I think so 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.930
 altogether quite nice times look 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.930
 if all fits in the trunk 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:55.439
 Everything easily in the trunk and 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.389
 you can play that with whom and kerstin 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:59.699
 So a nice little first 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.099
 set you can even in the comments 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.559
