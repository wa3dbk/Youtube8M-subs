so on down the line and keep going back

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.890 
so on down the line and keep going back
and<00:06:24.190> forth<00:06:24.400> that's<00:06:24.940> the<00:06:25.060> best<00:06:25.300> way<00:06:25.540> to<00:06:25.570> do<00:06:25.840> it

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
and forth that's the best way to do it

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.260 
and forth that's the best way to do it
if<00:06:26.170> you<00:06:26.320> try<00:06:26.620> to<00:06:26.740> run<00:06:27.010> a<00:06:27.040> bead<00:06:27.250> down<00:06:27.580> there<00:06:27.880> can

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
if you try to run a bead down there can

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.010 
if you try to run a bead down there can
you<00:06:28.300> have<00:06:28.750> that<00:06:29.160> good<00:06:30.160> look<00:06:30.430> like<00:06:30.640> a<00:06:31.060> big<00:06:31.750> way

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
you have that good look like a big way

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.380 
you have that good look like a big way
in<00:06:32.050> the<00:06:32.440> ocean<00:06:32.950> so<00:06:34.260> you<00:06:35.260> can<00:06:35.440> see<00:06:35.650> a<00:06:36.060> much<00:06:37.060> more

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
in the ocean so you can see a much more

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.450 
in the ocean so you can see a much more
feature<00:06:37.690> and

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
feature and

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.430 
feature and
so<00:06:38.730> I'm<00:06:39.630> going<00:06:39.780> to<00:06:39.810> go<00:06:39.900> ahead<00:06:40.020> and<00:06:40.260> finish

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
so I'm going to go ahead and finish

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.760 
so I'm going to go ahead and finish
getting<00:06:40.890> that<00:06:40.980> welded<00:06:41.430> up<00:06:41.550> and<00:06:42.290> Bieber<00:06:43.290> right

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
getting that welded up and Bieber right

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.010 
getting that welded up and Bieber right
back
