wherever<00:01:58.189> you<00:01:58.280> getting<00:01:58.549> your<00:01:58.640> yarn<00:01:58.880> if<00:01:59.210> it's

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
wherever you getting your yarn if it's

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.209 
wherever you getting your yarn if it's
like<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:01.189> Super<00:02:01.520> Saver<00:02:01.700> red<00:02:02.240> heart<00:02:03.219> then

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
like this the Super Saver red heart then

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.730 
like this the Super Saver red heart then
it's<00:02:04.399> gonna<00:02:04.520> have<00:02:04.610> an<00:02:05.180> inside<00:02:05.659> edge<00:02:05.899> an

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
it's gonna have an inside edge an

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.639 
it's gonna have an inside edge an
outside<00:02:07.280> edge<00:02:07.430> so<00:02:08.119> don't<00:02:08.420> immediately<00:02:08.780> rip

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
outside edge so don't immediately rip

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.530 
outside edge so don't immediately rip
the<00:02:09.799> label<00:02:09.920> off<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.459> then<00:02:10.579> just<00:02:10.790> look<00:02:11.239> and

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
the label off and then just look and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.210 
the label off and then just look and
then<00:02:11.780> just<00:02:12.049> pull<00:02:12.320> from<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.620> outside<00:02:13.040> because

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
then just pull from the outside because

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.449 
then just pull from the outside because
what<00:02:13.640> happens<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.450> your<00:02:14.840> yarn<00:02:15.410> gets<00:02:16.220> easily

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
what happens is your yarn gets easily

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.640 
what happens is your yarn gets easily
tangled<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.840> way

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
tangled that way

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.559 
tangled that way
and<00:02:18.739> plus<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.549> ball<00:02:19.700> keep<00:02:19.939> spinning

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
and plus the ball keep spinning

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.920 
and plus the ball keep spinning
everytime<00:02:21.409> it's<00:02:21.950> too<00:02:22.250> much<00:02:22.430> work<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:23.299> there

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
everytime it's too much work so there

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.100 
everytime it's too much work so there
should<00:02:24.500> be<00:02:24.549> and<00:02:25.549> I've<00:02:26.360> already<00:02:26.629> pulled<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.989> out

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
should be and I've already pulled it out

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.470 
should be and I've already pulled it out
because<00:02:27.920> I've<00:02:28.040> been<00:02:28.159> doing<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.579> already<00:02:28.760> but

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
because I've been doing it already but

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.220 
because I've been doing it already but
there<00:02:29.689> is<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:30.250> line<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.640> goes<00:02:32.090> directly<00:02:32.480> I

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
there is a line that goes directly I

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.960 
there is a line that goes directly I
don't<00:02:33.950> know<00:02:34.010> if<00:02:34.069> you<00:02:34.159> guys<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.610> see<00:02:34.819> it<00:02:34.939> but

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
don't know if you guys can see it but

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.470 
don't know if you guys can see it but
inside<00:02:35.540> into<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.650> middle<00:02:36.950> if<00:02:37.939> you<00:02:38.090> pull<00:02:38.329> from

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
inside into the middle if you pull from

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.690 
inside into the middle if you pull from
that<00:02:38.629> inside<00:02:38.930> edge<00:02:39.140> it<00:02:39.439> naturally<00:02:40.069> unwinds

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
that inside edge it naturally unwinds

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.679 
that inside edge it naturally unwinds
the<00:02:40.760> yarn<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:43.000> reduces<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.359> don't<00:02:44.569> get

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
the yarn and that reduces you don't get

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.210 
the yarn and that reduces you don't get
tangles<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.200> way<00:02:45.379> it<00:02:45.470> reduces<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.069> amount

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
tangles that way it reduces the amount

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.949 
tangles that way it reduces the amount
of<00:02:46.340> tangles<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:47.000> get<00:02:47.180> if<00:02:47.420> any<00:02:47.689> what

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
of tangles that you get if any what

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.500 
of tangles that you get if any what
usually<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.470> don't<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.120> won't<00:02:50.390> get

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
usually you don't so you won't get

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.530 
usually you don't so you won't get
tangles<00:02:51.019> it's<00:02:51.650> easier<00:02:52.159> for<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.000> measure

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
tangles it's easier for you to measure

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.940 
tangles it's easier for you to measure
the<00:02:53.810> arm<00:02:53.989> because<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.440> can<00:02:54.590> just<00:02:54.799> keep

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
the arm because you can just keep

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.619 
the arm because you can just keep
pulling<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.519> straight<00:02:55.639> out<00:02:55.849> keep<00:02:56.239> pulling<00:02:56.540> it

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
pulling it straight out keep pulling it

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.990 
pulling it straight out keep pulling it
keep<00:02:56.840> pulling<00:02:57.139> it<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.859> naturally<00:02:58.099> unwinds

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
keep pulling it and it naturally unwinds

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.390 
keep pulling it and it naturally unwinds
from<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.239> inside<00:02:59.629> and<00:02:59.959> that's<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:00.889> really<00:03:01.190> just

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
from the inside and that's a really just

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.710 
from the inside and that's a really just
neat<00:03:01.670> trick<00:03:01.909> that<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.120> wanted<00:03:02.389> to<00:03:02.510> tell

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
neat trick that I wanted to tell

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.390 
neat trick that I wanted to tell
everybody<00:03:03.019> I'm<00:03:03.349> sorry<00:03:03.650> I<00:03:03.739> couldn't<00:03:04.040> do<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.370> a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
everybody I'm sorry I couldn't do it a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.679 
everybody I'm sorry I couldn't do it a
little<00:03:04.549> better<00:03:04.790> because<00:03:05.180> I've<00:03:05.329> already<00:03:05.540> been

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
little better because I've already been

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.190 
little better because I've already been
using<00:03:05.959> my<00:03:06.200> yarn<00:03:06.970> but<00:03:07.970> yeah<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.659> want<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.959> pull

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
using my yarn but yeah you want to pull

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.929 
using my yarn but yeah you want to pull
it<00:03:09.230> from<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.560> inside<00:03:09.709> edge<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:10.280> just<00:03:10.310> look<00:03:10.700> for

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
it from the inside edge so just look for

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.179 
it from the inside edge so just look for
it<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.239> if<00:03:11.359> you<00:03:11.450> usually<00:03:11.859> you<00:03:12.859> can<00:03:13.040> usually

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
it and if you usually you can usually

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.460 
it and if you usually you can usually
find<00:03:13.579> it<00:03:13.819> very<00:03:14.060> easily<00:03:14.389> it's<00:03:14.810> usually<00:03:14.959> like<00:03:15.319> in

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
find it very easily it's usually like in

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.920 
find it very easily it's usually like in
the<00:03:15.590> middle<00:03:15.889> but<00:03:16.760> wherever<00:03:17.150> your<00:03:17.420> yarn<00:03:17.689> is

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
the middle but wherever your yarn is

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.110 
the middle but wherever your yarn is
it's<00:03:18.260> nothing<00:03:18.680> outside<00:03:19.189> so<00:03:19.760> don't<00:03:19.939> just

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
it's nothing outside so don't just

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.729 
it's nothing outside so don't just
immediately<00:03:20.599> rip<00:03:20.930> off<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.260> label<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:21.709> the

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
immediately rip off the label on the

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.369 
immediately rip off the label on the
look<00:03:22.010> with<00:03:22.159> the<00:03:22.250> outside<00:03:22.790> edge<00:03:23.060> because<00:03:23.930> that

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
look with the outside edge because that

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.129 
look with the outside edge because that
is<00:03:24.530> how<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.739> get<00:03:24.889> tangles<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.669> it<00:03:26.540> takes<00:03:26.930> up

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
is how you get tangles and it takes up

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.580 
is how you get tangles and it takes up
too<00:03:27.260> much<00:03:27.290> time<00:03:27.970> seriously<00:03:28.970> if<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.260> do<00:03:30.470> it

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
too much time seriously if you do it

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.830 
too much time seriously if you do it
that<00:03:30.769> way<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:31.489> really<00:03:31.910> I'm<00:03:32.090> sorry<00:03:32.419> that<00:03:32.660> this

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
that way so I really I'm sorry that this

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.509 
that way so I really I'm sorry that this
is<00:03:32.989> getting<00:03:33.169> a<00:03:33.319> little<00:03:33.560> gross<00:03:34.010> but<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.280> just

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519

really want to show you guys that as a
knitter<00:03:36.669> it's<00:03:37.669> something<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.120> I've<00:03:38.209> always

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
knitter it's something that I've always

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.569 
knitter it's something that I've always
done<00:03:38.780> if<00:03:39.079> I'm<00:03:39.500> working<00:03:39.799> on<00:03:39.859> a<00:03:39.919> project<00:03:40.159> or

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
done if I'm working on a project or

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.220 
done if I'm working on a project or

lot<00:03:57.079> of<00:03:57.109> fuss<00:03:57.409> it's<00:03:58.069> a<00:03:58.159> really<00:03:58.519> neat<00:03:58.669> trick<00:03:58.879> and

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
lot of fuss it's a really neat trick and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.879 
lot of fuss it's a really neat trick and
just<00:03:59.359> dawned<00:03:59.629> on<00:03:59.840> me<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.109> there<00:04:00.560> are<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.739> lot

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
just dawned on me that there are a lot

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.140 
just dawned on me that there are a lot
of<00:04:00.919> people<00:04:01.099> out<00:04:01.250> there<00:04:01.459> who<00:04:01.579> might<00:04:01.760> not<00:04:01.909> know

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
of people out there who might not know

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.210 
of people out there who might not know
about<00:04:02.329> it<00:04:02.629> so<00:04:03.109> I<00:04:03.500> just<00:04:03.560> wanted<00:04:03.949> to<00:04:04.010> let<00:04:04.129> you

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
about it so I just wanted to let you

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.330 
about it so I just wanted to let you
know<00:04:04.250> we<00:04:04.940> get<00:04:05.180> your<00:04:05.299> yarn<00:04:05.540> if<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.500> comes<00:04:06.769> round

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
know we get your yarn if it comes round

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.699 
know we get your yarn if it comes round
if<00:04:07.699> it<00:04:07.790> comes<00:04:07.940> in<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.120> ball<00:04:08.359> which<00:04:08.870> usually<00:04:09.409> if

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
if it comes in a ball which usually if

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.819 
if it comes in a ball which usually if
you<00:04:09.829> buy<00:04:09.949> yarn<00:04:10.250> from<00:04:10.519> jo-ann<00:04:10.760> fabrics<00:04:11.359> or

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
you buy yarn from jo-ann fabrics or

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.670 
you buy yarn from jo-ann fabrics or
Walmart<00:04:13.239> then<00:04:14.239> it<00:04:14.389> does<00:04:14.629> they<00:04:15.409> like<00:04:15.560> the

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
Walmart then it does they like the

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.009 
Walmart then it does they like the
cheaper<00:04:16.010> yarns<00:04:16.280> usually<00:04:16.729> come<00:04:17.000> already<00:04:17.780> wound

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
cheaper yarns usually come already wound

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.920 
cheaper yarns usually come already wound
so<00:04:18.859> if<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.250> like<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.489> ball<00:04:19.729> like<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.030> then

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
so if it's like a ball like that then

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.100 
so if it's like a ball like that then
you<00:04:21.320> just<00:04:21.349> want<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.680> look<00:04:21.769> for<00:04:21.949> the<00:04:22.010> inside<00:04:23.110> the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
you just want to look for the inside the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.070 
you just want to look for the inside the
inside<00:04:24.500> edge<00:04:25.490> I<00:04:25.909> guess<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.449> would<00:04:26.570> call<00:04:26.599> it<00:04:26.779> I

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
inside edge I guess you would call it I

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.750 
inside edge I guess you would call it I
don't<00:04:27.110> really<00:04:27.320> know<00:04:27.500> but<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.460> want<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:28.639> look

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
for that one the one nest that you can

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:31.830 
for that one the one nest that you can
pull

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
pull

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.780 
pull
and<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.020> yarn<00:04:32.260> on<00:04:32.440> once<00:04:32.740> from<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.160> inside<00:04:33.550> not

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
and the yarn on once from the inside not

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.129 
and the yarn on once from the inside not
unwinding<00:04:34.510> from<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.720> outside<00:04:35.080> because

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
unwinding from the outside because

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.080 
unwinding from the outside because
that'll<00:04:35.500> cost<00:04:35.680> tingles<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.460> lot<00:04:36.760> of<00:04:36.820> stress
