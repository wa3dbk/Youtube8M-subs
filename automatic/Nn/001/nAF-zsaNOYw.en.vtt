00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
a fairly special cooler it's a but

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.990 
a fairly special cooler it's a but
certainly<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> only<00:00:55.920> top<00:00:56.489> down<00:00:56.699> cooler

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
certainly not the only top down cooler

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
certainly not the only top down cooler
in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> market<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:58.020> terms<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.440> aesthetics<00:00:58.949> not

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
in the market in terms of aesthetics not

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250 
in the market in terms of aesthetics not
bad-looking<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.780> looks<00:01:00.989> fresh

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
bad-looking at all really looks fresh

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.930 
bad-looking at all really looks fresh
and<00:01:01.440> modern<00:01:01.559> probably<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.789> white

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
five millimeters with 140 and height 74
millimeters<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.479> that's<00:01:12.659> definitely<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.229> very

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
millimeters so that's definitely a very

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.679 
millimeters so that's definitely a very
short<00:01:13.680> CPU<00:01:14.070> cooler<00:01:14.369> which<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.180> perfect

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
short CPU cooler which is just perfect

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
short CPU cooler which is just perfect

first<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.290> all<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.439> gotta<00:01:22.740> say<00:01:22.979> that's<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.610> very

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
first of all I gotta say that's a very

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.760 
first of all I gotta say that's a very
interesting<00:01:24.119> design<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.900> basically<00:01:25.380> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
interesting design here basically to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
interesting design here basically to
save<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.130> much<00:01:26.369> space<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:26.850> possible

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
save as much space as possible

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.200 
save as much space as possible
especially<00:01:28.470> height<00:01:29.100> despite<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> small<00:01:30.150> size

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
especially height despite the small size

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.929 
especially height despite the small size
we<00:01:31.079> still<00:01:31.290> get<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> lot<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.829> aluminum<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
we still get a lot of aluminum here the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.940 
we still get a lot of aluminum here the

trust me it's super quiet that's great
for<00:04:07.310> an<00:04:07.400> idea<00:04:07.670> expelled<00:04:08.030> price<00:04:08.510> performance

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.069 
for an idea expelled price performance
wise<00:04:09.230> for<00:04:09.530> 65<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.220> 70<00:04:10.579> dollars<00:04:10.970> this<00:04:11.569> cooler<00:04:11.900> is

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
wise for 65 to 70 dollars this cooler is

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.080 
wise for 65 to 70 dollars this cooler is
a<00:04:12.110> bit<00:04:12.319> pricey<00:04:12.560> but<00:04:12.980> then<00:04:13.280> again<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.849> pay<00:04:14.060> a

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
a bit pricey but then again you pay a

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.210 
a bit pricey but then again you pay a
lot<00:04:14.299> for<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.540> sophisticated<00:04:15.319> design<00:04:15.709> for

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
lot for the sophisticated design for

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.520 
lot for the sophisticated design for
small<00:04:16.370> form<00:04:16.789> factors<00:04:17.410> unfortunately<00:04:18.410> even

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
small form factors unfortunately even

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.830 
small form factors unfortunately even
the<00:04:18.739> C<00:04:18.979> one<00:04:19.190> still<00:04:19.850> interferes<00:04:20.419> with<00:04:20.660> high

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
the C one still interferes with high

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.290 
the C one still interferes with high
profile<00:04:21.350> memory<00:04:21.680> but<00:04:22.070> then<00:04:22.190> again<00:04:22.310> for<00:04:22.880> an<00:04:22.940> ITX

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
profile memory but then again for an ITX

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.420 
profile memory but then again for an ITX
build<00:04:23.570> you'd<00:04:23.960> be<00:04:24.110> using<00:04:24.440> low<00:04:24.590> profile<00:04:25.100> memory

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
build you'd be using low profile memory

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.430 
build you'd be using low profile memory
most<00:04:25.789> of<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.090> time<00:04:26.300> anyways<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.080> that

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
most of the time anyways and that

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.930 
most of the time anyways and that
wouldn't<00:04:27.710> cause<00:04:27.860> any<00:04:28.130> interference<00:04:28.820> issues

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
wouldn't cause any interference issues

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.150 
wouldn't cause any interference issues
by<00:04:29.539> no<00:04:29.600> means<00:04:30.050> would<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.289> really<00:04:30.710> recommend

by no means would I really recommend
