00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
I think to see all of that tool and the

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.260 
I think to see all of that tool and the
black<00:05:43.469> and<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:44.099> boots<00:05:44.370> and<00:05:44.639> the<00:05:44.729> Glitter<00:05:44.909> heel

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
black and the boots and the Glitter heel

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.329 
black and the boots and the Glitter heel
and<00:05:45.569> that<00:05:46.169> really<00:05:46.319> tough<00:05:46.620> attitude<00:05:46.860> with<00:05:47.309> a

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:47.339 
and that really tough attitude with a

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.399 
and that really tough attitude with a
big<00:05:47.669> bee<00:05:47.939> hive<00:05:48.149> you<00:05:48.629> know<00:05:48.749> it<00:05:48.930> really<00:05:49.080> is<00:05:49.289> such

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
big bee hive you know it really is such

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:50.779 
big bee hive you know it really is such
a<00:05:49.439> statement<00:05:49.740> in<00:05:49.979> faster<00:05:50.339> than<00:05:50.370> I<00:05:50.460> think<00:05:50.669> it's

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
a statement in faster than I think it's

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.670 
a statement in faster than I think it's
a<00:05:50.849> really<00:05:51.029> interesting<00:05:51.539> idea<00:05:52.139> that<00:05:52.349> that

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
a really interesting idea that that

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.350 
a really interesting idea that that
comes<00:05:52.919> out<00:05:53.069> of<00:05:53.099> the<00:05:53.279> world<00:05:53.460> of<00:05:53.639> narrowing<00:05:53.879> and

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
comes out of the world of narrowing and

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.570 
comes out of the world of narrowing and
I<00:05:54.449> think<00:05:54.629> if<00:05:54.749> you<00:05:54.839> really<00:05:55.139> take<00:05:55.289> it<00:05:55.409> apart<00:05:55.710> it's

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
I think if you really take it apart it's

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.010 
I think if you really take it apart it's
really<00:05:56.729> still<00:05:57.029> the<00:05:57.120> essence<00:05:57.419> of<00:05:57.449> who<00:05:57.599> she<00:05:57.809> is<00:05:57.839> a

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
really still the essence of who she is a

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.670 
really still the essence of who she is a
