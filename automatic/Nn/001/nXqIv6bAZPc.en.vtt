00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.160
 it's time again Böblingen district of the ice hockey league 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.389
 Torsten receives the TSV Heringen 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.650
 the first leg had to be decided with 15 4 won 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.449
 or from Friday and won in Schweinfurt 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.569
 At home he got one important on the roof against Höchstadt 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.439
 For this purpose, therefore, some goals Prang given therefore one believes here today 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.470
 At first, first on counter 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.470
 and makes the conductor distance shot 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.260
 the pirates from the beginning ran dangerous and now with the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.050
 For starters, stars are only themselves after Hildebrandt and 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.000
 designed at Harrer 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.010
 and then 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.350
 but it is again Dorfen in Powerplay Soldo again only big but 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.210
 there must then come more and that comes Bonn Altenberge who brings along 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.410
 the program 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.220
 nice shot in the lower corner but Hauser on her post 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.049
 then the eighteenth minute came from DuPont's to the 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.920
 4 Hillebrand at midnight that goes well and through 4 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.680
 I have to give that what they still knew 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 we have Dr the gate does not count 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.950
 it is supposed to be too 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.450
 but I think we want that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.090
 own store Children is higher Owen the company reports euro in the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.050
 Suspenders look at us the popular tour perspective still Euro 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.290
 But there is always too much Rheine perspective, but only 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.150
 maybe they will let you 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.610
 Investors also alive Henkel won ten times 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.170
 Competition reported the situation and then Lawrence Talbot is suggested the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.460
 General will be the suspenders to read everything they were allowed to do and then this one 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.860
 Shot of Schneider for the Erdinger in powerplay 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.030
 and that was it next to the first third 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.020
 After the break, there was a penalty in Barem's penalty 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.839
 Game delay to the IEEE Dengel the oldest in powerplay 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:22.029
 that was not at all safe for humans but they were for 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:22.589
 speech 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:29.629
 then come again the freshman Orlov that is Stürzer we will against 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.449
 Midnight with the Great Dane Popcorn Chester 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:34.289
 Daimler had 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:38.969
 he could have wanted to go in too close to the exact one 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.120
 Angle but the crossbar is preventing the movement 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.059
 another goal before midnight 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:50.249
 with the chance for he things wrong pass of the DSC organic wines to the spot 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.239
 and did not like one 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.239
 the 18-year-old was again clarify 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:02.979
 he shows the broad corpse Russia he put in the Powerplay 5 the go 3 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.019
 not to the ball here 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.980
 he is called one, we are life 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.980
 the drilling work prove there is not quite true 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.419
 the numbers are just the official information 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:26.319
 Hörber Schneider Jerez nice Linz short corner but Frank Prüß not here 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.440
 right where he should be, this is the goalie Davoser but actually too 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.729
 do 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:38.739
 In any case, 1 1 compensation and then again some stars for 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.500
 but open the price is already lost think it would go in the morning 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.419
 the LCDs falls 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.319
 the tax lawyer 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.769
 Mrs Dr so wanted 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.340
 then it goes back in the other direction a long pass on squares 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.830
 but that failed Arne Frank o 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.520
 who also do the Doctor WHO see through the stadium that we are the boys super 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.379
 exciting game it goes back and forth 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.799
 and that we dive in the final third of it so I will mention it first 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.489
 from which the WGZ see this hit ending point 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.569
 in order to concretely fail to face cancer here 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.259
 a loud one does not hit the puck at the area even going it alone 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.110
 and Brian Lenihan 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.939
 build the wall Spohrs 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:28.279
 about it pace 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:30.120
 Holtby go into me 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.590
 rather, he goes with the nice pass of Philipp Selldorf old 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.809
 Halftime to 1 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:42.079
 with the help of the location of the holder Iran 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.409
 we are taking the lead now 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:47.180
 here is the repetition 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.120
 Answers can be enjoyed again Last Eight Hour 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:52.729
 3 percent 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.009
 These through the defense through and then run up there exactly in the angle 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.009
 no chance of defense for women's choir 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.229
 söb söb söb komen de is available for Ems 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.250
 but the summit in Seoul all enforce this hockey game 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.509
 have seen 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.209
 because it will be keynote speaker of the election campaign was exciting 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.189
 to look at real value and that's she's trying now for the backlog 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:24.610
 to make amends for her third game forward but he does the power 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.599
 very clever at the back 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.759
 In the final minute is set is very often all serious 12 Maize disease 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.379
 promptly bring the sixth man and here 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:40.430
 one over figures so in the game we ask all of you to enjoy the 

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:41.759
 Colonize space 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.050
 because it is out of 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.379
 what did they do anyway, the captain 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.729
 There was nothing left to do with this last action 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.999
 tried everything 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:57.499
 the last shot from Altenberge and then Wars that 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.770
 the WG oldest winner the three points ago 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.119
 because they were just the back line it could have been the other way around too 

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:13.059
 can go out and ladies Bengali fire in the gl the eldest in the block of the 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:17.369
 sad conclusion of his so great hockey game should 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:20.129
 one can only hope that the ECJ is seeing 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:23.219
 this policy is for display 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.629
 because something really does not want any scenes in sports 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:31.800

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.969
 Christmas and for the tour we'll meet again 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:40.240
