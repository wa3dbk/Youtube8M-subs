00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
go from one state to the other by adding

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260 
go from one state to the other by adding
or<00:01:01.020> subtracting<00:01:01.050> heat<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.730> material

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
or subtracting heat from the material

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.380 
or subtracting heat from the material
take<00:01:03.960> water<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.559> example<00:01:04.710> its<00:01:05.549> solid<00:01:06.360> state

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
take water for example its solid state

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.830 
take water for example its solid state
his<00:01:07.140> eyes<00:01:07.470> add<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.400> heat<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.630> liquid

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
his eyes add the heat and you get liquid

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.920 
his eyes add the heat and you get liquid
add<00:01:10.350> more<00:01:10.710> heat<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:12.030> gas<00:01:12.299> or<00:01:12.720> vapor

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
add more heat and you get gas or vapor

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.100 
add more heat and you get gas or vapor
if<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.920> even<00:01:14.549> more<00:01:14.580> heat<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> gas

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
if you have even more heat to the gas

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.570 
if you have even more heat to the gas
the<00:01:17.100> atoms<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.820> get<00:01:18.030> torn<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.720> broken

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
the atoms in it get torn or broken

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.520 
the atoms in it get torn or broken
remember<00:01:20.580> each<00:01:20.790> atom<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.450> sort<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.320> an
