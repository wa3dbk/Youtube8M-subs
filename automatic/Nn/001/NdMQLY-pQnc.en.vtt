00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.890
 on the internet on youtube 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.319
 I saw that there are several reviews 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.440
 of the lord of the rings the lord of the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.469
 rings but of course there are 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.680
 very few and in Italian 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:20.160
 then i'm an admirer of read from 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.410
 many years but we lost a little 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.500
 hand because rightly we grow not yes 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.019
 look very much with the lord of the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.650
 rings I went to retrieve all the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.520
 set that of course I have already mounted e 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:41.129
 all I need is a couple of sets including 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.280
 this is the 94 73 the mine of death that 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.200
 still closed but when I got it by now 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.149
 past almost a year I dare say that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.780
 this is the box then i will do with others 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.420
 videos because they are not very practical of 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.600
 prepare videos with a pasted copy 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.770
 those things 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.930
 this is set to point of the mines of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.310
 moria in which there are some characters 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.610
 of the saga naturally begins 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.900
 I find troll cave cards 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:20.850
 pipino jim lee legolas boromir that two 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:25.290
 orcs from my turn out enough 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.080
 true to the film of course as normal 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:34.590
 that is with the entrance there is the reflection 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:39.750
 of light alas with the entry into the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.509
 the king's room the tomb the test that everything 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.610
 the rest, however, committed a little that not 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.390
 see even the film I have to go to 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.630
 remember everything we will see 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.719
 when when I put it all up 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:00.659
 it is unlike other non-experts 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:03.299
 I will not be able to show the building 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.350
 because they employ at least one 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.470
 figure 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.319
 and nothing 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:19.910
 the beautiful 7 this the box on the back 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:22.200
 some scenes of fighting weapons 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.900
 there should be columns that yes 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:32.520
 move to simulate the scene a bit 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.900
 of the fight and nothing as not 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.330
 I'm an expert 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.850
 I ask you to have patience and not 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.500
 expect too much from these videos below 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:46.290
 I enjoy it so much more to criticize 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.790
 commercial telephone companies 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.810
 and nice company 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:56.420
 this is just a passion instead 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.420
 see you in the next videos
