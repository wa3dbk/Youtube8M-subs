00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
one in Twilight Princess I think the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.200 
one in Twilight Princess I think the
visuals<00:00:35.420> really<00:00:35.870> gave<00:00:36.050> me<00:00:36.230> that<00:00:36.380> feeling<00:00:36.649> that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
made me more connected to him compared

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.140 
made me more connected to him compared
to<00:00:39.650> all<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.800> other<00:00:39.890> volumes<00:00:40.400> because<00:00:40.610> you<00:00:40.880> so

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150

realistic and it was actually given more

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.070 
realistic and it was actually given more
of<00:00:43.370> a<00:00:43.430> personality<00:00:43.940> compared<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:44.660> other<00:00:44.810> love

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080
