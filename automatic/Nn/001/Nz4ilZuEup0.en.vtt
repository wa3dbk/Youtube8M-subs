00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.909
 and immense everyone left the five and today 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.249
 we are in the new stabilization the 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.509
 1.17 that has come out today and how are you 

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:09.099
 seeing I'm with the new car that they have 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.809
 We are going to deny you here we are going 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.820
 to see how it is with the pieces that 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.860
 let's put it and how are you going to see I'm going to 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.720
 teach what it costs and on the page that 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.580
 we are going to get the ball here 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.530
 is on the internet and we are going to get into 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.240
 travel and transportation as you know and in 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.520
 the page of this I'm seeing here 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.550
 here would be this vehicle as you see 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.040
 here is called fulco dgt and the truth that 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.379
 It's pretty cool, it's not very expensive like you have 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.780
 seen and let's go tuning we'll see 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.789
 what pieces can you put and how 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.949
 stay Let's see if the car fast 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.660
 the bad thing that I do not have the maximum level and 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.249
 then I will not be able to put some 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.120
 pieces but more or less is going to be able 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:48.129
 see if the vehicle is good or we are not going to 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.649
 see how we're going to repair it first 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.230
 let's put shielding is worth this 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.539
 it would be just as well let's put this 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.339
 of brake we are going to put this one that is 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.579
 down here engine, I can not put it 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.309
 this 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.170
 but it also does not make a difference 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.670
 so it's not bad of classes I'm not going to 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.220
 put nothing the lights we are going to put the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.280
 This is already the license plate 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.600
 it is of paint we are going to put him but 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.680
 let's put the first all the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.240
 pieces and the last thing is going to be painting 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.670
 to see if it has a spoiler and to see how 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.950
 the turbo remains the maximum 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.030
 wheels will also be the last 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.789
 we are going to put the windows 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.290
 these and it has no spoiler or anything is what 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.820
 how strange 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.850
 so we're not going to put the paint 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.550
 for that it 's a pretty simple car 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.410
 so to speak and we're going to put a 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.030
 metallic color let's go down to these 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.280
 that are down here that are the ones 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.909
 those who are cool and let's see which one 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.520
 we put this I like 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.069
 This looks good, that's fine 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.689
 let's see what more colors are there and what 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.329
 it may look good, even though I think 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.110
 I'm going to put one of these blue 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.280
 I like this one 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.409
 yeah yeah yeah yeah waited let's put 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.360
 this is going to get black and place now 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.920
 we're just going to put blue that I think 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.780
 it may look good to see if there are here 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.880
 a black that I like is this this and 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.390
 this so that I think I'm going to put 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.090
 this and we will put you in the face 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.760
 let's also put another touch more like this 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.760
 neuro 0 or dark black 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.290
 this we are going to put this and now 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.630
 up in the secondary color we're going to 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.370
 put the metallic one we are going to put the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.780
 that we have seen before it was a cell 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.380
 these clear to the new agreement of the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.050
 name but I think it was this this one was 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.310
 key ok let's put this this blue 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.910
 and let's go now to what would be the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.230
 wheels to see wheels here type of wheel 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.300
 we're going to put some that are luxurious 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.240
 these there are down here that I 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.250
 like this I like let's put that and 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.220
 now we are going to put the color that I 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.040
 I think a blue color to see if 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.570
 we found this I think it's going to be 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.460
 that is too dark that both 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.940
 clear the accessory we're just going to put 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.710
 all this and the color we're going to 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.900
 put blue ticket will see how 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.220
 is left let's continue outside truth me 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.400
 I heard what happened and I thought 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.990
 I was going to have ailerons or something but 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.550
 good is a car is quite simple 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.320
 but the truth that still remains 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.750
 pretty cool the color I think it has 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.390
 well we're going to take this straight to 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.489
 see how we're going to go to the bottom 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.350
 more or less and let's see if it runs or not 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.460
 to be honest 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.010
 I know that some pieces I have not 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.510
 but it's a normal car 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.000
 sincerely he keeps running more the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.890
 environment but still pretty much the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.370
 truth what they have gotten is fine but 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.430
 I think it's an update like that 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.290
 it stops us saying good let's put 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.050
 this is not much but the next 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.390
 is going to be even bigger or so we hope 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.730
 let's take this here and we'll go 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.680
