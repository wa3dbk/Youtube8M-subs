00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.450
 the musician lazio more in today's video 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.640
 I bring you a video to remove the dns 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.200
 in grand theft auto 5 online this is the 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.150
 second video that I do because I saw that a 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.879
 some do not work the first one like this 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.410
 that if you are new see the video that I have 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.240
 in the first one and then do this then 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.550
 let's start the first one that I have 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.200
 It works very well but I did this for other 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.840
 things the first thing we have to do 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.940
 is to turn off our play and turn it on later 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.310
 we will not have to log in and then 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.490
 we have to address network settings 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.780
 and internet connection settings for 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.510
 do this the only thing that we have to 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.550
 to do is to have to enter here and roxana 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.980
 easy and give any advance or be 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.809
 nothing else enter the options here 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.609
 of network settings and they give everything 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.350
 easy then I recommend that you 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.089
 first I go to my first video that is the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.399
 I'm going to put on the screen I create a 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.570
 clip and apart I'll put them in the 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.179
 description for those who are in 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.059
 cell ok then once we have 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.429
 done all this network is going to tell us 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.620
 everything that is good and everything then not 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.600
 give him the test network or anything just 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.729
 when I finish doing this the only thing that 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.300
 we will have to do will be to go to 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.810
 game data tools and it will have 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.100
 delete update 1.08 is very 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.190
 important to erase it because I saw that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.450
 some did not serve the first process 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.380
 that I will also leave them on the screen 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 and that has been said 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.120
 and after this the only thing that we will have 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.130
 what to do will be to address 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.200
 system update and they will have to 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.270
 have the most recent I did not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.040
 because he had updated the system 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.810
 the latest version to try on 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.360
 any case has been put through the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.250
 dns and I went back to do the whole process to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.740
 verify then once they have 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.740
 done this still do not log in 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.350
 they will have to enter a carpool 5 and they 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.970
 they will ask for the actual 1.08 update 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.820
 the video already had it recorded to nothing else 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.160
 I did not put the first audio because 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.530
 it was very long I explained it very long and 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.170
 very difficult so it's the simplest 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.270
 and I just decided to do it that way so 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.890
 you were much easier and you 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.330
 better understand the video or that 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.010
 then you see it and in 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.350
 Quick camera indeed the update 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.570
 for you it will take a little longer 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.570
 that's what it's up to you 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.760
 internet have if they have one of many 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.709
 megas another one that is more or less one that 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.900
 dont have 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.970
 so 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.010
 the first process that I have was the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.230
 way of serbia that vic a lot 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.909
 people served him but this is like 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.650
 those who did not come to serve or 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.659
 anything or they are already bathed or 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.879
 anything this I think is going to 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.890
 serve quite well and I recommend them 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.920
 that if they want to do any hack of 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.840
 dns and do it in a secondary account 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.150
 because if they can not take the risk of 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.879
 a handling to a friend and they won it and I 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.030
 I explain and he said he just does not let him 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.280
 never enter a big photo 5 online but 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.650
 leave it with your secondary account 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.870
 so I recommend you do not go beyond 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.810
 at level 200 I recommend a 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.400
 level 150 because they were very much for the 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.579
 high levels and do not worry if you're 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.500
 a legal high level or that was in 300 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.019
 but you've done missions and you've put 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.510
 vicious there do not worry ok then 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.370
 Once you have loaded all that we 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.609
 will start to load the game me all that 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.220
 I put it in fast camera because it was very 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.709
 taken all this the truth is something of 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.609
 lazy here as well go the cameras 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.110
 very fast and this process the truth I 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.390
 I discovered it in fact 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.700
 I put another one is the one of nc that is for you 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.890
 I said I will put another one is the one of neza and 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.840
 I will try to remove it in another way 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.790
 for those who could not with the first 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.700
 because I know that maybe it's a mistake of 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.350
 the console and this process especially 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.900
 will serve those who have the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.370
 ok digital format then we are going to 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.200
 once we have done all that 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.930
 we will have to start the game but 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.400
 remember not to log in okey once 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.620
 download the game and here the only thing 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.600
 will have to do is login 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.010
 from here once I have loaded them 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.560
 the game here at grand theft auto online 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.970
 and give him on here they will only have 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.130
 to wait for the cloud to load and 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.570
 All this I put in quick camera for 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.910
 that you can appreciate and here we 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.580
 it appears the big auto a main of 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.440
 Christmas but that is not going to 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.959
 appear using more as I visit it 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.910
 he stayed there loaded but he did not 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.060
 worry will not have neither snow nor hacks nor 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.190
 none of that ok here is when I'm going to the 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.680
 cloud and like bill I do not put on camera 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.680
 fast that always without better everything 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.530
 we are seeing and once this is done we 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.270
 will automatically send to large auto 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.940
 in light and here I start to kill a 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.490
 little bit of people for others 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.010
 that was no longer anything happening 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.160
 happened before here as they see no longer 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.400
 load the snow that is something important and 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.010
 I no longer have invincibility or more 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.470
 things here my character appeared in a 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.420
 respawn where I had left it because 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.700
 I have the repetition in any 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.410
 point and here I just started to kill 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.480
 people not the classic cases in large 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.640
 lack of wars there are people of the street and 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.740
 you kill it here as you will see it in your 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.480
 lame screen money does not give me a 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.020
 trillion dollars or nothing but that 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.360
 just nothing else picks me up 20 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.730
 dollars or something like that then here they 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.010
 I show that I lost all that and look 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.170
 here I take a bomb and dropped it to 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.270
 floor and I kill myself here I verify that I no longer 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.920
 Invincibility then have them chavos 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.230
 see saying the steps 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.690
 the first step go to network settings go 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.660
 easy and leave everything the same 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.450
 second step delete the update in 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.950
 the game data files or how 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.950
 they are called grand theft auto 5 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.080
 remember we give version 1.0 8 and 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.150
 then they will have to update their 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.580
 version to the most recent 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.900
 but I do not remember what it is and with this already 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.670
 they should be fine 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.260
 then I hope you like the video 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.450
 have served them do not forget to give like 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.860
 favorites and subscribe to the channel and 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.050

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.190
 he sees ok chol no more to say to me 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.190
 goodbye goodbye
