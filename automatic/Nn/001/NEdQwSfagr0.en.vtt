four<00:00:38.649> kilograms<00:00:41.339> so<00:00:42.339> that's<00:00:42.550> probably<00:00:42.819> like<00:00:42.969> a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
four kilograms so that's probably like a

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:51.180 
four kilograms so that's probably like a
newborn<00:00:49.379> he's<00:00:50.379> got<00:00:50.589> one<00:00:50.739> like<00:00:50.890> that<00:00:51.039> all

know

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.390 
know
I<00:02:17.840> think<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.560> code<00:02:18.739> is<00:02:18.859> supposed<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.099> be<00:02:19.220> like

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
I think the code is supposed to be like

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.680 
I think the code is supposed to be like
7<00:02:20.319> 7<00:02:21.319> pounds<00:02:21.620> or<00:02:21.709> something

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.660 

she<00:02:28.290> feels<00:02:28.500> lighter<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.160> I'd<00:02:29.250> say<00:02:29.430> she's

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
she feels lighter so I'd say she's

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:42.740 
she feels lighter so I'd say she's
probably<00:02:29.820> about<00:02:30.030> six

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.320 

or<00:02:43.320> maybe<00:02:43.500> five<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:43.920> maybe<00:02:44.340> she's<00:02:44.640> six<00:02:44.970> or

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
or maybe five and maybe she's six or

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.500 
or maybe five and maybe she's six or
seven<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.650> on<00:02:46.860> them<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.280> don't<00:02:48.000> have<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> scale

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
seven and on them I don't have a scale

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.670 
seven and on them I don't have a scale
so<00:02:49.200> hope<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.330> enjoyed<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.660> thought<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.440> wasn't

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
so hope you enjoyed I thought it wasn't

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.630 
so hope you enjoyed I thought it wasn't
recording<00:02:53.010> for<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.160> minute<00:02:53.400> because<00:02:53.550> I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
recording for a minute because I

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.240
