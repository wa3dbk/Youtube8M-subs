00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
paints and stuff on them you can't do

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.370 
paints and stuff on them you can't do
anything<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> engine<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.229> anything

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
anything to like the engine or anything

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.960 
anything to like the engine or anything
like<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.650> they<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.280> bulletproof<00:01:35.579> tires

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
like that they do have bulletproof tires

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.210 
like that they do have bulletproof tires
those<00:01:36.240> sets<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.930> ones<00:01:37.290> sort<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> good<00:01:38.040> thing

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
those sets the ones sort of a good thing

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
those sets the ones sort of a good thing
but<00:01:38.759> besides<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.659> can't<00:01:40.110> really

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
but besides that you can't really

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.990 
but besides that you can't really
customize<00:01:40.590> them<00:01:41.040> too<00:01:41.220> much<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.549> mean<00:01:41.670> besides

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
customize them too much I mean besides

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.609 
customize them too much I mean besides
the<00:01:42.150> color<00:01:42.420> which<00:01:42.930> does<00:01:43.110> kind<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.439> suck

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the color which does kind of suck

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.710 
the color which does kind of suck
because<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.250> know<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.360> could<00:01:45.540> take<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
because you know I if I could take that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.210 
because you know I if I could take that
truck<00:01:46.110> back<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.590> put<00:01:46.740> like<00:01:46.890> different

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
truck back there and put like different

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.319 
truck back there and put like different
engines<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.700> stuff<00:01:47.820> make<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> little<00:01:48.180> bit

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
engines and stuff make it a little bit

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.760 
engines and stuff make it a little bit
faster<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.899> stuff<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.259> think<00:01:49.470> I've<00:01:49.680> been

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
faster and stuff I think I've been

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.350 
faster and stuff I think I've been
pretty<00:01:49.920> cool<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.490> overall<00:01:50.729> these<00:01:50.939> cars<00:01:51.149> are

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
pretty cool but overall these cars are

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.580 
pretty cool but overall these cars are
rare<00:01:51.570> obviously<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.049> can't<00:01:52.229> find<00:01:52.439> them

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
rare obviously you can't find them

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.289 
rare obviously you can't find them
anywhere<00:01:52.829> they<00:01:52.979> are<00:01:53.009> modded<00:01:53.790> into<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> game

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
anywhere they are modded into the game

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.719 
anywhere they are modded into the game
either<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:55.140> goes<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.590> sirens<00:01:56.430> flying

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
either there goes the the sirens flying

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.249 
either there goes the the sirens flying
as<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.630> pretty<00:01:57.750> neat<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.140> they

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
as you see so it's pretty neat that they

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.810 
as you see so it's pretty neat that they
actually<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.950> little<00:01:59.130> effect<00:01:59.520> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
actually have that little effect and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.249 
actually have that little effect and
