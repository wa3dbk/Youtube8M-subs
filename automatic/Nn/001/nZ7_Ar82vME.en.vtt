00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:09.160
 hi 6 youtube access to the image and in 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.740
 today I want to show you a couple of 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.740
 tricks for quick makeup and my 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.330
 hairstyle with wave is easy and if the waves 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.539
 they give the image a fresh language 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:25.210
 affable gentle natural youth so 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.160
 We know that it does not work for all 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.019
 occasions but is a very good choice 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.310
 to wear the hair an option 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.070
 wonderful when you want the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.199
 Hair looks plentiful and organized 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.670
 of course I have a tool 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.589
 Well, with what I do not have to do 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.600
 practically nothing makes life easier 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.430
 but you can do the waves with the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.449
 iron that you have the same I also have 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.449
 a video for that 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.740
 it's an inheritance for when you're going to 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.160
 comb your hair with iron can you 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.550
 good to use a cool shirt and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.550
 some small earrings or without earrings now 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.500
 yes we can start 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.630
 these are the three colors that I am 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.420
 using lately you know that one is 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.720
 house with some surely after 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.590
 when I run out you can use 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:20.710
 others or come back and so she fell in love 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.710
 what you do is delineate the lip 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.500
 with the eyeliner 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.950
 I do it exactly on the line or 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.030
 a little outside 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.030
 the stuffed 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.530
 and on top I would apply a shine like 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.670
 these that I love 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.090
 or 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.850
 a lipstick to tone or find this by 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.890
 example in orange I will do it with 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.820
 this brightness to preserve the color of the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.820
 eyeliner 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.850
 if ideas only the eyeliner 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.250
 lips are going to look dry and not do so 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.990
 pretty can make up those with lipsticks 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.840
 of different shades to make mixtures 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.400
 wonderful but the important thing is that 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.720
 delineates your lips very well because it 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.480
 note the difference of a few lips 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.820
 delineated and ones that not the delineator 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.400
 It is wonderful and is in use so you do not 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.080
 it's fashionable not to know how to use me 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.690
 I suggest that you notice some lips 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.750
 made up for all the women in 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.570
 any condition of age occupation and 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.810
 professional level and only the brightness 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.090
 with washed lips for students 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.610
 or for all women who go to 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.050
 gym or doing sports very well and with 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.090
 this iron, how to do it 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.170
 a lot simply what I do is 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.170
 divide in all 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.260
 pick up this part which is the one I'm going to 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.150
 do 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.150
 in a second moment 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.000
 and I will dress is 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.000
 to boot 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.420
 here I pick it 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.460
 I suggest that the first day what to go is 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.710
 completely that this and the holy see 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.770
 already the second round is the day you could 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.900
 think 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.840
 30 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.140
 or this hair art for different 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.300
 places and that look 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.300
 today I have no shadow what I did was 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.770
 this does not work perfect 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.520
 the caress 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.710
 and this is this 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.169
 once the waves have other hairstyles 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.229
 that work could follow 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.229
 a little bomb without singing I know what 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.800
 and a tail 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:52.330
 I do not use penilla only 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.900
 I comb my hair when I have wet hair 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.900
 rest 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.389
 only with 3 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.070
 we could also do semirecogidos 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.990
 that is to say 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.580
 let the loose 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.580
 to be noticed in the shadow 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.010
 or we could 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.210
 as we do not pull out with hair 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.160
 We must leave 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.410
 sometimes on the outside to notice the 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.330
 waves very well I hope you like the 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.360
