we are previewing today is a prototype
so<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.219> software<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> isn't<00:00:51.180> exactly

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
so the software on it isn't exactly

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
so the software on it isn't exactly
finished<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.250> good<00:00:53.579> enough<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:53.850> us<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
finished but it's good enough for us to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
finished but it's good enough for us to
give<00:00:54.629> us<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> nice<00:00:55.320> first<00:00:55.620> impression<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
give us a nice first impression as to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.639 
give us a nice first impression as to
what<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.420> smartphone<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.989> shaping<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.410> like

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
what the smartphone is shaping up like

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.069 
what the smartphone is shaping up like
so<00:00:59.250> let's<00:00:59.550> check<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.969> out<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.390> see<00:01:00.629> how<00:01:00.840> well

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
so let's check it out and see how well

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.860 
so let's check it out and see how well
it<00:01:01.350> performs<00:01:02.180> first<00:01:03.180> would<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.600> give<00:01:03.780> you

have<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.579> admit<00:01:32.939> however<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.259> one

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
have to admit however there is one

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.649 
have to admit however there is one
downside<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.400> namely<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.060> picks<00:01:36.420> up

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
downside to it namely that it picks up

downside to it namely that it picks up
finger<00:01:37.049> prints<00:01:37.320> are<00:01:37.439> rather<00:01:37.530> easily<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.549> at

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
finger prints are rather easily but at

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.359 
finger prints are rather easily but at

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
least they're relatively easy to get rid

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.910 
least they're relatively easy to get rid
of<00:01:41.600> overall<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.780> are<00:01:42.869> pretty<00:01:43.079> satisfied<00:01:43.649> with
