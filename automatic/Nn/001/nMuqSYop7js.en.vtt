00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.040
 Yes this time yes 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.550
 Poop 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:14.040
 It is a diff lock if it should be called a drive system drive system 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.040
 I made some modifications to the differential lock 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.890
 This vehicle is 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:25.390
 Land Cruiser Hachimaru vx Limited 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.800
 You know in what say vehicle of 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.370
 It is full time 4 wd 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.390
 so 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.870
 If you put transfer gear in this jail, center diff lock will be engaged 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.360
 In addition 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.360
 To the switch here 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:54.120
 Deer's Deaf Bock and more rear &amp; front lock 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.520
 In short, everything is locked and the four-wheel drive point of Gachigachi 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.190
 If there 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:03.430
 Say this 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:07.400
 It is an answer with a fairly strong gimmick as a Zummer runaway ability, but this is further added 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:14.310
 I modified it and tried to improve the convenience 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:16.440
 Yes This is the normal grade for this model was nice city plus one by one 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.220
 It bet that 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.220
 Here it is- 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.550
 Center diff lock switch 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:31.280
 I was not really with a chisel rather than switch part is is this 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:34.640
 Such It is Well just collapsed have been 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.470
 The it was a state that can not be used have been doing crushed This is why 2 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.220
 I put a switch 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:48.830
 Suites Stock'm You're Tsukekata wearing is this panel a little and remove it to a simple 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:56.120
 Because there is one connector left behind the panel of the panel , connect this switch there 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.490
 Top It is the first one is that you can only and will feel say say first, in which gave Te 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.590
 enter 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:05.549
 I can not block at the center when it is in the range, but I turn on this switch 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.810
 It is a child you enter remain in the state they were put in a high range and 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.810
 If you press this as it is 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.920
 Center differential lock will now take 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.370
 So for example 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.270
 It is winter in the frozen road surface Toka snow road 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:29.230
 If you can use the recording at the center at such times and still have a slight run up ability 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.230
 Even if one wheel is idle and stacked, it can run as it is 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:38.500
 Well before going to the high range even when traveling on snowy roads 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.730
 If this center diff lock is inserted, it will lead to an improvement in running ability. 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.590
 It means that it will be difficult to make an accident 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.459
 And better 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.640
 It is another one but it is the word I wanted to do most 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.430
 this 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.019
 I just put it in the low range 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.849
 When I put it in the low range normally, this will take a log at the center after this automatically 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:03.490
 It takes 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:05.640
 Please try it by 8 remodels. It doesn't take 6 at the center even if you put it in jail 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.370
 What's wrong with this 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.730
 When you say whether there is what kind of benefits 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.000
 Cross- country running cross country in the low range 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.110
 It is also when running off road 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.640
 It's become necessary maneuverability because it does not suffer a not a Center 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:25.819
 I say this because there is a disadvantage in that troubled a little and take're in center becomes Te the engine 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.719
 And small circle came to be heard 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:35.150
 Asphalt It was wet asphalt , but it felt like I tried it there 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:36.750
 It takes 50 centimeters to 1 meter too much to see if it takes at the center 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.230
 Or even do not know 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:46.900
 This will change I wonder if I say that the maximum rotation radius 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:50.100
 Of course, if you press the center diff lock switch while in this prison 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.060
 Fees will be charged at the center 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:59.180
 6 on the rear differential lock and rear front of this differential lock 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.180
 From the other home front differential lock on the state of and even take this 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.140
 It takes I Deer differential lock is here 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.140
 If it takes 6 more at the front desk 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:15.170
 In this state 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:22.160
 If you do not take the center differential lock in the state were placed in this loan 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:27.680
 Actually, I have to disconnect the connector under the car, but for that also 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:30.370
 The image and the plug-in will be explained The connector at the bottom of the car 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.990
 I have to dive below and take it off 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:40.360
 Automatically center differential also put in trying to sell and not remove the it's it is at stake 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:43.950
 Center can not be released of the founder only this switch is that it takes to put Rurouni 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:48.520
 You can not release the block with this switch alone 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.580
 It's just that you can put it in your lungs and be able to turn it on and off 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.759
 so 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.409
 I 'm not that good I just transfer gear 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:05:02.820
 That there a 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:07.530
 The connector on the right side of the vehicle body near the base of the propeller shaft on the rear side 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.600
 There are two connectors, but the muffler is true and it's a bit hard to see 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:16.620
 It is also a difficult connector 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:21.760
 It's very easy because you can feel it by hand because it's slipped out with your hand, and you can grip it out 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.190
 Is it passes through the lower connector put this water 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.370
 Quite 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.820
 Flexible 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:34.490
 You will be able to use the diff lock 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:40.090
 Actually I just removed it too, so I have n't run this tofu yet 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:42.720
 a Yes I think I can expect some improvement in handling 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.720
 that's all
