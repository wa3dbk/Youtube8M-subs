00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:31.749 
basically um these all the classes

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.780 
basically um these all the classes
create<00:00:32.110> a<00:00:32.140> class<00:00:32.410> you<00:00:32.860> just<00:00:33.010> pick<00:00:33.430> up<00:00:33.550> whatever

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
create a class you just pick up whatever

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.650 
create a class you just pick up whatever
you<00:00:34.060> want<00:00:34.270> to<00:00:34.390> compete<00:00:35.170> with<00:00:35.410> that<00:00:35.890> could<00:00:36.460> be

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
you want to compete with that could be

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.420 
you want to compete with that could be
in<00:00:37.660> my<00:00:37.899> case<00:00:38.140> it's<00:00:38.320> like<00:00:38.500> machine<00:00:38.890> guns<00:00:39.100> but<00:00:39.280> it

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
in my case it's like machine guns but it

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.369 
in my case it's like machine guns but it
could<00:00:39.640> be<00:00:39.730> sniper<00:00:40.030> rifle<00:00:40.510> specials<00:00:40.989> whatever

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
could be sniper rifle specials whatever

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.459 
could be sniper rifle specials whatever
you<00:00:41.620> got<00:00:41.910> obviously<00:00:42.910> if<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.149> have<00:00:43.469> submachine

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
you got obviously if you have submachine

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.529 
you got obviously if you have submachine
guns<00:00:44.739> you<00:00:44.920> don't<00:00:45.100> have<00:00:45.250> like<00:00:45.460> one<00:00:45.820> two<00:00:46.210> three

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
guns you don't have like one two three

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.299 
guns you don't have like one two three
four<00:00:47.230> five<00:00:47.679> six<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:49.120> a<00:00:50.019> lot<00:00:50.289> of<00:00:50.320> missions<00:00:50.559> it's

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
four five six and a lot of missions it's

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.459 
four five six and a lot of missions it's
gonna<00:00:51.519> get<00:00:51.760> them<00:00:51.940> it's<00:00:52.600> gonna<00:00:52.839> be<00:00:53.019> really<00:00:53.230> long

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
gonna get them it's gonna be really long

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.169 
gonna get them it's gonna be really long
I<00:00:53.679> mean<00:00:53.890> it's<00:00:54.039> achievable<00:00:54.370> but<00:00:54.789> you<00:00:54.940> got<00:00:55.089> to

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
I mean it's achievable but you got to

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.810 
I mean it's achievable but you got to
play<00:00:55.269> a<00:00:55.359> long<00:00:55.570> time<00:00:55.809> um<00:00:56.609> obviously<00:00:57.609> the

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
play a long time um obviously the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.700 
play a long time um obviously the
shorter<00:00:58.210> ones<00:00:58.390> are<00:00:58.570> sniper<00:00:58.929> rifles<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.559> got

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
shorter ones are sniper rifles you got

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.739 
shorter ones are sniper rifles you got
four<00:00:59.980> of<00:01:00.010> them<00:01:00.160> um<00:01:00.579> still<00:01:01.269> hard<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.629> achieve

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
four of them um still hard to achieve

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.590 
four of them um still hard to achieve
but<00:01:02.140> it's<00:01:02.409> much<00:01:03.280> better<00:01:03.460> than<00:01:03.789> now<00:01:04.030> achieving

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
but it's much better than now achieving

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.670 
but it's much better than now achieving
six<00:01:04.960> of<00:01:05.110> those<00:01:05.260> so<00:01:05.890> I<00:01:05.920> got<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.430> UM<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:08.500> the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
six of those so I got the UM I like the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.460 
six of those so I got the UM I like the
light<00:01:09.250> machine<00:01:09.430> guns<00:01:09.790> for<00:01:09.970> this<00:01:10.150> so<00:01:10.440> what<00:01:11.440> you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
light machine guns for this so what you

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.400 
light machine guns for this so what you
need<00:01:11.650> to<00:01:11.710> do<00:01:11.920> is<00:01:12.040> just<00:01:12.190> create<00:01:12.370> a<00:01:12.520> class<00:01:12.820> and

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
need to do is just create a class and

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.290 
need to do is just create a class and
your<00:01:14.410> main<00:01:14.590> screen<00:01:14.860> Stata<00:01:15.370> class<00:01:15.670> pick<00:01:15.970> up<00:01:16.120> one

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
your main screen Stata class pick up one

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.640 
your main screen Stata class pick up one
of<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.480> machine<00:01:16.780> knows<00:01:16.960> whatever<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.440> want

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
of the machine knows whatever you want

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.810 
of the machine knows whatever you want
to<00:01:17.740> do<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.130> here's<00:01:18.940> what<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.330> do<00:01:19.540> um<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:21.640> you

hit<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.120> cameras<00:01:22.540> over<00:01:22.660> here<00:01:22.780> you're<00:01:23.200> gonna

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
hit the cameras over here you're gonna

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.660 
hit the cameras over here you're gonna
see<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.620> diamond<00:01:23.860> is<00:01:24.070> open<00:01:24.370> there<00:01:24.520> but

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
way down to ghost X you're gonna see

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.300 
way down to ghost X you're gonna see
like<00:01:36.130> 50<00:01:36.850> headshots<00:01:37.270> after<00:01:37.630> 58<00:01:38.080> shots<00:01:38.470> your

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
like 50 headshots after 58 shots your

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.410 
like 50 headshots after 58 shots your
missions<00:01:39.730> gonna<00:01:40.110> kind<00:01:41.110> of<00:01:41.170> reset<00:01:41.650> right<00:01:41.830> here

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
missions gonna kind of reset right here

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.130 
missions gonna kind of reset right here
between<00:01:43.420> our<00:01:44.280> cryptic<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.520> ghost<00:01:45.910> axe<00:01:46.180> once

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.960 
between our cryptic and ghost axe once
you<00:01:47.320> get<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.590> cryptic<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.280> new<00:01:48.670> set<00:01:48.940> of
