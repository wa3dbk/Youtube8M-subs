00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 but since they are here there has not been 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.370
 commented on that occasion it is well to be more 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.930
 or a little bit here a few tricks the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.780
 way easier to get all the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.240
 skills in 7 online at 100% 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.910
 skills are resistance shot strength 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.400
 stealth flight driving and ability 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.470
 pulmonary so I'm going to give you the way 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.270
 easier and in my opinion which is 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.070
 all so good let's start 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.650
 let's go in order from up towards 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.670
 down so let's start 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.220
 we start with the resistance with the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.199
 100% resistance you can run swimming 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.910
 and pedaling on the bike for a long time 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.309
 more time to increase to one hundred per 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.079
 you have three options run running 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.730
 running in free mode with your friends 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.520
 that truth is the easiest way 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.500
 to do it or at least in my opinion the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.140
 next option is to go swimming is a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270
 little tedious but it depended on you and the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.730
 last is to ride a bicycle is a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.260
 a little bit faster but to me in what 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.739
 it's much easier for me 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.899
 run the skill goes up 1 % every 18 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.480
 meters running one percent each 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.399
 minute swimming and 1 % every minute in 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.989
 bicycle I tell them the easiest way 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.240
 to make this skill to one hundred 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.690
 a hundred in my opinion is to go running 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.760
 head 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.410
 is that my garage and is both a 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 block more or less because I prefer to go 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.610
 running to part with then with my 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.500
 friends in the answer is for our 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.360
 horrible then don that go running to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.340
 the road this skill I did it 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.510
 unconsciously fills it 100% 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.120
 because then you always go running 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.070
 you are always swimming, riding a bicycle 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.580
 I do not use it much but it is also a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.140
 option 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 in fact the easiest way to do it 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.970
 It's on a bicycle because you're pedaling and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.890
 apart from 1% up every minute in 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.110
 bicycle we went to shot to have the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.510
 100% shooting ability speed 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.160
 in which recharge is a weapon will reduce and 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.230
 will increase the capacity of bullets in a 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.270
 cartridge to have 100% stability 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.100
 there are too many ways like games to 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.600
 death by team 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.730
 free mode or killing other 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.340
 Survival people there are too many 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.960
 but in all you can make the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.790
 skill go up a little bit more 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.680
 fast there is no fixed number in the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.020
 specific to say one percent per 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.580
 every so many deaths but what yes 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.800
 you can do to increase a little 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.750
 faster your shooting skill is to give 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.910
 pure shots to the head either in 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.860
 games to death or survival or 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.780
 the free mode and killing the other 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.700
 people in my opinion the way 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.500
 it's easy to do this skill is in 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.720
 a team duel the truth is that it 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.060
 it makes me much easier apart from that to 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.709
 my opinion you gain much more experience and 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.870
 you gain much more no comparison of 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.120
 the survivals but that decision of 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.980
 each one of me personally I like 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.260
 more the games to death because they last 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.910
 less but that decision of each one what 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.890
 they can do in death games what 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.200
 can do with survival not what 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.670
 can do in free mode and here we 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.500
 we turn to the ability to force the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.390
 have 100% strength ability 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.190
 you can increase the damage you do to him 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.290
 to the other players in an attack the 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.060
 melee reduces the damage that you 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.920
 do the other players to you in a 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.450
 melee attack and you get more 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.400
 fast when it comes to climbing a wall or 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.170
 go up the stairs to increase the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.330
 strength skill is 1 percent by 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.160
 every 20 hits and that way they're 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.540
 watching here on screen is the most 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.970
 easy to do what they have to do 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.950
 is to get stuck to a wall and ask 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.959
 a friend of yours who with a car put on 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.580
 in front of you that the friend is 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.410
 stays inside but the blows are not going to 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.300
 count and once your friend is 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.640
 in front of you you will have to hit the 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.080
 car every 20 shots 1% of the 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.230
 strength ability with this method 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.060
 it will take about 5 or 6 minutes 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.950
 and the truth is that it is the most 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.840
 easy and faster than there are until now 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.640
 so if you want to try are 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.709
 free to do it skill and stealth 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.930
 alternating the 100 will help you 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.819
 move faster making less noise 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.560
 in stealth mode and many people 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.330
 They will say what is this for? 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.310
 activate the stealth mode to me the personal 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.260
 I use it in death games 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.910
 when you go running it is more 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.680
 noise in fact looks like a circle 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.390
 around your character 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.980
 this means that you are dating in the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.650
 radar of the other people me in what 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.209
 staff use this in the edge mode to 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.430
 do not stay on the radar of others 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.069
 People reach out stealthily 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.129
 skill goes up 1 % every 45 meters 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.470
 walking the new stealth and 1.5 by 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.540
 one hundred for every two stealth deaths the 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.370
 faster and easier way than I 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.620
 I recommend you go to a place 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.930
 sure I recommend you go to a 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.090
 house to your garage if you have a 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.890
 Once they are in your house, activate the mode 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.470
 stealth and go walking all his 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.239
 home go down go go up go 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.340
 giving circles the way you 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.220
 want more or less it takes about 30 to 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.900
 45 minutes complete the 100% stealth 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.360
 in fact, what I did was 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.250
 and something on top of the xbox control for 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.440
 that the lever was moving 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.229
 and leave it in circles inside I went to 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.419
 another side and the game continued to give in 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.220
 circles and so you will increase your stealth 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.840
 100% flight ability the 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.030
 flight skill I would say is the 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.580
 hardest skill to get from 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.410
 done, and I have not achieved it 100% 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.690
 have 100% flying ability 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.280
 to reduce turbulence and here goes to 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.930
 facilitate control of the plane the 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.910
 flight skill climbs one percent 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.979
 for every 10 minutes flying the truth 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.199
 to get stability you need to have 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.810
 a lot of patience and I recommend that 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.400
 this is not being forced better than with 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.750
 the passage of time in what you 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.729
 They are playing will increase the ability 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.360
 flight and is what I did not 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.190
 I have done neither flying foolishly nor anything 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.539
 I prefer it better because I do not know sometimes that 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.250
 I'm playing with my friends grabbing a 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.800
 plane and practice and things like that 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.599
 because the truth is that it is very much one 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.000
 percent for every ten minutes flying 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.460
 then nothing else is the skill that 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.560
 more work costs and it's the skill that 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.300
 more time you have to have from echo tarda 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.039
 about a few hours to have the 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.539
 one hundred percent skill the 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.500
 driving ability to have the 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.330
 Driving ability 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.580
 percent if it's going to be easier for you 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.530
 driving you will feel that the car is 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.570
 more stuck to the floor and it's going to be 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.640
 much easier to go around and you're going to 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.500
 be easier to skid things by the 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.240
 style and apart you will have much more 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.300
 control when you are falling that is 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.580
 you can control as in single mode 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.770
 player you can control one with more 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.630
 ease where you're going to fall and how 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.150
 you are going to fall there are too many ways of 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.800
 having 100% stability may be in 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.810
 free mode can be doing jumps 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.250
 bases or can be careers in what 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.290
 staff I recommend you careers 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.210
 because they are not going to be so much land 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.830
 or other than that you're going to make a lot of money 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.110
 and other than that you're going to win a lot 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.880
 experience then since you're going to win 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.560
 the ability to drive a hundred 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.270
 hundred then it does not go beyond winning a 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.810
 little money and will not also earn a 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.810
 little experience 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.690
 and finally the ability ability 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.300
 pulmonar personally this skill 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.980
 it is the most horrible ability that exists 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.930
 the skill that breaks if it does not work 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.060
 for nothing having the lung capacity 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.040
 100% you will increase the time in the 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.810
 that you can be underwater and you 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.790
 facilitate movement under water 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.700
 for stability 100% No of 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.830
 another one goes up 1 % for every minute below 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.140
 water so I recommend that you 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.170
 remain at a point that not at a point 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:57.950
 fixed and nothing else is impressing rb in 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.930
 xbox and r1 on playstation3 and nothing else 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.240
 I see nothing nothing else stay there until 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.060
 the breathing bar goes down 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.490
 already that it is at maximum and that they leave 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.990
 to drown rise or do not die anything to 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.240
