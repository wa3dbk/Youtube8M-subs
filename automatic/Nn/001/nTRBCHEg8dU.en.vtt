00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
know our identity a little more than

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.390

water and I leave enough water that just
covers<00:04:15.669> the<00:04:15.699> pasta<00:04:16.449> like<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:17.079> okay<00:04:17.739> now<00:04:17.949> I

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
take the pot with the beans and I pour

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.779 
take the pot with the beans and I pour
it<00:04:22.389> in<00:04:22.630> here<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.500> left<00:04:23.860> about<00:04:23.979> a<00:04:24.159> cup<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.699> a

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
it in here so you left about a cup and a

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.120 
it in here so you left about a cup and a
half<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:25.120> water<00:04:25.479> in<00:04:25.780> this<00:04:25.990> macaron<00:04:26.560> well<00:04:26.800> just

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
half of water in this macaron well just

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.250 
half of water in this macaron well just
enough<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.699> see<00:04:27.909> the<00:04:28.060> water<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.510> covered

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
enough that you see the water is covered

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.070 
enough that you see the water is covered
very<00:04:29.680> pasta<00:04:30.639> then<00:04:30.820> instead<00:04:31.449> of<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.659> cup<00:04:31.870> and<00:04:32.020> a

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
very pasta then instead of a cup and a

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.140 
very pasta then instead of a cup and a
half<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.530> cup<00:04:32.710> because<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.430> all<00:04:33.580> depends<00:04:33.970> how

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
half a cup because it all depends how

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.060 
half a cup because it all depends how
much<00:04:34.300> pasta<00:04:34.599> you<00:04:34.870> have<00:04:35.080> in<00:04:35.260> there<00:04:35.409> and<00:04:35.650> the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
much pasta you have in there and the

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.770 
much pasta you have in there and the
pasta<00:04:36.400> wood<00:04:36.580> is<00:04:36.699> better<00:04:36.970> than<00:04:37.180> adding<00:04:37.630> just

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
pasta wood is better than adding just

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.629 
pasta wood is better than adding just
regular<00:04:38.260> water<00:04:38.440> because<00:04:38.770> it's<00:04:38.919> exact<00:04:39.340> yeah

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
regular water because it's exact yeah

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.730 
regular water because it's exact yeah
and<00:04:40.300> not<00:04:40.510> only<00:04:40.570> that<00:04:40.810> you<00:04:41.110> want<00:04:41.349> to<00:04:41.470> toss<00:04:41.710> a

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
and not only that you want to toss a

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.580 
and not only that you want to toss a
little<00:04:41.949> hard<00:04:42.400> so<00:04:43.150> this<00:04:43.330> way<00:04:43.570> it<00:04:44.080> keeps<00:04:44.260> cooking

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
little hard so this way it keeps cooking

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.589 
little hard so this way it keeps cooking
in<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.070> keeps<00:04:45.430> cooking<00:04:45.849> in<00:04:45.940> here<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.510> then

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
in the keeps cooking in here and then

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.680 
in the keeps cooking in here and then
you<00:04:46.990> let<00:04:47.560> them<00:04:47.680> get<00:04:47.860> married<00:04:48.070> nice<00:04:48.690> ceremony

cover this until some of the water is
absorbed<00:04:59.849> okay<00:05:00.849> so<00:05:00.909> about<00:05:01.090> how<00:05:01.330> long<00:05:01.539> would

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
absorbed okay so about how long would

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.230 
absorbed okay so about how long would
that<00:05:01.780> be<00:05:02.080> well<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:02.680> check<00:05:02.889> to<00:05:03.130> see<00:05:03.340> oh<00:05:03.639> no

like<00:05:10.930> it<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.139> little<00:05:11.320> thicker<00:05:11.889> not<00:05:12.430> only<00:05:12.669> that

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
like it a little thicker not only that

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.740 
like it a little thicker not only that
it's<00:05:13.150> better<00:05:13.419> for<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:15.070> pasta<00:05:16.030> because<00:05:16.570> it

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
it's better for the pasta because it

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.320 
it's better for the pasta because it
absorbs<00:05:16.960> and<00:05:17.380> my<00:05:17.590> lips<00:05:17.889> exactly<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.669> then<00:05:19.300> you

absorbs and my lips exactly and then you

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.450 
absorbs and my lips exactly and then you
have<00:05:19.570> to<00:05:19.719> wonder<00:05:19.900> it's<00:05:20.620> absorbed<00:05:21.190> to<00:05:21.340> the

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
have to wonder it's absorbed to the

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.250 
have to wonder it's absorbed to the
amount<00:05:21.729> that<00:05:21.820> you<00:05:22.090> want<00:05:22.270> then<00:05:22.599> you<00:05:22.630> taste<00:05:22.990> it

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260
