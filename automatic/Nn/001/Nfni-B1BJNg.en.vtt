me<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.640> brand<00:01:53.970> completely<00:01:54.780> taken

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
me it's the brand completely taken

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.950 
me it's the brand completely taken
advantage<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> popularity<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.360> retros

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
has nothing to do with materials and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.749 
has nothing to do with materials and
this<00:02:01.049> whole<00:02:01.259> remastered<00:02:01.710> thing<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.640> they

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
this whole remastered thing that they

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.819 
this whole remastered thing that they
keep<00:02:02.969> pushing<00:02:03.240> at<00:02:03.600> us<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.079> raise<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.560> prices

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
keep pushing at us to raise the prices

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.490 
keep pushing at us to raise the prices
this<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.909> an<00:02:06.030> easy<00:02:06.299> way<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.570> prove<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.020> that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
this is an easy way to prove that that

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.729 
this is an easy way to prove that that
is<00:02:07.680> gimmicky<00:02:08.270> because<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.989> basically

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
is gimmicky because this is basically

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.070 
is gimmicky because this is basically
the<00:02:11.039> same<00:02:11.420> materials<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.540> they've<00:02:12.870> been

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the same materials that they've been
