00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
today I'll be teaching how to do the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.840 
today I'll be teaching how to do the
continuous<00:00:14.390> tomorrow<00:00:15.369> obviously<00:00:16.369> before<00:00:16.730> you

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
continuous tomorrow obviously before you

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.589 
continuous tomorrow obviously before you
start<00:00:17.119> you<00:00:17.300> need<00:00:17.390> to<00:00:17.480> know<00:00:17.600> how<00:00:17.660> to<00:00:17.690> do<00:00:19.390> okay

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
start you need to know how to do okay

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.890 
start you need to know how to do okay
now<00:00:21.320> the<00:00:21.890> trick<00:00:22.130> is<00:00:22.160> getting<00:00:22.580> this<00:00:22.910> to<00:00:23.210> go

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
now the trick is getting this to go

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.890 
now the trick is getting this to go
continuously<00:00:24.939> by<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.000> way<00:00:26.180> which<00:00:26.570> looks<00:00:26.840> like

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
continuously by the way which looks like

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.370 
continuously by the way which looks like
this<00:00:28.449> okay

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
this okay

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.340 
this okay
the<00:00:30.770> trick<00:00:31.130> is<00:00:31.449> well<00:00:32.449> first<00:00:32.900> you<00:00:33.080> have<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:33.290> ask

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
the trick is well first you have to ask

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.010 
the trick is well first you have to ask
yourself<00:00:33.770> how<00:00:34.270> do<00:00:35.270> you<00:00:35.449> make<00:00:35.660> a<00:00:35.690> continuous

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
yourself how do you make a continuous

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.450 
yourself how do you make a continuous
well<00:00:36.760> you<00:00:37.760> know<00:00:37.910> that<00:00:38.150> it<00:00:38.360> starts<00:00:38.720> like<00:00:38.900> this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
well you know that it starts like this

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.060 
well you know that it starts like this
but<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:40.879> can't<00:00:41.150> really<00:00:41.330> do<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.080> again<00:00:42.440> because

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
but you can't really do it again because

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.280 
but you can't really do it again because
the<00:00:43.820> center<00:00:44.059> of<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.239> Pens<00:00:44.449> like<00:00:44.629> right<00:00:44.809> here

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
the center of the Pens like right here

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.280 
the center of the Pens like right here
and<00:00:45.500> it<00:00:45.769> should<00:00:45.920> be<00:00:46.010> like<00:00:46.190> down<00:00:46.370> here<00:00:46.930> so<00:00:47.930> how

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
and it should be like down here so how

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.390 
and it should be like down here so how
do<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:48.470> solve<00:00:48.680> this<00:00:48.769> problem

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
do you solve this problem

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.130 
do you solve this problem
you<00:00:49.640> know<00:00:49.729> because<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.269> have<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.659> make<00:00:51.049> the

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
you know because you have to make the

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.289 
you know because you have to make the
pen<00:00:51.320> kind<00:00:51.589> of<00:00:51.710> go<00:00:52.040> down<00:00:52.070> before<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:52.879> can<00:00:52.970> do<00:00:53.269> it

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
pen kind of go down before you can do it

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.770 
pen kind of go down before you can do it
again<00:00:53.600> see<00:00:54.699> I'm<00:00:55.699> going<00:00:56.030> down<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:56.540> then<00:00:56.659> have

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
again see I'm going down and then have

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.810 
again see I'm going down and then have
to<00:00:56.870> do<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.080> again<00:00:57.350> but<00:00:57.920> I<00:00:57.949> just<00:00:58.220> readjust<00:00:58.729> the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
to do it again but I just readjust the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.079 
to do it again but I just readjust the
pen<00:00:58.970> every<00:00:59.150> single<00:00:59.390> time<00:00:59.769> so<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:01.190> way<00:01:02.030> to

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
pen every single time so the way to

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.609 
pen every single time so the way to
solve<00:01:02.420> this<00:01:02.540> problem<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:05.449> let<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.409> pen

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
solve this problem is to let the pen

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.830 
solve this problem is to let the pen
slide<00:01:07.070> now<00:01:07.760> watch<00:01:09.729> now<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:10.790> first<00:01:11.390> time<00:01:11.540> I<00:01:11.600> go

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
slide now watch now the first time I go

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.840 
slide now watch now the first time I go
around<00:01:11.930> I<00:01:12.260> do<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.590> push<00:01:13.010> of<00:01:13.159> a<00:01:13.340> little<00:01:13.729> thing

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
around I do the push of a little thing

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.179 
around I do the push of a little thing
but<00:01:14.119> then<00:01:14.510> I<00:01:14.540> let<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:14.960> slide<00:01:15.259> down<00:01:15.320> just<00:01:15.859> a

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
but then I let it slide down just a

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.010 
but then I let it slide down just a
little<00:01:16.219> bit<00:01:16.520> just<00:01:16.939> from<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.329> momentum<00:01:17.600> alone

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
little bit just from the momentum alone

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.889 
little bit just from the momentum alone
and<00:01:19.329> then<00:01:20.329> I<00:01:20.359> push<00:01:21.289> with<00:01:21.439> my<00:01:21.680> index<00:01:22.189> finger

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
and then I push with my index finger

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.080 
and then I push with my index finger
okay<00:01:23.899> you<00:01:24.619> have<00:01:24.710> learn<00:01:24.890> how<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.039> do<00:01:25.219> that<00:01:25.340> you

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
okay you have learn how to do that you

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.730 
okay you have learn how to do that you
should<00:01:26.299> learn<00:01:26.539> how<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.719> do<00:01:26.960> it<00:01:27.109> now<00:01:27.229> okay<00:01:29.740> of

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
should learn how to do it now okay of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.830 
should learn how to do it now okay of
course<00:01:30.829> you<00:01:31.039> can<00:01:31.219> do<00:01:31.340> with<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.700> for<00:01:32.600> the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
course you can do with the for the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.710 
course you can do with the for the
middle<00:01:33.020> finger

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.450 

so<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:36.800> just<00:01:36.950> doesn't<00:01:37.220> look<00:01:37.250> as<00:01:37.430> smooth<00:01:39.280> okay

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
so it just doesn't look as smooth okay

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.500 
so it just doesn't look as smooth okay
now<00:01:41.120> in<00:01:41.870> order<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.290> make<00:01:42.830> a<00:01:43.220> slide<00:01:44.060> down<00:01:44.270> you

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
now in order to make a slide down you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
now in order to make a slide down you
have<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.720> do<00:01:44.810> this<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.800> know<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:47.320> first<00:01:48.320> do

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
the thumb realm then you kind of lied

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.050 
the thumb realm then you kind of lied
just<00:01:50.900> a<00:01:50.930> little<00:01:51.140> bit<00:01:51.260> when<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:51.770> say<00:01:52.010> slide<00:01:52.370> you

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
just a little bit when I say slide you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.580 
just a little bit when I say slide you
mean<00:01:53.300> I<00:01:53.420> mean<00:01:53.690> that<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:53.990> don't<00:01:54.170> catch<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.380> you

mean I mean that you don't catch it you
just<00:01:54.740> kind<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:54.980> goes<00:01:55.130> around<00:01:55.370> okay

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
just kind of goes around okay

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.420 
just kind of goes around okay
only<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.720> would<00:01:56.870> you're<00:01:57.260> compelled<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.830> catch

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
only you would you're compelled to catch

it but instead you just let it kind of
go<00:02:01.870> see<00:02:02.870> how<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.230> goes<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> little<00:02:03.620> further<00:02:03.890> than

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
go see how it goes a little further than

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.720 
go see how it goes a little further than
before

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
before

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.150

that's the fighting right here not only
you<00:02:07.340> would<00:02:07.460> catch<00:02:07.760> it<00:02:07.790> right<00:02:07.940> here<00:02:08.210> right<00:02:08.920> here

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.970 

and<00:02:14.150> it's<00:02:14.360> getting<00:02:14.510> further<00:02:14.840> okay<00:02:15.590> that's

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
and it's getting further okay that's

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.270 
and it's getting further okay that's
sliding<00:02:16.600> now<00:02:17.600> with<00:02:17.840> slides<00:02:18.170> another<00:02:19.130> thing

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
sliding now with slides another thing

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.920 
sliding now with slides another thing
you<00:02:19.400> can<00:02:19.550> do<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:20.060> help<00:02:20.240> book<00:02:20.720> the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
you can do to help book the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.820 
you can do to help book the
repositioning<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:23.240> move<00:02:23.420> bump<00:02:23.780> up<00:02:23.990> yeah<00:02:25.060> up

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830
