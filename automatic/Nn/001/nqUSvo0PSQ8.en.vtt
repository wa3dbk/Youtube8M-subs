Optimus is very heavy I don't know he
probably<00:02:36.430> weighs<00:02:36.730> less<00:02:37.120> this<00:02:37.960> one<00:02:38.200> probably

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
probably weighs less this one probably

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.790 
probably weighs less this one probably
weighs<00:02:38.680> less<00:02:38.920> because<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.120> no<00:02:40.690> metal<00:02:41.020> but

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
weighs less because of the no metal but

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.250 
weighs less because of the no metal but
I'm<00:02:42.040> gonna<00:02:42.220> say<00:02:42.520> at<00:02:42.640> least<00:02:42.820> four<00:02:43.270> three<00:02:44.080> four

this guy is not five pounds so there you
go<00:02:54.750> there's<00:02:55.750> no<00:02:55.930> other<00:02:56.080> features<00:02:56.470> in<00:02:56.620> vehicle

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
go there's no other features in vehicle

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.240 
go there's no other features in vehicle
mode

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
mode

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.950 
mode
so<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.510> gonna<00:02:58.990> say<00:02:59.230> display<00:02:59.680> him<00:02:59.830> in<00:02:59.980> robot<00:03:00.370> mode

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
so I gonna say display him in robot mode

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.670 
so I gonna say display him in robot mode
I'm<00:03:01.960> gonna<00:03:02.140> go<00:03:02.260> ahead<00:03:02.350> with<00:03:02.500> the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
I'm gonna go ahead with the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.730 
I'm gonna go ahead with the
transformation<00:03:03.460> now<00:03:04.380> first<00:03:05.380> what<00:03:05.530> you<00:03:05.590> want

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
transformation now first what you want

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.960 
transformation now first what you want
to<00:03:05.830> do<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.190> if<00:03:07.000> you've<00:03:07.930> seen<00:03:08.140> my<00:03:08.290> stop<00:03:08.560> motion

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
to do is if you've seen my stop motion

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.460 
to do is if you've seen my stop motion
with<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:12.250> Autobots<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.959> see<00:03:14.230> how<00:03:14.410> he

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
with the the Autobots you see how he

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.449 
with the the Autobots you see how he
transforms<00:03:15.160> quick<00:03:16.150> but<00:03:16.570> this<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.400> way<00:03:18.400> I

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
transforms quick but this is the way I

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.740 
transforms quick but this is the way I
do<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.690> pull<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.050> arms<00:03:20.080> out<00:03:20.560> like<00:03:21.070> that<00:03:21.750> if

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
do it you pull the arms out like that if

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.540 
do it you pull the arms out like that if
we<00:03:22.840> take<00:03:22.990> a<00:03:23.020> look<00:03:23.170> at<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.410> underside<00:03:23.890> here

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
we take a look at the underside here

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.730 
we take a look at the underside here
we<00:03:25.030> have<00:03:25.240> this<00:03:25.650> little<00:03:26.650> thing<00:03:26.800> open<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:27.910> up

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
we have this little thing open that up

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.760 
we have this little thing open that up
push<00:03:29.740> that<00:03:29.920> up<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:31.320> up<00:03:32.320> comes<00:03:32.650> the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
push that up like that and up comes the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.230 
push that up like that and up comes the
hand<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:34.170> when<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.380> fingers<00:03:36.000> show<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.090> that

hand and when the fingers show you that
other<00:03:37.510> side<00:03:37.900> close<00:03:38.170> up<00:03:38.380> pull<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:40.320> down<00:03:42.510> push

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
other side close up pull that down push

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.250 
other side close up pull that down push
that<00:03:43.630> side<00:03:43.900> up<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.260> lock<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.160> back<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:46.510> all

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
that side up and lock it back and all

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.810 
that side up and lock it back and all
the<00:03:47.350> fingers<00:03:47.650> will<00:03:47.890> move<00:03:48.100> individually

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
the fingers will move individually

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.729 
the fingers will move individually
you'll<00:03:49.000> get<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.239> that<00:03:49.360> later

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
you'll get to that later

00:03:49.739 --> 00:04:03.930 
you'll get to that later
um<00:03:54.000> next<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:58.420> could<00:03:58.540> sort<00:03:58.780> of<00:03:58.810> see<00:03:58.989> this<00:04:02.730> if<00:04:03.730> we
