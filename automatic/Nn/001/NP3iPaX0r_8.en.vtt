00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
as long as the hair can go inside it and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.480 
as long as the hair can go inside it and
you<00:02:03.359> can<00:02:03.479> hold<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.959> it<00:02:04.319> looks<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.250> will

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
you can hold it it looks like it will

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
you can hold it it looks like it will
still<00:02:05.700> work<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.569> what<00:02:06.810> we're<00:02:06.990> saying<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.439> if

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
still work but what we're saying is if

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.839 
still work but what we're saying is if
you've<00:02:07.709> got<00:02:07.740> waist<00:02:08.039> length<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.489> by<00:02:08.700> all

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
you've got waist length there by all

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.630 
you've got waist length there by all
means<00:02:09.090> use<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.259> start<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.009> curls<00:02:11.280> from

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
means use it but start the curls from

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.759 
means use it but start the curls from
lower<00:02:11.849> down<00:02:12.120> starting<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.019> work<00:02:13.200> towards<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
lower down starting to work towards the

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.400 
lower down starting to work towards the
back<00:02:13.920> section<00:02:14.569> sometimes<00:02:15.569> it's<00:02:15.870> people<00:02:16.170> think

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
back section sometimes it's people think

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.809 
back section sometimes it's people think
it's<00:02:16.500> difficult<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.920> get<00:02:17.010> hold<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.459> we<00:02:17.580> have

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
it's difficult to get hold of it we have

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.420 
it's difficult to get hold of it we have
to<00:02:17.970> do<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.690> tilt<00:02:19.079> your<00:02:19.260> head<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.590> one<00:02:19.620> side

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
to do is tilt your head to one side

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.430 
to do is tilt your head to one side
so<00:02:20.879> that<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.720> know<00:02:21.840> see<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.230> hair

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
so that you can you know see the hair

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.030 
so that you can you know see the hair
take<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.340> hair<00:02:23.730> place<00:02:24.329> it<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.680> then<00:02:25.860> from

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
take the hair place it in and then from

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.740 
take the hair place it in and then from
about<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.459> yeah<00:02:26.849> we<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.269> do<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.450> from<00:02:27.540> there

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
about that yeah we can do it from there

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.210 
about that yeah we can do it from there
wherever<00:02:28.049> further<00:02:28.500> down<00:02:28.709> if<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.980> were<00:02:29.069> to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
wherever further down if you were to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.589 
wherever further down if you were to
close<00:02:29.750> what's<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.930> can't<00:02:31.440> be<00:02:31.530> easy<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:33.450> is

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
close what's that can't be easy it is

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.680 
close what's that can't be easy it is
this<00:02:33.870> way<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.170> get<00:02:34.470> curls<00:02:34.739> ever<00:02:38.150> release<00:02:39.150> it

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
this way to get curls ever release it

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.349 
this way to get curls ever release it
also<00:02:40.109> thinks<00:02:40.590> for<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.859> as<00:02:41.010> well<00:02:41.250> because<00:02:41.700> what

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
also thinks for you as well because what

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.490 
also thinks for you as well because what
it<00:02:42.450> does<00:02:42.629> is<00:02:43.079> it<00:02:43.980> alternates<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.030> curl<00:02:45.379> so<00:02:46.379> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
it does is it alternates the curl so the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.250 
it does is it alternates the curl so the
first<00:02:46.739> curl<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.579> you<00:02:47.640> put<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.090> will<00:02:48.840> go<00:02:48.989> one

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
first curl that you put in will go one

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.710 
first curl that you put in will go one
way<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.220> second<00:02:50.639> curl<00:02:50.849> will<00:02:51.450> go<00:02:51.569> the

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
way and the second curl will go the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.960 
way and the second curl will go the
opposite<00:02:52.049> way<00:02:52.109> so<00:02:52.590> jump<00:02:53.310> will<00:02:53.459> stop<00:02:53.639> the<00:02:53.730> count

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
opposite way so jump will stop the count

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.910 
opposite way so jump will stop the count
and<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.329> my<00:02:54.510> natural<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:55.049> guess<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.769> way

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
and that's my natural I guess that way

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.199 
and that's my natural I guess that way
yeah<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.400> gives<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.639> a<00:02:56.670> really<00:02:57.000> natural

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
yeah it gives you a really natural

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.990 
yeah it gives you a really natural
finish<00:02:57.889> so<00:02:58.889> what<00:02:59.099> I'm<00:02:59.160> gonna<00:02:59.220> do<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.730> start

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
finish so what I'm gonna do is start

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.599 
finish so what I'm gonna do is start
this<00:03:00.209> side<00:03:00.510> again<00:03:00.810> take<00:03:01.440> sections<00:03:02.069> back<00:03:02.310> to

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
this side again take sections back to

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.150 
this side again take sections back to
wall<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:03.090> center<00:03:03.510> much<00:03:04.440> easier<00:03:04.919> to<00:03:05.040> work

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
wall to the center much easier to work

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.530 
wall to the center much easier to work
on<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:05.489> hair<00:03:05.609> that<00:03:05.819> way<00:03:06.000> if<00:03:06.180> you're<00:03:06.299> trying

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
on your hair that way if you're trying

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.780 
on your hair that way if you're trying
to<00:03:06.599> curl<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:07.859> I'm<00:03:07.980> gonna<00:03:08.069> get<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.609> take

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
to curl it so I'm gonna get you to take

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.330 
to curl it so I'm gonna get you to take
a<00:03:08.819> section<00:03:09.180> mm-hmm<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.290> got<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.530> there<00:03:10.709> and

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
a section mm-hmm you got it there and

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.940 
a section mm-hmm you got it there and
you<00:03:11.489> just<00:03:11.669> place<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.389> and<00:03:13.290> then<00:03:13.410> tie<00:03:13.680> shut

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
you just place it in and then tie shut

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.250 
you just place it in and then tie shut
it<00:03:14.099> down<00:03:14.250> I've<00:03:14.970> actually<00:03:15.150> turned<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.780> time<00:03:16.019> up

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
it down I've actually turned the time up

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.650 
it down I've actually turned the time up
just<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.620> tiny<00:03:16.829> bit<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.090> can<00:03:18.269> hear<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
just a tiny bit so you can hear the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.010 
just a tiny bit so you can hear the
different<00:03:19.019> types<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.410> beeps<00:03:21.230> open<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.319> up

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
different types of beeps open it up

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.620 
different types of beeps open it up
and<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:24.650> see<00:03:24.860> what<00:03:24.980> happened<00:03:25.370> there<00:03:25.630> you've

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
and you see what happened there you've

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.110 
and you see what happened there you've
got<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:26.840> much<00:03:27.170> tighter<00:03:27.500> curl<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.820> it<00:03:28.970> just

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
got a much tighter curl and it just

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.640 
got a much tighter curl and it just
shows<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.360> I<00:03:29.570> was<00:03:29.750> talking<00:03:30.080> about<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.380> timer

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
shows you I was talking about the timer

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.580 
shows you I was talking about the timer
how<00:03:30.980> different<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:31.610> is<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.900> just<00:03:33.380> by<00:03:33.560> doing

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
how different it is and just by doing

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.560 
how different it is and just by doing
that<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.550> shows<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.210> gives<00:03:35.390> you<00:03:35.540> a

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
that it shows that it gives you a

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.500 
that it shows that it gives you a
totally<00:03:36.200> different<00:03:36.530> curls<00:03:36.710> yeah<00:03:37.510> it's

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
totally different curls yeah it's

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.740 
totally different curls yeah it's
completely<00:03:38.990> symmetrical<00:03:39.740> as<00:03:39.890> well<00:03:40.180> yeah<00:03:41.180> and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
completely symmetrical as well yeah and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.630 
completely symmetrical as well yeah and
I<00:03:41.840> think<00:03:42.140> some<00:03:42.350> people<00:03:42.500> fight<00:03:43.010> really

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
I think some people fight really
