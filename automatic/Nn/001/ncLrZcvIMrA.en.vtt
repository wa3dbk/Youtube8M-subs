00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
middle i think it's called the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.060 
middle i think it's called the
centrifuge<00:01:18.630> correct<00:01:19.259> me<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.500> wrong<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:19.950> it's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
centrifuge correct me I'm wrong but it's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.140 
centrifuge correct me I'm wrong but it's
the<00:01:20.190> thing<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.369> used<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:20.940> space

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the thing that used for like space

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.640 
the thing that used for like space
training<00:01:21.390> stuff<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> spin<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> circle<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
training stuff you spin in a circle I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.040 
training stuff you spin in a circle I
think<00:01:23.550> that<00:01:23.700> could<00:01:23.820> possibly<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.420> trap<00:01:24.780> like

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
think that could possibly be a trap like

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.380 
think that could possibly be a trap like
it<00:01:25.740> spins<00:01:26.070> around<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:26.910> a<00:01:27.090> zombie

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it spins around and then it's a zombie

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.820 
it spins around and then it's a zombie
it's<00:01:27.540> kind<00:01:27.660> of<00:01:27.690> like<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> flogger<00:01:28.200> from<00:01:28.619> shi

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
it's kind of like the flogger from shi

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.130 
it's kind of like the flogger from shi
no<00:01:28.950> numa<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.430> next<00:01:30.330> thing<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.540> seen<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.930> way

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
no numa the next thing I seen the way

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560 
no numa the next thing I seen the way
back<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> quick<00:01:31.950> revive<00:01:32.220> machine<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
back is the quick revive machine and a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.270 
back is the quick revive machine and a
jagged<00:01:33.930> line<00:01:34.110> which<00:01:34.410> kind<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> looks<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.160> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
jagged line which kind of looks like a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.660 
jagged line which kind of looks like a
thunderbolt<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:36.050> it<00:01:37.250> points<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> power

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
thunderbolt and it points to the power

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.730 
thunderbolt and it points to the power
button<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.479> guessing<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:40.140> that's<00:01:40.590> what

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
button I'm guessing because that's what

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.580 
button I'm guessing because that's what
it<00:01:40.830> that<00:01:41.729> symbol<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.600> by<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.899> other<00:01:43.229> power

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it that symbol is by the other power

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.830 
it that symbol is by the other power
switches<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.400> other<00:01:44.610> maps<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.570> I'm<00:01:45.630> guessing

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
switches and other maps so I'm guessing

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.390 
switches and other maps so I'm guessing
this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.380> main<00:01:46.560> power<00:01:46.890> room<00:01:47.159> where<00:01:47.370> you

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
this is the main power room where you

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.610 
this is the main power room where you
turn<00:01:47.580> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.760> power<00:01:48.140> alright<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.350> here's<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
turn on the power alright so here's a

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.500 
turn on the power alright so here's a
scene<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> same<00:01:50.520> area<00:01:50.940> but<00:01:51.240> i<00:01:51.270> want<00:01:51.450> to

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
scene from the same area but i want to

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.420 
scene from the same area but i want to
point<00:01:51.600> out<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.110> zombie<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:53.070> far

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
point out that the zombie on the far

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.920 
point out that the zombie on the far
left<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> big<00:01:54.060> red<00:01:54.270> arrow<00:01:54.299> pointing<00:01:54.900> to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
left with the big red arrow pointing to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.230 
left with the big red arrow pointing to
it<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.320> wearing<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.010> gas<00:01:56.220> mask<00:01:56.280> which<00:01:57.119> i'm

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
it is wearing a gas mask which i'm

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.789 
it is wearing a gas mask which i'm
guessing<00:01:57.390> has<00:01:57.630> something<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.080> with<00:01:58.260> no<00:01:58.409> six

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
guessing has something to do with no six

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.310 
guessing has something to do with no six
maybe<00:01:59.210> it's<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.390> member<00:02:00.720> of<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.900> essential

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
maybe it's a member of the essential

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.399 
maybe it's a member of the essential
group<00:02:01.590> which<00:02:02.190> kind<00:02:02.580> of<00:02:02.700> has<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.409> relationship

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
group which kind of has a relationship

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.460 
group which kind of has a relationship
to<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.979> executive<00:02:05.549> order<00:02:06.320> level<00:02:07.320> from

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
to the executive order level from

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.880 
to the executive order level from
campaign<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.049> section<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> map

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
campaign this is a section of the map

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.250 
campaign this is a section of the map
and<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.730> look<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.540> bottom<00:02:12.660> writer<00:02:12.959> by

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and if you look on the bottom writer by

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.870 
and if you look on the bottom writer by
the<00:02:13.290> fire<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.250> see<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.580> lot<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.820> a

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
the fire you can see that a lot of a

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.759 
the fire you can see that a lot of a
claymore<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:16.230> really<00:02:16.530> isn't<00:02:16.680> that

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
claymore this really isn't that

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.259 
claymore this really isn't that
important<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:17.310> i<00:02:17.459> just<00:02:17.670> thought<00:02:17.910> i'd<00:02:18.060> point

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
important but i just thought i'd point

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.820 
important but i just thought i'd point
that<00:02:18.390> out<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.840> way<00:02:18.959> people<00:02:18.989> know<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.680> is

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that out so that way people know this is

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.800 
that out so that way people know this is
a<00:02:19.860> playable<00:02:20.100> part<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.549> map<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:21.540> i'm<00:02:21.690> not

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
a playable part of the map but i'm not

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.660 
a playable part of the map but i'm not
sure<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.530> access<00:02:22.950> they<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> left

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
sure if you can access they on the left

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.560 
sure if you can access they on the left
but<00:02:23.910> i'm<00:02:24.060> pretty<00:02:24.209> sure<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:26.420> alright<00:02:27.420> so

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
but i'm pretty sure you can alright so

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.509 
but i'm pretty sure you can alright so
the<00:02:27.690> next<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:28.019> freeze<00:02:28.260> frames<00:02:28.500> go<00:02:28.830> together<00:02:29.010> so

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
the next to freeze frames go together so

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.550 
the next to freeze frames go together so
I'll<00:02:29.820> show<00:02:30.150> one<00:02:30.450> right<00:02:30.660> now<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.049> then<00:02:31.530> we'll

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
I'll show one right now and then we'll

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.710 
I'll show one right now and then we'll
probably<00:02:31.830> make<00:02:32.040> sense<00:02:32.340> later<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
probably make sense later so in the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.410 
probably make sense later so in the
background<00:02:34.170> there's<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.220> rocket<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.820> if<00:02:36.299> you

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
background there's a rocket and if you

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.180 
background there's a rocket and if you
haven't<00:02:36.690> figured<00:02:36.810> already<00:02:37.350> this<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.950> same

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
haven't figured already this is the same

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.310 
haven't figured already this is the same
setting<00:02:38.610> from<00:02:38.760> launch<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.840> map<00:02:40.049> launched

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
campaign and the big floating hovercraft

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.270

thing<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.900> sky<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.500> what<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.950> saw<00:02:47.100> in<00:02:47.190> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
thing in the sky is what you saw in the

thing in the sky is what you saw in the
previous<00:02:47.610> picture<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.300> guessing<00:02:49.170> this

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
previous picture and I guessing this

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.290 
previous picture and I guessing this
will<00:02:49.440> perhaps<00:02:50.069> maybe<00:02:50.670> replace<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
will perhaps maybe replace the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.460 
will perhaps maybe replace the
teleporters

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
teleporters

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.050

rare<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.460> my<00:02:53.550> thoughts<00:02:53.850> on

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
rare this is just my thoughts on

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.580 
rare this is just my thoughts on
official<00:02:54.390> information<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:55.080> I'm<00:02:55.170> not<00:02:55.320> sure<00:02:55.380> if

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
official information so I'm not sure if

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.130 
official information so I'm not sure if
that<00:02:55.740> will<00:02:55.950> actually<00:02:56.160> be<00:02:56.430> true<00:02:56.900> alright<00:02:57.900> so

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
that will actually be true alright so

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.320 
that will actually be true alright so
this<00:02:58.290> last<00:02:58.730> screenshot<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.910> showing<00:03:00.240> the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
this last screenshot is showing the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.720 
this last screenshot is showing the
space<00:03:00.660> monkeys<00:03:01.080> which<00:03:01.860> are<00:03:02.040> new<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.550> they

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
space monkeys which are new and they

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.880 
space monkeys which are new and they
apparently<00:03:03.000> steal<00:03:03.690> your<00:03:03.930> perks<00:03:04.260> which<00:03:04.560> I'm

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
apparently steal your perks which I'm

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.320 
apparently steal your perks which I'm
not<00:03:05.160> really<00:03:05.280> sure<00:03:05.400> if<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:05.910> or<00:03:06.180> not

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
not really sure if I like that or not

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.640 
not really sure if I like that or not
I'll<00:03:07.290> probably<00:03:07.470> figure<00:03:08.460> out<00:03:08.640> if<00:03:09.060> i<00:03:09.210> do<00:03:09.270> or<00:03:09.660> if<00:03:10.530> I

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
I'll probably figure out if i do or if I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.090 
I'll probably figure out if i do or if I
don't<00:03:10.860> when<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.580> play<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.540> whatever<00:03:12.870> um<00:03:13.110> I'm

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
don't when I play it but whatever um I'm

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.640 
don't when I play it but whatever um I'm
not<00:03:14.280> sure<00:03:14.340> if<00:03:14.880> these<00:03:15.060> will<00:03:15.330> like<00:03:15.690> beat<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.410> dog

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
not sure if these will like beat the dog

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.430 
not sure if these will like beat the dog
round<00:03:16.950> or<00:03:17.190> like<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.430> thief<00:03:17.640> round<00:03:18.110> but<00:03:19.110> I'm

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
round or like the thief round but I'm

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.170 
round or like the thief round but I'm
guessing<00:03:19.650> they<00:03:19.920> will<00:03:20.160> since<00:03:20.550> they<00:03:20.730> steal<00:03:21.150> your

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
guessing they will since they steal your

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.600 
guessing they will since they steal your
purse<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.960> if<00:03:22.050> they<00:03:22.170> came<00:03:22.350> like<00:03:22.530> every<00:03:23.100> single

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
purse and if they came like every single

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.150 
purse and if they came like every single
round<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.090> would<00:03:24.180> be<00:03:24.300> kind<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.630> lot<00:03:24.840> oh<00:03:25.160> and

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
round that would be kind of a lot oh and

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.340 
round that would be kind of a lot oh and
also<00:03:26.310> d<00:03:26.700> has<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.209> Nova<00:03:27.510> 6<00:03:27.690> followers<00:03:28.140> won't

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
also d has that Nova 6 followers won't

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.110 
also d has that Nova 6 followers won't
like<00:03:28.440> return<00:03:28.740> hope<00:03:29.370> not<00:03:29.550> those<00:03:29.760> things<00:03:29.970> are

like return hope not those things are

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.900 
like return hope not those things are
