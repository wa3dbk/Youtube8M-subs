00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
and you're just going to continue this

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:22.210 
and you're just going to continue this
process<00:02:04.340> until<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:06.080> reach<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.560> base

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.110 

okay<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.060> once<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.420> have<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.900> French<00:02:24.170> braid

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.150 

basically<00:02:34.220> at<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:34.640> very<00:02:34.820> top<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.420> base<00:02:35.630> and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
basically at the very top the base and

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.250 
basically at the very top the base and
then<00:02:37.160> split<00:02:37.550> up<00:02:37.730> into<00:02:37.910> three<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.660> repeat<00:02:39.230> the
