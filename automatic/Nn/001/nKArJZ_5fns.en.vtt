00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.410
 I am carlos carlÃ­n love sportsman of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.410
 elite I dedicate myself to spinning 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.730
 I'm 33 years old, I'm an elite sport 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.880
 of almost 10 years I started with football 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.500
 then I changed to mountain biking 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.210
 between cyclist damages too 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.090
 I participated in some races of 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.250
 adventure and now I focus on clearly 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.289
 for about four months what 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.880
 is the spinning combined with the trail 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.800
 bank and the stake laengen reach a 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.870
 top in the shortest possible time and 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.370
 descend in the same way as much as 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.530
 the possible represents the equator in 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.140
 this type of sites try to overcome the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.579
 time the terrain the weather I have some 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.160
 national rectors 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.480
 in some mountain routes 70 medals 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.670
 of gold for the equator in cycling 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.289
 I had the luck in 2012 is ranked 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.550
 among the 80 best in the world two 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.199
 participations in a World Cup 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.430
 cycling not maximum category I am 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.590
 bearer of a new world record 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.609
 world record for speed in climate 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.219
 char kilimanjaro 5,895 meters high 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.780
 It is a very emblematic mountain in the 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.509
 Africa is the highest mountain in the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.550
 continent the new world record is the 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.800
 complete that are 6 hours and 42 minutes 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.600
 with 24 seconds versus the record 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.480
 previous from kilian jornet that he had 7 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.850
 14 hours and the new climb record 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.220
 what I did with 4 hours and 56 minutes 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.530
 versus the kilian record that he had 5 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.810
 23 hours is more or less like going out to the 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.300
 height of one thousand 2,600 meters in height and 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.490
 coordinate the cotopaxi now I trust a lot 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.050
 more of me in my abilities and that's why 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.490
 I have put in front of a new challenge that is 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.950
 the aconcagua and to which I have been 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.850
 preparing properly to reach the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.250
 best conditions aconcagua 6.962 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.780
 meters high in the cun out for me 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.920
 It is a very important mountain 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.570
 only because it is higher 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.490
 continent but because it is in our 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.650
 continent my goal is to break the record 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.690
 world of kiel where you just put it 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.700
 Now on December 23, he was able to 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.250
 go up and down the mountain 60 kilometers 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.980
 with 40 other 1,300 of unevenness around 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.410
 12 hours and 49 minutes 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.720
 I hope I can lower that time how much 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.790
 I know the goal is to lower it I want to break the 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.880
 record of ascent decline and the full 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.010
 the psychological preparation as such is 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.230
 almost even more important than the easy 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.600
 that's why I also travel a lot of time before 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.240
 because I need to get away from things 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.250
 that can influence finding my 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.110
 best day in performance that will be and 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.120
 totally connected with him 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.010
 with mountain energy acclimatize me 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.930
 way to be away from social networks and 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.430
 be very focused on what is going to be 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.740
 the record the hardest thing of all in the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.210
 Aconcagua is cold and height is a 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.910
 height where we already entered the area of 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.130
 death to throw me with my own saliva 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.260
 could cause an edema could it make me 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.240
 harm to make the vision abort then 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.380
 is going to be a moment the world from 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.600
 the 6 minutes I will be very 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.550
 extremely trained concentrate and 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.440
 well-fed mental heleno ideal for 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.850
 the conagua since it's something from him 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.100
 from below from the lagoon of horcones 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.780
 where the record starts 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.850
 talking about two thousand 900 meters high 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.550
 similar climate to quito height similar to 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.190
 I remove where I will handle a 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.020
 good clothes well trailer to masses and 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.570
 for jogging from a certain height 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.430
 I'm going to change shoes I'm going to wear 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.250
 shoes already with a fiber de gaulle text 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.750
 and increasing the clothing until 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.900
 reach almost 7,000 meters where 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.030
 estimated at noon to get up in a 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.430
 temperature maybe minus 20 degrees 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.989
 explorer has allowed me to travel to 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.489
 kilimanjaro and in the same way is 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.600
 allowing to convert a second dream 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.550
 what is the aconcagua 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.000
 a sponsor for me is that 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.800
 company that supports you but explore for 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.620
 I am also a factor of friendship in 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.190
 where you can really ask something 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.380
 personal or make an order for totally 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.570
 unofficial which makes the 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.400
 agreement is more of a friendship as in 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.750
 house as elite sportsman of the 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.730
 Ecuador I recommend to all 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.740
 generations that go out and enjoy 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.090
 our moors of ecuadorians and of 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.380
 all the mountains that surround us 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.790
 It really is a privilege 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.520
 reconstruct a greeting to our friends 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.120
 from explorer follow us hashtag to concave 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.120
 2015
