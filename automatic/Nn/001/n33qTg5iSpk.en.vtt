 same and that school was not lacking 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.649

 and not as an actress but as a woman not 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.500
 we are used to thinking about what 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.230
 It is a process 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.700

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.670
 with you 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.520
 and I'm in full treatment the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.280
 results are giving very well 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.799
 and in that I want to thank as is the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.670
 page because the results of the good do not 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.670
 just because one 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.800
 good people my problems started 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.730
 since I was a child 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.670
 my life was never easy the first scare 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.920
 my parents took it when the edge 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.300
 from my cradle it occurred to me to say to my 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.120
 old 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.970
 who is the little angel of the house 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.400
 they had to take me down with a rope because 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.060
 with the wings that came out I started 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.240
 fly everywhere while fighting 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.100
 against his illness he keeps working 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.310
 making you laugh you said there was going to be a 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.060
 humorist and I know whether to be 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.060

 Humor is not just making people laugh 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.330
 for me it is the language in which I can 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.090
 tell my tragedy if someone laughs 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.170

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.980
 I hope the next one will see me with a 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.810
 glass of alcohol in hand 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.300
 and to toast with everyone who is 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.300

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.220
