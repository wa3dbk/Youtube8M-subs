00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
have to charge up this weapon and the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440 
have to charge up this weapon and the
magazine<00:01:43.710> capacity<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.490> 3<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.030> once<00:01:45.329> again

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
magazine capacity is 3 so once again

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.850 
magazine capacity is 3 so once again
there's<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> plasma<00:01:46.079> railgun<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
there's the plasma railgun and that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.100 
there's the plasma railgun and that
should<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.100> definitely<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.460> lot<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.700> fun<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.939> use

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
should be definitely a lot of fun to use

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.270 
should be definitely a lot of fun to use
next<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.380> arc<00:01:49.649> cannon<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
next we have the arc cannon and the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.160 
next we have the arc cannon and the

there's actually a burn card for this

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.469 
there's actually a burn card for this
weapon<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.579> could<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.909> wrong<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.270> but

you<00:02:10.500> can't<00:02:10.679> charge<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.819> also

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you can't charge it up but you can also

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.640 
you can't charge it up but you can also
shoot<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.270> very<00:02:12.480> rapidly<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
shoot it very rapidly and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.309 
shoot it very rapidly and
not<00:02:13.739> very<00:02:13.950> rapidly<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:15.000> watching<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:16.079> as

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
not very rapidly but watching you can as

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.319 
not very rapidly but watching you can as
it<00:02:16.439> did<00:02:16.560> say<00:02:16.739> but<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.610> looks<00:02:18.060> like<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.269> is

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
it did say but it looks like it is

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.670 
it did say but it looks like it is
recommended<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.780> tribes<00:02:19.260> depending<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.590> your

recommended to tribes depending on your

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.619 
recommended to tribes depending on your
playstyle<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.610> damage<00:02:20.909> is<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.360> little

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
playstyle and the damage is a little

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.119 
playstyle and the damage is a little
lower<00:02:21.780> than<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.989> railgun<00:02:22.500> was<00:02:22.680> but<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.950> still

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
lower than the railgun was but it still

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.369 
lower than the railgun was but it still
is<00:02:23.250> pretty<00:02:23.549> dang<00:02:23.730> high<00:02:23.909> accuracy<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.870> pretty

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
is pretty dang high accuracy is pretty

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.449 
is pretty dang high accuracy is pretty
dang<00:02:25.560> good<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.860> believe<00:02:26.069> this<00:02:26.189> about

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
dang good I believe this about

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.360 
dang good I believe this about
eighty-five<00:02:27.269> percent<00:02:27.530> well<00:02:28.530> out<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.620> 100<00:02:29.099> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
eighty-five percent well out of 100 the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.250 
eighty-five percent well out of 100 the
barf<00:02:29.579> this<00:02:29.849> filled<00:02:30.030> up<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.180> range<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.720> limited

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
barf this filled up the range is limited

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.960 
barf this filled up the range is limited
but<00:02:31.739> not<00:02:31.950> terrible<00:02:32.310> by<00:02:32.430> any<00:02:32.459> means<00:02:32.700> instead

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
but not terrible by any means instead

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.789 
but not terrible by any means instead
about<00:02:33.120> twenty-five<00:02:33.599> percent<00:02:33.750> fire<00:02:34.439> rate<00:02:34.650> is

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
about twenty-five percent fire rate is

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.770 
about twenty-five percent fire rate is
really<00:02:35.099> low<00:02:35.250> at<00:02:35.670> about<00:02:35.819> fifteen<00:02:36.269> percent<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.720> a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
really low at about fifteen percent in a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.990 
really low at about fifteen percent in a
magazine<00:02:36.959> capacity<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.680> 1000<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.819> looks

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
magazine capacity is 1000 so this looks

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.130 
magazine capacity is 1000 so this looks
like<00:02:39.090> another<00:02:39.299> weapon<00:02:39.689> though<00:02:39.870> me<00:02:39.989> laugh<00:02:40.109> when

these<00:02:41.909> weapons<00:02:42.239> will<00:02:42.420> play<00:02:42.599> like<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.989> was<00:02:43.379> full

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
these weapons will play like I was full

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.380 
these weapons will play like I was full
getting<00:02:43.829> discount<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.609> finally<00:02:45.090> we<00:02:45.239> have

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
getting discount and finally we have

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.390 
getting discount and finally we have
triple<00:02:45.989> threat<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.739> triple<00:02:47.010> threat<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
triple threat the triple threat is a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.770 
triple threat the triple threat is a
great<00:02:47.639> launcher<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.120> fires<00:02:48.359> three<00:02:48.629> grenades

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
great launcher that fires three grenades

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.170 
great launcher that fires three grenades
once<00:02:49.230> excels<00:02:49.950> at<00:02:50.129> clearing<00:02:50.489> interiors<00:02:50.909> and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
once excels at clearing interiors and

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.819 
once excels at clearing interiors and
it's<00:02:51.269> grenades<00:02:51.569> explode<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:52.049> armor<00:02:52.349> contact

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
it's grenades explode on armor contact

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.470 
it's grenades explode on armor contact
making<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.489> effective<00:02:53.879> at<00:02:54.000> close<00:02:54.090> range

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
making it effective at close range

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.509 
making it effective at close range
against<00:02:55.109> other<00:02:55.290> Titans<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.159> this<00:02:56.340> thing

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
against other Titans so this thing

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.250 
against other Titans so this thing
sounds<00:02:56.940> pretty<00:02:57.180> beastly<00:02:57.450> as<00:02:57.599> well<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.930> damage

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
sounds pretty beastly as well the damage

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.770 
sounds pretty beastly as well the damage
is<00:02:58.409> at<00:02:58.799> about<00:02:58.920> fifty<00:02:59.459> percent<00:02:59.760> ish<00:02:59.939> accuracy

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780

is really low at coming in at a boat I

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.970 
is really low at coming in at a boat I

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
say fifteen percent or I'm not sure

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.020 
say fifteen percent or I'm not sure
what's<00:03:05.099> up<00:03:05.220> with<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.370> damage<00:03:05.519> damage<00:03:05.819> is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
what's up with the damage damage is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.550 
what's up with the damage damage is
fifty<00:03:06.299> percent<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.810> actually<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.290> fifteen

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
fifty percent and actually is fifteen

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.379 
fifty percent and actually is fifteen
percent<00:03:07.799> I'm<00:03:07.950> sorry<00:03:08.159> I<00:03:08.730> don't<00:03:08.909> think<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.239> messed

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
percent I'm sorry I don't think I messed

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.910 
percent I'm sorry I don't think I messed
up<00:03:09.510> there<00:03:09.659> always<00:03:09.930> range<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.349> that<00:03:10.769> about

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
up there always range is that about

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.710 
up there always range is that about
fifteen<00:03:11.220> percent<00:03:11.459> same<00:03:12.150> with<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.329> accuracy

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
fifteen percent same with the accuracy

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.629 
fifteen percent same with the accuracy
the<00:03:13.109> fire<00:03:13.290> fire<00:03:13.739> rate<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.069> at<00:03:14.189> about<00:03:14.280> twenty

the fire fire rate is at about twenty

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.000 
the fire fire rate is at about twenty
percent<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.150> magazine<00:03:15.720> capacity<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:16.230> nine<00:03:16.500> so

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
percent and magazine capacity is nine so

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.259 
percent and magazine capacity is nine so
you<00:03:17.069> guys<00:03:17.250> will<00:03:17.400> label<00:03:17.609> fire<00:03:17.849> this<00:03:18.120> weapon

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
you guys will label fire this weapon

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.849 
you guys will label fire this weapon
three<00:03:18.569> times<00:03:18.780> as<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.109> doesn't<00:03:19.230> say<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.470> fires

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
three times as it doesn't say it fires

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.710 
three times as it doesn't say it fires
three<00:03:20.069> grenades<00:03:20.190> at<00:03:20.459> once<00:03:20.669> and<00:03:20.879> you<00:03:21.389> got<00:03:21.540> four

three grenades at once and you got four
reload<00:03:22.379> after<00:03:22.530> three<00:03:22.829> shots<00:03:23.069> cuz<00:03:23.970> that's<00:03:24.180> math

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
reload after three shots cuz that's math

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.869 
reload after three shots cuz that's math
9/3<00:03:25.349> equals<00:03:25.590> three<00:03:25.739> but<00:03:25.889> anyways<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:26.579> once

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
9/3 equals three but anyways this once

leaked to ordinance for the Titans and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.770 
leaked to ordinance for the Titans and
we'll<00:03:32.190> quickly<00:03:32.340> onto<00:03:32.699> that<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.180> for

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
we'll quickly onto that and for

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.689 
we'll quickly onto that and for
ordinance<00:03:34.109> that<00:03:34.260> was<00:03:34.500> leaked<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:35.340> was<00:03:35.579> not

ordinance that was leaked that was not
in<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:35.879> beta<00:03:36.060> we<00:03:36.449> have<00:03:36.569> cluster<00:03:36.959> missile<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
in the beta we have cluster missile the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.409 
in the beta we have cluster missile the
cluster<00:03:37.919> missile<00:03:38.250> pod<00:03:38.519> fire<00:03:38.819> is<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.060> missile

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
cluster missile pod fire is a missile

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.479 
cluster missile pod fire is a missile
which<00:03:39.599> on<00:03:39.900> impact<00:03:40.349> deploys<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.099> shower<00:03:41.340> of

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
which on impact deploys a shower of

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.860 
which on impact deploys a shower of
secondary<00:03:41.879> explosive<00:03:42.329> charges<00:03:42.599> that

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
secondary explosive charges that

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.869 
secondary explosive charges that
continue<00:03:43.229> to<00:03:43.290> explode<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.010> saturate<00:03:44.489> an<00:03:44.609> area

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
continue to explode and saturate an area

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.550 
continue to explode and saturate an area
for<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.150> considerable<00:03:45.599> time<00:03:45.720> then<00:03:46.349> we<00:03:46.440> also

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
for a considerable time then we also

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.319 
for a considerable time then we also
have<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.979> multi<00:03:47.250> target<00:03:47.669> missile<00:03:48.000> system

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
have the multi target missile system

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.399 
have the multi target missile system
this<00:03:48.479> thing<00:03:48.659> sounds<00:03:48.930> pretty<00:03:49.139> beastly

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
this thing sounds pretty beastly

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.740 
this thing sounds pretty beastly
multi-target<00:03:50.159> missile<00:03:50.579> system<00:03:50.940> enables<00:03:51.629> you

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
multi-target missile system enables you

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.080 
multi-target missile system enables you
to<00:03:51.780> engage<00:03:52.290> multiple<00:03:52.680> targets<00:03:53.250> at<00:03:53.340> once<00:03:53.370> hold

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
to engage multiple targets at once hold

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.610 
to engage multiple targets at once hold
down<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.299> ordinance<00:03:54.690> ability<00:03:54.989> control<00:03:55.379> and

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
down the ordinance ability control and

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.979 
down the ordinance ability control and
sweep<00:03:55.919> your<00:03:56.069> view<00:03:56.329> over<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.359> targets<00:03:57.810> to

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
sweep your view over the targets to

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.399 
sweep your view over the targets to
paint<00:03:58.199> them<00:03:58.440> then<00:03:59.430> release<00:03:59.699> excuse<00:04:00.629> me<00:04:00.780> to

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
paint them then release excuse me to

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.020 
paint them then release excuse me to
fire<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.799> missiles<00:04:02.099> at<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.430> painted<00:04:02.699> targets

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
fire the missiles at the painted targets

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.580 
fire the missiles at the painted targets
so<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.299> sounds<00:04:03.449> pretty<00:04:03.690> dang<00:04:03.930> legit<00:04:04.379> and

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
so that sounds pretty dang legit and

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.080 
so that sounds pretty dang legit and
also<00:04:04.859> there<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.129> tactical<00:04:05.669> ability<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.030> we

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
also there is a tactical ability that we

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.430 
also there is a tactical ability that we
have<00:04:06.209> not<00:04:06.359> learned<00:04:06.840> about<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.199> other<00:04:07.319> two

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
have not learned about the other two

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.750 
have not learned about the other two
tactical<00:04:07.650> abilities<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.159> were<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.609> game

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
tactical abilities that were in the game

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.699 
tactical abilities that were in the game
where<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.030> vortex<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.900> smoke<00:04:10.169> but<00:04:10.620> this

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
where the vortex and the smoke but this

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.589 
where the vortex and the smoke but this
thing<00:04:10.889> is<00:04:11.040> called<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.400> particle<00:04:11.849> wall<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.299> I

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
thing is called a particle wall and I

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.149 
thing is called a particle wall and I
think<00:04:12.659> i<00:04:12.930> mighta<00:04:12.959> use<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:13.379> one<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.680> most<00:04:13.829> I

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
think i mighta use this one the most I

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.009 
think i mighta use this one the most I
mean<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.459> vortex<00:04:14.819> shield<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.209> probably<00:04:15.690> I

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
mean the vortex shield is probably I

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.779 
mean the vortex shield is probably I
really<00:04:16.440> like<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.590> vortex<00:04:17.190> Eli<00:04:17.370> was<00:04:17.549> really

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
really like the vortex Eli was really

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.550 
really like the vortex Eli was really
founded<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.269> electric<00:04:18.570> smoke<00:04:18.840> anyways<00:04:19.470> the

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
founded the electric smoke anyways the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.379 
founded the electric smoke anyways the
particle<00:04:19.919> wall<00:04:20.430> tactical<00:04:20.940> ability<00:04:21.239> reads

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
particle wall tactical ability reads

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.269 
particle wall tactical ability reads
like<00:04:21.539> this<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:22.620> particle<00:04:22.979> wall<00:04:23.099> is<00:04:23.219> a

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:23.279 
like this the particle wall is a

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.610 
like this the particle wall is a
stationary<00:04:23.760> force<00:04:24.360> field<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.840> blocks<00:04:25.349> all

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
stationary force field that blocks all

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.940 
stationary force field that blocks all
incoming<00:04:26.010> fire<00:04:26.340> I'll

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
incoming fire I'll

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.710 
incoming fire I'll
one<00:04:27.040> side<00:04:27.280> while<00:04:27.790> allowing<00:04:28.030> weapons<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:28.570> fire

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
one side while allowing weapons the fire

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.510 
one side while allowing weapons the fire
through<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.110> from<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.440> other<00:04:29.560> enemy<00:04:30.190> weapons

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
through it from the other enemy weapons

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.510 
through it from the other enemy weapons
cannot<00:04:31.270> damage<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.990> our<00:04:32.320> seeming<00:04:32.860> weapons<00:04:33.190> can

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
cannot damage it our seeming weapons can

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.070 
cannot damage it our seeming weapons can
damage<00:04:33.820> it<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.090> eventually<00:04:34.210> take<00:04:34.600> it<00:04:34.630> down<00:04:34.810> so

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
damage it and eventually take it down so

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.170 
damage it and eventually take it down so
this<00:04:35.710> thing<00:04:35.920> sounds<00:04:36.220> pretty<00:04:36.520> dang<00:04:36.730> good<00:04:36.760> as

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
this thing sounds pretty dang good as

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.170 
this thing sounds pretty dang good as
you<00:04:37.540> did<00:04:37.630> say<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.040> bolts<00:04:39.610> initially<00:04:40.090> from

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
you did say you the bolts initially from

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.610 
you did say you the bolts initially from
enemies<00:04:40.540> won't<00:04:40.720> go<00:04:40.870> through<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:41.170> but<00:04:41.320> they<00:04:41.440> can

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
enemies won't go through it but they can

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.160 
enemies won't go through it but they can
damage<00:04:41.920> it<00:04:42.010> while<00:04:42.280> firing<00:04:42.610> at<00:04:42.940> it<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.870> can

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
damage it while firing at it and you can

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.810 
damage it while firing at it and you can
chew<00:04:44.380> through<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:44.680> without<00:04:44.770> damaging<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.430> but

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
chew through it without damaging it but

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.640 
chew through it without damaging it but
but<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.240> enemy<00:04:46.480> can<00:04:46.690> after<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.230> while<00:04:47.410> shooting

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
but the enemy can after a while shooting

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.110 
but the enemy can after a while shooting
at<00:04:47.830> if<00:04:47.950> it<00:04:48.070> will<00:04:48.250> be<00:04:48.370> destroyed<00:04:48.670> so<00:04:48.730> at<00:04:48.970> least

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
at if it will be destroyed so at least

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.640 
at if it will be destroyed so at least
once<00:04:49.600> again<00:04:49.750> everybody<00:04:49.990> this<00:04:50.080> was<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.320> Titan
