00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.740

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.189

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.980
 Marquitos as smart as possible are very 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.890
 easy to get very cheap and in 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 any importer and please already 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.050
 leave them ready to work we are going to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.290
 need arenite 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.250
 that does not have remains of shell or stones 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.699
 as clean as possible because we are going to 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.460
 make a sand frame and another one of remains 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.590
 Conchita pure are these although 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.750
 find where there are those lands in the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.850
 beach on the sand that are pure 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.119
 conchitas but if they do not find with pure 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.729
 sand is magnificent of course the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.300
 ornament of our frames the conchitas 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.300
 and to punish we're going to need glue 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.400
 liquid in a container can dilute it 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.360
 with water if you want and silicone 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:32.270
 we are going to need a plastic bag 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:34.460
 or a newspaper for the process we pour 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.840
 all the sand on the bag or the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.850
 all all newspaper and then with the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.270
 hand we extend it so that it is 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.420
 I plan the joke is that here for 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.110
 our frame then let's give it a 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.619
 Resolue passage without leaving spaces 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.229
 the little ears are very important 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.990
 you inspire yourself and if you want more 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.260
 beach crafts there they get into my 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.040
 main channel 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.520
 since we have everything full of resistol 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:15.480
 they will have something like that and this we're going 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:18.569
 to seal in the sand we let it fall 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.480
 and then we are going to press with so much 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.659
 force so that all the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.540
 sand to the handle we can even move it 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:30.750
 so slightly to notice that yes 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:36.000
 and then they're going to repeat this process with 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.390
 the banks when they finish this well 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 they will stay longer if they see any 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.360
 space as well as this one they put him 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.360
 resistol and then arenita 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.150
 it was time to decorate the wonders 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.090
 that we boldly collect or else that 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.050
 We decided to buy these stick with 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.210
 silicone and so the decoration is already of each 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.120
 who but I pass them a tip 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.580
 it looks great if the elements like that 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.250
 they get into the area of ​​the photo as in 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.830
 this example but you surprise me 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.500
 With your creativity I leave you the networks 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.200
 social networks and the mail of the program so that 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.870
 send me photos of how they fit but 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.570
 put his name for me to publish his 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.860
 photo with the corresponding credit in 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.860
 social networks look at what beauty 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.640
 now I will work the frame with the remains 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.180
 of shells same procedure what 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.290
 we cover with resistol we seal them and not 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.930
 we see lightly so that everything sticks 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.620
 spaces that have missed the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.800
 We cover with some liquid resistol and 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.670
 we drop shell remains in each 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.120
 hole 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.620
 then we decorate look just 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.170
 I recommend that when everything is 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.320
 finished we give you a little 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.320
 resistol to seal everything very well that 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.190
 be shiny and when we shake not 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.190
 it has sand 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.359
 we have 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.230
 one
