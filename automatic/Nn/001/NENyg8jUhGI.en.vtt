00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
out that I've taken over the right so we

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.889 
out that I've taken over the right so we
concentrated<00:01:04.129> basically<00:01:05.000> with<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.570> novice

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
concentrated basically with the novice

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.609 
concentrated basically with the novice
and<00:01:07.149> duster<00:01:08.149> who<00:01:08.420> belongs<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:08.810> admin<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:09.440> it

and duster who belongs to admin so it

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.230 
and duster who belongs to admin so it
actually<00:01:09.830> worked<00:01:10.220> out<00:01:10.810> perfectly<00:01:13.060> what<00:01:14.060> it

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
actually worked out perfectly what it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.240 
actually worked out perfectly what it
could<00:01:14.479> have<00:01:14.570> been<00:01:14.690> quite<00:01:14.869> a<00:01:14.990> juggling<00:01:15.410> act<00:01:15.470> and

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
could have been quite a juggling act and

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.060 
could have been quite a juggling act and
what's<00:01:16.490> gonna<00:01:16.729> happen<00:01:17.119> that<00:01:17.240> Hoy's<00:01:17.920> we're<00:01:18.920> not

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070

this<00:01:21.560> device<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.159> we've<00:01:22.310> just<00:01:22.340> got<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:22.729> two

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
this device so we've just got the two

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.240 
this device so we've just got the two
going<00:01:23.180> because<00:01:23.570> we<00:01:23.840> thought<00:01:24.080> as<00:01:24.439> she's<00:01:24.710> only

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
going because we thought as she's only

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.160 
going because we thought as she's only
enormous<00:01:25.700> this<00:01:25.880> year<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.420> we<00:01:26.570> do<00:01:26.750> think<00:01:27.020> she's

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
enormous this year and we do think she's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.300 
enormous this year and we do think she's
quite<00:01:27.409> special

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.190 

but<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> actually<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.420> think<00:01:33.450> she<00:01:33.869> would<00:01:33.990> cook

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
but I actually do think she would cook

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.740 
but I actually do think she would cook
work<00:01:34.470> very<00:01:34.710> well<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:38.270> yeah<00:01:39.270> she<00:01:39.510> seems
