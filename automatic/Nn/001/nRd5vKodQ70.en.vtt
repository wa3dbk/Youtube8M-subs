 [Music] 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.890
 it's a horror you kill zombies you play 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.060
 in person you can 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.060
 build your own weapons 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:37.910
 no it is not a strange mode for left for 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:39.739
 dead or a spin off for dead rising i'm 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.270
 talking about dead island the new title 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.370
 of the cloud that we are finally 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.510
 managed to touch with one hand 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.510
 preview arrived here in the newsroom 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.360
 you want to find out what awaits us in 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:01:03.500
 first hours of play 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:01:05.089
 well this video is for you 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.040
 we wake up on the bed of a large room 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.780
 hotel a few seconds to succeed 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.549
 to orient oneself with sight initially 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.470
 fogged and then everything becomes more 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.140
 clear but only visually 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.030
 because there are still many things 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.100
 that do not fit within its 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.220
 panzer resort use in the paradise 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.780
 tropical banoi island a quick one 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.610
 look from the vast balcony and two 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.070
 disfigured corpses fall in the sky 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.720
 that is definitely something that doesn't fit 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.990
 and the atmosphere that pervades the environment 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.760
 she seems pregnant with terrible news 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.590
 impression confirmed with horror 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.960
 from the meeting with the first vacationers 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.150
 inside a long corridor there 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.159
 dead blank look and semi bodies 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.930
 devoured by these individuals sweep 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.229
 away the questions by imposing on us 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.700
 to flee would come that I would eat my back 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.860
 laughed at the home and away the year war 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.450
 this happens in the first few minutes of 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.430
 dead island in which we take 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.450
 confidence with the control system e 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.369
 let's take the first steps 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.650
 in the setting built by techland 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.780
 for this first-person action game 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.369
 in a horror setting 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.649
 despite the setting it can do 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.750
 think immediately of the ford and it is rather 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.370
 dead rising the reference perhaps more 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.140
 fitting if you are looking for a meter of 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.060
 comparison to describe the structure of the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.349
 game 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.150
 at the beginning it is possible to choose one of the 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.069
 four characters available 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.370
 each characterized by characteristics 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.510
 different for the partner 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.730
 moment is its own background 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.920
 staff we will be the only ones to be 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.120
 mysteriously immune to the infection that 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.010
 hit the island 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.840
 therefore we will soon be back to 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.480
 run around the resort in the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.620
 attempt to save the survivors 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.260
 initially massed in a bunga it has it 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.379
 besieged by zombies the setting is 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.420
 extremely open sandbox style 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.549
 multiplayer integrates into the experience in 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.599
 single proposing the possibility of 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.000
 face the game in mode 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:03:01.049
 cooperative for up to four 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:02.609
 players can activate more than 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.440
 a mission as you explore in 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.120
 freedom the game environment what 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.799
 imposes a non-linear approach to the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.349
 route to take to reach 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.909
 the objectives work tools e 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.590
 blunt objects can be 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.420
 used to fight melee 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.640
 or launched while firearms 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.170
 fall within the more canonical system of 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.230
 first shooter-style combat 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.329
 person the system is enriched by 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.670
 vast possibilities for customization 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.829
 offers advancement of the game allows 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.450
 an evolution of the character in terms 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.340
 of level of experience and skill 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.380
 the latter can be activated in a way 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.120
 progressive through the schemes ad 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.970
 tree quite similar to those 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.159
 present several role-playing games 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.159
 [Music] 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.389
 the most characterizing element 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.160
 of dead island is probably one 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.900
 especially a tropical admiration 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.239
 unpublished choice as scenography for a 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.430
 survival horror the graphic engine chrome 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.810
 engine 5 developed by techland yes 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.250
 entails admirably in 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.660
 representation of the island in 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.340
 particular with regard to 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.340
 sunny exterior from the broad horizon 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.590
 there is something like andria 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.870
 the engine in the rendering of different surfaces 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.519
 and in particular in the interiors where the 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.500
 game on more than one occasion reminds from 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.790
 near bioshock as modeling of the 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:26.410
 mechanical combat characters 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:28.150
 apple trees and color choices naples one 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.949
 some attention to the construction 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.690
 anatomical character of the characters appears evident 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.289
 in the different effects that the blows inflicted 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.490
 behave on the bodies of enemies 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.990
 the audio sector is also excellent for 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.240
 how much it was possible to hear 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.490
 focused mainly on noise 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.320
 environmental and on the various dialogues in this 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.130
 version entirely in English with 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.130
