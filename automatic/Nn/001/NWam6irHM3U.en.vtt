and our recovery for the go away so

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.380 
and our recovery for the go away so
that'll<00:01:22.890> basically<00:01:22.950> increase<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> goalie<00:01:23.790> so

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
drawls and I'll use recovery so

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.380
