00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the comment so it doesn't matter about

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.870 
the comment so it doesn't matter about
that<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.759> your<00:01:41.880> xbox<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:42.780> Twitter<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.880> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
that but your xbox your Twitter and the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.210 
that but your xbox your Twitter and the
car<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:46.049> want<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.740> team<00:01:47.100> you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780

want to be in and I think you can have
16<00:01:49.229> people<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.860> I'll<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.460> them<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.790> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
16 people so I'll be one of them and I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.690 
16 people so I'll be one of them and I
probably<00:01:51.860> probably<00:01:52.860> put<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.250> context<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
probably probably put in the context of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.520 
probably probably put in the context of
a<00:01:53.820> car<00:01:54.030> i'm<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:54.720> what<00:01:55.290> your<00:01:55.409> need

all<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.110> races<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.800> then<00:02:23.040> uploading<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.580> my

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
all the races and then uploading to my

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.340 
all the races and then uploading to my
second<00:02:24.150> channel<00:02:24.180> because<00:02:24.630> I've<00:02:24.750> kind<00:02:25.260> of

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
second channel because I've kind of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.350 
second channel because I've kind of
thought<00:02:25.710> that<00:02:25.740> there's<00:02:26.130> not<00:02:26.250> really<00:02:26.370> much

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
thought that there's not really much

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.700 
thought that there's not really much
stuff<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:28.020> there<00:02:28.170> on<00:02:28.260> my<00:02:28.380> second

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
stuff going on there on my second

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.160 
stuff going on there on my second
channel<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.150> wanted<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.510> sort<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.750> relive<00:02:31.140> it

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
channel so I wanted to sort of relive it

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.320 
channel so I wanted to sort of relive it
or<00:02:31.410> reinvent<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.670> put<00:02:33.060> something

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
or reinvent it and put something

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.820 
or reinvent it and put something
different<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.840> there<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> probably<00:02:34.620> gonna

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
different on there so I probably gonna

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.240 
different on there so I probably gonna
start<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.550> on<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.210> channel<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:37.800> you
