 I'll show you a few others for example 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.200
 there is a game for augmented reality 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.850
 which is called the movie where it is not yet 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.280
 Apparently in the appstore I will show 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.189

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.840
 loaded naturally need to fell 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.869
 zombies 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.680
 in general there are few games about zombies which are not 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.770
 need to bring down zubakov 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.040

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.509
 cameras let's work do n't you say so 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.700
 here you need to somehow configure it first 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.940
 wounds see no action page 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.340
 and here it is our button as settings 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.860
 draws very simply you will open such 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.630
 the wheel on the screen and you need it so 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.580
 set in order to guide her. on 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.679
 the ball that is burning pointed at you 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.890
 if you look here there are and not points 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.679
 Come on such a trick, but here it is blue. 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.690
 it is honestly looking at me all ok my 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.239
 There were zombies well, but now in it about 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.100
 her egg oozing following me again 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.950
 again 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.400
 now the attention is on the ball screen go 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.690
 here 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.540
 the ball goes here and should appear in the frame 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.620
 zombie game is not final yet therefore 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.549
 here something will look a little bit 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.070
 strange but the idea is that dogs should 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.580
 cut straight out of the ground and appear well 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.230
 and where they are not where the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.210

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.690

 Internet and not much is not enough but 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.380
 with the help of this game you can actually 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.240
 turn it into reality augmented 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.580
