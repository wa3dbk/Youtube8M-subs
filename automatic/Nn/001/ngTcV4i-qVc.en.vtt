we're<00:00:05.850> going<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.359> continue<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.319> previous

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
we're going to continue on a previous

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.060 
we're going to continue on a previous
video<00:00:08.510> the<00:00:09.510> previous<00:00:09.960> one<00:00:10.139> we<00:00:10.290> covered<00:00:10.500> making

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
video the previous one we covered making

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.560 
video the previous one we covered making
patterns<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:12.030> know<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.150> knife<00:00:12.360> sheath

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
patterns you know a knife sheath

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.669 
patterns you know a knife sheath
patterns<00:00:13.019> or<00:00:13.170> whatever

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
patterns or whatever

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.560 
patterns or whatever
now<00:00:14.370> you're<00:00:14.670> gonna<00:00:14.759> we're<00:00:15.150> getting<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
now you're gonna we're getting to the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.060 
now you're gonna we're getting to the
point<00:00:15.750> where<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.049> want<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.410> lay<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:17.039> our

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
point where we want to lay out our

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.429 
point where we want to lay out our
stitching<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.750> there's<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.050> there's<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.410> few

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
stitching so there's a there's a few

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.050 
stitching so there's a there's a few
ways<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.070> doing<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:21.650> traditionally<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.060> one

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
ways of doing that traditionally the one

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.390 
ways of doing that traditionally the one
that<00:00:24.180> requires<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.810> most<00:00:25.050> skill<00:00:25.439> would<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.310> an

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
that requires the most skill would be an

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.220 
that requires the most skill would be an
awl<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.670> regular<00:00:27.300> straight<00:00:27.630> either<00:00:27.840> straight

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
awl and regular straight either straight

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.689 
awl and regular straight either straight
all<00:00:28.410> or<00:00:28.619> curved<00:00:28.859> all<00:00:29.070> depending<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.580> what

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
all or curved all depending on what

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.849 
all or curved all depending on what
you're<00:00:29.820> doing<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:31.080> would<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.410> punching

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
you're doing and you would be punching

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.700 
you're doing and you would be punching
your<00:00:31.980> own<00:00:32.160> holes<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:33.540> you're<00:00:34.140> relying<00:00:34.500> on

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
your own holes but you're relying on

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.260 
your own holes but you're relying on
your<00:00:34.890> your<00:00:35.309> eye<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:36.600> space<00:00:37.500> those<00:00:38.270> stitches

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
your your eye to space those stitches

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.959 
your your eye to space those stitches
evenly<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.950> same<00:00:41.190> distance<00:00:41.430> away<00:00:41.850> from

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
evenly and the same distance away from

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.299 
evenly and the same distance away from
the<00:00:42.180> edge<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.350> are<00:00:43.469> tools<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.860> help<00:00:44.100> you

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the edge but there are tools to help you

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.410 
the edge but there are tools to help you
with<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:45.800> here's<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> tool<00:00:47.160> also<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:48.270> that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
with that here's a tool also here that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
with that here's a tool also here that
will<00:00:49.850> gauge<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.449> distance<00:00:51.989> between<00:00:52.350> stitches

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
will gauge the distance between stitches

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.819 
will gauge the distance between stitches
now<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.840> would<00:00:55.050> use<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.530> tool

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
now what you how you would use this tool

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.660 
now what you how you would use this tool
is<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.699> would<00:00:56.850> take<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:59.340> would<00:00:59.489> put

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
is you would take it and you would put

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.869 
is you would take it and you would put
it<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.850> your<00:01:00.059> leather<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:01.520> you<00:01:02.520> would<00:01:02.670> just

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it on your leather and you would just

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.350 
it on your leather and you would just
press<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.939> focus

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
press it in like so and if you can focus

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.630 
press it in like so and if you can focus
in<00:01:06.630> real<00:01:06.869> quick<00:01:07.200> real<00:01:07.439> close<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.460> can

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
in real quick real close here you can

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
in real quick real close here you can
see<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.939> leaves<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.390> little<00:01:09.720> little

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
see that leaves like little little

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
see that leaves like little little
dimples<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> leather<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.909> would<00:01:12.119> tell

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
dimples and the leather that would tell

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.890 
dimples and the leather that would tell
you<00:01:12.420> where<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> punch<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.229> hole<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:13.860> all

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
you where to punch a hole with your all

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.200 
you where to punch a hole with your all
you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.080> also<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.770> different<00:01:17.100> spacers<00:01:17.939> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
you can also get different spacers that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.240 
you can also get different spacers that
will<00:01:18.990> space<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.009> know<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
will space out that you know the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
will space out that you know the
distance<00:01:20.549> between<00:01:20.759> each<00:01:21.000> hole<00:01:21.390> differently

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
distance between each hole differently

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.399 
distance between each hole differently
so<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> good<00:01:23.580> option<00:01:23.990> another<00:01:24.990> thing

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
so this is a good option another thing

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.130 
so this is a good option another thing
you<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.189> take<00:01:27.030> an<00:01:27.180> edging<00:01:27.570> tool<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you can do is take an edging tool and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.679 
you can do is take an edging tool and
and<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.130> does<00:01:29.460> actually<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.420> does

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
and what this does actually this does

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.179 
and what this does actually this does
two<00:01:30.990> things<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.530> will<00:01:32.430> keep<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.540> steady

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
two things it will keep a steady

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.530 
two things it will keep a steady
distance<00:01:35.189> away<00:01:35.400> from<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.939> edge<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
distance away from the edge of the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.990 
distance away from the edge of the
leather<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.220> will<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:38.549> take<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
leather in and it will also take a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.789 
leather in and it will also take a
little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.630> leather<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.680> what

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
little bit of leather out so what

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.969 
little bit of leather out so what
happens<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.680> I'm<00:01:43.860> going

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
happens is if you can see this I'm going

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.480 
happens is if you can see this I'm going
to<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.189> lightly<00:01:44.460> press<00:01:44.729> down<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:46.560> takes<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
to just lightly press down it takes a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.450 
to just lightly press down it takes a
little<00:01:47.700> bit<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.030> leather<00:01:48.329> out<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
little bit of leather out you see that

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.789 
little bit of leather out you see that
it's<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.640> taking<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.030> little<00:01:51.500> little<00:01:52.500> piece

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
it's just taking a little little piece

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.670 
it's just taking a little little piece
now<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.790> doing<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.960> giving<00:01:55.380> us<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
now what this is doing is giving us a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.639 
now what this is doing is giving us a
nice<00:01:55.950> straight<00:01:56.939> border<00:01:57.450> along<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.960> edge<00:01:59.540> okay

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
nice straight border along the edge okay

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.100 
nice straight border along the edge okay
now<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.890> we've<00:02:02.009> done<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.960> what<00:02:03.960> we're

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
now that we've done that what we're

tubes

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.650 
tubes
equally-spaced<00:02:13.099> what's<00:02:13.880> nice<00:02:14.120> about<00:02:14.150> this

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
equally-spaced what's nice about this

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.620 
equally-spaced what's nice about this
tool<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.620> these<00:02:16.069> punches<00:02:16.520> are<00:02:16.630> removable

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
tool is that these punches are removable

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.270 
tool is that these punches are removable
and<00:02:17.840> replaceable<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.670> can<00:02:19.849> use<00:02:20.540> 4<00:02:21.140> 3<00:02:21.680> 2<00:02:22.040> or

and replaceable and you can use 4 3 2 or
1<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:23.300> with<00:02:24.020> this<00:02:24.170> tool<00:02:24.470> gives<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.310> nice<00:02:25.459> even

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
1 so with this tool gives you nice even

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.059 
1 so with this tool gives you nice even
spacing<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:26.989> gives<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.530> holes<00:02:27.770> that

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
spacing and it gives you the holes that

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.830 
spacing and it gives you the holes that
you<00:02:28.130> need<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.640> stitch<00:02:28.880> through<00:02:29.209> there

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
you need to stitch through there

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.040 
you need to stitch through there
therefore<00:02:30.530> not<00:02:30.739> needing<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.880> all<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.900> we're

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
therefore not needing the all so we're

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.000 
therefore not needing the all so we're
going<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.260> do<00:02:33.319> is<00:02:33.410> we're<00:02:33.500> gonna<00:02:33.590> take<00:02:33.770> that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
going to do is we're gonna take that

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.970 
going to do is we're gonna take that
tool<00:02:34.720> start<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:35.840> right<00:02:36.020> where<00:02:36.230> we<00:02:36.410> want<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.800> and

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
tool start it right where we want it and

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.090 
tool start it right where we want it and
I'm<00:02:37.790> putting<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.180> right<00:02:38.890> where<00:02:39.890> we<00:02:40.010> had

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
I'm putting that right where we had

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:49.150 
I'm putting that right where we had
taken<00:02:40.310> some<00:02:40.459> material<00:02:41.000> from<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:43.510> punch<00:02:48.160> do

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
taken some material from and punch do

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:59.590 
taken some material from and punch do
that<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.370> little<00:02:49.519> bit<00:02:49.730> harder<00:02:58.150> now<00:02:59.150> as<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.480> can

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
that a little bit harder now as you can

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.490 
that a little bit harder now as you can
see<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.950> holes<00:03:01.250> are<00:03:01.580> there<00:03:02.080> right<00:03:03.080> down<00:03:03.319> the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
see the holes are there right down the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.130 
see the holes are there right down the
middle<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.340> mark<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:04.910> when<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.840> stitch

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
middle of that mark and when you stitch

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.870 
middle of that mark and when you stitch
your<00:03:06.560> stitches<00:03:06.890> are<00:03:06.980> going<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.160> be<00:03:07.250> very<00:03:07.489> even

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
your stitches are going to be very even

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.110 
your stitches are going to be very even
and<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:09.620> thread<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:09.980> going<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.489> lay<00:03:10.790> in<00:03:11.090> that

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
and the thread is going to lay in that

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.690 
and the thread is going to lay in that
slight<00:03:11.930> little<00:03:11.959> grooves<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.280> we<00:03:13.459> made

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
slight little grooves that we made

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.270 
slight little grooves that we made
earlier<00:03:14.209> now<00:03:15.200> what<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.650> would<00:03:15.769> do<00:03:15.980> is

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
earlier now what you would do is

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.449 
earlier now what you would do is
continue<00:03:16.910> on<00:03:16.940> down<00:03:17.890> obviously<00:03:18.890> overlapping

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
continue on down obviously overlapping

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.270 
continue on down obviously overlapping
the<00:03:19.940> last<00:03:20.180> one<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:21.079> maintain<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.950> nice

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
the last one so that you maintain a nice

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.500 
the last one so that you maintain a nice
even<00:03:23.049> row<00:03:24.049> all<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.470> way<00:03:24.920> down<00:03:25.280> now<00:03:25.609> if<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.329> get

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
even row all the way down now if you get

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.240 
even row all the way down now if you get
to<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.660> point<00:03:27.100> where<00:03:28.100> you're<00:03:28.850> inside<00:03:29.359> of<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.690> very

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
to a point where you're inside of a very

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.729 
to a point where you're inside of a very
tight<00:03:31.390> radius<00:03:32.390> or<00:03:32.690> on<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.079> outside

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
tight radius or on the outside

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.250 
tight radius or on the outside
remove<00:03:34.489> a<00:03:34.609> tube<00:03:34.850> or<00:03:35.090> two<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:35.660> that's<00:03:36.049> why

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
remove a tube or two and that's why

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.569 
remove a tube or two and that's why
you'll<00:03:36.440> be<00:03:36.590> able<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.859> get<00:03:36.980> around<00:03:37.130> these

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
you'll be able to get around these

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.420 
you'll be able to get around these
things<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.970> little<00:03:38.090> bit<00:03:38.299> easier<00:03:38.829> so<00:03:39.829> this<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.400> a

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
things a little bit easier so this is a

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.349 
things a little bit easier so this is a
very<00:03:40.730> good<00:03:41.109> very<00:03:42.109> handy<00:03:42.680> tool<00:03:42.920> we<00:03:43.820> sell<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.120> lot

the next time we're going to take it a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.039 
the next time we're going to take it a
little<00:03:55.579> bit<00:03:55.730> step<00:03:55.970> further<00:03:56.269> and<00:03:56.600> we're<00:03:56.780> going
