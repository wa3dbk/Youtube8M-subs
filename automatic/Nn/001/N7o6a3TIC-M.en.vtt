00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hi it's true we're at the end 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.290
 today unpacking video before the 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.549
 test video that will arrive from here 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.680
 few days at most a few 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.230
 weeks but it's going to be very fast from 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.590
 lg g3 a mobile that you have been very 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.269
 numerous 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.410
 just sales m is like I come 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.009
 to tell you this will happen very 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.389
 quickly 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.890
 and today is the video of 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.210
 unpacking and to tell you it's 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.500
 really really for a very purpose 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.699
 selfish that I present to you this 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.140
 phone just because you 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.880
 imagine it maybe if you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 know shut up for fun and well you 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.119
 know the ng2 and already my personal mobile 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.519
 inevitably I was waiting with a lot 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.560
 impatience the lg 3 it's done 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.360
 he's here and I'll probably get you 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.430
 you doubt it by doing in the end my 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.450
 personal mobile then today we are 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.380
 on a close copy 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.270
 unfortunately I will not be able 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 preserved we can not have everything but I 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.629
 still a pleasure 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.190
 for precisely the test that will last 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.969
 some days 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.079
 but anyway today 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.789
 is on the unpacking video go 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.079
 truce of blah we will do a little 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.579
 box owner's ride is enough 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.020
 design is pretty original we take again 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.760
 actually a very clean style to 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.440
 alger with a very rectangular format 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.570
 but here we have two languages ​​etc 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.770
 it is very classy and necessarily that you 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.719
 puts in an atmosphere that is that of 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.829
 high-end wii the lg g37 a mobile 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.049
 high-end I call it worth 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.920
 still 600 euros so we're on a 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.909
 phone that is clearly in the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.140
 slice hearings or even 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.939
 ultra high end as I like 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.840
 the qualified ones and so that's it 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.580
 feels only on the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.439
 packaging we already put you at lg in 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.479
 a very special atmosphere 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.380
 it's really high-end then 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.640
 on the front of the box one 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.259
 found the mark awarded 3 on 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.299
 also finds that this 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.670
 phone won at them on Tuesday the global 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.770
 mobile awards all fathers and protein 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.869
 link with my very good good accent in 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.020
 big he won an unum award a 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.970
 consecration a trophy at the last 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.549
 trade show that was organized 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.740
 especially by the GSM has alas gsm enough 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.680
 organizer of the mobile world congress 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.110
 especially he stands in barcelona 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.170
 then we find lg g3 labeling of 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.700
 lg g3 lg logo again and it's up to 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.780
 the back of the box we find a 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.040
 number of spec actually 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780
 finally, but it's very fast 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.890
 there is not a leap years it is 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.229
 besides something that reminds me 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.490
 enormously the press presentation we have it 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.350
 seen during the sg press presentation 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.670
 did not dwell on the specs lg was 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.020
 actually lingering on the features 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.850
 does that bring you so it's 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.180
 another way to see telephony 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.829
 mobile 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.930
 in any case it finally changes 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.129
 the angle very very specifications even if 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.229
 vj 3 is a crude 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.860
 a racehorse so we have a screen of 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.690
 5.5 inches quad hd it's not the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.000
 full hd it's not hd ready it's 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.740
 Above so that crazy the quad grc 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.660
 hd if of the two cases we find a 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.370
 snapdragon 801 processor we have a high 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.840
 1 watt speaker 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.190
 good but to be stressed because 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.810
 it's rare on a phone 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.760
 to have so much power a sensor 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.280
 3 megapixel photo with dual led flash 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.660
 and stabilizer also we have a laser 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.730
 to do autofocus 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.470
 which apparently visibly 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.790
 the ouch against the builder of according 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.170
 the information almost makes more 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.000
 still effective this auto focus more 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.370
 fast and we have a battery of three 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.380
 milliamps hours then the box 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.630
 she has already been me I you the you 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.240
 open I got myself I could not resist 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.640
 and so the phone is here and yes 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.100
 it's a man you'll see him very 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.570
 very very beautiful phone including here 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.239
 proposed in gray gray version 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.220
 dark gray anthracite very beautiful very 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.480
 class then it's a battery cover that 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.520
 looks like brushed aluminum but 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.770
 no it's still good plastic despite 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.970
 everything we could have regretted 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.480
 maybe just that it is not 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.010
 metal 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.840
 on the other hand the advantage is that 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.130
 precisely this kind of battery cover is 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.140
 extractable and provides access to the 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.010
 battery which in turn becomes 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.600
 extractable so you can change it 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.060
 and that's what was actually asked 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.799
 precisely on the g2 which for him suddenly 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.690
 I remember it had a battery 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.880
 which was not extractable since he 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.920
 it's a unibody the ng2 it's 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.450
 impossible to disassemble good after I say 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.070
 impossible if you are a repairer 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.060
 you know how to do it and then if 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.230
 you take a little time you'll know 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.250
 how to do it but in the absolute what 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.850
 is not made to be disassembled this 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.910
 kind of phone 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.320
 so here are the g2 g3 good little video on 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.390
 see it's not the goal here is to 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.280
 make a comparison but here dd 3 is 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.720
 already the largest and yet he did not 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.870
 badly or what is to say that we go from 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.370
 50.2 grows to 5.5 inches but more 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.110
 of the g3 that he is very well worked at 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.310
 level of its chassis that's at the level of 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.500
 its bodywork there are very frames 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.120
 very hungry that's my little video with the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.590
 g2 cold i leave you i have two you 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.700
 see it there are different styles the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.049
 style it's more exactly the same 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.150
 but we still find the 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.860
 small peculiarities so especially this 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.239
 famous button on the back that's who 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.000
 controls the phone that allows 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.140
 control the phone very beautiful mobile 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.489
 very beautiful mobile but I'm there 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.840
 will come back during the test there it's time 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.459
 to continue otherwise I will linger 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.269
 I'm going to be contemplating then at 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.320
 inside the box what do we 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.120
 found in addition a small 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.030
 documentation the getting started guide 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.260
 quick lg g3 for once he's in 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.829
 English necessarily it's a very boy 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.840
 they gave me 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.099
 in the versions of almost necessarily who 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.599
 is English whose gabon can not all 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.900
 to have but it does not matter it remains a 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.759
 guide 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.979
 so in the end what will change position 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:34.490
 so we find what else 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.469
 find in which and well you go 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.889
 see lg is not doing things by half 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:40.340
 because we have a very very good kit 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.590
 pedestrian 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.930
 and yes it's a real good pedestrian kit 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.009
 nice with the real in-ear headphones 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.270
 this is what makes the 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.560
 difference also dlg compared to a 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.030
 number of English competitors there 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.710
 including position on the same market 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.090
 on the same segment 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.289
 is that where there is work you 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.729
 see the headphones they have a small 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.590
 form they were reworked which donations 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.240
 are curved finally they are curve has 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.889
 constantly adapting best to your 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.719
 auditory canal that's how we get them 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.280
 called one your two ears in water and 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.690
 the cable itself has two 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.039
 peculiarities it is flat so it is 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.409
 do not go without exactly 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.240
 do nodes jack and 3.5 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.379
 curves and probably to allow 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.830
 precisely better placed on the 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.560
 phone 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.300
 rather than having a jack right there are 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.979
 well the microphone input with a control of 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.419
 volume plus - and a hung button 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.580
 pick up so it's a real good kit 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.840
 pedestrian already nothing that that it puts you 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.270
 already in the mood we are on some 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.800
 thing that is clearly explained if we 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.090
 think that just the unpacking crate 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.620
 gifts with him and we have a 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.389
 series of tips that can adapt and 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.860
 well this same pedestrian kit to your ears 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.990
 because we are not all the same size 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.610
 of auditory canal repeats to me 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.139
 so that's enough provided with the 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.330
 phone we also find cable 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.129
 usb micro usb go very very classy 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.629
 very classy sorry very very basic 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.330
 very simple with a plastic 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:52.520
 very soft rubbery found 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.830
 also the typical AC adapter 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.479
 lg down we go the big ones too 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.550
 classic format including france for 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.469
 the blow finally formed to europe with 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.539
 the very classic usb input 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:05.060
 nothing to add on it we find 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.500
 also the battery and this famous has 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.810
 extractable fact that I told you 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.300
 a few moments that makes 3000 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.389
 milliamperes hours prom at 3 min in 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.770
 terror millions battery a good 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.819
 big battery anyway and that makes 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.440
 pleasure just to have a good 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.900
 big battery / did not lose 5.25 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.310
 inches who needs to consume a little 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.060
 of energy but lg claims in particular 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.889
 energy consumption patterns 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.000
 rehearsal to prevent precisely that the 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.350
 phone is too greedy in 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.080
 little recap of what we 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.780
 found in the box of lg g3 the 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.370
 again the successor of the ng2 so we 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.380
 found the battery of 3000 thousand in 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.330
 eur eutractive pair you saw it on 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.310
 also finds the usb cable 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.680
 micro usb we also find the 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.590
 drummer sector we find small 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.510
 documentation and especially especially finally 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.880
 among other good points the pedestrian kit 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.620
 which is really worked well 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.290
 very nice if only by his 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.790
 shape and we also imagine by its quality 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.150
 I talked to you about it during the 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.860
 test 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.110
 thank you for managing the video of 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.310
 unpacking the hadj and g3 and you 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.750
 imagine it now I have a live 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.979
 impatience for even the 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.460
 test so that will happen very 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:08.419
 shortly 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.419
