course again you have to authenticate

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.630 
course again you have to authenticate
with<00:01:00.539> touch<00:01:00.809> ID<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.800> there's<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.219> protect

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
to protect the shortcut to access the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 
to protect the shortcut to access the
taken<00:01:08.400> photos<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.000> videos<00:01:09.360> through<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.950 
photos guess what pops up well touch ID
so<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> need<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> authenticate<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
so I need to authenticate with the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
so I need to authenticate with the
fingerprints<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.829> registered<00:01:47.280> with

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
fingerprints that I have registered with

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.280 
fingerprints that I have registered with
touch<00:01:48.090> ID<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.720> I'm<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.229> right

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
touch ID so I'm going to do that right

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.740 
touch ID so I'm going to do that right
now<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.909> now<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.570> actually

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
now and I have and now you can actually

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
now and I have and now you can actually
tap<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.740> three<00:01:53.040> delete<00:01:53.549> three<00:01:53.759> photos<00:01:54.030> option

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
tap the three delete three photos option

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
tap the three delete three photos option
now<00:01:55.770> there's<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.729> complaint<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.240> have

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
now there's one little complaint I have

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.499 
now there's one little complaint I have
with<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.079> method<00:01:58.380> i<00:01:58.680> wish<00:01:59.100> i<00:01:59.430> wish<00:02:00.210> there<00:02:00.390> was

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
with this method i wish i wish there was

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.350 
with this method i wish i wish there was
an<00:02:00.630> option<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.020> would<00:02:01.799> outright<00:02:02.729> delete<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
an option that would outright delete the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.749 
an option that would outright delete the
photos<00:02:03.689> once<00:02:04.079> i<00:02:04.259> authenticate<00:02:05.219> with<00:02:05.250> touch<00:02:05.579> ID

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
photos once i authenticate with touch ID

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.749 
photos once i authenticate with touch ID
because<00:02:06.149> basically<00:02:06.689> you're<00:02:07.049> adding<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.439> whole

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
because basically you're adding a whole

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.119 
because basically you're adding a whole
additional<00:02:08.759> step<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> mix<00:02:10.110> here<00:02:10.379> so

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
additional step in in the mix here so

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.830 
additional step in in the mix here so
normally<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.000> would<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.330> hit<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.569> delete

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
normally you would just hit the delete

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.640 
normally you would just hit the delete
button<00:02:13.020> in

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
button in

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.170 
button in
delete<00:02:13.980> photos<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.579> now<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:15.030> tap

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
delete photos but now you have to tap

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.759 
delete photos but now you have to tap
the<00:02:15.329> delete<00:02:15.569> button<00:02:15.750> then<00:02:16.409> you<00:02:16.530> have<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
the delete button then you have to

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.949 
the delete button then you have to
verify<00:02:16.950> with<00:02:17.310> touch<00:02:17.459> ID<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.060> then<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.810> have

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
verify with touch ID and then you have

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.170 
verify with touch ID and then you have
to<00:02:18.989> tap<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.470> Delete<00:02:20.010> 3<00:02:20.430> photos<00:02:20.670> or<00:02:21.000> however

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
to tap the Delete 3 photos or however

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.640 
to tap the Delete 3 photos or however
many<00:02:21.480> photos<00:02:21.840> you're<00:02:22.019> deleting<00:02:22.379> so<00:02:22.470> that's

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
many photos you're deleting so that's

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.949 
many photos you're deleting so that's
just<00:02:22.769> an<00:02:23.189> extra<00:02:23.640> step<00:02:23.879> that<00:02:23.939> this<00:02:24.239> adds<00:02:24.480> but<00:02:24.780> if

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
just an extra step that this adds but if

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.050 
just an extra step that this adds but if
you're<00:02:25.110> looking<00:02:25.349> for<00:02:25.379> security<00:02:26.060> that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
you're looking for security that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.940 
you're looking for security that
probably<00:02:27.390> won't<00:02:27.540> bother<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.170> now<00:02:28.680> let<00:02:28.920> me

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
probably won't bother you now let me

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.140 
probably won't bother you now let me
show<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.189> something<00:02:29.610> else<00:02:29.700> if<00:02:29.909> i<00:02:29.970> go<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
show you something else if i go to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.830
