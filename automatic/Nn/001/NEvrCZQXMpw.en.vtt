00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
special when we play Maine we've had

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.449 
special when we play Maine we've had
some<00:02:17.239> great<00:02:17.480> games<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.650> some<00:02:18.830> great<00:02:19.040> venues

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
whether it's been an anti and whether

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.289 
whether it's been an anti and whether
it's<00:02:21.080> been<00:02:21.319> here<00:02:22.220> at<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> winter<00:02:22.670> up<00:02:22.790> at<00:02:22.940> alpha
