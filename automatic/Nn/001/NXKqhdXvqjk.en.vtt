00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
thought it would be worth mentioning

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.370 
thought it would be worth mentioning
because<00:03:57.810> it's<00:03:58.170> just<00:03:58.350> another<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.980> know

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
because it's just another you know

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.479 
because it's just another you know
important<00:04:01.380> nutrient<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:01.890> your<00:04:02.010> body<00:04:02.220> needs
