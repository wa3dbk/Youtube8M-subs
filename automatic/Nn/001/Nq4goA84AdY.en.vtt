00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.529
 It must have been an attack because 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.230
 the boat was very well built 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.269
 It was built by the military forces 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.130
 in buenaventura the ship could be said 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.830
 that it was the best coasting vessel that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.490
 there was in the Colombian Pacific I 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.619
 as captain of that vessel I felt 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.349
 very protected because it was the best ship 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.640
 that existed in the Pacific but are the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.050
 elements beyond that that you 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.260
 expresses the construction that leads to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.809
 think that it can be an attack so 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.360
 that the ship was ripped off two 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.539
 pieces of the mine that for no reason 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.629
 neither a gas pipe nor a fire 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.070
 they could start what they started and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.570
 I understand that this manifesto was 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.180
 corroborated by the port captaincy 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.859
 in adventure the port captaincy in 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.500
 adventure the harbor captain in a 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.810
 statement that came out on television 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.540
 with different phrases said almost the same 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.330
 that I'm saying that that ship was 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.160
 built by themselves and that in 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.130
 no time a gas pipe or 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.650
 fire fuel could rip you 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.410
 a piece of film to see man and if 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.090
 it was an attack had aimed at the ship 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.290
 to day trade che 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.479
 that attack I think it was directed 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.300
 to the costa solano bay trade 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.290
 peaceful because it was the boat that brought 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.420
 the merchandise to 80% of the coast 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.550
 peaceful and finally an affectation 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.710
 for all of them now neither the pacific 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:40.500
 Yes, as it happened 34 days ago 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.520
 you already feel the shortage in the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.340
 towns in the jury there is no gasoline in 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.580
 chopped food is scarce and here in 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.090
 solano bay there are already several elements 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.430
 things that no longer brought elements 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.750
 the ship basically the ship brought 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.430
 since 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.530
 rice gas gas everything 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.380
 consume in these towns has our 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.300
 vehicle at the time of sinking 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.480
 three vehicles were coming we had already gone down 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.180
 two and even one was lost 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.450
 dump of money to the particular object 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.310
 or fiction of the dump truck 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.920
 Unfortunately it was my gosh was 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.950
 sum more to the losses the future that 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.410
 indicates that it is going to be because I have to 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.900
 continue to look forward to the form of 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.330
 rent a boat to follow 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.620
 working, you told me, you three 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.770
 microphones from the moment of the explosion 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.280
 you were between the ship yes sir I 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.040
 I had about 78 minutes of 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.980
 to have entered my cabin with two 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.080
 more people to fix my nails and 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.800
 this intimate that how was perceived what 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.720
 happened at that time 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.480
 only sense 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.210
 something that I get up I stop and I leave 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.420
 like a fool and how he reacts to 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.300
 to serve as the executioner I owe my life to a 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.590
 girl who was next to me that I do not know 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.000
 how well I was gone and 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.120
 I heard that she said we are dead 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.980
 We are dead and I answered that 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.220
 we are alive that we are going out that 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.250
 let's go out I could not see her 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.290
 nor to mom but I do not know god helped us and 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.209
 We left the cabin 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.670
 although the place where we are from happened what 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.920
 that in this site 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.900
 exactly here was parked the 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.560
 boat here was moored at the end of the 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.110
 aft this was the place where it happened 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.240
 we all imagine a ship and whoever 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.800
 inside the boat in which if you take or not 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.690
 can you be in that moment I 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.940
 I was in the back of the stern 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:53.270
 of the ship forgiveness in the explosion was in 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.640
 the back of the boat's stern and 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.460
 I was more or less in the middle 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.750
 in my cabin you can calculate in meters 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:06.880
 how far but I was more or less 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.870
 2 meters meters and some of the explosion 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.700
 speaks very well of the construction of the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.810
 ship was definitely a blow to 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.100
 luck was I think something miraculous 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.290
 because so close in an explosion and 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.019
 save her see when she goes out with that 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.080
 panorama is when I leave then 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.870
 I left very stunned and I look and see him 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.320
 a missing piece to the boat all 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.290
 What I did was to pass the two people and 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.850
 I was like I was not there I do not know 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.240
 club could not believe at what time 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.120
 when earth 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.300
 I spent around 34 minutes there 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.280
 I calculate to be able to go down to the dock in 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.590
 that moment the ship is already on fire 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.020
 not the boat time that he calculates that 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.419
 happened so that they burned down the 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:57.479
 boat I think after 35 minutes 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:00.240
 begins to have flames for several 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:04.050
 parties and what they think they can do 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.169
 nothing because here the crew of the 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:11.729
 ship I many people caught fire extinguishers 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:14.490
 and but it was not impossible the only thing 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.720
 we could do was stop to see me 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.990
 they say that someone comes up with 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.930
 drop the boat if still young edison's 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.840
 here the town gave machete to the corporals 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.479
 because they shouted that the bombs that were 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.550
 they could learn everything here from a distance 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.240
 with the boat from here where is where 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.650
 finally sinks 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.330
 and I think about 40 meters 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.669
 fifty and what time it takes for the 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.180
 sinking the boat takes longer or 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:45.250
 less about 40 to 35 minutes to be able 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.810
 sink I will appeal to your experience a 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.430
 ship in normal conditions that there is not 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.590
 an expression how much we can for 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.639
 sink this type of boat can be 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.889
 delay days that is not sinking yes yes 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.810
 it would not have been an explosion is to bring 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.449
 He knows one day that he was burning 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.460
 totally because no no I did not have like 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.409
 sink man and why do you think that 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.120
 we are not dead 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.699
 I believe where the crew was 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.490
 just the crew was 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:15.220
 irrigated that at the dock they were here in 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.800
 the dock is pending from the boat and two 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.599
 more people were in another cabin and 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.979
 I understand that another stroke of luck is that 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.229
 on Monday regularly they do not work in 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.690
 download here not because it was festive yes or 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.659
 be from that day we arrived a festive Monday 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.729
 and that the people had already been canceled 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:32.289
 work or that is a day of 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:33.580
 ordinary week and we could be 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.490
 in the face of a tragedy of proportions 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.930
 capital letters we could talk about god 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.889
 rather 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:44.470
 80 to 100 dead the young man who dies and 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.680
 who was it was the son of the lady who 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.539
 I was in the kitchen as follows 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.690
 fortunately very well it is in 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:55.000
 Medellin is already very stable and it is already 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.080
 well attended I understand that quite the 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.080
 safety of the boat that is not 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.810
 assured yes sir no no lending pe 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.120
 I did not have insurance so it was very good 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.370
 ship was the best ship that existed in 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.430
 the pacific how many years of work 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.800
 they lost in because of I will be in that 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.349
 ship fourteen years but that will be the 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.130
 my whole life's work 30 years of 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:20.289
 work that the family of person thinks 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:22.690
 is the only good thing is that I have my 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.840
 family alive and I'm alive 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.220
 ever travel when the ship is still 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.530
 continuously because they are from here 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.870
 from solano bay my wife of the day here 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.120
 solano bay and fortunately they did not come 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.770
 on the ship if fortunately not 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.729
 they were in port we did not reiterate 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.010
 our order solidarity with what has 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:44.960
 past and a lot of force forward if 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:49.280
 that 's the idea let's start 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:52.270
 with the help of the people and good we go to 

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.270
 in front of God's help
