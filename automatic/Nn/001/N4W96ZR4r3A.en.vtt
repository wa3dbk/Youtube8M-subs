00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
helped me then upgrade the vehicle and

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.390 
helped me then upgrade the vehicle and
it's<00:02:53.200> real<00:02:53.410> sort<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:53.800> sense<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.130> there's

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
it's real sort of sense that there's

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.640 
it's real sort of sense that there's
that<00:02:54.550> some<00:02:54.760> urban<00:02:55.120> flow<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.170> game<00:02:56.320> as<00:02:56.500> well

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
flames of balloons can be blowing real

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.730 
flames of balloons can be blowing real
life<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.350> corresponds<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.530> whole

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
life and that corresponds to a whole

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.560 
life and that corresponds to a whole
load<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.010> different<00:03:49.100> attacks<00:03:49.790> where<00:03:50.450> the

battle is jumping or the fighting and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.699 
battle is jumping or the fighting and
look<00:03:53.270> at<00:03:53.390> this<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.900> will<00:03:54.020> see<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.410> bow<00:03:54.560> before

the sounds he's painting and I love the
way<00:04:00.140> he's<00:04:00.350> constructed<00:04:00.920> seas<00:04:01.100> without

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
way he's constructed seas without

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.890 
way he's constructed seas without
blowing<00:04:01.850> light

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.890 

so<00:04:05.890> Spitfire<00:04:06.340> though<00:04:06.580> making<00:04:06.849> pretty<00:04:07.239> quick

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
so Spitfire though making pretty quick

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.869 
so Spitfire though making pretty quick
work<00:04:08.140> of<00:04:08.319> him<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.769> we<00:04:08.920> move<00:04:09.099> into<00:04:09.310> another

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
work of him and we move into another

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.809 
work of him and we move into another
level<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:11.709> can<00:04:11.830> see<00:04:11.980> it's<00:04:12.159> much<00:04:12.280> darker

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
level and you can see it's much darker

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.699 
level and you can see it's much darker
here<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.299> Spitfires<00:04:13.930> flames<00:04:14.319> I've<00:04:14.590> been

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
here so Spitfires flames I've been

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.979 
here so Spitfires flames I've been
upgraded<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.370> they<00:04:15.670> are<00:04:15.849> here<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.479> they're

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
upgraded and they are here and they're

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.439 
upgraded and they are here and they're
sort<00:04:17.109> of<00:04:17.169> red<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.560> yellow<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.449> illuminating

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
sort of red and yellow and illuminating

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.629 
sort of red and yellow and illuminating
for<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.660> level<00:04:19.900> around<00:04:20.019> him<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.769> think<00:04:21.489> that

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
for the level around him I think that

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.610 
for the level around him I think that
Skylanders<00:04:22.270> superchargers<00:04:23.050> does<00:04:23.199> have<00:04:23.410> that

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
Skylanders superchargers does have that

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.189 
Skylanders superchargers does have that
edge<00:04:23.889> over<00:04:24.250> previous<00:04:24.850> Skylanders<00:04:25.510> games<00:04:25.750> as

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
edge over previous Skylanders games as

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.020 
edge over previous Skylanders games as
you<00:04:26.260> see<00:04:26.500> in<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.680> distance<00:04:26.889> some<00:04:27.639> of<00:04:27.760> the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
you see in the distance some of the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.360 
you see in the distance some of the
architecture<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.229> this<00:04:29.949> piece<00:04:30.160> I<00:04:30.250> really

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
architecture and this piece I really

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.580 
architecture and this piece I really
like<00:04:30.639> is<00:04:30.790> a<00:04:30.820> puzzle<00:04:31.240> here<00:04:31.449> but<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.110> like<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.470> way

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
like is a puzzle here but I like the way

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.370 
like is a puzzle here but I like the way
that<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.830> puzzle<00:04:33.130> also<00:04:33.610> then<00:04:34.139> resolves<00:04:35.139> by

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
that the puzzle also then resolves by

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.980 
that the puzzle also then resolves by
constructing<00:04:35.919> this<00:04:36.250> Gong<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.790> Spitfire<00:04:37.750> puts

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
constructing this Gong and Spitfire puts

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.420 
constructing this Gong and Spitfire puts
it<00:04:38.139> together<00:04:39.000> he<00:04:40.000> can<00:04:40.270> ring<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.020> gong<00:04:41.169> and

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
it together he can ring the gong and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.850 
it together he can ring the gong and
complete<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:42.610> section<00:04:43.050> so<00:04:44.050> rounding<00:04:44.710> off

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
complete that section so rounding off

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.650 
complete that section so rounding off
the<00:04:45.070> vehicles<00:04:45.490> of<00:04:45.639> course<00:04:45.850> we've<00:04:46.030> got<00:04:46.060> sky

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
the vehicles of course we've got sky

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.409 
the vehicles of course we've got sky
slicer<00:04:47.080> here<00:04:47.470> get<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.100> on<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.729> portal<00:04:49.150> and

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
slicer here get that on the portal and

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.300 
slicer here get that on the portal and
although<00:04:50.229> we<00:04:50.440> have<00:04:50.470> seen<00:04:50.800> quite<00:04:50.889> a<00:04:50.979> bit<00:04:51.010> of<00:04:51.160> sky

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
although we have seen quite a bit of sky

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.830 
although we have seen quite a bit of sky
so<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:51.490> said<00:04:51.669> before<00:04:51.789> it's<00:04:52.090> interesting<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.570> see

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
so I said before it's interesting to see

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.870 
so I said before it's interesting to see
some<00:04:53.650> vehicles<00:04:54.100> flying<00:04:54.400> through<00:04:54.699> some

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
some vehicles flying through some

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.430 
some vehicles flying through some
different<00:04:55.360> levels<00:04:55.630> we<00:04:55.750> saw<00:04:55.930> this<00:04:56.080> earlier

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
different levels we saw this earlier

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.200 
different levels we saw this earlier
when<00:04:56.919> we<00:04:56.949> were<00:04:57.130> driving<00:04:57.610> at<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.789> back<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.030> this

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
when we were driving at the back of this

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.200 
when we were driving at the back of this
dragon<00:04:58.449> but<00:04:58.960> here<00:04:59.229> got<00:04:59.590> this<00:04:59.710> optional<00:05:00.210> moved

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
dragon but here got this optional moved

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.500 
dragon but here got this optional moved
over<00:05:01.660> where<00:05:01.870> we<00:05:01.990> can<00:05:02.169> fly<00:05:03.120> stay<00:05:04.120> go<00:05:04.300> back

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
over where we can fly stay go back

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.379 
over where we can fly stay go back
rounds<00:05:04.870> off<00:05:04.960> our<00:05:05.229> look<00:05:05.470> at<00:05:05.650> some<00:05:05.979> of<00:05:06.130> this

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
rounds off our look at some of this
