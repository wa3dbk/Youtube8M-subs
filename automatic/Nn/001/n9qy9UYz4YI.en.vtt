and<00:01:04.000> since<00:01:05.000> I'm<00:01:05.680> in<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.800> school<00:01:07.010> full<00:01:07.160> of

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
and since I'm in a school full of

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.270 
and since I'm in a school full of
teenagers<00:01:07.610> I'm<00:01:08.570> just<00:01:08.840> gonna<00:01:08.930> say<00:01:09.020> other<00:01:09.380> you

can<00:01:10.430> fill<00:01:10.610> in<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.790> blanks<00:01:11.119> I<00:01:11.530> bought<00:01:12.530> this<00:01:12.740> for

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
can fill in the blanks I bought this for

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.920 
can fill in the blanks I bought this for
the<00:01:13.160> design<00:01:13.460> though<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:14.090> curve<00:01:14.450> makes<00:01:14.750> it

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
the design though that curve makes it

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.960 
the design though that curve makes it
easy<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.259> easy<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.890> hold<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:16.400> won't<00:01:16.729> need

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
easy to easy to hold so I won't need

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.820 
easy to easy to hold so I won't need
some<00:01:17.450> sort<00:01:17.660> of<00:01:17.750> additional<00:01:18.290> thirty<00:01:18.590> dollar

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
some sort of additional thirty dollar

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.070 
some sort of additional thirty dollar
grip<00:01:19.190> or<00:01:19.550> something<00:01:19.940> like<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.780> entire

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
grip or something like that the entire

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.680 
grip or something like that the entire
idea<00:01:21.290> was<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.920> take<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.460> grab<00:01:22.940> it<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.240> go

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
idea was to take it and grab it and go

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.330 
idea was to take it and grab it and go
so<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.200> needed<00:01:24.530> really<00:01:24.800> good<00:01:24.950> stabilization

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
so I needed really good stabilization

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.219 
so I needed really good stabilization
and<00:01:25.820> a<00:01:25.910> really<00:01:26.090> good<00:01:26.210> form<00:01:26.600> factor<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:27.020> hold

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
and a really good form factor to hold

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.910 
and a really good form factor to hold
and<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:27.800> circular<00:01:28.250> form<00:01:28.520> factor<00:01:28.910> brings<00:01:29.600> it

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
and this circular form factor brings it

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.650 
and this circular form factor brings it
so<00:01:30.920> as<00:01:31.040> I<00:01:31.070> stated<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.640> camera<00:01:31.940> only<00:01:32.090> has<00:01:32.390> two

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
so as I stated the camera only has two

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.719 
so as I stated the camera only has two
buttons<00:01:32.869> one<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.560> switch<00:01:33.770> between<00:01:33.920> slow-mo

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
buttons one to switch between slow-mo

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.540 
buttons one to switch between slow-mo
and<00:01:35.080> regular<00:01:36.080> video<00:01:36.380> recording<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.310> slow<00:01:37.520> mo

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
and regular video recording the slow mo

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.270 
and regular video recording the slow mo
is<00:01:37.790> pretty<00:01:38.000> bad<00:01:38.180> at<00:01:38.450> 720p<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.470> I<00:01:39.680> wouldn't

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
is pretty bad at 720p and I wouldn't

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.040 
is pretty bad at 720p and I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:40.550> using<00:01:40.940> it<00:01:41.180> as<00:01:41.360> it's<00:01:41.540> not<00:01:41.660> half<00:01:41.900> as

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
recommend using it as it's not half as

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.500 
recommend using it as it's not half as
good<00:01:42.229> as<00:01:42.409> some<00:01:42.680> more<00:01:42.860> premium<00:01:43.250> action<00:01:44.180> camera

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
good as some more premium action camera

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.360 
good as some more premium action camera
awkward<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.170> then<00:01:45.770> there's<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.070> actual

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
awkward and then there's the actual

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.370 
awkward and then there's the actual
shutter<00:01:46.670> book<00:01:46.880> it's<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.240> big<00:01:47.510> brown<00:01:47.900> shiny

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
shutter book it's a big brown shiny

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.320 
shutter book it's a big brown shiny
button<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.280> works<00:01:49.520> fine<00:01:49.670> there's<00:01:50.150> really

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
button and it works fine there's really

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.480 
button and it works fine there's really
nothing<00:01:50.479> more<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.990> talk<00:01:51.110> about<00:01:51.340> after<00:01:52.340> about

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
nothing more to talk about after about

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.190 
nothing more to talk about after about
