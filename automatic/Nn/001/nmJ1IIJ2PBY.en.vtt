00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.529
 one knows the complaints education policy in 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.150
 the dead end learning lust city ​​school frustration 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.769
 contrast these students from Berlin 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.389
 they want their desire to learn 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.540
 to report experiences 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.460
 are front and lateral thinkers in things school 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:24.000
 Together with them threatens to go 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.830
 This bus is loaded with eight 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.140
 students of a headmistress one 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.410
 teacher and a scientist home 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.960
 Germany explains a school 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.870
 berlin tells in many cities in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.399
 our country as they make school 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.100
 school in aufbruch this is the name 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.640
 initiative and this school works 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.640
 a little different 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.920
 bullet on the rise what does it mean 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.360
 Actually , the scientist is more likely 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.340
 behind this project behind this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.460
 Initiative of the brain researcher professor 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.370
 gerald hüther from godingen hüther wohin 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.680
 the schools break up on the break 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.020
 and develop another one 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.550
 cheaper learning and relationship culture 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.380
 that is perhaps the essential 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.650
 feature of school in departure we go 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.070
 less about it 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.110
 teaching plans and new reforms 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.090
 we have already experienced everything 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.370
 we are not that concerned about it either 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.830
 that now change processes from above 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.840
 be passed down but 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.030
 we try a new overdraft 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.950
 initiate sculpture on the spot 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.320
 So I'm Paul understand years old 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.390
 I use the cash registers I think I go 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.960
 Today, I'm 15 years old 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.490
 i am the same as i am 13 years old and 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.680
 go in the eighth grade 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.659
 i am sarah i am 13 went 90 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.609
 launched 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.979
 the young ambassadors are eager to learn 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.590
 want to infect the republic with theirs 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.840
 The stage goal today is the Horst 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.259
 Haug all in schwaigern near Heilbronn 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.609
 The hall is almost sold out over 600 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.649
 interested have registered 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:59.140
 including many teachers the 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.979
 resonance shows that the topic is the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.979
 moving people 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.810
 sarah luna put stefan location the first 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.420
 character 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:38.239
 we should move into which 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:39.830
 work direction and if you think so 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.050
 that ready to hate the topic now 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.570
 understood because teachers say you are 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.570
 ready to write the test then you can 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.790
 I could not understand something 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.090
 first ask again and then he 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.070
 the teacher has to learn and he has to learn 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.070
 must explain that otherwise there 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:19.180
 to become better self-confident 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:30.730
 Paul tells children I have to say how 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:34.380
 to be your teacher and now the teacher 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.380
 experiences from the point of view of the school principal 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:50.380
 in 45 minutes circle simply no 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:52.840
 projects and city you should 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.790
 Just think how can we get one 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.799
 create structure in school or it 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.959
 is possible and actually as 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.390
 easy and we have off 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.930
 different subjects we have 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.470
 placed one after another so that we each 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.470
 thursday 5 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:18.040
 Why do we know teacher educators and 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.350
 Teachers are teachers advertised because they 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.780
 to support children and adolescents 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.730
 wanted to go an infection brings you 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.330
 not all house from the relationship 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.300
 there you go and strength yourself 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.740
 many houses are not here at last 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.020
 structurally, it becomes us 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.400
 disability 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.570
 in order for that to change the 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.570
 be changed 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.790
 gerald hüther preaches the change of system 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.590
 the culture in the schools should 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.510
 be changed to the potential 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.130
 to promote the student's development 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.130
 arrives this embassy audience 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.569
 the event is over two 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.300
 takes hours and there is still a lot going on here 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.349
 discussed 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:16.190
 Let's see if I still have a few votes 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:20.080
 Catching the mood was great 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.080
 but you have been great 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:27.680
 You can just celebrate 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.770
 the new things are still on the rise 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.570
 make ideas develop his 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.600
 educational heart to trust 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.389
 the racecourse there are definitely people 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.699
 the critical but to the 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.699
 For the most part, it is feedback positive 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.199
 For many years there is this gives us 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.729
 yes also new education dieters on 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.850
 have reigned on the new knowledge 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:52.400
 There is also personal research 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.150
 Competencies social skills that it 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.500
 is less about it 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.180
 Knowledge transfer is somewhere 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.460
 student who reacts a bit 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.669
 The rooms are not as open as this one 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.310
 is desired in school and is it 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.710
 an old think of course, too 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.169
 food for thought from school on the rise 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.660
 seem to arrive 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:14.510
 I liked it a lot that 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.030
 that must change so that must be about it 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.430
 but talk to the federal court 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.820
 let these structures to 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:26.150
 meadow are simply set in motion 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.980
 would have structures in motion like that 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.250
 Many people are well aware of the thesis 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.130
 in front 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.480
 is an old wine in new hoses 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.850
 basically taken 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.350
 it's a drama all over somewhere 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.370
 they only have their present on the way 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.730
 make is I think the 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.410
 crucial and you have to speak so to speak 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.970
 to initiate discussions that is the 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.450
 dedicated Berlin students ever 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.880
 successful 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.920
 It remains to be seen whether their tour across 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.570
 through Germany to a real one 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.570
 departure in the schools leads
