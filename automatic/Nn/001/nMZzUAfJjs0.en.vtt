all this is the 16-inch number 22 this

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.310 
all this is the 16-inch number 22 this
hair<00:01:14.040> has<00:01:14.580> not<00:01:14.820> been<00:01:15.060> colored<00:01:15.420> obviously<00:01:16.080> it's

hair has not been colored obviously it's

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.609

the<00:01:16.350> same<00:01:16.590> color<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:16.920> my<00:01:17.610> hair<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:21.200> it's<00:01:22.200> just

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the same color as my hair and it's just

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.920 
the same color as my hair and it's just
completely<00:01:23.130> lost<00:01:23.490> its<00:01:23.700> integrity<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.630> short

completely lost its integrity in a short
amount<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.290> time<00:01:25.350> what<00:01:25.830> I'm<00:01:25.979> assuming<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.670> that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
amount of time what I'm assuming is that

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.770

they<00:01:27.150> may<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.360> gotten<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.840> bad<00:01:28.020> batch<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.530> hair

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
they may have gotten a bad batch of hair

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.990 
they may have gotten a bad batch of hair
and<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.259> hope<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:31.950> take<00:01:32.000> responsibility

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
and I hope that they take responsibility

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.390 
and I hope that they take responsibility
for<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.360> give<00:01:33.720> me<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.900> refund<00:01:34.290> I'm<00:01:35.130> also
