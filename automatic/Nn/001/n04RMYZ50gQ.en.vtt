00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
those if you see my multiplier right now

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.429 
those if you see my multiplier right now
is<00:00:16.830> times<00:00:17.180> 384<00:00:18.180> alright<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.109> let's<00:00:19.289> go<00:00:19.380> to

is times 384 alright so let's go to

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.019 
is times 384 alright so let's go to
mini-map<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:19.920> we're<00:00:20.250> going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> go<00:00:20.520> over<00:00:20.550> here

little tentacles come out and against
the<00:00:43.320> gold<00:00:43.530> claws<00:00:44.059> you're<00:00:45.059> gonna<00:00:45.149> want<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.770> you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the gold claws you're gonna want to you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.110 
the gold claws you're gonna want to you
don't<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.879> where<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
don't have to do this to where you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.600 
don't have to do this to where you
dispose<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.539> them<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:48.840> anything<00:00:49.219> but<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.550> is

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
dispose of them or anything but this is

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
dispose of them or anything but this is
the<00:00:50.700> area<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:50.969> need<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> level<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
the area you need to be in the level is

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.049 
the area you need to be in the level is
the<00:00:52.440> second<00:00:52.800> period<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.370> tentacles<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the second period of little tentacles of

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.889 
the second period of little tentacles of
pop<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.760> we're<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> break

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
pop up and we're just going to break

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.160 
pop up and we're just going to break
these<00:00:58.140> parts<00:00:58.649> right<00:00:58.770> here<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:04.140> should

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
these parts right here and this should

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.789 
these parts right here and this should
build<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:05.010> plastic<00:01:05.549> man<00:01:05.700> pad<00:01:06.060> right<00:01:06.299> there<00:01:06.799> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
build a plastic man pad right there and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.039 
build a plastic man pad right there and
then<00:01:08.280> I'm<00:01:08.549> gonna<00:01:08.640> switch<00:01:08.970> over<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.360> plastic

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
then I'm gonna switch over to plastic

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.740 
then I'm gonna switch over to plastic
man<00:01:12.409> and<00:01:13.430> go<00:01:14.430> over<00:01:14.580> here<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.820> make<00:01:15.150> him<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.540> his

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
man and go over here and make him do his

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.859 
man and go over here and make him do his
thing<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:17.869> he's<00:01:18.869> gonna<00:01:19.110> go<00:01:19.259> fishing<00:01:20.869> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
thing and he's gonna go fishing and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.910 
thing and he's gonna go fishing and
guess<00:01:22.080> what<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.799> gets<00:01:23.070> red<00:01:23.340> brick<00:01:23.580> times<00:01:23.939> 10

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
guess what it gets red brick times 10

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.370 
guess what it gets red brick times 10
multiplier<00:01:26.540> there<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.630> go<00:01:29.600> alright<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.200> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
multiplier there we go alright so as you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
multiplier there we go alright so as you
can<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.070> studs<00:01:32.430> times<00:01:32.759> 10<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.329> 5

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
can see we have studs times 10 for 5

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.630 
can see we have studs times 10 for 5
million<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:34.740> ahead<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> buy<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
million I'm go ahead and buy that and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.520 
million I'm go ahead and buy that and
let<00:01:36.030> me<00:01:36.090> go<00:01:36.180> into<00:01:36.329> extras<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.259> we're

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
let me go into extras here and we're

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.950 
let me go into extras here and we're
going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.680> turn<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.100> stud<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.090> now<00:01:39.600> our

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
going to turn that stud on and now our

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.490 
going to turn that stud on and now our
multiplier<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.930> three<00:01:42.930> thousand<00:01:43.380> eight

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
multiplier is up to three thousand eight

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.990 
multiplier is up to three thousand eight
hundred<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.950> forty<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.470> lot<00:01:47.000> but

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
hundred and forty so it's a lot but

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.620 
hundred and forty so it's a lot but
that's<00:01:48.810> crazy<00:01:49.430> alright<00:01:50.430> guys<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.000> that's<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that's crazy alright guys so that's the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.620 
that's crazy alright guys so that's the
last<00:01:51.810> red<00:01:52.590> bricks<00:01:52.829> multiplier<00:01:53.490> video<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.450> if

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
last red bricks multiplier video so if
