the game again we'll try them break a

we're putting on the screen and how but

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.580 
we're putting on the screen and how but
again<00:02:55.390> all<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.660> those<00:02:55.870> systems<00:02:56.110> even<00:02:56.470> though

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
again all of those systems even though

right now now she made me feel utterly
this<00:03:03.730> event<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.150> will<00:03:04.240> go<00:03:04.330> do<00:03:04.480> something<00:03:04.750> else

this event and will go do something else

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.280 
this event and will go do something else
so<00:03:06.070> we'll<00:03:06.610> easy<00:03:06.760> drive<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.750> just<00:03:07.930> leave<00:03:08.110> the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
little bit as we continue this demo but

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.760 
little bit as we continue this demo but
we've<00:04:31.510> opened<00:04:32.020> this<00:04:32.170> world<00:04:32.440> it's<00:04:32.590> not<00:04:32.710> just

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
we've opened this world it's not just

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.340 
we've opened this world it's not just
about<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.490> road<00:04:33.760> network<00:04:34.390> itself<00:04:35.050> as<00:04:35.200> the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
about the road network itself as the

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.410 
about the road network itself as the
off-road<00:04:35.710> areas<00:04:36.070> as<00:04:36.190> well<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:36.880> cops<00:04:37.180> will

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
off-road areas as well and the cops will

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.140 
off-road areas as well and the cops will
follow<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:38.020> there<00:04:38.350> too<00:04:38.740> so<00:04:39.190> wherever<00:04:39.730> you

that's you using your knowledge of here

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.370 
that's you using your knowledge of here
we<00:04:45.880> go<00:04:46.030> routes<00:04:46.270> are<00:04:46.420> in<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.570> we're<00:04:46.930> in<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:47.020> case

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
we go routes are in a we're in a case

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.350 
we go routes are in a we're in a case
right<00:04:47.590> now<00:04:47.650> she's<00:04:48.040> quite<00:04:48.340> quickly<00:04:48.610> you're<00:04:49.210> too

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
right now she's quite quickly you're too

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.800 
right now she's quite quickly you're too
fast<00:04:49.630> for<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.930> plane<00:04:50.110> is<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:52.060> concert<00:04:52.600> can

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
fast for the plane is so the concert can

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.140 
fast for the plane is so the concert can
be<00:04:52.900> lost<00:04:53.110> very<00:04:53.200> easily<00:04:53.530> at<00:04:53.860> any<00:04:54.010> level<00:04:54.190> one<00:04:54.460> but

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
be lost very easily at any level one but

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.630 
be lost very easily at any level one but
you'll<00:04:55.480> earn<00:04:55.660> more<00:04:56.140> speed<00:04:56.560> points<00:04:56.830> when<00:04:57.550> you

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
you'll earn more speed points when you

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.720 
you'll earn more speed points when you
start<00:04:57.910> taking<00:04:58.120> them<00:04:58.450> on<00:04:58.540> so<00:04:59.340> the<00:05:00.340> length<00:05:00.580> of

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
start taking them on so the length of

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.640 
start taking them on so the length of
time<00:05:00.940> you<00:05:01.090> spend<00:05:01.360> in<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.510> pursue<00:05:01.900> obviously

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
time you spend in the pursue obviously

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.930 
time you spend in the pursue obviously
beaten<00:05:03.010> up<00:05:03.100> on<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.340> cops<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.730> going<00:05:03.880> to

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
beaten up on the cops is going to

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.420 
beaten up on the cops is going to
escalate<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.690> your<00:05:05.560> heat<00:05:05.800> levels<00:05:06.220> and

escalate the your heat levels and

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.170 
escalate the your heat levels and
they'll<00:05:06.730> start<00:05:07.000> to<00:05:07.120> bring<00:05:07.380> more<00:05:08.940> faster<00:05:09.940> cars

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
they'll start to bring more faster cars

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.750 
they'll start to bring more faster cars
