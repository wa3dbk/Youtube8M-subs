00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.710
 That is visible to the bag 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.710
 Aoshima, a tourist destination representing Miyazaki 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.330
 Right after Aoshima 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.470
 There is a beach in front of you 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.039
 I'm sorry 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.250
 Oh dear 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.910
 Why only summer 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.910
 Other than that 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.890
 I can surf all the time around here 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:44.480
 As a feature of here mostly Chima people 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.480
 Nde I feel that wave becomes smaller as it approaches 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.790
 Really easy to understand 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.300
 The closer it is to the teamer, the more it comes to waves and it's kinder 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.300
 For beginners 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.320
 From the rice here Kizakihama 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.540
 To become thus gradually 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.540
 It's like the waves get bigger 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.280
 It is better not to say that there is a wave any time you come, so it 's better to be careful a bit 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:21.040
 other 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:23.940
 Well Kizaki sometimes server here to the beach Toka was closed anymore was really in you. Gather 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.940
 Crowded 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.590
 I have to pay attention to 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.649
 It is that there is a surprisingly Ookini toward or Tuplets 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.490
 That I noticed when I come out off the coast and no longer go back 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:47.740
 Than there is towards the center's 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:50.850
 Cheetah is good enough when the waves get bigger 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.850
 In feeling 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.770
 I often disturb you 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.039
 Why is of Aoshima of Cape Zhuang 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.360
 Although there was no wave this year's Golden Week 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.420
 The research pressure was the best 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.619
 The customers who came are also 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.050
 I was happy to return 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.750
 Also 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:20.800
 Because it is a season to come free from now 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.800
 Please come to Aoshima, where everyone is warm .
