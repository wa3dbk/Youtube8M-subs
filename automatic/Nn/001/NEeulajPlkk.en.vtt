00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
might find it very ugly but one thing is

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.080 
might find it very ugly but one thing is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
sure is and that's that it's worse in

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.920 
sure is and that's that it's worse in

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
not special about optimus 2x is that it

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.779 
not special about optimus 2x is that it

power<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.479> funny<00:01:35.689> thing<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:35.930> that<00:01:36.259> that's

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
power and the funny thing is that that's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.330 
power and the funny thing is that that's
not<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.950> case<00:01:36.979> because<00:01:38.770> actually<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.920> HDC

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
not the case because actually the HDC

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.830 
not the case because actually the HDC
seems<00:01:40.759> to<00:01:40.909> be<00:01:41.890> speedier<00:01:46.299> so<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.360> optimization

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
seems to be speedier so the optimization

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.730 
seems to be speedier so the optimization
is<00:01:48.320> better<00:01:48.560> done<00:01:48.860> by<00:01:48.920> HTC<00:01:50.470> Prince's<00:01:51.470> if<00:01:51.619> we

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
is better done by HTC Prince's if we

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:02.190 
is better done by HTC Prince's if we
start<00:01:52.039> an<00:01:55.330> art<00:01:56.330> application<00:01:58.390> like<00:01:59.390> mega<00:01:59.929> jump

that's what happened to lost two times

that's what happened to lost two times
anyway<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:38.620> goes<00:02:39.620> for<00:02:39.799> other<00:02:39.890> applications

that<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.950> HTC<00:03:34.340> finishes<00:03:35.060> bit<00:03:35.960> earlier<00:03:37.330> with

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
that the HTC finishes bit earlier with

that the HTC finishes bit earlier with
flashed<00:03:38.630> HTC<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.410> quicker<00:03:39.860> to<00:03:40.010> but<00:03:40.700> that's

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
flashed HTC is quicker to but that's

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.300 
flashed HTC is quicker to but that's

lot<00:03:49.370> better<00:03:49.640> on<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.060> LG<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:52.130> it's<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.490> tie<00:03:52.730> in

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
lot better on the LG so it's a tie in

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.440 
lot better on the LG so it's a tie in
that<00:03:53.150> area<00:03:55.090> what<00:03:56.090> is<00:03:56.300> a<00:03:57.520> an<00:03:58.520> advantage<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.330> the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
that area what is a an advantage of the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.960 
that area what is a an advantage of the
dual<00:03:59.720> core<00:03:59.930> processor<00:04:00.440> is<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:00.739> you<00:04:00.920> will<00:04:01.670> in

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
dual core processor is that you will in

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.479 
dual core processor is that you will in
the<00:04:02.180> future<00:04:02.420> be<00:04:02.630> able<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:03.230> play<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.830> lot<00:04:04.459> more

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
the future be able to play a lot more

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.630 
the future be able to play a lot more
apps<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.180> games<00:04:06.160> because<00:04:07.160> they<00:04:07.310> will<00:04:07.489> be

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
apps and games because they will be

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.060 
apps and games because they will be
optimized<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:08.390> of<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.989> optimized<00:04:09.709> for<00:04:09.920> the

we<00:04:40.190> kind<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:40.970> lose<00:04:41.120> our<00:04:41.330> way<00:04:41.450> in<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:42.650> know

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
we kind of lose our way in it you know

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.330 
we kind of lose our way in it you know
your<00:04:43.550> instance<00:04:44.030> pop<00:04:44.330> up<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.860> standby<00:04:45.860> menu

err<00:04:46.810> it's<00:04:47.810> really<00:04:48.080> big<00:04:48.320> in<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.950> HTC<00:04:49.910> device

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
err it's really big in the HTC device

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.770 
err it's really big in the HTC device
well<00:04:51.290> with<00:04:52.070> LG<00:04:52.580> it's<00:04:53.140> pretty<00:04:54.140> standard<00:04:54.350> and

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
well with LG it's pretty standard and

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:04.360 
well with LG it's pretty standard and
you<00:04:56.780> have<00:04:56.960> only<00:05:00.310> some<00:05:01.310> options<00:05:01.729> and<00:05:03.370> we

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
you have only some options and we

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.580 
you have only some options and we
consider<00:05:04.729> it<00:05:04.850> as<00:05:05.060> an<00:05:05.270> advantage<00:05:05.750> for<00:05:06.110> the<00:05:06.229> LG

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
consider it as an advantage for the LG

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.280 
consider it as an advantage for the LG
because<00:05:07.100> it's<00:05:07.280> simpler<00:05:07.729> and<00:05:11.020> that's<00:05:12.020> a<00:05:12.140> bit

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
because it's simpler and that's a bit

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.990 
because it's simpler and that's a bit
better<00:05:12.500> we<00:05:12.740> think<00:05:13.010> but<00:05:13.340> of<00:05:13.490> course<00:05:13.729> you<00:05:13.850> might

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
better we think but of course you might

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.380 
better we think but of course you might
disagree<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.720> think<00:05:14.990> that<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:16.390> complexity

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
disagree and think that the complexity

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.240 
disagree and think that the complexity
and<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:18.830> amount<00:05:19.669> of<00:05:19.760> options<00:05:20.000> on<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.450> HTC<00:05:20.840> is

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
and the amount of options on the HTC is

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.570 
and the amount of options on the HTC is
better

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.310 

apart<00:05:26.580> from<00:05:26.670> this<00:05:26.820> we<00:05:27.030> see<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.720> LG<00:05:28.230> has

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
apart from this we see that the LG has

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.590 
apart from this we see that the LG has
an<00:05:28.470> HDMI<00:05:28.980> out

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
an HDMI out

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.620 
an HDMI out
well<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:30.750> HDC<00:05:31.080> doesn't<00:05:31.530> have<00:05:31.680> one<00:05:35.480> so<00:05:36.480> you'll

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
well the HDC doesn't have one so you'll

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.700 
well the HDC doesn't have one so you'll
be<00:05:36.810> able<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.320> play<00:05:37.560> full<00:05:38.070> HD<00:05:38.250> films<00:05:39.060> on<00:05:39.300> your<00:05:39.420> TV

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
be able to play full HD films on your TV

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
be able to play full HD films on your TV
with<00:05:40.710> one<00:05:40.740> cable<00:05:41.400> just<00:05:42.410> left<00:05:43.410> LG<00:05:43.860> not<00:05:44.400> with<00:05:44.580> the

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
with one cable just left LG not with the

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.500 
with one cable just left LG not with the
HTC<00:05:45.170> so<00:05:46.170> if<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.470> have<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.650> nice<00:05:46.950> full<00:05:47.190> HD<00:05:47.640> TV

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.500 

that's<00:05:51.510> a<00:05:51.630> nice<00:05:51.810> thing<00:05:52.050> for<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.910> fans<00:05:53.910> costs

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
that's a nice thing for the fans costs

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.320 
that's a nice thing for the fans costs
the<00:05:54.690> same<00:05:54.900> so<00:05:55.710> if<00:05:56.490> you're<00:05:56.700> really<00:05:56.880> looking<00:05:57.120> for

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
the same so if you're really looking for

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.120 
the same so if you're really looking for
a<00:05:57.510> powerhouse<00:05:57.930> that<00:05:58.230> will<00:05:58.410> be<00:05:58.530> able<00:05:58.710> to<00:05:58.950> play

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
a powerhouse that will be able to play

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.700 
a powerhouse that will be able to play
all<00:05:59.310> apps<00:05:59.670> in<00:05:59.910> the<00:05:59.970> future<00:06:00.000> also<00:06:00.720> you<00:06:01.470> should

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
all apps in the future also you should

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.580 
all apps in the future also you should
go<00:06:01.890> for<00:06:02.100> the<00:06:02.160> LG<00:06:02.490> else<00:06:03.450> the<00:06:03.870> difference<00:06:04.290> is<00:06:04.440> not

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
go for the LG else the difference is not

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.130 
go for the LG else the difference is not
that<00:06:04.770> big<00:06:05.010> but<00:06:05.250> the<00:06:05.910> HTC<00:06:06.390> is<00:06:06.540> a<00:06:06.570> bit<00:06:06.750> speedier

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
that big but the HTC is a bit speedier

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:13.730 
that big but the HTC is a bit speedier
it's<00:06:08.210> smaller<00:06:09.210> and<00:06:11.720> it's<00:06:12.720> of<00:06:12.870> course<00:06:13.020> HTC

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
it's smaller and it's of course HTC

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.270 
it's smaller and it's of course HTC
which<00:06:14.870> has<00:06:15.870> a<00:06:18.320> reputation<00:06:19.320> of<00:06:19.770> giving<00:06:20.070> better

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
which has a reputation of giving better

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.630 
which has a reputation of giving better
support<00:06:20.790> and<00:06:21.000> things<00:06:21.330> like<00:06:21.570> that
