00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.460

 montoneros only montoneros but 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.330
 I wrote almost killed him it can not be neither 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.870
 so let's go for corpse 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.659
 Revenge Revenge club is looking 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.080
 taken 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.080
 Let's see 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.369
 disappearance a steak david copperfield

 There is disappearing and everything 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.580
 how beautiful the diamond sniper looks 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.580
 tortoiseshell 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.770
 nothing 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.220
 the shadows nothing was pobrecito 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.200
 true that this sniper is the second 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.260
 favorite and it's very good indeed but I 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.240
 much more like being 50 for obvious 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.700
 good reasons not for the reasons but 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.950
 because I like it more than a flip 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.310
 nothing else that is powerful and with a shot 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.690
 Enough for me 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.330
 it takes on the foot good guys well almost 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.190
 I never talk about the subject of this one of that 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.150
 series that is from drug dealers and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.700
 well tell them that one is taking that 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.970
 imagine a drug dealer collecting 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.099
 having a sniper as this of 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.430
 diamonds or gold at least makes me 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.739
 I was already dying flies so good 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.069
 Well, a little here, giving it the touch of 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.920
 originality if some day it were narco me 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.790

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.880

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.160
 They kill me I'm not bloodthirsty very well 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.870
 nothing like they see I would not like to make a 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.360
 arch but not at all 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.210

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.720

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.960
 distracting is there 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.169

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.810
 that healthy mind that is 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:44.090
 a little on the weak back 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:47.340
 it's pure churro baby to see 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:50.610
 then we are winning 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.490
 this kit the good thing about bringing a staple 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.070
 frank up this fellow and my 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.689
 comrades frighten me are very bad 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.049
 and says that 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:03.880
 come, come on, but why do they all go? 

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:05.510
 for here 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.400
 uff 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.890
 another to point out the guys we're seeing 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.260
 today it scared me while very fellow 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.910
 well done 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.910
 and they encourage me to see and see 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:24.320
 This is because someone shows me champion 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.450
 if you want essence and the invisible man 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.160
 but it is that in the back it can not be 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.149
 what a rat you are 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.800
 and then nothing 

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:36.559
 I made the mistake of getting too far away from 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.629
 my classmates so well I'm not going to 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:44.229
 make that mistake again and I'm 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:44.229
 changing so that 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.050
 we offered the advantage I will finish 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.050

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:05.600
 more but it is that 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:09.470
 what bad luck despite the fact that the 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.230
 king uncle higher because we lost what 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.150
 courage and for a low the worst not person 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.950
