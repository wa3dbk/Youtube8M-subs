 a lot and you're thinking that you can not 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:00.850

 to the home audience coach 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.350

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.350
 nothing less than the bilirubin adam díaz 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.060
 because of your Christian love 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.060

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.300
 diagnosed maldeamors 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.300
 Seeing my heart as knees 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.940
 today metro

 gypsy Aaron dayz and they tell me not you 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.690
 worry that we are going to vote for 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.690
 you so that you do not marry 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.710

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.570
 abraham the wedding how about the wedding 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.330
 at the moment we do not have to put 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:53.790
 a little bit but I did not know I had a 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.790
 meringue and a salsa place 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.770

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.390
 different than what you 're used to 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.580
 but in my opinion I felt like I 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.350
 uncomfortable not me I felt that he sees you 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.170

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.740

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.070
 Do you want this song at the beginning? 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.680

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.820
 sing it but then he put the batteries 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.980
 and he outlined the decision of his teacher and his 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.370
 car that is me and I liked it

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.560
 excited and it was like a 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.470
 It was like I started with a ball 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.620
 emotions 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:43.680
 or curry of emotions, the truth is 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.840

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.270
 someone win this competition and I 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.720
