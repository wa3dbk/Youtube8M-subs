00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.100 

now<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.790> next<00:00:09.030> one<00:00:09.150> we're<00:00:09.300> going<00:00:09.390> to<00:00:09.480> do<00:00:09.570> we're

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
now the next one we're going to do we're

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.080 
now the next one we're going to do we're
moving<00:00:10.320> out<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.620> step<00:00:11.100> and<00:00:11.250> slide<00:00:11.340> moving<00:00:11.970> out

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
moving out the step and slide moving out

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.660 
moving out the step and slide moving out
into<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.270> slide<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.139> step<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:14.490> closed<00:00:14.639> a

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
into a slide and step we closed a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.720 
into a slide and step we closed a
pendulum<00:00:15.210> also<00:00:15.720> so<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.950> either<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.310> when

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
pendulum also so you can either and when

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.700 
pendulum also so you can either and when
we<00:00:17.790> do<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> pendulum<00:00:18.360> to<00:00:18.840> slide<00:00:19.200> and<00:00:19.410> step

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
we do a pendulum to slide and step

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.100 
we do a pendulum to slide and step
because<00:00:20.099> our<00:00:20.250> feet<00:00:20.460> contract<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.660> then<00:00:21.990> they

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
because our feet contract and then they

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.710 
because our feet contract and then they
expand<00:00:22.529> okay<00:00:23.010> before<00:00:23.220> notice<00:00:23.760> space<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.600> my

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
expand okay before notice space to my

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.420 
expand okay before notice space to my
feet<00:00:24.930> gets<00:00:25.619> bigger<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.160> then<00:00:26.280> it<00:00:26.369> gets

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
feet gets bigger and then it gets

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.980 
feet gets bigger and then it gets
smaller<00:00:26.760> back<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> normal<00:00:27.539> size

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
smaller back to normal size

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.380 
smaller back to normal size
when<00:00:28.350> I'm<00:00:28.440> going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.619> pendulum<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.400> feet<00:00:30.180> come

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
when I'm going to pendulum a feet come

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.140 
when I'm going to pendulum a feet come
together<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.960> then<00:00:31.080> go<00:00:31.230> out<00:00:31.380> okay<00:00:32.190> I'm<00:00:33.030> going

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
together and then go out okay I'm going

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.460 
together and then go out okay I'm going
to<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.900> you<00:00:34.199> take<00:00:34.379> your

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
to think about this is you take your

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.360 
to think about this is you take your
feet<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.400> same<00:00:35.670> spot<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.030> floor<00:00:37.070> back<00:00:38.070> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
feet on the same spot and floor back and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.670 
feet on the same spot and floor back and
forth<00:00:38.580> okay<00:00:39.330> we<00:00:39.780> use<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.050> movement<00:00:40.470> curve

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
forth okay we use this movement curve

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.750 
forth okay we use this movement curve
for<00:00:41.190> kicking<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.160> person<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.700> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
for kicking and the person is just a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.030 
for kicking and the person is just a
little<00:00:44.940> bit<00:00:45.030> farther<00:00:45.360> away<00:00:45.600> from<00:00:45.719> us<00:00:45.899> okay

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
little bit farther away from us okay

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.069 
little bit farther away from us okay
it's<00:00:47.520> also<00:00:47.640> very<00:00:48.210> similar<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.690> kids<00:00:48.899> do

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it's also very similar to what kids do

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.150 
it's also very similar to what kids do
when<00:00:50.040> they<00:00:50.160> gallop<00:00:51.050> okay<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> pendulum

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
when they gallop okay that is a pendulum

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
when they gallop okay that is a pendulum
kind<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.520> movement<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.200> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
kind of movement so when you do the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.889 
kind of movement so when you do the
pendulum<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:56.160> back<00:00:56.370> foot<00:00:56.700> is<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.660> kick

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
pendulum your back foot is going to kick

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.770 
pendulum your back foot is going to kick
the<00:00:58.050> front<00:00:58.170> foot<00:00:58.440> out<00:00:58.469> okay<00:01:02.480> just<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the front foot out okay just like that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.930 
the front foot out okay just like that
okay<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.170> pencil<00:01:04.619> forward<00:01:04.949> feet<00:01:05.580> together<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
okay so pencil forward feet together and

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.690 
okay so pencil forward feet together and
then<00:01:06.090> apart<00:01:06.360> okay<00:01:07.080> again<00:01:07.399> returning<00:01:08.399> to<00:01:08.520> that

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
then apart okay again returning to that

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.029 
then apart okay again returning to that
fighting<00:01:09.000> stance<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.509> connect<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.960> front<00:01:14.690> okay

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
fighting stance on connect in front okay

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.400 
fighting stance on connect in front okay
potential<00:01:17.039> back<00:01:17.220> then<00:01:18.119> jewel<00:01:18.330> back<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.170> front

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
potential back then jewel back the front

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.290 
potential back then jewel back the front
foot<00:01:19.560> moves<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> back<00:01:20.069> foot<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:20.970> apart

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
foot moves the back foot and then apart

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.120 
foot moves the back foot and then apart
okay<00:01:21.929> so<00:01:22.530> pendulum<00:01:22.920> forward<00:01:23.599> until<00:01:24.599> neck<00:01:25.130> make

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
okay so pendulum forward until neck make

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.859 
okay so pendulum forward until neck make
sense<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:27.179> you<00:01:27.270> wants<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.569> guys<00:01:27.660> you're

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
sense if you wants you guys you're

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.460 
sense if you wants you guys you're
better<00:01:27.990> at<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.610> try<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.670> okay<00:01:31.880> good<00:01:32.880> way<00:01:33.470> so

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
better at it try it okay good way so

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.210 
better at it try it okay good way so
edge<00:01:35.310> hold<00:01:35.520> forward<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:37.020> come<00:01:37.200> back<00:01:37.349> we're

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
edge hold forward and come back we're

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.359 
edge hold forward and come back we're
gonna<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.670> front<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:39.899> forward

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
gonna have to the front and then forward

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.130 
gonna have to the front and then forward
that's<00:01:41.369> your<00:01:41.490> back<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.810> now<00:01:42.899> we're<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.080> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that's your back and now we're going to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.889 
that's your back and now we're going to
have<00:01:43.289> it<00:01:44.160> passed<00:01:44.580> forward<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.330> pass<00:01:45.599> back

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
have it passed forward and a pass back

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.190 
have it passed forward and a pass back
okay<00:01:46.410> when<00:01:47.039> we're<00:01:47.160> doing<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.490> our<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:48.240> two

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
okay when we're doing on our one two

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.770 
okay when we're doing on our one two
when<00:01:49.830> I<00:01:49.920> covered<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> ton<00:01:50.489> of<00:01:50.550> distance<00:01:50.940> when

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
when I covered a ton of distance when

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.969 
when I covered a ton of distance when
the<00:01:51.840> past<00:01:52.080> forward<00:01:52.440> next<00:01:52.770> you'll<00:01:52.950> be

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the past forward next you'll be

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.279 
the past forward next you'll be
switching<00:01:53.340> feet<00:01:53.550> so<00:01:54.209> in<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.420> back<00:01:54.599> foot<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.170> do

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
switching feet so in the back foot we do

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.219 
switching feet so in the back foot we do
a<00:01:55.319> past<00:01:55.560> forward<00:01:55.800> steps<00:01:56.729> through<00:01:57.229> okay

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
a past forward steps through okay

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.260 
a past forward steps through okay
whether<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.530> pass<00:01:58.709> back<00:01:58.979> when<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.940> do<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> pass

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
whether you pass back when I do a pass

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:09.760 
whether you pass back when I do a pass
back<00:02:00.860> it's<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.099> step<00:02:02.280> back

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.960 

okay<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.979> lot<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.370> times<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.670> use<00:02:11.700> this

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
okay a lot of times you use this

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.020 
okay a lot of times you use this
defensively<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.990> let's<00:02:13.140> try<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.320> keep<00:02:13.500> my<00:02:13.620> foot

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
defensively so let's try to keep my foot

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.370 
defensively so let's try to keep my foot
that's<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.330> okay

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
that's that okay

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.830 
that's that okay
and<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.890> also<00:02:17.040> could<00:02:17.340> be<00:02:17.490> this<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.600> basically

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
and it also could be this is basically

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.630 
and it also could be this is basically
the<00:02:18.990> terminology<00:02:19.740> has<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.130> pest<00:02:20.340> back<00:02:20.490> hoes

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640

into some of your more angular movements
is<00:03:39.600> very<00:03:39.810> similar<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.519> from<00:03:41.519> colleague

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
is very similar to from colleague

is very similar to from colleague
through<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.570> female<00:03:42.840> triangle<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.320> male

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
through the female triangle the male

through the female triangle the male
triangle<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.190> stuff<00:03:44.400> but<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.090> we<00:03:45.209> can<00:03:45.330> mix<00:03:45.540> it

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
triangle and stuff but so we can mix it

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.770 
triangle and stuff but so we can mix it
into<00:03:45.989> our<00:03:46.910> numbering<00:03:47.910> system<00:03:48.300> we're<00:03:48.630> going<00:03:48.720> to

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
into our numbering system we're going to

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.080 
into our numbering system we're going to
call<00:03:48.930> ABC<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.739> D<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.400> what<00:03:50.640> we<00:03:50.730> be<00:03:50.820> doing

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
call ABC and D and this what we be doing

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.660 
call ABC and D and this what we be doing
is<00:03:51.510> going<00:03:51.720> on<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.870> 45<00:03:52.290> degree<00:03:52.410> angle<00:03:52.590> at<00:03:53.519> the

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
is going on a 45 degree angle at the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.300 
is going on a 45 degree angle at the
various<00:03:53.940> directions<00:03:54.209> alright<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.500> we're
