and one of the big differences that we
have<00:03:15.440> with<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:16.100> one<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:17.260> he<00:03:18.260> has<00:03:18.440> an

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
have with this one is that he has an

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.570 

maybe<00:03:40.110> it's<00:03:40.379> just<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.739> differences<00:03:41.280> in<00:03:41.489> the

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
maybe it's just the differences in the

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.910 
maybe it's just the differences in the
way<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.390> dolls<00:03:42.989> get<00:03:43.260> made<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.739> the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.839 
way that the dolls get made in the

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
factory but it looks like the one on the

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.210 
factory but it looks like the one on the
left<00:03:48.060> has<00:03:48.300> more<00:03:48.569> yellow<00:03:48.870> around<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.890> edge<00:03:50.010> of

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220
