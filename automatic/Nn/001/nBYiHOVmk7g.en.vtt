 what owed it as my daughter 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.919
 simply impossible what is 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.259

 ashamed 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.710

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.239
 family this thing in the pile I would like 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.100
 introduce you to the second of my nieces 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.860
 Miss from the insignia flights or find her 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.690
 repellent as my rank is 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.489
 too high to have dinner with the servants 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.910
 but too low to have dinner with mine 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.070
 family 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.470
 although I recognize and effectiveness 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.390
 of the measures you take with you there 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.950
 start asking questions he would do me 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.409
 the honor of taking a walk with me 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.450
 you don't care what people will say what 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.880
 should tell people I had no idea 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.409
 that it was so black you ca n't take it 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.569
 for wife a rare and exotic flower 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.609
 the language still has one 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:26.950
 language but yours shows why not 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.630
 you want to marry your child but 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.219
 greatest misfortune would be to marry a 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.670
 man whose family considers me one 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.670

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.530
 risk your position 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.170
 laws that allow us to belittle 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.240
 the humanity of someone not only old gives 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.700
