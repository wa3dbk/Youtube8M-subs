 sugar nails as you can only see 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.420
 I have three nails painted because I wanted 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.399
 show them how it looks in different 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.200
 colors is not because I will run out of 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.780
 enamel and will not reach me more 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.579
 nails but yes this is basically the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.899
 design so I recommend that you 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.700
 stay so they can learn to 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.650
 do what 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.420
 I'm going to start painting my nails with 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.040
 this transparent shine 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.440
 This is a brand that is manufactured here in 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.420
 my country you can use the one you want and 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.560
 will help me protect my nails and that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.560
 do not get yellow 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.380
 I'm going to use the mentor to see 'mello' 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.640
 ice and the greenwich sends the three are 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.920
 by sally hansen 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.729
 I will paint the first nail with the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.729
 ice veil 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.299
 and the second with the greenwich embi 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.350
 and the third with this color mind 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.720
 called sorbet mind 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.330
 and I'm going to let them dry very well for a 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.729
 and then I'm going to give him a coat of 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.770
 shine again before the brightness 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.470
 dry I will scatter the sugar by 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.360
 over for this to stay attached 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.119
 then I will remove the excess with a 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 brush I give a layer of brightness to 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.610
 prevent sugar from falling 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.150
 and that's how the three look after 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.150
 completed 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.439
 something they can do to prevent the 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.610
 sugar fall from the nails smear it is 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.830
 hair profiler 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.200
 that I could not include it in the part 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.300
 previous video because my spray 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.580
 unfortunately if the feet got damaged I 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.690
 come spray what was happening is that it 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.180
 fell on his head 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.269
 the bottle then you stayed straight like that 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.269
 is 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.709
 and it absolutely self all the spray and 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.510
 a mesh time to buy another bottle 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.519
 to make this video something that also 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.379
 maybe they ask you if the sugar is 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.140
 goes easily with water when 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.359
 mojan goes a little bit but not everything like that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.819

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.709
