810 biking computer so the routing
settings<00:00:11.810> are<00:00:11.930> found<00:00:12.170> in<00:00:12.320> your<00:00:12.350> activity

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:12.890 
settings are found in your activity

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.950 
settings are found in your activity
profiles<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:13.580> we're<00:00:13.670> going<00:00:13.760> to<00:00:13.850> go<00:00:13.940> in<00:00:14.030> tools

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
profiles so we're going to go in tools

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.820 
profiles so we're going to go in tools
and<00:00:15.580> then<00:00:16.580> activity<00:00:17.150> profiles<00:00:17.720> then<00:00:18.439> we<00:00:18.619> want

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
and then activity profiles then we want

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.190 
and then activity profiles then we want
to<00:00:18.950> choose<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.220> activity<00:00:19.910> profile<00:00:20.510> we<00:00:20.869> want

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
to choose the activity profile we want

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.100 
to choose the activity profile we want
to<00:00:21.410> change<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:22.010> route<00:00:22.220> settings<00:00:22.820> for<00:00:23.300> they're

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
to change the route settings for they're

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.779 
to change the route settings for they're
going<00:00:24.260> to<00:00:24.320> save<00:00:24.530> their<00:00:24.740> own<00:00:24.770> route<00:00:25.190> settings

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
going to save their own route settings

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.460 
going to save their own route settings
so<00:00:26.090> be<00:00:26.270> sure<00:00:26.300> to<00:00:26.570> choose<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:26.930> one<00:00:27.110> you'll<00:00:27.320> be

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
so be sure to choose the one you'll be

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.460 
so be sure to choose the one you'll be
using<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:28.460> I'm<00:00:28.640> going<00:00:28.789> to<00:00:28.850> select<00:00:29.080> race<00:00:30.080> for

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
using so I'm going to select race for

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.619 
using so I'm going to select race for
now<00:00:30.619> in<00:00:31.359> race<00:00:33.190> navigation<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.399> then<00:00:34.969> routing

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
now in race navigation and then routing

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.689 
now in race navigation and then routing
so<00:00:35.870> now<00:00:36.019> we<00:00:36.079> could<00:00:36.350> choose<00:00:36.679> the<00:00:36.859> way<00:00:37.039> the<00:00:37.280> unit

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
so now we could choose the way the unit

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.239 
so now we could choose the way the unit
routes<00:00:37.969> us<00:00:38.269> so<00:00:38.510> taking<00:00:38.899> us<00:00:39.019> down<00:00:39.199> roads<00:00:39.679> or

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:40.249 
routes us so taking us down roads or

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.419 
routes us so taking us down roads or
going<00:00:40.670> in<00:00:40.819> straight<00:00:41.089> lines<00:00:42.100> avoiding<00:00:43.100> Hills

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:43.429 
going in straight lines avoiding Hills

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:45.939 
going in straight lines avoiding Hills
and<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.059> on<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:44.659> first<00:00:45.079> option<00:00:45.589> we<00:00:45.710> have<00:00:45.920> is

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
and so on so first option we have is

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.450 
and so on so first option we have is
activity<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.329> we<00:00:47.839> can<00:00:48.139> do<00:00:48.409> direct<00:00:49.010> routing

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
activity so we can do direct routing

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.079 
activity so we can do direct routing
cycling<00:00:49.999> to<00:00:50.239> recycling<00:00:50.719> mountain<00:00:51.229> biking

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
cycling to recycling mountain biking

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.750 
cycling to recycling mountain biking
automobile<00:00:53.089> or<00:00:53.449> motorcycle<00:00:53.479> driving

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
automobile or motorcycle driving

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.459 
automobile or motorcycle driving
pedestrian<00:00:55.760> we<00:00:56.629> even<00:00:56.780> have<00:00:57.019> hiking

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
pedestrian we even have hiking

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.379 
pedestrian we even have hiking
mountaineering<00:00:58.010> in<00:00:58.280> here<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.670> ATV

00:00:59.379 --> 00:00:59.389 
mountaineering in here and ATV

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.270 
mountaineering in here and ATV
off-roading<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:00.649> each<00:01:00.829> one<00:01:00.979> of<00:01:01.100> these<00:01:01.159> are

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
off-roading so each one of these are

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.329 
off-roading so each one of these are
going<00:01:01.369> to<00:01:01.429> have<00:01:01.579> slightly<00:01:01.969> different<00:01:03.339> methods

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
going to have slightly different methods

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.480 
going to have slightly different methods
so<00:01:05.059> let's<00:01:05.239> back<00:01:05.479> out<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.810> here<00:01:06.370> we<00:01:07.370> have

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
so let's back out of here we have

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.030 
so let's back out of here we have
calculation<00:01:08.210> method<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.260> whether<00:01:09.680> it's<00:01:09.860> going

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
calculation method so whether it's going

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.220 
calculation method so whether it's going
to<00:01:10.130> choose<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:11.030> roads<00:01:11.270> based<00:01:11.630> on<00:01:11.870> minimum

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
to choose the roads based on minimum

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.700 
to choose the roads based on minimum
distance<00:01:12.800> or<00:01:13.010> minimum<00:01:13.790> time<00:01:14.410> you<00:01:15.410> could<00:01:15.560> also

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
distance or minimum time you could also

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.560 
distance or minimum time you could also
have<00:01:16.130> it<00:01:16.630> do<00:01:17.630> minimum<00:01:18.380> ascent<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:20.300> don't

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
have it do minimum ascent so you don't

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.690 
have it do minimum ascent so you don't
have<00:01:20.870> to<00:01:21.260> go<00:01:21.380> up<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.740> down<00:01:21.890> hills<00:01:22.190> all<00:01:22.550> the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
have to go up and down hills all the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.520 
have to go up and down hills all the
time<00:01:23.000> you're<00:01:23.840> probably<00:01:24.050> going<00:01:24.230> to<00:01:24.320> want<00:01:24.500> to

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
time you're probably going to want to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.280 
time you're probably going to want to
stay<00:01:24.830> on<00:01:25.190> a<00:01:25.220> flat<00:01:25.550> course<00:01:26.030> if<00:01:26.330> you're<00:01:27.110> riding

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
stay on a flat course if you're riding

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.500 
stay on a flat course if you're riding
your<00:01:27.530> bike<00:01:28.900> we<00:01:29.900> have<00:01:30.050> LOC<00:01:30.410> on<00:01:30.650> road<00:01:31.010> I

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
your bike we have LOC on road I

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.970 
your bike we have LOC on road I
recommend<00:01:32.510> everybody<00:01:32.900> leaves<00:01:33.200> lock<00:01:33.530> on<00:01:33.710> road

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
recommend everybody leaves lock on road

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.670 
recommend everybody leaves lock on road
to<00:01:34.250> know<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:35.240> reason<00:01:35.570> why<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:36.170> if<00:01:36.230> you<00:01:36.590> have

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
to know the reason why is if you have

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.370 
to know the reason why is if you have
two<00:01:36.920> parallel<00:01:37.250> roads<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:38.480> may<00:01:38.690> lock<00:01:39.020> you<00:01:39.200> to

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
two parallel roads it may lock you to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.400 
two parallel roads it may lock you to
the<00:01:39.500> wrong<00:01:39.770> road<00:01:40.990> there's<00:01:41.990> always<00:01:42.170> going<00:01:42.350> to

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
the wrong road there's always going to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.620 
the wrong road there's always going to
be<00:01:42.470> map<00:01:42.740> errors<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.220> GPS<00:01:43.610> errors<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.360> that's

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
be map errors and GPS errors so that's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.950 
be map errors and GPS errors so that's
why<00:01:45.020> also<00:01:45.890> if<00:01:46.520> you're<00:01:46.970> looking<00:01:47.000> for<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.600> point

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
why also if you're looking for a point

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.320 
why also if you're looking for a point
with<00:01:48.530> your<00:01:48.890> Garmin<00:01:49.340> Edge<00:01:49.460> 810<00:01:49.790> if<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.240> have

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
with your Garmin Edge 810 if you have

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.210 
with your Garmin Edge 810 if you have
lock<00:01:50.600> on<00:01:50.780> road<00:01:51.020> on<00:01:51.260> it<00:01:51.409> may<00:01:51.530> always<00:01:51.830> lock<00:01:52.070> you

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
lock on road on it may always lock you

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.800 
lock on road on it may always lock you
to<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.460> road<00:01:52.700> even<00:01:53.060> though<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.480> point<00:01:53.690> you're

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
to the road even though the point you're

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.200 
to the road even though the point you're
looking<00:01:53.900> for<00:01:54.260> is<00:01:54.320> not<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:54.830> that<00:01:55.250> closest<00:01:55.850> road

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
looking for is not on that closest road

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.970 
looking for is not on that closest road
so<00:01:56.900> you're<00:01:57.080> going<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.260> have<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.380> real<00:01:57.740> difficult

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
so you're going to have a real difficult

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.899 
so you're going to have a real difficult
time<00:01:58.400> finding<00:01:59.120> that<00:01:59.240> Waypoint<00:02:00.460> we<00:02:01.460> have<00:02:01.670> our

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
time finding that Waypoint we have our

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.719 
time finding that Waypoint we have our
avoidance<00:02:02.510> setup<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:03.860> could<00:02:04.220> use<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.520> to

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
avoidance setup so you could use this to
