to me it's the right timing i thought

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.350 
to me it's the right timing i thought
that<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.340> might<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:57.000> during<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that they might do one during the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760 
that they might do one during the
superbowl<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:58.079> might<00:00:58.260> still<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
superbowl they might still do a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.529 
superbowl they might still do a
different<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.190> during<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> Super<00:00:59.940> Bowl<00:01:00.000> so

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
different one during the Super Bowl so

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.060 
different one during the Super Bowl so
it<00:01:00.690> seems<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.199> well<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.710> Super<00:01:01.920> Bowl<00:01:01.980> is

it seems like well the Super Bowl is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.399 
it seems like well the Super Bowl is
almost<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.640> month<00:01:02.850> away<00:01:03.000> still<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:04.109> you<00:01:04.229> want

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
almost a month away still so if you want

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
shows just how wide of an appeal a movie

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
shows just how wide of an appeal a movie
