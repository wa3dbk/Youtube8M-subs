00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
out this new rod you know I've used it a

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.230 
out this new rod you know I've used it a
little<00:00:27.199> bit<00:00:27.440> it's<00:00:28.010> called<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.490> Dave<00:00:28.910> ganz

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
little bit it's called the Dave ganz

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.929 
little bit it's called the Dave ganz
fuller<00:00:29.689> combo<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:30.529> you<00:00:31.310> know<00:00:31.490> it<00:00:31.609> looks<00:00:31.789> like

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
fuller combo and you know it looks like

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.599 
fuller combo and you know it looks like
a<00:00:31.970> fly<00:00:32.329> reel<00:00:32.570> but<00:00:33.199> we're<00:00:33.500> not<00:00:33.649> casting<00:00:34.250> with<00:00:34.430> it

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:34.609 
a fly reel but we're not casting with it

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.299 
a fly reel but we're not casting with it
obviously<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:35.960> philosophy<00:00:36.590> behind<00:00:36.620> this<00:00:37.130> is

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
obviously the philosophy behind this is

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.440 
obviously the philosophy behind this is
that<00:00:38.230> it<00:00:39.230> eliminates<00:00:39.500> line<00:00:40.070> twists<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:40.790> when

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
that it eliminates line twists and when

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.120 
that it eliminates line twists and when
I'm<00:00:41.570> jigging<00:00:41.960> for<00:00:41.989> blue<00:00:42.260> gills<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:42.649> crappies

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
I'm jigging for blue gills and crappies

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.819 
I'm jigging for blue gills and crappies
when<00:00:43.309> I<00:00:43.340> stop<00:00:43.969> jigging<00:00:44.570> I<00:00:44.750> want<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.530> be<00:00:45.620> sure

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
when I stop jigging I want to be sure

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.319 
when I stop jigging I want to be sure
that<00:00:46.040> this<00:00:46.160> jig<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.579> gonna<00:00:46.760> sit<00:00:47.000> perfectly

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
that this jig is gonna sit perfectly

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.080 
that this jig is gonna sit perfectly
still<00:00:47.719> if<00:00:48.530> I'm<00:00:48.770> using<00:00:48.950> a<00:00:49.160> spinning<00:00:49.640> rod<00:00:49.790> or

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
still if I'm using a spinning rod or

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.090 
still if I'm using a spinning rod or
spinning<00:00:50.480> reel<00:00:50.629> every<00:00:51.350> time<00:00:51.590> that<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:51.829> closed

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
spinning reel every time that I closed

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.850 
spinning reel every time that I closed
the<00:00:52.309> Bale<00:00:52.550> using<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.480> reel<00:00:53.660> handle<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:54.500> puts<00:00:54.770> a

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
the Bale using the reel handle it puts a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.310 
the Bale using the reel handle it puts a
slight<00:00:55.129> twist<00:00:55.489> into<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.879> line<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.390> every

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
slight twist into the line and every

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.229 
slight twist into the line and every
time<00:00:57.559> that<00:00:57.590> I<00:00:57.890> set<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.370> hook<00:00:58.550> with<00:00:58.730> a<00:00:58.760> spinning

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
time that I set the hook with a spinning

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.840 
time that I set the hook with a spinning
reel<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.629> the<00:01:00.230> drag<00:01:00.500> starts<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.070> go<00:01:01.190> out<00:01:01.340> if<00:01:01.640> I

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
reel and the drag starts to go out if I

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.819 
reel and the drag starts to go out if I
crank<00:01:02.180> against<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:02.719> drag<00:01:03.110> it's<00:01:03.530> putting

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
crank against that drag it's putting

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.219 
crank against that drag it's putting
twists<00:01:04.159> in<00:01:04.309> my<00:01:04.460> line<00:01:04.699> with<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.390> spooler<00:01:05.719> combo

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
twists in my line with the spooler combo

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.849 
twists in my line with the spooler combo
it<00:01:06.759> eliminates<00:01:07.759> that<00:01:07.880> twist<00:01:08.359> and<00:01:08.770> helps<00:01:09.770> you

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
it eliminates that twist and helps you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:11.410 
it eliminates that twist and helps you
catch<00:01:10.039> some<00:01:10.249> of<00:01:10.279> those<00:01:10.429> lethargic<00:01:11.029> fish<00:01:11.240> so

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420

definitely going to be a hot item this

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.019 
definitely going to be a hot item this
winter<00:02:00.649> for<00:02:00.950> catching<00:02:01.219> more<00:02:01.369> big<00:02:01.579> blue<00:02:01.819> gills

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
and crappies using my vex lark I'm

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.429 
and crappies using my vex lark I'm
constantly<00:02:05.059> you<00:02:05.659> know<00:02:05.689> watching<00:02:06.259> how<00:02:06.380> the

constantly you know watching how the

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.400 
constantly you know watching how the
fish<00:02:06.709> behave<00:02:07.899> towards<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.020> way<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.319> I'm

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
fish behave towards the way that I'm

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.339 
fish behave towards the way that I'm
jigging<00:02:09.800> my<00:02:09.920> bait

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
jigging my bait

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.610 
jigging my bait
if<00:02:11.590> they're<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:13.450> I'm<00:02:13.659> jigging<00:02:14.019> too<00:02:14.140> hard<00:02:14.379> I<00:02:14.469> can

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
if they're if I'm jigging too hard I can

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.110 
if they're if I'm jigging too hard I can
tell<00:02:14.769> that<00:02:14.799> they're<00:02:15.069> moving<00:02:15.219> away<00:02:15.459> from<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:16.000> it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
tell that they're moving away from it it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.670 
tell that they're moving away from it it
looks<00:02:16.299> like<00:02:16.359> they're<00:02:16.599> going<00:02:16.780> down<00:02:17.079> but

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
looks like they're going down but

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.470 
looks like they're going down but
actually<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.430> fish<00:02:18.609> are<00:02:18.760> moving<00:02:18.879> away<00:02:19.209> from

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
actually the fish are moving away from

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.809 
actually the fish are moving away from
the<00:02:19.840> cone<00:02:20.019> of<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.200> transducer<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:21.609> looks

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
the cone of the transducer so it looks

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.009 
the cone of the transducer so it looks
like<00:02:21.879> they're<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.269> down<00:02:22.569> in<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.840> water

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
like they're going down in the water

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.780 
like they're going down in the water
column<00:02:23.349> but<00:02:23.890> they're<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.159> moving<00:02:24.370> away<00:02:24.609> from

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
column but they're just moving away from

column but they're just moving away from
my<00:02:25.060> bait<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:28.060> know<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.299> greatest<00:02:28.510> thing

my bait you know the greatest thing

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.809 
my bait you know the greatest thing
about<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.989> Vexilar<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.829> not<00:02:30.370> only<00:02:30.549> does<00:02:30.760> it

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
about a Vexilar is that not only does it

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.940 
about a Vexilar is that not only does it
show<00:02:30.939> you<00:02:31.150> where<00:02:31.390> there<00:02:31.540> are<00:02:31.629> fish<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.739> shows

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
show you where there are fish it shows

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.160 
show you where there are fish it shows
you<00:02:33.099> when<00:02:33.220> there's<00:02:33.400> not<00:02:33.549> fish<00:02:33.909> years<00:02:34.299> ago<00:02:34.599> we

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
you when there's not fish years ago we

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.379 
you when there's not fish years ago we
used<00:02:35.349> to<00:02:35.500> fish<00:02:35.739> drill<00:02:36.370> one<00:02:36.609> hole<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.150> sit

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:37.389 
used to fish drill one hole and sit

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:38.339 
used to fish drill one hole and sit
there<00:02:37.540> all<00:02:37.689> day<00:02:37.720> long

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
there all day long

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.170 
there all day long
and<00:02:38.859> you<00:02:39.159> wouldn't<00:02:39.430> know<00:02:39.519> if<00:02:39.670> anything<00:02:40.030> was

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
and you wouldn't know if anything was

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.720 
and you wouldn't know if anything was
below<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.569> you<00:02:40.719> would<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:42.010> might<00:02:42.219> assume

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
below you you would you you might assume

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.750 
below you you would you you might assume
that<00:02:42.900> maybe<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.079> had<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.409> wrong<00:02:44.560> bait<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.189> or

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
that maybe you had the wrong bait on or

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.300 
that maybe you had the wrong bait on or
maybe<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:47.200> know<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.439> fish<00:02:47.620> just<00:02:47.859> were<00:02:48.010> coming

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
maybe you know the fish just were coming

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.860 
maybe you know the fish just were coming
through<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.609> weren't<00:02:48.760> hungry<00:02:49.209> but<00:02:49.629> now<00:02:49.810> you

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
through and weren't hungry but now you

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.199 
through and weren't hungry but now you
actually<00:02:50.470> know<00:02:50.769> if<00:02:51.159> there's<00:02:51.579> fish<00:02:51.790> below<00:02:52.150> you

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
actually know if there's fish below you

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.839 
actually know if there's fish below you
and<00:02:52.540> that's<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.109> huge<00:02:53.319> asset<00:02:53.620> but<00:02:54.489> knowing<00:02:54.730> when

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
and that's a huge asset but knowing when

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.849 
and that's a huge asset but knowing when
there's<00:02:55.030> not<00:02:55.239> fish<00:02:55.569> below<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:55.900> then<00:02:56.620> he<00:02:56.739> can

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
there's not fish below you then he can

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.530 
there's not fish below you then he can
tell<00:02:57.040> if<00:02:57.099> it's<00:02:57.220> time<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.669> move<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.419> know

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
tell if it's time to move and you know

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.720 
tell if it's time to move and you know
what<00:02:58.720> I've<00:02:58.900> got<00:02:59.139> some<00:02:59.379> fish<00:02:59.590> down<00:02:59.799> here<00:02:59.859> but

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
what I've got some fish down here but

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.069 
what I've got some fish down here but
I'm<00:03:00.819> not<00:03:00.970> seeing<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.389> right<00:03:01.569> ones<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.989> I

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
I'm not seeing the right ones that I

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:16.740 
I'm not seeing the right ones that I
want<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.530> I<00:03:02.769> think<00:03:03.370> it's<00:03:03.489> time<00:03:03.639> to<00:03:03.819> move

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.569 

maybe<00:03:17.750> this<00:03:17.989> was<00:03:18.200> gonna<00:03:18.409> be<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.739> hot<00:03:18.950> spot<00:03:19.340> you

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
maybe this was gonna be the hot spot you

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.440 
maybe this was gonna be the hot spot you
know<00:03:20.000> we<00:03:20.299> drilled<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.959> whole<00:03:21.230> pile<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:22.180> grid<00:03:23.180> of

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
know we drilled a whole pile a grid of

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.559 
know we drilled a whole pile a grid of
holes<00:03:23.870> as<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.319> team<00:03:24.680> we<00:03:25.430> concentrated<00:03:26.180> on<00:03:26.299> a

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
holes as a team we concentrated on a

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.580 
holes as a team we concentrated on a
certain<00:03:26.959> structural<00:03:27.530> area<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:30.260> just<00:03:30.439> hop

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
certain structural area and you just hop

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.039 
certain structural area and you just hop
from<00:03:30.799> hole<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.040> hole<00:03:31.329> if<00:03:32.329> I'm<00:03:32.540> not<00:03:32.689> seeing<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
from hole to hole if I'm not seeing the

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.809 
from hole to hole if I'm not seeing the
right<00:03:33.170> fish<00:03:33.409> that<00:03:33.620> I<00:03:33.650> want<00:03:33.920> I<00:03:34.129> keep<00:03:34.430> moving

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
right fish that I want I keep moving

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.030 
right fish that I want I keep moving
constantly<00:03:35.120> moving<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.079> we'll<00:03:36.739> see<00:03:36.889> if<00:03:36.980> we

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
constantly moving and we'll see if we

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.410 
constantly moving and we'll see if we
can<00:03:37.189> get<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.340> big<00:03:37.489> one<00:03:37.670> here<00:03:37.819> there<00:03:38.299> we<00:03:38.480> go

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
can get a big one here there we go

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.569 
can get a big one here there we go
it's<00:03:41.420> not<00:03:41.629> the<00:03:41.810> big<00:03:41.959> one<00:03:45.099> but<00:03:46.099> it's<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.310> crappie

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
it's not the big one but it's a crappie

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.670 
it's not the big one but it's a crappie
you<00:03:47.419> know<00:03:47.510> that's<00:03:47.750> a<00:03:47.840> good<00:03:47.959> year<00:03:48.139> class<00:03:48.409> for

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
you know that's a good year class for

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.789 
you know that's a good year class for
the<00:03:48.769> future<00:03:49.159> we'll<00:03:49.760> let<00:03:49.909> that<00:03:50.060> one<00:03:50.269> back<00:03:50.799> but

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
the future we'll let that one back but
