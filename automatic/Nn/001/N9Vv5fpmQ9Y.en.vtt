up a lot of the time this pistol is

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.860 
up a lot of the time this pistol is
compared<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.780> Glock<00:00:25.020> 17<00:00:25.050> or<00:00:25.950> the<00:00:26.070> Glock<00:00:26.340> 19

compared to the Glock 17 or the Glock 19
even<00:00:27.870> though<00:00:27.990> those<00:00:28.290> two<00:00:28.350> are<00:00:29.040> great<00:00:29.400> weapons

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
even though those two are great weapons

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.829 
even though those two are great weapons
also<00:00:30.620> this<00:00:31.620> one<00:00:32.369> feels<00:00:32.940> better<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> hand

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:33.839 
also this one feels better in the hand

17 without Privia closer comparison and

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.880 
17 without Privia closer comparison and
see<00:00:46.440> which<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.859> feels<00:00:47.190> better<00:00:47.429> in<00:00:47.699> the<00:00:47.789> hand<00:00:48.030> I

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
see which one feels better in the hand I

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.709 
see which one feels better in the hand I
personally<00:00:49.890> don't<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.909> secondary

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
personally don't like this secondary

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.989 
personally don't like this secondary
safety<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.190> safe<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.640> has<00:00:53.819> to<00:00:53.909> be

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
safety so this safe this has to be

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.430 
safety so this safe this has to be
depressed<00:00:54.510> which<00:00:54.780> means<00:00:54.989> if<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.230> had<00:00:55.409> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
depressed which means if you had a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.380 
depressed which means if you had a
correct<00:00:55.949> grip<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.030> pulled<00:00:57.269> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
correct grip and then you pulled the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.139 
correct grip and then you pulled the
trigger<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:58.229> would<00:00:58.519> fire<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.699> weapon<00:00:59.999> when

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
trigger it would fire the weapon when

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.299 
trigger it would fire the weapon when
you<00:01:00.269> pulled<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.659> trigger<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:01.079> opposed<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.679> if

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
you pulled the trigger as opposed to if

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.250 
you pulled the trigger as opposed to if
you<00:01:02.579> were<00:01:02.670> holding<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.269> like<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.749> and<00:01:04.080> then

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
you were holding it like this and then

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260 
you were holding it like this and then
trying<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.620> pull<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> trigger<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.760> would<00:01:06.060> not

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
trying to pull the trigger it would not

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.230 
trying to pull the trigger it would not
fire<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.830> main<00:01:08.010> selling<00:01:08.310> point<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.760> got<00:01:09.000> me

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
fire the main selling point that got me

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.410 
fire the main selling point that got me
was<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.870> fact<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.410> at<00:01:11.040> nighttime<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.300> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
was the fact that at nighttime if you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.240 
was the fact that at nighttime if you
can't<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.840> anything<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.620> still<00:01:13.890> feel

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
can't see anything you can still feel

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.920 
can't see anything you can still feel
and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.030> would<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.300> able<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.480> feel<00:01:15.720> that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and then you would be able to feel that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.330 
and then you would be able to feel that
there<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> round<00:01:16.410> in<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.650> chamber<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:17.100> not

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
there is a round in the chamber or not

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.210 
there is a round in the chamber or not
and<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.960> striker<00:01:19.290> indicator<00:01:19.860> is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and that this striker indicator is

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.460 
and that this striker indicator is
popping<00:01:20.760> out<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.510> wouldn't<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.870> if

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
popping out so that you wouldn't know if

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.700 
popping out so that you wouldn't know if
it's<00:01:22.710> ready<00:01:22.980> to<00:01:23.100> fire<00:01:24.080> because<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.230> those<00:01:25.380> two

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it's ready to fire because of those two

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100 
it's ready to fire because of those two
facts<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.640> because<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.270> fact<00:01:27.480> that<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
facts and because of the fact that it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.510 
facts and because of the fact that it
feels<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.680> good<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.160> hand

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
feels so good in the hand

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.500 
feels so good in the hand
I<00:01:30.230> pretty<00:01:31.230> much<00:01:31.320> which<00:01:31.770> use<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.550> pistol<00:01:33.210> over

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
I pretty much which use this pistol over

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.040 
I pretty much which use this pistol over
that<00:01:33.870> of<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.170> Glock<00:01:34.970> disassembling<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.270> Glock<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
that of a Glock disassembling a Glock I

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.910 
that of a Glock disassembling a Glock I
think<00:01:37.260> is<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.410> little<00:01:37.680> bit<00:01:37.800> easier<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.940> this

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
think is a little bit easier but this

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.320 
think is a little bit easier but this
this<00:01:40.920> pistol<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.370> too<00:01:41.640> bad<00:01:41.790> either<00:01:42.000> you

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
this pistol is not too bad either you

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.790 
this pistol is not too bad either you
lock<00:01:43.050> it<00:01:43.200> back<00:01:44.060> put<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.210> thing<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:46.700> unlock

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
lock it back put this thing up unlock

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.670 
lock it back put this thing up unlock
pull<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.890> trigger<00:01:50.160> once<00:01:50.370> and<00:01:50.990> then<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
pull the trigger once and then the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.850 
pull the trigger once and then the
normal<00:01:53.270> removing<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:55.110> spring<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:55.770> then

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
normal removing the spring and then

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.660 
normal removing the spring and then
here's<00:01:56.160> your<00:01:56.310> barrel<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:58.670> it's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
here's your barrel so it's it's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.300 
here's your barrel so it's it's
essentially<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.270> same<00:02:00.300> thing<00:02:00.480> you<00:02:00.870> would<00:02:00.960> do

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
essentially the same thing you would do

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.910 
essentially the same thing you would do
with<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> Glock<00:02:02.730> except<00:02:04.490> like<00:02:05.490> after<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.300> put

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
with a Glock except like after you put

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.099 
with a Glock except like after you put
everything<00:02:07.920> back<00:02:08.189> together<00:02:08.629> you<00:02:09.629> still<00:02:09.929> have

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:10.109 
everything back together you still have

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.540 
everything back together you still have
to<00:02:10.229> lock<00:02:10.439> it<00:02:10.619> back<00:02:10.799> and<00:02:11.189> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
to lock it back and the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.700 
to lock it back and the
this<00:02:11.850> tab<00:02:12.120> down<00:02:12.420> as<00:02:12.780> opposed<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.440> Glock

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
this tab down as opposed to a Glock

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.560 
this tab down as opposed to a Glock
where<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.340> slide<00:02:14.880> everything<00:02:15.150> across

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
where you just slide everything across

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.610 
where you just slide everything across
and<00:02:15.840> you're<00:02:15.930> good<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.140> go

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
and you're good to go

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.530 
and you're good to go
but<00:02:17.070> then<00:02:17.250> again<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.760> Glock<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.030> would<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.450> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
but then again a Glock you would have to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.050 
but then again a Glock you would have to
hold<00:02:18.660> like<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.320> depress<00:02:20.220> two<00:02:20.550> little

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
hold like this and depress two little

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.750 
hold like this and depress two little
nubs<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.080> side<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.830> also<00:02:23.340> works

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
nubs on the side but that also works

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.360 
nubs on the side but that also works
fine<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:25.140> mainly<00:02:26.540> both<00:02:27.540> pistols<00:02:28.080> are<00:02:28.290> good<00:02:28.590> but

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
fine so mainly both pistols are good but

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.340 
fine so mainly both pistols are good but
you<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.510> see<00:02:30.780> which<00:02:31.020> one<00:02:31.050> feels

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
you just have to see which one feels

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.040 
you just have to see which one feels
better<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> hand<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.520> then<00:02:32.670> after<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.180> go

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
better in the hand and then after you go

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.840 
better in the hand and then after you go
out<00:02:34.350> shooting<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.010> little<00:02:35.250> bit<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.670> have<00:02:35.760> to

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
out shooting a little bit you have to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.780 
out shooting a little bit you have to
see<00:02:36.030> which<00:02:36.750> one<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.710> shoot<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.610> best

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
see which one you can shoot the best

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.510 
see which one you can shoot the best
with<00:02:39.000> most<00:02:39.300> accurately<00:02:39.930> with<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.340> one

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
with most accurately with and the one

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.220 
with most accurately with and the one
you<00:02:41.640> like<00:02:41.850> personally<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.020> like<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> XD<00:02:45.230> if

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
you like personally I like the XD if

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.560 
you like personally I like the XD if
you're<00:02:46.380> ever<00:02:46.470> pondering<00:02:47.100> getting<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:47.520> xd9<00:02:48.150> or

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
you're ever pondering getting in xd9 or

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.590 
you're ever pondering getting in xd9 or
an<00:02:48.720> XT<00:02:49.110> 9<00:02:49.380> m<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:50.670> might<00:02:50.880> want<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.120> consider<00:02:51.360> the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
an XT 9 m you might want to consider the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.300 
an XT 9 m you might want to consider the
fact<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.080> they<00:02:52.830> don't<00:02:53.490> have<00:02:55.010> they<00:02:56.010> only<00:02:56.130> have

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
fact that they don't have they only have

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.150 
fact that they don't have they only have
high-capacity<00:02:56.670> magazines<00:02:57.480> or<00:02:57.950> over<00:02:58.950> 10

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
high-capacity magazines or over 10

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.270 
high-capacity magazines or over 10
essentially<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.480> if<00:03:00.840> you're<00:03:01.050> going<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.530> go

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
essentially so if you're going to go

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.850 
essentially so if you're going to go
travel<00:03:02.970> or<00:03:03.210> live<00:03:03.990> in<00:03:04.350> somewhere<00:03:04.710> like

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
travel or live in somewhere like

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.060 
travel or live in somewhere like
California<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.910> isn't<00:03:06.180> very<00:03:06.330> gun<00:03:06.570> friendly

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
California that isn't very gun friendly

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.510 
California that isn't very gun friendly
the<00:03:08.070> xt9<00:03:08.670> M<00:03:09.210> does<00:03:09.600> not<00:03:09.750> have<00:03:10.020> mags<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:11.190> are

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
the xt9 M does not have mags that are

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.010 
the xt9 M does not have mags that are
legal<00:03:12.420> over<00:03:12.870> there<00:03:13.230> so
