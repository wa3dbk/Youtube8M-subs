key muscle involved in this action what

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.380 
key muscle involved in this action what
we<00:00:46.140> need<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> learn<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.760> start<00:00:48.210> from

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
we need to learn is how to start from

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.170 
we need to learn is how to start from
this<00:00:48.570> muscle<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.980> also<00:00:50.160> actually<00:00:50.430> improve<00:00:50.940> our

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
this muscle it also actually improve our

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.420 
this muscle it also actually improve our
performance<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.440> I'm<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> protect<00:00:53.190> us
