00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.349 
look I just I just think that I think
that<00:04:17.989> this<00:04:18.709> has<00:04:18.949> been<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.250> chance<00:04:19.609> for<00:04:19.940> Robert

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
that this has been a chance for Robert

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.020 
that this has been a chance for Robert
to<00:04:20.510> revisit<00:04:21.260> choices<00:04:21.769> that<00:04:21.919> he<00:04:22.070> made<00:04:22.280> early<00:04:22.820> on

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
to revisit choices that he made early on

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.600 
to revisit choices that he made early on
and<00:04:23.720> go<00:04:23.900> back<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.349> say<00:04:24.560> you<00:04:25.160> know<00:04:25.280> maybe<00:04:25.460> I

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
and go back and say you know maybe I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.950 
and go back and say you know maybe I
didn't<00:04:26.060> squeeze<00:04:26.300> enough<00:04:26.570> out<00:04:26.750> of<00:04:26.780> this

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
didn't squeeze enough out of this

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.870 
didn't squeeze enough out of this
character<00:04:27.410> maybe<00:04:27.620> there's<00:04:28.130> whole<00:04:28.550> things

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
character maybe there's whole things

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.070 
character maybe there's whole things
that<00:04:29.030> we

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
that we

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.439 
that we
there's<00:04:30.979> places<00:04:31.129> that<00:04:31.340> we<00:04:31.520> go<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.729> in<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.120> show

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
there's places that we go to in the show

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.570 
there's places that we go to in the show
and<00:04:32.780> characters<00:04:33.710> that<00:04:33.919> are<00:04:34.039> in<00:04:34.069> the<00:04:34.250> show<00:04:34.370> that

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
and characters that are in the show that

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.189 
and characters that are in the show that
aren't<00:04:34.789> in<00:04:34.849> the<00:04:34.879> comic<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.539> again<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.050> think

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
aren't in the comic and again I think

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.110 
aren't in the comic and again I think
it's<00:04:36.440> a<00:04:36.470> testament<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:37.069> the<00:04:37.610> collaborative

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
it's a testament to the collaborative

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.059 
it's a testament to the collaborative
nature<00:04:38.509> of<00:04:38.990> what<00:04:39.199> we're<00:04:39.349> trying<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.650> do<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.039> I

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
nature of what we're trying to do and I

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.070 
nature of what we're trying to do and I
mean<00:04:40.190> she<00:04:40.400> said<00:04:40.639> it<00:04:40.759> first<00:04:40.909> the<00:04:41.750> fact<00:04:41.990> that
