the performance today because again it
is<00:00:30.559> an<00:00:30.759> identically<00:00:32.019> problematic

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:33.019 
is an identically problematic

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.200 
is an identically problematic
performance<00:00:33.620> in<00:00:33.800> pretty<00:00:34.519> much<00:00:34.579> every<00:00:35.030> game

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210

I'm going to stop being a stubborn
little<00:01:01.220> goon<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.360> think<00:01:03.080> I'm<00:01:03.500> not<00:01:03.890> going<00:01:04.040> to

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
little goon and think I'm not going to

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.380 
little goon and think I'm not going to
play<00:01:04.220> him<00:01:04.400> there<00:01:04.549> because<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.939> doesn't<00:01:05.239> work

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
play him there because it doesn't work

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.030 
play him there because it doesn't work
and<00:01:05.630> he<00:01:05.720> kills<00:01:05.960> everything<00:01:06.380> that's<00:01:06.710> good<00:01:06.860> and

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
and he kills everything that's good and

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.190 
and he kills everything that's good and
I'll<00:01:07.400> explain<00:01:07.790> why<00:01:08.240> he<00:01:08.450> kills<00:01:08.720> everything

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
I'll explain why he kills everything

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.830 
I'll explain why he kills everything
that's<00:01:09.590> good<00:01:09.799> if<00:01:09.979> you're<00:01:10.460> playing<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:10.850> 423<00:01:11.600> one

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
that's good if you're playing a 423 one

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.050 
that's good if you're playing a 423 one
which<00:01:12.170> we<00:01:12.380> are<00:01:12.650> you<00:01:13.280> need<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.670> center

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
which we are you need that center

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.940 
which we are you need that center
forward<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.479> be<00:01:14.570> able<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.930> create<00:01:15.079> space<00:01:15.650> and

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
forward to be able to create space and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.410 
forward to be able to create space and
you<00:01:16.250> need<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.490> be<00:01:16.579> able<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.820> get<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.030> ball<00:01:17.210> to

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
you need to be able to get the ball to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.270 
you need to be able to get the ball to
act<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.840> him<00:01:17.990> at<00:01:18.170> angles<00:01:18.590> where<00:01:18.829> you<00:01:18.920> can<00:01:19.070> link

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
act to him at angles where you can link

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.059 
act to him at angles where you can link
in<00:01:19.520> or<00:01:19.850> get<00:01:20.119> a<00:01:20.179> shot<00:01:20.420> on<00:01:20.450> goal<00:01:20.539> you<00:01:21.469> need<00:01:21.710> width

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
in or get a shot on goal you need width

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.459 
in or get a shot on goal you need width
essentially<00:01:22.909> you<00:01:23.149> need<00:01:23.299> width<00:01:23.630> because<00:01:24.319> if

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
essentially you need width because if

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:25.870 
essentially you need width because if
you<00:01:24.590> have<00:01:24.770> width<00:01:25.069> it<00:01:25.249> means<00:01:25.429> that<00:01:25.579> the<00:01:25.700> two

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
you have width it means that the two

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.999 
you have width it means that the two
centre-backs<00:01:26.329> have<00:01:26.749> to<00:01:26.899> cover<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.710> side<00:01:27.979> of

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
centre-backs have to cover the side of

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.190 
centre-backs have to cover the side of
the<00:01:28.549> full-back<00:01:28.939> whichever<00:01:29.479> side<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.840> ball<00:01:30.020> is

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
the full-back whichever side the ball is

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.099 
the full-back whichever side the ball is
up<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:30.829> if<00:01:31.189> the<00:01:31.340> ball<00:01:31.520> is<00:01:31.549> at<00:01:31.850> Ramsey<00:01:32.600> side<00:01:32.869> for

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
up so if the ball is at Ramsey side for

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.800 
up so if the ball is at Ramsey side for
example<00:01:33.590> if<00:01:33.889> it<00:01:34.340> was<00:01:34.520> up<00:01:34.880> say<00:01:35.119> Chamberlain<00:01:35.719> on

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
example if it was up say Chamberlain on

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.749 
example if it was up say Chamberlain on
the<00:01:35.929> left<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.740> centre-back<00:01:37.280> would<00:01:37.490> have<00:01:37.639> to

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
the left the centre-back would have to

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.370 
the left the centre-back would have to
cover<00:01:37.999> the<00:01:38.149> fall<00:01:38.359> back<00:01:38.569> and<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:38.990> creates

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
cover the fall back and that creates

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.200 
cover the fall back and that creates
space<00:01:39.560> in<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.039> middle<00:01:40.310> for<00:01:40.490> sure<00:01:40.549> ooh<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:41.060> play

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
space in the middle for sure ooh to play

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.690 
space in the middle for sure ooh to play
around<00:01:41.479> with<00:01:41.780> if<00:01:42.069> Ramsey<00:01:43.069> is<00:01:43.189> on<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.520> left
