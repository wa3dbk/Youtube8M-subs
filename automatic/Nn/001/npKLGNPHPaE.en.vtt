first I've got my tofu and yes tofu is a
fantastic<00:00:42.540> source<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.079> nutrition<00:00:45.620> well

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
fantastic source of nutrition well

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.040 
fantastic source of nutrition well
particularly<00:00:47.070> protein<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.570> people<00:00:48.989> who

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
particularly protein for people who

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.590 
particularly protein for people who
don't<00:00:49.320> eat<00:00:49.559> meat<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.120> slice<00:00:51.390> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
don't eat meat so you just slice this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.290 
don't eat meat so you just slice this
tofu<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.199> into<00:00:52.440> blocks<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:55.699> I'm<00:00:56.699> using<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
tofu up into blocks and I'm using a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.329 
tofu up into blocks and I'm using a
ceramic<00:00:57.780> pan<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.559> my<00:00:58.710> stir<00:00:58.949> frying<00:00:59.219> with

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.920 

I'm<00:01:05.339> aware<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.880> lot<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.180> tofu<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.570> this

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
I'm aware that's a lot of tofu that this

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.690 
I'm aware that's a lot of tofu that this
is<00:01:07.140> probably<00:01:07.500> gonna<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.770> my<00:01:08.070> highest<00:01:08.460> protein

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
is probably gonna be my highest protein

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.899 
is probably gonna be my highest protein
meal<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> day<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.460> gonna<00:01:11.580> eat

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
full of cooks I'm not a fantastic show

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.510 
full of cooks I'm not a fantastic show
it<00:01:21.689> myself<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.439> further<00:01:22.799> clothes<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.310> easy

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
it myself but further clothes are easy

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.670 
it myself but further clothes are easy
to<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.869> yourself<00:01:25.250> just<00:01:26.250> smash<00:01:26.520> them<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.759> that

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
to do yourself just smash them like that

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.219 
to do yourself just smash them like that
take<00:01:28.680> your<00:01:28.710> knife<00:01:28.890> smash<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.229> that

take your knife smash them and that

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.810 
take your knife smash them and that
shell<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.770> peels<00:01:32.070> away<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:35.070> again<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.490> am<00:01:35.670> by

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
shell just peels away and again I am by

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.060 
shell just peels away and again I am by
no<00:01:36.030> means<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> particularly<00:01:36.990> good<00:01:37.470> chef

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
no means of a particularly good chef

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
no means of a particularly good chef
so<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.329> don't<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.020> beautifully<00:01:40.530> as

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
so I don't do this as beautifully as

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.510 
so I don't do this as beautifully as
someone<00:01:41.070> who's<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.579> good<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:41.939> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.260 

they<00:01:48.520> just<00:01:48.760> dice<00:01:48.970> them<00:01:49.000> up

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.190 

you<00:01:55.750> throw<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.229> into<00:01:56.469> the<00:01:56.560> mix<00:02:00.929> she<00:02:01.929> probably

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
you throw that into the mix she probably

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.380 
you throw that into the mix she probably
turned<00:02:02.590> my<00:02:02.740> water<00:02:02.979> up<00:02:03.189> on<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.060> what<00:02:04.270> I'm

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
turned my water up on this and what I'm

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.819 
turned my water up on this and what I'm
using<00:02:04.420> right<00:02:04.840> now<00:02:04.899> something<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.619> see

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
using right now something that you see

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.950 
using right now something that you see
salt<00:02:06.130> but<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.340> lot<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.549> times<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.820> user<00:02:06.969> reduce<00:02:07.450> or

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
salt but a lot of times a user reduce or

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.479 
salt but a lot of times a user reduce or
reduce<00:02:08.110> sodium<00:02:08.649> salt<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.129> so<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.340> we're

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
reduce sodium salt and so that we're

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.070 
reduce sodium salt and so that we're
looking<00:02:09.759> for<00:02:10.000> as<00:02:10.179> far<00:02:10.390> as<00:02:10.569> fluid<00:02:10.959> balance

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
looking for as far as fluid balance

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.009 
looking for as far as fluid balance
sometimes<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.420> balance<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.569> sodium<00:02:13.870> or

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
sometimes is a balance of sodium or

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.940 
sometimes is a balance of sodium or
potassium<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:15.489> is<00:02:15.610> 50%<00:02:15.940> potassium<00:02:16.840> salt<00:02:17.140> so

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
potassium this is 50% potassium salt so

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.000 

I<00:03:12.610> used<00:03:13.360> like<00:03:13.570> a<00:03:13.600> sweet<00:03:14.050> chilli<00:03:14.500> sauce<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.920> I

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
I used like a sweet chilli sauce that I

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.710 
I used like a sweet chilli sauce that I
also<00:03:15.160> get<00:03:15.460> from<00:03:15.610> an<00:03:15.730> Asian<00:03:15.850> shop<00:03:16.330> for<00:03:16.570> this

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
also get from an Asian shop for this

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.600 
also get from an Asian shop for this
sometimes<00:03:17.170> they<00:03:17.290> use<00:03:17.470> soy<00:03:17.680> sauce<00:03:18.040> but<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:18.490> is

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
sometimes they use soy sauce but this is

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.830 
sometimes they use soy sauce but this is
what<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:18.760> want<00:03:19.030> today<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.300> don't<00:03:19.420> really<00:03:19.630> like

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
what I want today I don't really like

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.020

the<00:03:19.960> soy<00:03:20.170> sauce<00:03:20.290> won't<00:03:20.710> come<00:03:20.890> through<00:03:24.030> now

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
the soy sauce won't come through now

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.880 
the soy sauce won't come through now
this<00:03:25.210> is<00:03:25.360> relatively<00:03:25.870> high<00:03:26.110> in<00:03:26.320> sugar<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:26.860> you

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
this is relatively high in sugar so you

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.590 
this is relatively high in sugar so you
do<00:03:27.100> need<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.310> get<00:03:27.490> an<00:03:27.610> idea<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.000> about<00:03:28.270> how<00:03:28.390> much

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
do need to get an idea of about how much

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.320 
do need to get an idea of about how much
you<00:03:28.720> put<00:03:28.930> in<00:03:29.050> something<00:03:29.290> like<00:03:29.470> this<00:03:30.330> because

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
you put in something like this because

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.920 
you put in something like this because
the<00:03:31.570> calories<00:03:31.780> can<00:03:32.200> add<00:03:32.350> up<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:36.780> then<00:03:37.780> I<00:03:37.810> have

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
the calories can add up and then I have

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.380 
the calories can add up and then I have
here<00:03:38.260> in<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.500> microwave<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:39.940> use<00:03:40.150> frozen
