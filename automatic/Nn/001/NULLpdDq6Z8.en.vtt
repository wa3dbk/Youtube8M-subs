by strand by strand that Hardware closed
for<00:04:17.109> several<00:04:17.260> reasons<00:04:17.560> one<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:18.010> which<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.280> jump

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
for several reasons one of which is jump

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.469 
for several reasons one of which is jump
see<00:04:20.109> here<00:04:20.350> they<00:04:20.620> stripping<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.479> another

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
see here they stripping it another

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.870 
see here they stripping it another
reason<00:04:22.780> is<00:04:23.110> is<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.410> felt<00:04:23.979> this<00:04:24.159> hardware<00:04:24.640> cloth

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
reason is is I felt this hardware cloth

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.370

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
up better than the bottom did I keep

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.710 
up better than the bottom did I keep
saying<00:04:51.100> bottom<00:04:51.580> because<00:04:51.910> of<00:04:52.090> members<00:04:52.390> upside

down<00:04:52.950> but<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.610> these<00:04:55.270> right<00:04:55.510> here<00:04:55.540> this<00:04:55.930> is<00:04:56.080> a

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
down but and these right here this is a

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.710 
down but and these right here this is a
great<00:04:56.410> off<00:04:56.650> of<00:04:56.800> an<00:04:56.920> air<00:04:57.070> conditioned<00:04:57.720> shrouds

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
great off of an air conditioned shrouds

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.040 
great off of an air conditioned shrouds
and<00:04:59.140> we<00:04:59.620> just<00:04:59.860> cut<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.220> up<00:05:00.400> then<00:05:01.120> wrap<00:05:01.330> wire<00:05:01.750> on

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
and we just cut it up then wrap wire on

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.230 
and we just cut it up then wrap wire on
it<00:05:02.200> and<00:05:02.320> they<00:05:02.410> doors<00:05:02.760> so<00:05:03.760> it<00:05:03.850> turned<00:05:04.090> out

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
it and they doors so it turned out

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.360 
it and they doors so it turned out
pretty<00:05:04.450> well<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:05.050> like<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:06.040> idea<00:05:06.720> but<00:05:08.370> years

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
pretty well I like that idea but years

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.940 
pretty well I like that idea but years
ago<00:05:09.640> we<00:05:09.880> used<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.900> go<00:05:11.050> to<00:05:11.110> chicken<00:05:11.500> phones<00:05:11.710> or

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
ago we used to go to chicken phones or

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.580 
ago we used to go to chicken phones or
they'd<00:05:12.100> producing<00:05:13.030> chicken<00:05:13.360> eggs<00:05:13.540> we<00:05:14.320> take

their pins that they want to switch out

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.710 
their pins that they want to switch out
and<00:05:18.250> we'd<00:05:18.370> modify<00:05:18.850> them<00:05:19.090> that's<00:05:19.419> a<00:05:19.570> lot<00:05:19.690> of

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
and we'd modify them that's a lot of

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.990 
and we'd modify them that's a lot of
work<00:05:19.930> just<00:05:20.260> about<00:05:20.890> as<00:05:21.070> much<00:05:21.220> work<00:05:21.490> building
