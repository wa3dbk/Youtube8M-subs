00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
two walls that could really help me out

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.179 
two walls that could really help me out
and<00:01:21.180> then<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.780> Blastoise<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> rapid

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
and then I have Blastoise for a rapid

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.219 
and then I have Blastoise for a rapid
spin<00:01:23.340> support<00:01:23.640> now<00:01:23.790> my<00:01:23.939> opponent<00:01:24.030> has<00:01:24.330> force

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
spin support now my opponent has force

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.980 
spin support now my opponent has force

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
are definitely for things that have to

watch out Snorlax in cod4 gregus really

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.310 
watch out Snorlax in cod4 gregus really
shouldn't<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.869> big<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.110> an<00:01:37.229> issue

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
shouldn't be that big of an issue

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260 
shouldn't be that big of an issue
because<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.920> mean<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.520> Sableye<00:01:39.090> which

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
because I mean I have Sableye which

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.760 
because I mean I have Sableye which
could<00:01:39.479> potentially<00:01:39.570> stall<00:01:40.140> them<00:01:40.290> both<00:01:40.500> out

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
could potentially stall them both out

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.499 
could potentially stall them both out
but<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> main<00:01:41.640> threats<00:01:41.939> are<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.390> as

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
but the main threats are going to be as

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.789 
but the main threats are going to be as
for<00:01:42.750> heavy<00:01:42.899> hitters<00:01:43.170> hopefully<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.649> work

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
for heavy hitters hopefully I can work

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.260 
for heavy hitters hopefully I can work
around<00:01:43.860> those<00:01:44.220> guys<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.670> pull<00:01:45.090> out<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
around those guys and pull out the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.429 
around those guys and pull out the
victory<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.750> guess<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
victory but I guess you just have to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.630 
victory but I guess you just have to
wait<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.590> find<00:01:46.710> out<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.159> let's<00:01:47.369> get<00:01:47.460> right

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
wait and find out so let's get right

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940 
wait and find out so let's get right
into<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.939> battle<00:01:48.380> he's<00:01:49.380> gonna<00:01:49.500> lead<00:01:49.680> off<00:01:49.799> with

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
into the battle he's gonna lead off with

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.469 
into the battle he's gonna lead off with
a<00:01:50.009> man<00:01:50.159> shell<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.670> will<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.909> living<00:01:51.030> off<00:01:51.270> for

a man shell as I will be living off for

a man shell as I will be living off for
my<00:01:51.570> sable<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.229> reason<00:01:52.470> why

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
my sable and the reason why

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.230 
my sable and the reason why
Sableye<00:01:53.439> was<00:01:53.619> because<00:01:53.950> Sableye<00:01:54.820> can<00:01:55.030> pretty

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
Sableye was because Sableye can pretty

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.539 
Sableye was because Sableye can pretty
much<00:01:55.360> stall<00:01:55.930> out<00:01:56.140> his<00:01:56.320> entire<00:01:56.710> team<00:01:57.100> whose<00:01:57.369> go

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
much stall out his entire team whose go

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.210 
much stall out his entire team whose go
for<00:01:57.759> Louis<00:01:58.119> Vuitton<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.780> recover<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.950> really

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
for Louis Vuitton and recover it really

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.859 
for Louis Vuitton and recover it really
doesn't<00:02:00.490> matter<00:02:00.549> because<00:02:00.790> his<00:02:00.970> team<00:02:01.180> doesn't

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
doesn't matter because his team doesn't

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.270 
doesn't matter because his team doesn't
really<00:02:02.020> have<00:02:02.170> anything<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.619> can<00:02:02.649> one<00:02:02.920> hit<00:02:03.100> KO

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280

and what I'm gonna do here is actually
go<00:02:15.190> for<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> foul<00:02:15.580> play<00:02:15.790> now<00:02:16.030> yes<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.510> do<00:02:16.840> know

go for the foul play now yes I do know

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.620 
go for the foul play now yes I do know
that<00:02:17.430> cop<00:02:18.430> Rodriguez<00:02:18.819> does<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.360> ammonia

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
that cop Rodriguez does have the ammonia

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.630 
that cop Rodriguez does have the ammonia
ability<00:02:20.019> but<00:02:20.230> as<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.470> saw<00:02:20.620> stabilize<00:02:21.130> faster

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
ability but as you saw stabilize faster

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.920 
ability but as you saw stabilize faster
than<00:02:21.760> coffee<00:02:21.940> trees<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.510> really<00:02:22.720> doesn't

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
than coffee trees so it really doesn't

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.140 
than coffee trees so it really doesn't
matter<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.590> I'm<00:02:24.550> this<00:02:24.790> point<00:02:25.000> I'm<00:02:25.090> pretty

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
matter and I'm this point I'm pretty

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.130 
matter and I'm this point I'm pretty
sure<00:02:25.390> he's<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:25.540> trying<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.810> get<00:02:25.959> as<00:02:26.019> much

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
sure he's just trying to get as much

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.330 
sure he's just trying to get as much
damage<00:02:26.380> off<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.769> my<00:02:26.830> stable<00:02:27.130> as<00:02:27.250> possible

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
damage off on my stable as possible

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.580 
damage off on my stable as possible
because<00:02:27.819> he<00:02:28.030> knows<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:29.080> big<00:02:29.410> threat

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
because he knows that it is a big threat

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.530 
because he knows that it is a big threat
to<00:02:29.860> his<00:02:29.980> team<00:02:30.220> so<00:02:30.489> I'm<00:02:30.850> gonna<00:02:31.030> go<00:02:31.180> for<00:02:31.299> recover

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
to his team so I'm gonna go for recover

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.910 
to his team so I'm gonna go for recover
just<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.840> get<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.080> extra<00:02:32.170> burn<00:02:32.440> damage<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.890> I

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
just to get the extra burn damage and I

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.289 
just to get the extra burn damage and I
wanted<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.250> take<00:02:33.400> too<00:02:33.640> much<00:02:33.760> for<00:02:33.940> Shadow<00:02:34.120> Ball

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
wanted to take too much for Shadow Ball

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.020 
wanted to take too much for Shadow Ball
and<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:35.140> he<00:02:35.590> ends<00:02:35.890> up<00:02:35.980> getting<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.519> crit<00:02:37.000> and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
and then he ends up getting a crit and

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.380 
and then he ends up getting a crit and
that<00:02:37.450> completely<00:02:38.380> did<00:02:38.830> matter<00:02:39.130> because<00:02:39.580> as<00:02:39.760> I

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
that completely did matter because as I

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.390 
that completely did matter because as I
said<00:02:40.450> Sableye<00:02:41.319> can<00:02:41.590> pretty<00:02:41.739> much<00:02:41.830> stall<00:02:42.220> out

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
said Sableye can pretty much stall out

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.759 
said Sableye can pretty much stall out
his<00:02:42.549> entire<00:02:42.850> team<00:02:43.120> above<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.720> Sableye<00:02:44.560> was

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
his entire team above that Sableye was

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.370 
his entire team above that Sableye was
the<00:02:44.980> number<00:02:45.519> one<00:02:45.549> check<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.360> had<00:02:46.630> for<00:02:46.989> that<00:02:47.140> man

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
the number one check I had for that man

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.840 
the number one check I had for that man
shell<00:02:47.620> which<00:02:47.799> has<00:02:48.010> now<00:02:48.190> become<00:02:48.400> an<00:02:48.670> even

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
shell which has now become an even

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.240 
shell which has now become an even
bigger<00:02:49.510> problem<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.680> Fallen<00:02:51.010> train<00:02:51.130> is

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
bigger problem and the Fallen train is

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.530 
bigger problem and the Fallen train is
going<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.430> be<00:02:51.519> able<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.760> finish<00:02:51.910> me<00:02:52.180> off<00:02:52.209> with

if i had gone for the recoveries they

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.720 
if i had gone for the recoveries they

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
thunderbolt and then getting off hero

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.020 
thunderbolt and then getting off hero
louis<00:03:10.930> on<00:03:11.079> me<00:03:11.290> or<00:03:11.470> going<00:03:11.709> for<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.220> shadow<00:03:12.850> ball

louis on me or going for the shadow ball
so<00:03:13.570> thinking<00:03:14.109> that<00:03:14.260> he's<00:03:14.380> going<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.590> bring<00:03:14.769> in

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
so thinking that he's going to bring in

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.500 
so thinking that he's going to bring in
the<00:03:15.100> zapdos<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.850> excellence<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.239> bringing

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
the zapdos the excellence of bringing

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.250 
the zapdos the excellence of bringing
dementia<00:03:17.019> which<00:03:17.170> has<00:03:17.350> me<00:03:17.500> thinking<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.799> may

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
dementia which has me thinking that may

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.070 
dementia which has me thinking that may
Zapdos<00:03:18.830> doesn't<00:03:19.220> carry<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.879> heat<00:03:20.360> wave<00:03:20.510> so

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
Zapdos doesn't carry a heat wave so

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.509 
Zapdos doesn't carry a heat wave so
knowing<00:03:21.439> the<00:03:21.530> fake-out<00:03:21.799> is<00:03:21.950> very<00:03:22.099> obvious<00:03:22.250> i'm

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
knowing the fake-out is very obvious i'm

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.890 
knowing the fake-out is very obvious i'm
gonna<00:03:22.670> switch<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.939> the<00:03:23.000> Cabal<00:03:23.239> i'm<00:03:23.450> switching

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
gonna switch to the Cabal i'm switching

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.240 
gonna switch to the Cabal i'm switching
to<00:03:24.019> my<00:03:24.170> black<00:03:24.409> so<00:03:24.620> she's<00:03:24.799> saying<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.099> high

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
to my black so she's saying the high

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
jump kick because i'm max offense max HP

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.780 
jump kick because i'm max offense max HP
but<00:03:27.769> you're<00:03:28.250> going<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.430> see<00:03:28.579> that<00:03:28.760> I

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
but you're going to see that I

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.300 
but you're going to see that I
completely<00:03:29.420> underestimated<00:03:29.900> our<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:31.099> man

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
completely underestimated our of man

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.580 
completely underestimated our of man
shell<00:03:31.640> so<00:03:32.239> he<00:03:32.480> turns<00:03:32.840> out<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.110> zapdos<00:03:33.439> now

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
shell so he turns out to zapdos now

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.569 
shell so he turns out to zapdos now
obviously<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.040> don't<00:03:34.129> want<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.430> take<00:03:34.549> it

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
obviously I don't want to take it

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:35.710 
obviously I don't want to take it
Thunderbolt<00:03:35.120> because<00:03:35.299> i'm<00:03:35.480> visiting

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
Thunderbolt because i'm visiting

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.300 
Thunderbolt because i'm visiting
defensive<00:03:36.260> that<00:03:36.379> specially<00:03:36.769> defensive<00:03:37.159> so<00:03:37.280> i

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
defensive that specially defensive so i

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.039 
defensive that specially defensive so i
can't<00:03:37.579> stay<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.090> go<00:03:38.209> for<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.390> toxic<00:03:38.840> and

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
can't stay in and go for the toxic and

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.720 
can't stay in and go for the toxic and
also<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.590> might<00:03:39.829> go<00:03:39.980> for<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.190> substitute<00:03:40.610> so

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
also you might go for the substitute so

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.250 
also you might go for the substitute so
switching<00:03:40.970> into<00:03:41.209> my<00:03:41.390> own<00:03:41.510> brown<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.840> basically

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
switching into my own brown is basically

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.020 
switching into my own brown is basically
the<00:03:42.379> best<00:03:42.560> thing<00:03:42.860> that<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.340> have<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.760> deal<00:03:43.909> with

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
the best thing that I have to deal with

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.089 
the best thing that I have to deal with
the<00:03:44.120> zapdos<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.690> like<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.409> next<00:03:45.560> ten<00:03:45.859> turns

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
the zapdos in like the next ten turns

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.710 
the zapdos in like the next ten turns
are<00:03:46.280> pretty<00:03:46.519> much<00:03:46.670> me<00:03:46.909> just<00:03:47.150> stalling<00:03:47.420> or

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
are pretty much me just stalling or

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.599 
are pretty much me just stalling or
trying<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.290> stall<00:03:48.470> him<00:03:48.620> out<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.430> finally

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
trying to stall him out and it finally

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.339 
trying to stall him out and it finally
clicked<00:03:49.939> in<00:03:50.060> my<00:03:50.209> mind<00:03:50.239> that<00:03:50.540> when<00:03:51.049> he<00:03:51.170> goes

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
clicked in my mind that when he goes

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.690 
clicked in my mind that when he goes
through<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.620> roof<00:03:51.769> I<00:03:51.950> can<00:03:52.159> use<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.310> free

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
through the roof I can use that free

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.069 
through the roof I can use that free
turn<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.120> switch<00:03:53.239> out<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.629> mark<00:03:53.810> your<00:03:53.900> man

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
turn the switch out to mark your man

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.630 
turn the switch out to mark your man
attend<00:03:54.349> but<00:03:54.500> I'm<00:03:54.620> thinking<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.159> when<00:03:55.549> he

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
attend but I'm thinking that when he

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.800 
attend but I'm thinking that when he
does<00:03:55.879> go<00:03:56.060> for<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.329> group's<00:03:56.510> he's<00:03:56.690> actually

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
does go for the group's he's actually

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.330 
does go for the group's he's actually
going<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.109> predict<00:03:57.440> my<00:03:57.590> switch<00:03:57.950> into<00:03:58.190> their

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
going to predict my switch into their

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.949 
going to predict my switch into their
men<00:03:58.519> attending<00:03:58.909> go<00:03:59.060> for<00:03:59.269> Thunderbolt<00:03:59.690> ooh<00:03:59.810> ho

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
men attending go for Thunderbolt ooh ho

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.839 
men attending go for Thunderbolt ooh ho
co-chairman<00:04:00.440> of<00:04:00.470> 10<00:04:00.709> which<00:04:01.220> is<00:04:01.250> why<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.549> just

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
co-chairman of 10 which is why I just

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.670 
co-chairman of 10 which is why I just
keep<00:04:02.060> staying<00:04:02.299> in<00:04:02.599> and<00:04:02.810> keep<00:04:03.200> going<00:04:03.440> for<00:04:03.590> the

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
keep staying in and keep going for the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.619 
keep staying in and keep going for the
foul<00:04:03.859> play<00:04:04.129> in<00:04:04.310> which<00:04:04.489> combination<00:04:05.090> but<00:04:05.480> it

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
foul play in which combination but it

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.800 
foul play in which combination but it
finally<00:04:05.810> uh<00:04:06.530> clicks<00:04:07.280> in<00:04:07.459> my<00:04:07.519> mind<00:04:07.819> that<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:08.239> can

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
finally uh clicks in my mind that I can

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.869 
finally uh clicks in my mind that I can
just<00:04:09.049> do<00:04:09.769> that<00:04:10.040> because<00:04:10.220> he<00:04:10.430> just<00:04:10.609> keeps<00:04:10.760> going

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
just do that because he just keeps going

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.369 
just do that because he just keeps going
for<00:04:11.120> roofs<00:04:11.269> he's<00:04:11.450> not<00:04:11.599> trying<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:11.959> predict<00:04:12.260> my

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
for roofs he's not trying to predict my

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:13.960 
for roofs he's not trying to predict my
demand<00:04:12.709> time<00:04:12.889> switching<00:04:13.190> at<00:04:13.310> all<00:04:13.459> when<00:04:13.909> he

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
demand time switching at all when he

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.729 
demand time switching at all when he
needs<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.269> go<00:04:14.389> for<00:04:14.569> us<00:04:14.690> he<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:14.989> going<00:04:15.200> for<00:04:15.319> ruse

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
needs to go for us he is going for ruse

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.890 
needs to go for us he is going for ruse
so<00:04:16.280> this<00:04:16.459> turn<00:04:16.669> I<00:04:16.910> finally<00:04:17.419> make<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.690> switch

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
so this turn I finally make the switch

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.509 
so this turn I finally make the switch
enter<00:04:18.289> my<00:04:18.380> dimension<00:04:18.889> which<00:04:19.070> is<00:04:19.280> what<00:04:19.489> I

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
enter my dimension which is what I

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.250 
enter my dimension which is what I
should<00:04:19.729> have<00:04:19.760> done<00:04:19.850> a<00:04:20.150> couple<00:04:20.479> turns<00:04:20.810> ago<00:04:21.049> and

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
should have done a couple turns ago and

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.360 
should have done a couple turns ago and
never<00:04:21.380> would<00:04:21.560> have<00:04:21.590> made<00:04:21.709> this<00:04:21.859> battle<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.160> lot

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
never would have made this battle a lot

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.830 
never would have made this battle a lot
shorter<00:04:22.729> but<00:04:23.000> it<00:04:23.330> really<00:04:23.510> doesn't<00:04:23.720> matter

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
shorter but it really doesn't matter

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.210 
shorter but it really doesn't matter
because<00:04:24.080> now<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.349> can<00:04:24.470> freely<00:04:24.800> bring<00:04:25.010> into<00:04:25.190> our

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
because now I can freely bring into our

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.589 
because now I can freely bring into our
man<00:04:25.370> attending<00:04:25.699> something<00:04:25.880> on<00:04:26.090> his<00:04:26.180> team<00:04:26.419> is

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
man attending something on his team is

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.930 
man attending something on his team is
about<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.139> die<00:04:27.470> yes<00:04:28.039> he<00:04:28.190> does<00:04:28.340> have<00:04:28.520> Sharpedo

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
about to die yes he does have Sharpedo

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.270 
about to die yes he does have Sharpedo
in<00:04:29.120> store<00:04:29.330> likes<00:04:29.539> but<00:04:29.770> Sharpedo<00:04:30.770> doesn't<00:04:31.160> have

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
in store likes but Sharpedo doesn't have

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.650 
in store likes but Sharpedo doesn't have
any<00:04:31.520> defenses<00:04:31.729> and<00:04:32.180> as<00:04:32.300> you're<00:04:32.449> going<00:04:32.539> to<00:04:32.599> see

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
any defenses and as you're going to see

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.500 
any defenses and as you're going to see
this<00:04:33.320> does<00:04:34.389> 45%<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.510> snorlax<00:04:35.900> that's<00:04:36.650> all

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
this does 45% the snorlax that's all

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.450 
this does 45% the snorlax that's all
kinds<00:04:38.510> of<00:04:38.660> damage<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.320> Pokemon<00:04:39.919> with<00:04:40.130> thick

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
kinds of damage to a Pokemon with thick

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.430 
kinds of damage to a Pokemon with thick
fat<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.060> because<00:04:41.599> he<00:04:41.750> thinks<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.050> I'm<00:04:42.199> more

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
fat and because he thinks that I'm more

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.260 
fat and because he thinks that I'm more
than<00:04:42.560> likely<00:04:42.710> scarf<00:04:43.190> I'm<00:04:43.370> actually<00:04:43.849> going<00:04:44.120> to

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
than likely scarf I'm actually going to

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.290 
than likely scarf I'm actually going to
go<00:04:44.300> for<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.690> super<00:04:45.080> powers<00:04:45.440> completely

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
go for the super powers completely

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.460 
go for the super powers completely
annihilate<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.449> snorlax<00:04:47.840> so<00:04:48.050> I<00:04:48.080> managed<00:04:48.440> to

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
annihilate the snorlax so I managed to

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.290 
annihilate the snorlax so I managed to
get<00:04:48.650> rid<00:04:48.830> of<00:04:48.860> his<00:04:49.039> two<00:04:49.250> walls<00:04:49.520> which<00:04:50.090> means

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
get rid of his two walls which means

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.270 
get rid of his two walls which means
he's<00:04:50.750> only<00:04:51.050> down<00:04:51.260> to<00:04:51.500> his<00:04:51.650> offensive<00:04:51.919> hitters

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
he's only down to his offensive hitters

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.589 
he's only down to his offensive hitters
which<00:04:52.430> means<00:04:52.610> i<00:04:52.699> can<00:04:52.849> take<00:04:53.000> advantage<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.510> that

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
which means i can take advantage of that

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.480 
which means i can take advantage of that
as<00:04:54.110> he's<00:04:54.320> going<00:04:54.500> to<00:04:54.620> bring<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:55.010> man<00:04:55.220> shall

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
as he's going to bring you the man shall

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.050 
as he's going to bring you the man shall
now<00:04:55.669> obviously<00:04:56.210> I'm<00:04:56.330> always<00:04:56.479> one

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
now obviously I'm always one

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.340 
now obviously I'm always one
just<00:04:57.240> going<00:04:57.389> to<00:04:57.450> go<00:04:57.540> for<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.720> fake<00:04:57.960> out<00:04:58.139> and

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
just going to go for the fake out and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.960 
just going to go for the fake out and
not<00:04:58.440> go<00:04:58.590> for<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.800> high<00:04:58.889> jump<00:04:58.919> kick<00:04:59.190> so<00:04:59.820> what

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
not go for the high jump kick so what

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.790 
not go for the high jump kick so what
I'm<00:05:00.060> going<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.210> do<00:05:00.360> is<00:05:00.570> bring<00:05:00.840> in<00:05:00.900> my<00:05:01.230> belly<00:05:01.680> on

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
I'm going to do is bring in my belly on

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.440 
I'm going to do is bring in my belly on
just<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.430> take<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.610> fake<00:05:02.880> out<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.210> volunteer

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
just to take the fake out and volunteer

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.600 
just to take the fake out and volunteer
I'm<00:05:04.440> more<00:05:04.650> than<00:05:04.860> likely<00:05:05.010> thinking<00:05:05.400> he<00:05:05.490> might

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
I'm more than likely thinking he might

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.980 
I'm more than likely thinking he might
just<00:05:05.820> go<00:05:05.910> for<00:05:06.030> another<00:05:06.150> future<00:05:06.480> but<00:05:06.780> I<00:05:06.810> don't

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
just go for another future but I don't

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.300 
just go for another future but I don't
want<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.169> risk<00:05:07.290> it<00:05:07.500> so<00:05:07.889> I'm<00:05:07.980> actually<00:05:08.070> gonna

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
want to risk it so I'm actually gonna

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.920 
want to risk it so I'm actually gonna
pull<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.580> switch<00:05:08.850> out<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.150> my<00:05:09.270> Blastoise<00:05:09.750> and

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
pull a switch out to my Blastoise and

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.720 
pull a switch out to my Blastoise and
this<00:05:10.050> journey<00:05:10.200> actually<00:05:10.590> does<00:05:10.950> end<00:05:11.220> up<00:05:11.490> going

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
this journey actually does end up going

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.890 
this journey actually does end up going
for<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:11.970> high<00:05:12.090> jump<00:05:12.120> kick<00:05:12.360> on<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.660> off<00:05:12.870> chance

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
for the high jump kick on the off chance

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.020 
for the high jump kick on the off chance
that<00:05:13.139> maybe<00:05:13.290> I<00:05:13.560> did<00:05:13.800> see<00:05:14.100> in<00:05:14.160> considering<00:05:14.940> that

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
that maybe I did see in considering that

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.850 
that maybe I did see in considering that
the<00:05:15.240> first<00:05:15.570> time<00:05:15.780> when<00:05:15.960> it<00:05:16.050> was<00:05:16.200> cavalli<00:05:16.710> on

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
the first time when it was cavalli on

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.800 
the first time when it was cavalli on
against<00:05:17.100> manchow<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.910> exit<00:05:18.180> did<00:05:18.300> just<00:05:18.540> go<00:05:18.660> for

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
against manchow the exit did just go for

Thunderbolt or voltage and I was

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.860 
Thunderbolt or voltage and I was
thinking<00:05:42.190> that<00:05:42.310> maybe<00:05:42.370> a<00:05:42.940> bolts<00:05:43.540> which<00:05:43.660> would

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870

as she saw there he lives with eight

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.600 
as she saw there he lives with eight
percent<00:05:47.260> which<00:05:47.380> means<00:05:47.590> now<00:05:47.770> I'm<00:05:48.280> gonna<00:05:48.490> be

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
percent which means now I'm gonna be

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.190

forced to bring in my umbreon which at
this<00:05:50.290> point<00:05:50.410> is<00:05:50.620> the<00:05:50.770> most<00:05:50.950> expandable<00:05:51.610> thing

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
this point is the most expandable thing

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.610 
this point is the most expandable thing
on<00:05:51.940> my<00:05:52.180> team<00:05:52.480> but<00:05:52.960> because<00:05:53.260> he<00:05:53.350> was<00:05:53.470> actually

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
on my team but because he was actually

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.410 
on my team but because he was actually
at<00:05:53.890> eight<00:05:54.010> percent<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:54.520> ten<00:05:54.730> percent<00:05:55.030> life

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
at eight percent the ten percent life

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.790 
at eight percent the ten percent life
for<00:05:55.630> Rico<00:05:55.930> is<00:05:56.110> going<00:05:56.290> to<00:05:56.350> be<00:05:56.440> able<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.650> finish

for Rico is going to be able to finish
him<00:05:57.040> off<00:05:57.160> which<00:05:57.700> means<00:05:57.910> now<00:05:58.060> he's<00:05:58.240> going<00:05:58.390> to

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450

able<00:06:15.880> to<00:06:16.120> actually<00:06:16.420> live<00:06:16.960> and<00:06:17.140> i<00:06:17.770> found<00:06:18.220> it<00:06:18.310> a

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
able to actually live and i found it a

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.710 
able to actually live and i found it a
bit<00:06:18.430> odd<00:06:18.670> that<00:06:18.700> he<00:06:18.910> didn't<00:06:19.150> go<00:06:19.210> for<00:06:19.240> earthquake

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
bit odd that he didn't go for earthquake

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.480 
bit odd that he didn't go for earthquake
maybe<00:06:20.020> he<00:06:20.170> doesn't<00:06:20.350> carry<00:06:20.830> it<00:06:21.040> or<00:06:21.190> maybe<00:06:21.310> he

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
maybe he doesn't carry it or maybe he

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.130 
maybe he doesn't carry it or maybe he
was<00:06:21.520> predicting<00:06:22.000> my<00:06:22.090> switch<00:06:22.270> onto<00:06:22.450> my<00:06:22.720> Rotom

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
was predicting my switch onto my Rotom

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.320 
was predicting my switch onto my Rotom
but<00:06:23.950> that<00:06:24.220> over<00:06:24.490> prediction<00:06:24.910> or<00:06:25.060> the<00:06:25.180> fact

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
but that over prediction or the fact

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.880 
but that over prediction or the fact
that<00:06:25.420> isn't<00:06:25.600> carrying<00:06:25.990> it<00:06:26.230> is<00:06:26.380> really<00:06:26.770> going

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
that isn't carrying it is really going

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.380 
that isn't carrying it is really going
to<00:06:26.950> cost<00:06:27.160> him<00:06:27.280> because<00:06:27.610> i'm<00:06:27.970> going<00:06:28.210> to<00:06:28.270> be<00:06:28.330> able

to cost him because i'm going to be able

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.150 
to cost him because i'm going to be able
to<00:06:28.540> finish<00:06:28.690> him<00:06:28.930> off<00:06:29.050> with<00:06:29.110> a<00:06:29.350> close<00:06:29.590> combat<00:06:29.860> as

i'm pretty positive at this point that

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.200 
i'm pretty positive at this point that
the<00:06:38.410> battle<00:06:38.710> is<00:06:38.800> over<00:06:38.950> but<00:06:39.280> it<00:06:39.310> turns<00:06:39.580> out<00:06:39.760> the

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:21.730 
heat wave but I'm pretty positive that

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.490 
heat wave but I'm pretty positive that
after<00:07:22.120> being

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
after being

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.740

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
minus one special defense a thunderbolt

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.790 
minus one special defense a thunderbolt
would<00:07:24.900> have<00:07:24.990> been<00:07:25.110> able<00:07:25.230> to<00:07:25.380> finish<00:07:25.530> me<00:07:25.770> off

would have been able to finish me off

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.860 
would have been able to finish me off
and<00:07:26.190> if<00:07:26.580> he<00:07:26.670> had<00:07:26.850> missed<00:07:27.090> the<00:07:27.240> heat<00:07:27.510> wave<00:07:27.630> that

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
and if he had missed the heat wave that

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.110 
and if he had missed the heat wave that
possibly<00:07:28.650> could<00:07:28.710> have<00:07:28.860> cost<00:07:29.070> him<00:07:29.340> but<00:07:29.880> at<00:07:30.000> this

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 
possibly could have cost him but at this

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.580 
possibly could have cost him but at this
point<00:07:30.300> I'm<00:07:30.480> just<00:07:30.510> hoping<00:07:30.690> that<00:07:31.050> Thunder<00:07:31.470> bow

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590
