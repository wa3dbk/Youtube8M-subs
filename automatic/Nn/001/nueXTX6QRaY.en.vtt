 hello friends hope you youtube 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.680
 have liked this song is called me 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.140
 I want to make beta broken light and good 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.310
 I had uploaded this video before 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.430
 some time ago and they had asked me for a 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.760
 tutorial for what is the intro 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.430
 and in the end it's practically the same 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.600
 but good in the link in the first 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.930
 part goes more or less like that starts nothing 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.900
 more let's occupy the fifth and the sixth 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.510
 rope are going to be fifths and then 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.240
 let's put in let's do what is my 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.390
 in fifth that would be sixth and fifth 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.720
 string and start like this with a radio like 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.720
 of error 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:15.130
 and the song starts to nobody strange anymore 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:19.000
 and then it's going to change it 's going to change 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:24.370
 the note we are going to use in the fifth 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.560
 string in the fourth fret and in the 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:34.630
 fourth string on the sixth fret this 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:37.460
 would be the sustained world 11 sustained and 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.069
 then it will change 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.550
 the fifth agreement to the air and the fourth in 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:46.120
 the second after d 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.890
 and then it's going to go through 2 that this would be 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.440
 that the fifth chord in the second 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.440
 fret and the fourth string in the room 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:05.740
 imagine repeats and Romans taking with 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:11.970
 the rain falling on the streets of this 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.970
 city or the rain 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.500
 and in the end it just stays in funk 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.220
 because it 's the original song about 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.220
 half tone 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.060
 more or less this is so 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.000
 good if you have any questions please 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.310

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.680
