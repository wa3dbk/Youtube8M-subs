00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the same color green green you might

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.450 
the same color green green you might
have<00:00:42.899> read<00:00:43.680> read<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.969> might<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:46.460> glue

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
have read read here you might have glue

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.520 
have read read here you might have glue

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
glue here and you might have pink pink

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.720 
glue here and you might have pink pink
hair<00:00:49.770> or<00:00:49.950> orange<00:00:50.280> orange<00:00:50.579> there<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:52.020> have

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
hair or orange orange there if you have

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.250 
hair or orange orange there if you have
all<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.090> same<00:00:54.239> colors<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.899> each<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.170> these

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
all the same colors in each of these

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.930 
all the same colors in each of these
then<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.980> wait<00:00:56.309> till<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> end<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> video

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
then just wait till the end of the video

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.020 
then just wait till the end of the video
or<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.510> turn<00:00:58.289> until<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.250> pieces<00:00:59.520> match<00:00:59.820> up

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
or just turn until your pieces match up

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.760 
or just turn until your pieces match up
and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.719> your<00:01:00.870> cube<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.199> done<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.559> keep

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and then your cube is done but keep

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.619 
and then your cube is done but keep
watching<00:01:01.949> because<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.850> may<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.329> don't<00:01:03.480> know

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
watching because you may you don't know

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.329 
watching because you may you don't know
how<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.840> solve<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> situation

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
how to solve it if you have a situation

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.429 
how to solve it if you have a situation
like<00:01:05.729> mine<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.720> there's<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.140> three

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
like mine so there's going to be three

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.230 
like mine so there's going to be three
situations<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.220> already<00:01:08.400> covered<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.000> when

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
situations I already covered one when

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.700 
situations I already covered one when
you<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.510> all<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> them<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> same<00:01:10.229> color<00:01:10.470> just

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you have all of them the same color just

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.859 
you have all of them the same color just
turn<00:01:11.010> until<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.490> matched<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.119> second

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
turn until it's matched up a second

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.300 
turn until it's matched up a second
situation<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.770> when<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.659> all

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
situation is when you have like this all

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
situation is when you have like this all
they're<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> same<00:01:17.700> color<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.330> any<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
they're not the same color on any of the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.760 
they're not the same color on any of the
sides<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.240> then<00:01:21.240> another<00:01:21.450> situation<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.200> 13

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
sides and then another situation is 13

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.469 
sides and then another situation is 13
of<00:01:22.860> them<00:01:22.979> or<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> same<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.640> different<00:01:24.210> colors

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
of them or the same or different colors

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.469 
of them or the same or different colors
and<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> same<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.330> have

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and then one is the same so if you have

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.390 
and then one is the same so if you have
like<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.869> where<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.170> three<00:01:28.920> different

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
like this where you have three different

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.100 
like this where you have three different
colors<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.939> then<00:01:30.060> one<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> same<00:01:30.750> colors

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
colors and then one of the same colors

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.539 
colors and then one of the same colors
in<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.409> case<00:01:31.619> Green<00:01:31.920> Green<00:01:32.130> you're<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
in this case Green Green you're going to

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.249 
in this case Green Green you're going to
put<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> side<00:01:33.090> where<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.600> two<00:01:33.750> colors<00:01:33.990> match

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
put the side where the two colors match

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.800 
put the side where the two colors match
up<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> back<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.790> either<00:01:35.880> turn<00:01:36.570> your

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
up in the back you can either turn your

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.810 
up in the back you can either turn your
cube<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.159> turn<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> top

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
cube like that or you can turn the top

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850 
cube like that or you can turn the top
layer<00:01:39.030> twice<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> simple

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
layer twice and then do the simple

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.660 
layer twice and then do the simple
algorithm<00:01:41.479> right<00:01:42.479> inverted<00:01:42.930> front<00:01:43.680> right

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
algorithm right inverted front right

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.039 
algorithm right inverted front right
inverted<00:01:45.149> back<00:01:45.810> 180<00:01:46.520> right<00:01:47.520> front<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.630> verted

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
inverted back 180 right front and verted

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.740 
inverted back 180 right front and verted
right<00:01:50.009> inverted<00:01:50.520> back<00:01:51.149> 180<00:01:52.250> right<00:01:53.250> 180<00:01:53.750> then

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
right inverted back 180 right 180 then

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.600 
right inverted back 180 right 180 then
you're<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.530> either<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.280> same

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you're going to have either the same

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.550 
you're going to have either the same
situation<00:01:57.270> where<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.659> repeat<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.079> same

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
situation where you just repeat the same

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560 
situation where you just repeat the same
step<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.159> taught<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.729> or<00:01:59.909> you're<00:02:00.479> going

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
step I just taught you or you're going

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.179 
step I just taught you or you're going
to<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.229> where<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.590> two

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
to have like this where you have two

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.010 
to have like this where you have two
Reds<00:02:02.490> two<00:02:03.420> greens<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:05.100> pinks<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.700> two<00:02:06.540> blue<00:02:06.719> so

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
Reds two greens to pinks and two blue so

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.710 
Reds two greens to pinks and two blue so
what<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.409> just<00:02:07.770> turn<00:02:08.179> until<00:02:09.179> they<00:02:09.599> all

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
what you do is just turn until they all

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.640 
what you do is just turn until they all
match<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:09.929> green<00:02:10.830> green<00:02:11.099> red<00:02:11.670> red

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
match up green green red red

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.710 
match up green green red red
blue<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.189> now<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.459> have<00:02:13.700> your<00:02:13.970> two<00:02:14.480> by<00:02:14.599> two

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
blue and now you have your two by two

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.679 
blue and now you have your two by two
completed<00:02:15.140> yay<00:02:15.760> except<00:02:16.760> there's<00:02:17.090> one<00:02:17.180> case

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
completed yay except there's one case

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.470 
completed yay except there's one case
that<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.890> may<00:02:19.700> not<00:02:19.760> have<00:02:20.060> completed<00:02:20.390> your

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
that you may not have completed your

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.300 
that you may not have completed your
cube<00:02:20.780> yet<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:22.400> case<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:24.010> when<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.129> have

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
cube yet so this case is when you have

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.710 
cube yet so this case is when you have
your<00:02:25.819> pieces<00:02:30.939> this<00:02:31.939> case<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.359> when<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.599> have

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
your pieces this case is when you have

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.420 
your pieces this case is when you have
your<00:02:32.840> pieces<00:02:33.049> like<00:02:33.319> this<00:02:33.500> none<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.040> them<00:02:34.250> are

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
your pieces like this none of them are

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.880 
your pieces like this none of them are
the<00:02:34.489> same<00:02:34.519> color<00:02:34.939> on<00:02:35.180> off<00:02:35.569> any<00:02:35.989> for<00:02:36.379> them<00:02:36.650> and

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
the same color on off any for them and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.160 
the same color on off any for them and
in<00:02:37.579> that<00:02:37.640> case<00:02:37.909> you<00:02:38.180> just<00:02:38.329> recite<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.989> same

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
in that case you just recite the same

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.479 
in that case you just recite the same
algorithm<00:02:39.590> we<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:39.859> did<00:02:43.659> and<00:02:45.069> now<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.129> will

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
algorithm we just did and now you will

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.970 
algorithm we just did and now you will
have<00:02:46.519> one<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.450> these<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:48.650> are<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.799> same

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
have one of these that are the same

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.129 
have one of these that are the same
colors<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.459> this<00:02:49.609> case<00:02:49.790> it's<00:02:50.000> red<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:50.780> put<00:02:51.019> that

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
colors in this case it's red so put that

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:59.729 
colors in this case it's red so put that
in<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.379> back<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:53.030> do<00:02:53.269> this<00:02:53.420> remember<00:02:53.690> them

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.690 

and<00:03:00.739> there<00:03:00.920> we<00:03:01.069> go<00:03:01.189> there<00:03:01.430> all<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.579> same

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
and there we go there all the same

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.020 
and there we go there all the same
colors<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.269> matchup<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:03.280> your<00:03:04.280> two<00:03:04.459> by<00:03:04.609> two<00:03:04.670> is

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
colors so matchup and your two by two is

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.800 
colors so matchup and your two by two is
solved<00:03:05.510> yay<00:03:06.129> so<00:03:07.129> Congrats<00:03:08.030> on<00:03:08.269> solving<00:03:08.329> your
