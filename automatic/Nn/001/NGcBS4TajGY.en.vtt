idea so I start with the environment
industrial<00:01:19.240> climber<00:01:20.530> definition<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:21.679> an

industrial climber definition is an

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.679 
industrial climber definition is an
important<00:01:22.130> right<00:01:22.280> now<00:01:22.310> we<00:01:23.090> just<00:01:23.240> want<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.539> see

that<00:03:23.410> day<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.740> don't<00:03:23.890> really<00:03:24.069> know<00:03:24.190> why<00:03:24.450> but<00:03:25.450> the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
that day I don't really know why but the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.710 
that day I don't really know why but the
point<00:03:25.750> here<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.050> you're<00:03:26.470> you're<00:03:27.190> just

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
point here is that you're you're just

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.370 
point here is that you're you're just
separating<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> subject<00:03:29.230> from<00:03:29.319> the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
separating the subject from the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.250 
separating the subject from the
background<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.069> certain<00:03:30.400> extent<00:03:30.840> using<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
background to a certain extent using the

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.340 
background to a certain extent using the
lighting<00:03:32.560> techniques<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.310> I'm<00:03:33.970> going<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.350> do

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
lighting techniques and I'm going to do

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.670 
lighting techniques and I'm going to do
my<00:03:35.830> photoshop<00:03:36.670> explanation<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:38.140> last<00:03:38.380> image

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680

here which is my favorite image from the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.830 
here which is my favorite image from the
whole<00:03:41.350> shoot<00:03:42.270> so<00:03:43.270> it's<00:03:43.390> going<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.540> basically

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
whole shoot so it's going to basically

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.830 
whole shoot so it's going to basically
just<00:03:44.200> be<00:03:44.380> shadow<00:03:44.890> lighting<00:03:45.640> adjustments

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
just be shadow lighting adjustments

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.380 
just be shadow lighting adjustments
texture<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.200> then<00:03:47.380> that'll<00:03:47.890> be<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.060> going<00:03:49.060> on

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
texture and then that'll be it going on

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.120 
texture and then that'll be it going on

copy<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:57.250> we<00:03:57.370> copied<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.450> new<00:03:58.660> layer

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
copy so we copied that to a new layer

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.199 
copy so we copied that to a new layer
and<00:03:59.140> on<00:04:00.040> that<00:04:00.190> copy<00:04:00.459> layer<00:04:00.760> we're<00:04:00.940> just<00:04:01.090> going

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
on the face just to give it a little bit

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.200 
on the face just to give it a little bit
over<00:04:22.870> hyper<00:04:23.140> realistic<00:04:23.530> look<00:04:23.979> and<00:04:24.669> it<00:04:25.060> so<00:04:25.120> it's

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
over hyper realistic look and it so it's

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.000 
over hyper realistic look and it so it's
going<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.360> be<00:04:25.450> painting<00:04:25.900> over<00:04:26.110> these<00:04:26.440> parts<00:04:26.919> of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
going to be painting over these parts of

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.280 
going to be painting over these parts of
the<00:04:27.100> images<00:04:27.460> using<00:04:28.150> dodging<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.229> burning

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
the images using dodging and burning

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.010 
the images using dodging and burning
tools<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.100> then<00:04:31.030> everything<00:04:31.630> else<00:04:31.750> should

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
tools and then everything else should

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.200 
tools and then everything else should
just<00:04:32.229> be<00:04:32.380> some<00:04:32.710> basically<00:04:33.550> real<00:04:33.640> adjustments

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
just be some basically real adjustments

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.370 
just be some basically real adjustments
I<00:04:34.390> first<00:04:35.169> do<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.710> high-pass<00:04:36.190> filter<00:04:37.229> and<00:04:38.229> what

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
I first do a high-pass filter and what

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.409 
I first do a high-pass filter and what
this<00:04:38.530> does<00:04:38.590> is<00:04:39.010> kind<00:04:39.220> of<00:04:39.310> give<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.460> cool<00:04:39.910> dark

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
this does is kind of give a cool dark

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.230 
this does is kind of give a cool dark
feeling<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.110> whole<00:04:41.260> image<00:04:41.550> but<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:43.060> was

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
feeling to the whole image but it was

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.330 
feeling to the whole image but it was
too<00:04:43.690> dark<00:04:43.870> for<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.229> main<00:04:44.530> subject<00:04:45.010> area<00:04:45.250> so

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
too dark for the main subject area so

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.700 
too dark for the main subject area so
what<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.550> do<00:04:45.669> is<00:04:46.210> for<00:04:46.720> what<00:04:46.930> I<00:04:46.960> did<00:04:47.200> was<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.470> mask

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
what I do is for what I did was to mask

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.630 
what I do is for what I did was to mask
out<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:49.000> area<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.660> image<00:04:50.340> just<00:04:51.340> using

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
out that area of the image just using

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.750 
out that area of the image just using
basic<00:04:52.000> masking<00:04:52.479> technique<00:04:52.840> in<00:04:53.050> Photoshop<00:04:53.500> and

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
basic masking technique in Photoshop and

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.790 
basic masking technique in Photoshop and
so<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:54.790> got<00:04:55.060> rid<00:04:55.300> of<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.510> high-pass<00:04:55.900> layer<00:04:56.260> over

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
so I got rid of the high-pass layer over

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.500 
so I got rid of the high-pass layer over
the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
the

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.130 
the
like<00:04:57.930> I<00:04:58.230> then<00:04:59.040> added<00:04:59.340> a<00:04:59.690> just<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.780> levels

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
like I then added a just a levels

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.440 
like I then added a just a levels
adjustment<00:05:01.380> add<00:05:02.250> some<00:05:02.700> green<00:05:02.910> which<00:05:03.180> is<00:05:03.300> what

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
adjustment add some green which is what

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.500 
adjustment add some green which is what
I<00:05:03.480> wanted<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.020> I<00:05:04.370> shot<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.400> texture<00:05:06.180> on

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
I wanted and I shot a texture on

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.210 
I wanted and I shot a texture on
location<00:05:07.080> in<00:05:07.110> one<00:05:07.320> of<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.470> brick<00:05:07.680> walls<00:05:07.920> or

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
location in one of the brick walls or

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.460 
location in one of the brick walls or
one<00:05:08.520> of<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.640> concrete<00:05:08.940> walls<00:05:09.240> and<00:05:09.540> I<00:05:10.260> use<00:05:10.440> that

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
one of the concrete walls and I use that

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.530 
one of the concrete walls and I use that
to<00:05:10.800> get<00:05:10.890> this<00:05:11.070> image<00:05:11.280> it's<00:05:11.520> gritty<00:05:11.730> look<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.330> I

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
to get this image it's gritty look and I

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.880 
to get this image it's gritty look and I
just<00:05:12.750> ended<00:05:12.990> with<00:05:13.080> some<00:05:13.320> brightness<00:05:13.710> and

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
just ended with some brightness and
