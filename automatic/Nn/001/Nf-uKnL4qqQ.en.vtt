00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.160 

I<00:00:39.829> really<00:00:40.640> would<00:00:40.790> emphasize<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.629> importance

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
I really would emphasize the importance

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.580 
I really would emphasize the importance
of<00:00:42.379> having<00:00:42.820> in<00:00:43.820> most<00:00:44.690> cases<00:00:44.960> a<00:00:45.140> medical

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
of having in most cases a medical

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.619 
of having in most cases a medical
officer<00:00:45.980> of<00:00:46.010> Health<00:00:46.370> who<00:00:46.610> is<00:00:46.760> a<00:00:46.790> real<00:00:47.059> champion

for it and senior administration within

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.950 
for it and senior administration within
that<00:00:51.559> Health<00:00:51.920> Unit<00:00:52.280> as<00:00:52.430> well<00:00:52.640> without<00:00:53.629> that

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
that Health Unit as well without that

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.649 
that Health Unit as well without that
you<00:00:54.500> really<00:00:55.010> are<00:00:55.399> probably<00:00:56.089> not<00:00:56.300> able<00:00:56.480> to

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
you really are probably not able to

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.930 
you really are probably not able to
complete<00:00:57.170> that<00:00:57.379> work<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:57.890> if<00:00:58.550> you<00:00:58.760> do

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
complete that work and if you do

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.970 
complete that work and if you do
complete<00:00:59.390> it<00:00:59.540> it<00:00:59.659> probably<00:00:59.870> will<00:01:00.739> not<00:01:00.920> be

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
complete it it probably will not be

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.189 
complete it it probably will not be
acted<00:01:01.550> upon<00:01:01.610> things<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.750> need<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:02.989> be<00:01:03.050> in

acted upon things that need to be in

acted upon things that need to be in

the<00:01:09.320> public<00:01:09.619> health<00:01:09.740> work<00:01:10.040> is<00:01:11.289> definitely<00:01:12.289> a

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
the public health work is definitely a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.840 
the public health work is definitely a
shared<00:01:12.890> vision<00:01:13.100> right<00:01:13.940> across<00:01:14.179> sectors<00:01:15.850> the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
capacity within all of the sectors but

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.410 
capacity within all of the sectors but
in<00:01:24.590> particular<00:01:25.070> of<00:01:25.220> course<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:26.210> health

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
in particular of course the the health

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.139 
in particular of course the the health
sector<00:01:26.750> to<00:01:27.880> be<00:01:28.880> able<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.119> produce<00:01:29.710> the

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
sector to be able to produce the

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.190 
sector to be able to produce the
surveillance<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.330> monitoring<00:01:32.899> and<00:01:33.050> the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
surveillance the monitoring and the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.310 
surveillance the monitoring and the
reporting<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:34.190> can't<00:01:34.460> use<00:01:34.700> evidence<00:01:35.320> if

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
reporting you can't use evidence if

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.680 
reporting you can't use evidence if
there<00:01:36.590> is<00:01:36.710> no<00:01:36.890> evidence

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.719 

the<00:01:44.110> important<00:01:44.500> thing<00:01:44.620> I<00:01:44.770> think<00:01:45.040> is<00:01:45.220> actually

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
the important thing I think is actually

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.060 
the important thing I think is actually
that<00:01:45.850> we're<00:01:46.000> doing<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.360> work<00:01:46.630> that<00:01:47.620> we're

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
that we're doing this work that we're

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.560 
that we're doing this work that we're
learning<00:01:48.220> from<00:01:48.430> our<00:01:48.700> own<00:01:48.820> work<00:01:49.150> we're

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
learning from our own work we're

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.290 
learning from our own work we're
improving<00:01:49.900> a<00:01:50.470> whole<00:01:51.040> area<00:01:51.580> that's<00:01:52.030> really

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
improving a whole area that's really

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.570 
improving a whole area that's really
important<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:52.960> public<00:01:53.290> health<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.740> it's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
important to public health and it's

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.480 
important to public health and it's
still<00:01:54.910> pretty<00:01:55.210> new<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.950> have<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.220> remind

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
still pretty new we have to remind

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.580 
still pretty new we have to remind
ourselves<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:58.090> over<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.110> last<00:01:59.229> 20<00:01:59.560> years

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
ourselves that over the last 20 years

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.820 
ourselves that over the last 20 years
we've<00:01:59.979> gained<00:02:00.250> access<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.820> all<00:02:01.000> sorts<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:01.540> data

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
we've gained access to all sorts of data

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.200 
we've gained access to all sorts of data
partly<00:02:02.830> because<00:02:03.009> of<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.430> access<00:02:03.910> we<00:02:04.180> have

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
partly because of the access we have

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.010 
partly because of the access we have
through<00:02:04.690> computers<00:02:05.440> so<00:02:06.369> this<00:02:07.330> whole<00:02:07.570> field<00:02:07.869> is

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
through computers so this whole field is

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.380 
through computers so this whole field is
going<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.200> progress<00:02:08.610> when<00:02:09.610> we<00:02:09.759> first<00:02:10.030> started

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
going to progress when we first started

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.000 
going to progress when we first started
doing<00:02:10.509> health<00:02:10.810> status<00:02:11.140> assessment<00:02:11.440> we<00:02:11.770> didn't

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
doing health status assessment we didn't

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.550 
doing health status assessment we didn't
have<00:02:12.130> electronic<00:02:12.760> data<00:02:13.000> either<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.720> was

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
have electronic data either and that was

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.199 
have electronic data either and that was
a<00:02:14.590> difficult<00:02:14.830> thing<00:02:15.100> because<00:02:15.580> we<00:02:15.730> had<00:02:15.910> you

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
a difficult thing because we had you

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.550 
a difficult thing because we had you
know<00:02:16.720> birth<00:02:17.350> data<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.910> was<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.060> paper<00:02:19.560> you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
know birth data that was on paper you

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.680 
know birth data that was on paper you
know<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.370> had<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.670> be<00:02:21.880> tabulated<00:02:22.270> by

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
know and that had to be tabulated by

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.260 
know and that had to be tabulated by
hand<00:02:22.989> and<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:23.770> when<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.070> look<00:02:24.310> now<00:02:24.640> at<00:02:24.970> some<00:02:25.000> of

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
hand and so when I look now at some of

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.470 
hand and so when I look now at some of
our<00:02:25.360> discussions<00:02:25.959> it's<00:02:26.400> we've<00:02:27.400> come<00:02:27.670> such<00:02:28.180> a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
our discussions it's we've come such a

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.840 
our discussions it's we've come such a
long<00:02:28.540> way<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.920> know<00:02:29.950> concerned<00:02:30.640> they're

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
long way you know concerned they're

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.010 
long way you know concerned they're
still<00:02:31.060> concerned<00:02:31.450> about<00:02:31.660> getting<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.930> right

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
still concerned about getting the right

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.050 
still concerned about getting the right
data<00:02:32.320> being<00:02:32.800> able<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.250> link<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.910> right

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
data being able to link it to the right

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.660 
data being able to link it to the right
sources<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.900> being<00:02:35.739> able<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.980> match<00:02:36.280> things

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670

population<00:03:00.320> health<00:03:00.350> assessment<00:03:01.100> when<00:03:01.250> really

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
population health assessment when really

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.850 
population health assessment when really
we<00:03:01.700> should<00:03:01.880> just<00:03:02.060> be<00:03:02.480> taking<00:03:02.960> action<00:03:03.170> we<00:03:03.710> know

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
we should just be taking action we know

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.580 
we should just be taking action we know
enough<00:03:04.130> now<00:03:04.370> we<00:03:05.120> don't<00:03:05.270> need<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.810> say<00:03:06.410> anything

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
enough now we don't need to say anything

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.620 
enough now we don't need to say anything
more<00:03:06.890> about<00:03:07.010> what<00:03:07.310> we<00:03:07.460> know<00:03:07.640> we<00:03:08.150> just<00:03:08.390> want<00:03:08.570> to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
more about what we know we just want to

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.310 
more about what we know we just want to
take<00:03:08.780> action

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
take action

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.050 
take action
and<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.980> think<00:03:10.190> part<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.550> being<00:03:10.850> in<00:03:11.000> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
and I think part of being in the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.150 
and I think part of being in the
learning<00:03:11.330> circle<00:03:11.450> in<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.720> last<00:03:11.900> few<00:03:12.140> days<00:03:12.350> has

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
learning circle in the last few days has

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.540 
learning circle in the last few days has
also<00:03:13.460> helped<00:03:13.880> me<00:03:14.030> realize<00:03:14.570> that<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:15.890> is<00:03:16.100> part

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
also helped me realize that this is part

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.970 
also helped me realize that this is part
of<00:03:16.670> taking<00:03:16.820> action<00:03:17.240> it<00:03:17.930> is<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:19.270> way<00:03:20.270> a<00:03:20.690> tool<00:03:21.110> to

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
of taking action it is a way a tool to

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.830 
of taking action it is a way a tool to
change<00:03:22.340> what's<00:03:22.760> happening<00:03:23.180> related<00:03:23.690> to

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
change what's happening related to

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.510 
change what's happening related to
inequities<00:03:24.740> and<00:03:25.190> if<00:03:26.030> we<00:03:26.270> forget<00:03:26.570> it<00:03:26.930> if<00:03:27.200> we

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
inequities and if we forget it if we

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.520 
inequities and if we forget it if we
disregard<00:03:28.520> it<00:03:29.030> as<00:03:29.300> a<00:03:29.360> tool<00:03:29.720> in<00:03:29.900> our<00:03:29.990> tool<00:03:30.200> bag

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
disregard it as a tool in our tool bag

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.920 
disregard it as a tool in our tool bag
then<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.820> know<00:03:31.940> we<00:03:32.060> won't<00:03:32.240> be<00:03:32.330> doing<00:03:32.450> public

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
then you know we won't be doing public

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.450 
then you know we won't be doing public
health<00:03:33.110> or<00:03:33.260> real<00:03:33.380> service<00:03:33.770> you<00:03:34.220> know<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.370> way

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
health or real service you know the way

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.310 
health or real service you know the way
I've<00:03:34.550> seen<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:34.760> over<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.060> last<00:03:35.180> 30<00:03:35.690> 40<00:03:35.810> years

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
I've seen it over the last 30 40 years

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.010 
I've seen it over the last 30 40 years
or<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:37.340> now<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:38.000> no<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.570> really<00:03:38.810> has

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
or so is now that no it really has

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.010 
or so is now that no it really has
almost<00:03:39.260> in<00:03:39.710> many<00:03:40.070> situations<00:03:40.640> become<00:03:41.020> again

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
almost in many situations become again

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.590 
almost in many situations become again
you<00:03:42.200> know<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.370> primary<00:03:43.370> lens<00:03:43.610> in<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.210> sense<00:03:44.420> to

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
you know a primary lens in the sense to

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.970 
you know a primary lens in the sense to
look<00:03:44.720> at<00:03:44.960> at<00:03:45.260> health<00:03:45.500> status<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:47.740> not<00:03:48.740> if<00:03:48.860> it's

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
look at at health status so not if it's

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.620 
look at at health status so not if it's
not<00:03:49.070> for<00:03:49.220> everyone<00:03:49.550> no<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.880> think<00:03:50.030> it's<00:03:50.420> really

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
not for everyone no I think it's really

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.830 
not for everyone no I think it's really
to<00:03:50.900> be<00:03:50.990> honest<00:03:51.350> sort<00:03:51.860> of<00:03:51.950> within<00:03:52.840> public

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
to be honest sort of within public

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.330 
to be honest sort of within public
health<00:03:54.050> for<00:03:54.350> sure<00:03:54.530> but<00:03:54.800> I<00:03:54.860> don't<00:03:54.950> think<00:03:55.130> it's

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
health for sure but I don't think it's

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.770 
health for sure but I don't think it's
