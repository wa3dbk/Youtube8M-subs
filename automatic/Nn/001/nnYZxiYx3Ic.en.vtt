okay I'm going to do a curtain head

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.900 
smoothing level to number two using soft
selection<00:00:22.769> I'm<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.519> stretching<00:00:24.320> out<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
selection I'm just stretching out the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.120 
selection I'm just stretching out the
parts<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.359> stuff<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:28.019> get<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.230> shape<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.949> I

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
parts and stuff to get a shape that I

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.950 
parts and stuff to get a shape that I
want<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:30.740> it's<00:00:31.740> kind<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.960> sculpting

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
want to do it's kind of like a sculpting

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.119 
want to do it's kind of like a sculpting
process<00:00:35.420> that<00:00:36.420> would<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:37.020> better<00:00:37.260> probably<00:00:37.980> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
process that would be better probably to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.819 
process that would be better probably to
start<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> sketch<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.899> kind<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.620> like

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
start with a sketch but I kind of like

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.190 
start with a sketch but I kind of like
to<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:42.350> work<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> fly<00:00:44.960> it's<00:00:45.960> more

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to do the work on the fly it's more

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.950 
to do the work on the fly it's more
intuitive<00:00:46.829> sort<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.360> way<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.840> do

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
intuitive sort of like the way that I do

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.869 
intuitive sort of like the way that I do
some<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:51.440> two-dimensional<00:00:52.879> illustration

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
some of the two-dimensional illustration

some of the two-dimensional illustration
projects<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.730> do<00:00:56.730> at<00:00:57.149> least<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
projects that I do at least the

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.680 
projects that I do at least the
caricature<00:01:00.359> work<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.879> best<00:01:03.120> way<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> learn

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
caricature work the best way to learn

this<00:01:03.960> program<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.720> check<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.200> mango

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
this program is to check out the mango

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.000 
this program is to check out the mango
that<00:01:08.070> came<00:01:08.400> comes<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:12.740> go<00:01:13.740> through

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that came comes with it and go through

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.969 
that came comes with it and go through
the<00:01:14.220> steps<00:01:14.520> or<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> exercisers<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.799> learn<00:01:16.950> how

the steps or the exercisers to learn how
to<00:01:17.189> use<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> tools<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.290> universal

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
to use the tools I like the universal

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.390 
to use the tools I like the universal
manipulator<00:01:20.790> which<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.930> see<00:01:22.400> me

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
manipulator which is the one you see me

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.240 
manipulator which is the one you see me
using<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.979> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.220> select<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:28.159> bunch<00:01:29.159> of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
using here I you can select a bunch of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.630 
using here I you can select a bunch of
faces<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.790> verses<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.100> they<00:01:32.100> pull<00:01:32.990> a

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
faces and verses and they pull a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
faces and verses and they pull a
relative<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.880> how<00:01:36.299> close<00:01:36.810> they<00:01:37.200> are<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
relative to how close they are to the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.120 
relative to how close they are to the

center of your selection sub pulling

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.950 
center of your selection sub pulling
more<00:01:41.280> than<00:01:41.670> others<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:46.070> hexagon<00:01:47.509> 2.1<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
more than others and hexagon 2.1 is a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.399 
more than others and hexagon 2.1 is a
program<00:01:50.060> right<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.090> I'm<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.689> roughing<00:01:52.229> in

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
program right now I'm just roughing in

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.230 
program right now I'm just roughing in
the<00:01:52.759> basics<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> head<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.430> later<00:01:56.430> whilst

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the basics of the head and later whilst

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.920 
the basics of the head and later whilst
do<00:01:57.630> some<00:01:57.990> detail<00:01:58.740> work<00:01:59.540> which<00:02:00.540> would<00:02:00.840> involve

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
do some detail work which would involve

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.950 
do some detail work which would involve
doing<00:02:03.930> some<00:02:04.640> edge<00:02:05.960> extractions<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:08.869> extra

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
doing some edge extractions and extra

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.360 
doing some edge extractions and extra
of<00:02:10.560> certain<00:02:11.460> phases<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:15.560> process<00:02:16.560> that's

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
of certain phases the process that's

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.120 
of certain phases the process that's
pretty<00:02:17.640> handy<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.960> select<00:02:19.230> your<00:02:22.700> faces<00:02:23.700> and

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
pretty handy is to select your faces and

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.210 
pretty handy is to select your faces and
just<00:02:26.130> do<00:02:26.460> like<00:02:26.700> I'm<00:02:26.970> doing<00:02:27.300> sort<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.320> working

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
just do like I'm doing sort of working

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.600 
just do like I'm doing sort of working
like<00:02:29.670> you're<00:02:30.000> working<00:02:30.210> with<00:02:30.510> clay<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.610> this

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
like you're working with clay and this

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.540 
like you're working with clay and this
is<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> good<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.330> important<00:02:34.190> process<00:02:35.190> here

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
is a good and important process here

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.270 
is a good and important process here
you're<00:02:36.110> selecting<00:02:37.110> edges<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.860> then<00:02:38.070> I'm

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
you're selecting edges and then I'm

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.770 
you're selecting edges and then I'm
doing<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.830> extraction<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.370> edge<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:42.630> the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
doing the extraction of the edge to the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.770 
doing the extraction of the edge to the
inside<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.530> original<00:02:44.130> edge<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:45.210> kind<00:02:45.690> of

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
inside of the original edge this kind of

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.940 
inside of the original edge this kind of
helps<00:02:46.080> keep<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:48.200> quad<00:02:49.200> or<00:02:49.560> for<00:02:49.980> virtus<00:02:50.870> faces

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
helps keep the quad or for virtus faces

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:02.980 
helps keep the quad or for virtus faces
which<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:52.980> important<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.730> clean<00:02:54.030> geometry

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990
