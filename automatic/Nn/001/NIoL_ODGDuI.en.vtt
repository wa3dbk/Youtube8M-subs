usually need to be addressed in order to
get<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.960> good<00:02:31.350> result<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.580> when<00:02:32.850> we're<00:02:33.030> trying

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
get a good result so when we're trying

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.230 
get a good result so when we're trying
to<00:02:33.660> remove<00:02:33.930> fatty<00:02:34.320> tissue<00:02:34.620> alone<00:02:35.040> that's<00:02:35.970> when

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
to remove fatty tissue alone that's when

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.970 
to remove fatty tissue alone that's when
we<00:02:36.390> use<00:02:36.660> either<00:02:37.080> traditional<00:02:37.470> liposuction

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
we use either traditional liposuction

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.880 
we use either traditional liposuction
techniques<00:02:38.880> with<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> cannula<00:02:39.510> or<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:40.620> use<00:02:40.650> a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
a sense in essence it's the same surgery

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.970 
a sense in essence it's the same surgery
if<00:02:49.380> we<00:02:49.770> need<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.660> remove<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.930> fat<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.470> try<00:02:52.920> to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
if we need to remove the fat and try to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.850 
if we need to remove the fat and try to
tighten<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.640> skin<00:02:53.940> on<00:02:54.090> top<00:02:54.410> then<00:02:55.410> we<00:02:55.680> have<00:02:55.830> to

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
tighten the skin on top then we have to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.900 
tighten the skin on top then we have to
add<00:02:56.190> more<00:02:56.880> advanced<00:02:57.450> techniques<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.530> laser

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
add more advanced techniques like laser

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.210 
add more advanced techniques like laser
like<00:02:59.910> smart<00:03:00.240> lipo<00:03:00.450> which<00:03:01.320> will<00:03:01.500> allow<00:03:01.740> this

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
like smart lipo which will allow this

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.460 
like smart lipo which will allow this
additional<00:03:02.790> skin<00:03:03.030> tightening<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.660> phaser

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
additional skin tightening and phaser

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.280 
additional skin tightening and phaser
which<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.280> ultrasound<00:03:05.910> based<00:03:06.240> technique<00:03:06.690> what

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
which is ultrasound based technique what

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.050 
which is ultrasound based technique what
it<00:03:07.410> does<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.770> melts<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.160> fatty<00:03:08.400> tissue<00:03:08.730> and

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
it does it melts the fatty tissue and

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.270 
it does it melts the fatty tissue and
that<00:03:09.630> allows<00:03:09.990> additional<00:03:10.290> skin<00:03:10.800> tightening

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
that allows additional skin tightening

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.910 
that allows additional skin tightening
on<00:03:11.430> top<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:12.150> what<00:03:12.630> happens<00:03:13.020> when<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.710> just

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
on top of what happens when we just

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.150 
on top of what happens when we just
remove<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.250> volume<00:03:14.960> so<00:03:15.960> those<00:03:16.560> techniques

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
remove the volume so those techniques

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.540 
remove the volume so those techniques
allows<00:03:18.030> us<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.390> do<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.710> skin<00:03:19.980> tightening<00:03:20.370> and

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
allows us to do the skin tightening and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.600 
allows us to do the skin tightening and
removal<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.720> fatty<00:03:22.530> tissue<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.130> it's

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
removal of the fatty tissue and it's

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.010 
removal of the fatty tissue and it's
important<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.150> remember<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.780> fatty

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
important to remember that the fatty

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.860 
important to remember that the fatty
tissue<00:03:25.350> needs<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.400> be<00:03:26.550> removed<00:03:26.850> not<00:03:27.210> only<00:03:27.270> from

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
tissue needs to be removed not only from

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.890 
tissue needs to be removed not only from
the<00:03:28.250> breast<00:03:29.250> but<00:03:29.610> also<00:03:29.850> we<00:03:30.420> need<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.690> define

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
the breast but also we need to define

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.300 
the breast but also we need to define
our<00:03:32.120> edge<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.600> pectoralis<00:03:33.900> muscle<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.680> as

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
our edge of the pectoralis muscle and as

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.400 
our edge of the pectoralis muscle and as
well<00:03:35.580> as<00:03:35.610> go<00:03:36.030> into<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.600> side<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.140> chest

a semi circular incision underneath the
areolar<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.110> then<00:03:58.920> we<00:03:59.100> remove<00:03:59.370> that<00:03:59.580> tissue

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
areolar and then we remove that tissue

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.950 
areolar and then we remove that tissue

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
a coordinate shaver is it's a little

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.190 
a coordinate shaver is it's a little
tube<00:04:15.930> with<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.040> blade<00:04:17.600> that<00:04:18.600> looks<00:04:18.810> like<00:04:18.960> this

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
tube with the blade that looks like this

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.920 
tube with the blade that looks like this
and<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.890> moves<00:04:20.100> back<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.460> forth<00:04:20.549> so<00:04:21.299> as<00:04:21.600> we

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
and it moves back and forth so as we

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.140 
and it moves back and forth so as we
slide<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.620> blade<00:04:22.950> underneath<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:24.090> the

slide that blade underneath of the
glandular<00:04:24.900> tissue<00:04:25.350> we<00:04:26.070> shave<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.550> off<00:04:26.640> because

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
glandular tissue we shave it off because

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.030 
glandular tissue we shave it off because
it<00:04:27.600> cannot<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:28.110> removed<00:04:28.260> with<00:04:28.650> regular

it cannot be removed with regular

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.970 
it cannot be removed with regular
liposuction<00:04:29.790> or<00:04:29.940> vase<00:04:30.150> or<00:04:30.390> a<00:04:30.450> laser<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:31.080> that

liposuction or vase or a laser and that

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.520 
liposuction or vase or a laser and that
is<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.280> way<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.490> remove<00:04:33.080> at<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.290> glandular

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
is the way to remove at the glandular

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.210 
is the way to remove at the glandular
tissue

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
tissue

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
so if your main concerns are just the

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.300 
so if your main concerns are just the
volume<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.970> fatty<00:04:39.360> tissue<00:04:39.480> and<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.560> volume<00:04:40.860> of

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
volume of fatty tissue and the volume of

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.200 
volume of fatty tissue and the volume of
breast<00:04:42.150> tissue<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.930> usually<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.500> enough<00:04:44.210> the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
breast tissue that usually is enough the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.570 
breast tissue that usually is enough the
next<00:04:45.660> things<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:46.050> consider<00:04:46.350> is<00:04:46.620> do<00:04:47.310> we<00:04:47.430> need

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
next things to consider is do we need

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.270 
next things to consider is do we need
additional<00:04:48.090> skin<00:04:48.300> tightening<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:49.440> then<00:04:50.040> we

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
additional skin tightening so then we

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.660 
additional skin tightening so then we
can<00:04:50.460> use<00:04:50.790> laser<00:04:51.480> or<00:04:51.840> laser<00:04:52.050> on<00:04:52.320> top<00:04:52.680> not<00:04:53.430> for

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
can use laser or laser on top not for

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.970 
can use laser or laser on top not for
the<00:04:53.760> purposes<00:04:54.180> of<00:04:54.300> reduction<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.900> fat<00:04:55.170> but<00:04:55.770> for

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
the purposes of reduction of fat but for

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.640 
the purposes of reduction of fat but for

the purpose of stimulating additional
skin<00:04:58.920> tightening<00:05:00.080> now<00:05:01.080> let's<00:05:01.350> talk<00:05:01.530> about<00:05:01.650> the

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
skin tightening now let's talk about the

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.680 
skin tightening now let's talk about the
a<00:05:02.280> real<00:05:02.670> a<00:05:02.940> real<00:05:03.000> as<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.480> pigmented<00:05:03.900> part<00:05:05.690> it's

a real a real as a pigmented part it's

a real a real as a pigmented part it's
not<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.900> nipple<00:05:07.230> itself<00:05:07.560> it's<00:05:07.860> a<00:05:07.950> route<00:05:08.130> they

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
not a nipple itself it's a route they

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.120 
not a nipple itself it's a route they
meant<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.730> part<00:05:08.940> in<00:05:09.060> our<00:05:09.150> chest<00:05:09.450> wall<00:05:09.920> as<00:05:10.920> the

gynecomastia the areolar also stretches

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.390 
gynecomastia the areolar also stretches
out<00:05:16.680> becomes<00:05:17.100> so<00:05:17.490> scope<00:05:17.730> puffy<00:05:18.800> so<00:05:19.800> commonly

out becomes so scope puffy so commonly
what<00:05:20.610> we<00:05:20.730> need<00:05:20.910> to<00:05:21.060> do<00:05:21.240> in<00:05:21.720> addition<00:05:22.260> to

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
what we need to do in addition to

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.730 
what we need to do in addition to
removing<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:23.400> fat<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.270> glandular<00:05:24.660> tissue<00:05:25.050> we

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
removing the fat and glandular tissue we

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.220 
removing the fat and glandular tissue we
also<00:05:25.950> need<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.310> shrink<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.600> size<00:05:27.870> of<00:05:28.110> the

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
also need to shrink the size of the

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.920 
also need to shrink the size of the
areolar<00:05:29.150> sometimes<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.270> real<00:05:30.450> is<00:05:30.630> can<00:05:30.780> be

asymmetric one can be larger than the

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.909 
asymmetric one can be larger than the
other<00:05:32.910> so<00:05:33.510> different<00:05:34.230> techniques<00:05:34.650> or

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
other so different techniques or

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.890 
other so different techniques or
different<00:05:37.610> strengths<00:05:38.610> or<00:05:39.090> methods<00:05:39.540> may<00:05:39.750> need

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
different strengths or methods may need

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.680 
different strengths or methods may need
to<00:05:39.990> be<00:05:40.110> used<00:05:40.520> to<00:05:41.520> improve<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:42.090> symmetry<00:05:42.540> and

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
to be used to improve the symmetry and

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.170 
to be used to improve the symmetry and
to<00:05:43.290> do<00:05:43.470> that<00:05:43.710> we<00:05:44.250> can<00:05:44.430> use<00:05:44.460> internal

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
to do that we can use internal

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.640 
to do that we can use internal
techniques<00:05:45.570> when<00:05:45.870> they'll<00:05:45.990> put<00:05:46.140> a<00:05:46.169> suture

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
techniques when they'll put a suture

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.070 
techniques when they'll put a suture
called<00:05:47.100> purse-string<00:05:47.520> suture<00:05:47.840> underneath<00:05:48.840> or

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
called purse-string suture underneath or

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.260 
called purse-string suture underneath or
we<00:05:49.560> can<00:05:49.800> weave<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.430> suture<00:05:50.729> from<00:05:50.910> the<00:05:51.000> surface

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
we can weave the suture from the surface

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.780 
we can weave the suture from the surface
or<00:05:52.050> sometimes<00:05:52.650> we<00:05:52.770> have<00:05:52.919> to<00:05:52.979> make<00:05:53.220> an<00:05:53.370> incision

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
or sometimes we have to make an incision

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.110 
or sometimes we have to make an incision
around<00:05:54.350> to<00:05:55.350> create<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.800> defined<00:05:56.460> shape<00:05:56.700> of

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
around to create a defined shape of

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.659 
around to create a defined shape of
their<00:05:57.300> real<00:05:57.510> and<00:05:57.840> I<00:05:58.650> think<00:05:58.919> one<00:05:59.130> of<00:05:59.160> the<00:05:59.370> most

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
their real and I think one of the most

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.650 
their real and I think one of the most
understated<00:06:01.010> topics<00:06:02.010> in<00:06:02.220> gynecomastia<00:06:03.090> is<00:06:03.630> a

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
understated topics in gynecomastia is a

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.840 
understated topics in gynecomastia is a
shape<00:06:04.110> size<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:04.710> position<00:06:05.070> of<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.490> nipple

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
shape size and position of the nipple

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.350 
shape size and position of the nipple
itself<00:06:06.210> what<00:06:07.200> we<00:06:07.350> commonly<00:06:07.560> see<00:06:07.919> is<00:06:08.430> when<00:06:09.180> the

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
itself what we commonly see is when the

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.290 
itself what we commonly see is when the
glandular<00:06:10.260> tissue<00:06:10.680> is<00:06:10.950> removed<00:06:11.100> Oh<00:06:11.669> breast

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
glandular tissue is removed Oh breast

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.150 
glandular tissue is removed Oh breast
tissue<00:06:12.479> is<00:06:12.630> removed<00:06:12.870> from<00:06:13.350> right<00:06:13.770> underneath

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
tissue is removed from right underneath

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.180 
tissue is removed from right underneath
the<00:06:14.460> nipple<00:06:14.790> the<00:06:15.419> nipple<00:06:15.870> splays<00:06:16.590> out<00:06:16.830> so<00:06:17.130> it

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
the nipple the nipple splays out so it

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.760 
the nipple the nipple splays out so it
becomes<00:06:17.430> flat<00:06:17.850> and<00:06:18.120> even<00:06:18.900> when<00:06:19.290> everything

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
becomes flat and even when everything

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.760 
becomes flat and even when everything
heals<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:20.850> nipple<00:06:21.330> cannot<00:06:21.720> really<00:06:22.350> come<00:06:22.740> up

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
heals the nipple cannot really come up

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.659 
heals the nipple cannot really come up
anymore<00:06:23.280> so<00:06:24.500> the<00:06:25.500> only<00:06:25.680> way<00:06:26.010> to<00:06:26.070> correct<00:06:26.310> that

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
anymore so the only way to correct that

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.930 
anymore so the only way to correct that
is<00:06:26.970> actually<00:06:27.419> do<00:06:27.660> open<00:06:28.440> technique<00:06:28.830> will<00:06:29.430> go<00:06:29.729> in

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
is actually do open technique will go in

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.120 
is actually do open technique will go in
underneath<00:06:30.240> and<00:06:30.570> we'll<00:06:31.050> bring<00:06:31.320> the<00:06:31.650> basis<00:06:32.100> of

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
underneath and we'll bring the basis of

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.310 
underneath and we'll bring the basis of
the<00:06:32.340> nipple<00:06:32.640> together<00:06:33.000> recreating<00:06:33.900> the

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
the nipple together recreating the

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.170 
the nipple together recreating the
volume<00:06:34.680> of<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:34.950> nipple<00:06:35.250> so<00:06:35.640> it<00:06:35.729> looks<00:06:35.910> more

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
volume of the nipple so it looks more

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.750 
volume of the nipple so it looks more
normal<00:06:36.780> and<00:06:37.200> natural<00:06:37.290> so<00:06:38.280> whenever<00:06:38.520> you

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760
