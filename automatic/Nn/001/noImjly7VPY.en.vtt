loved but trying it again in this
tutorial<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.560> actually<00:00:28.980> did<00:00:29.160> not<00:00:29.400> work<00:00:29.609> out

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789

for<00:00:29.820> my<00:00:29.970> skin<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.599> don't<00:00:30.660> think<00:00:31.050> I'll<00:00:31.170> use

for my skin and I don't think I'll use

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.380 
for my skin and I don't think I'll use
it<00:00:31.380> again<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.309> not<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> nice

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.360 
it again it was just not a nice
foundation<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.989> because<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.890> foundation

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
foundation and because this foundation

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
foundation and because this foundation
had<00:00:38.579> no<00:00:38.760> coverage<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> I'm<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> use
