00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:11.190
 clearly declared presents 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:15.379
 what is DNA and how does it work 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.990
 DNA also called acid 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.410
 deoxyribonucleic is a molecule is 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.310
 a lot of atoms stuck 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.189
 in the case of DNA these atoms are 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.610
 combine to create the shape of a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.610
 long staircase in the form of special as 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.940
 is here if you have ever studied 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.840
 biology or seen the jurassic movie 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.379
 park you've probably heard of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.970
 that the DNA acts as a plane or a 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.050
 recipe for a living being 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.960
 but how can a molecule act 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.140
 as a plane for something so complex and 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.380
 wonderful as a tree a dog 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.199
 [Music] 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.030
 to help answer this question 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.830
 first let's look at the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.250
 amino acids 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.550
 amino acids are tiny substances 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.190
 chemicals inside our bodies that 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.550
 they are so important that they are often 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.540
 referred to as the bricks of life 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.960
 there are about 20 types of amino acids 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.080
 each with its own unique form what 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.260
 fantastic is that you can connect like this 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.810
 as if they were laymen to produce a 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.380
 large variety of larger particles 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.219
 called proteins 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.009
 the amino acids form the proteins 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:49.890
 proteins together with other products 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.450
 chemicals combine to form the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.179
 cells the cells form tissues the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.329
 which form organs and organs 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:03.990
 when they come together and they work they form a 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.020
 living beings like you and me are 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.360
 proteins that make up our body and 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.120
 keep in mind that there are millions of 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.390
 different types of proteins should 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.450
 build yourself in the perfect way to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.610
 can work if they have the form 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:28.330
 wrong usually do not work 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:32.010
 that's where the DNA comes into play 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.500
 DNA does many interesting things 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.290
 some of which we do not understand about 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.410
 everything but one of its functions 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.770
 main and most clearly understood 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.950
 is to tell amino acids how 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.920
 line up and get organized in ways 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.430
 specific to make proteins that 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.120
 work 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.540
 in theory if the correct proteins are 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.840
 build at the right time and in 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.900
 the right place everything else from 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.930
 the cells to the organs and even the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.930
 whole organisms will believe well 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.000
 this is a simplified model of DNA 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.390
 shows us that the steps of the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.060
 ladder are made up of four 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.250
 different types of chemical products 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.240
 that are shown here with different 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.880
 colors and letters 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.210
 if we look only at half of 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.530
 the stairs can actually read your 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:41.580
 chemical code or genetic sequence of 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.990
 up and down like a book 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.740
 a single DNA staircase is 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:52.350
 extremely long millions of letters 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:55.680
 for most of his life he is 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.170
 curled up like a noodle living in the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.020
 core interior 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.430
 in the central compartment of the 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.609
 cell 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.400
 the amino acids however live outside 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.590
 of the nucleus in what is called the 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.069
 cytoplasm 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:18.180
 to help DNA to interact with the 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:21.299
 cytoplasm and create certain proteins 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.750
 special chemicals within the 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.810
 core make partial copies of the code 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.310
 of the DNA 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:35.630
 these new specimens called arn are 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.750
 they look like DNA but they are shorter by 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.620
 course and they lack one side of the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.700
 staircase the small size and shape 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.820
 of the arn allows you to pass through 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:53.090
 small pores in the nucleus towards the 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:57.639
 cytoplasm and inside the mouth of another 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.639
 particle called the ribosome 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.850
 ribosomes are machines that 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:08.419
 they build the proteins they read the rn three 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.630
 letters at the same time collect amino acids from 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.600
 their surroundings and link them together 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.460
 to build a chain in accordance with 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.660
 the code of the rn 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.600
 as the chain grows it bends 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.920
 folds and sticks itself to form 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.590
 a protein of perfect shape 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.400
 each set of three letters of the code of the 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:37.340
 adn tells the riva zone which of the 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.430
 20 varieties of amino acids must be 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.449
 add to the protein chain by 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.150
 example 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.809
 it tells the ribosome that it picks up a 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.809
 glutamine 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:55.889
 he says to pick up an acerin and so 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.620
 successively once the protein is 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.830
 you finish building you can make a 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:05.069
 number of different things one of them 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.849
 could be help to form a new type 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.849
 from cell 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:17.020
 so to answer the question 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:20.650
 original that is the DNA the DNA is a 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:27.610
 molecular plane for a living being how 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:30.639
 works the DNA creates the rn the a rn creates 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:34.870
 proteins and proteins go on to form 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:38.650
 life all this complicated process 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.379
 as sophisticated as magical as you can 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.279
 seem to be based entirely on the 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:49.419
 chemistry in this way can be 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:54.180
 studied and you can understand this is the 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:54.180
 DNA clearly declared
