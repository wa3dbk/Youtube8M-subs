00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
then right here is kind of fast so it's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.030 
then right here is kind of fast so it's
a<00:00:33.570> little<00:00:33.809> bit<00:00:33.930> different<00:00:34.140> but<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.680> goes<00:00:34.890> from

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
a little bit different but it goes from

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:44.920 
a little bit different but it goes from
3<00:00:35.660> D<00:00:36.660> minor<00:00:37.050> C<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:39.300> again<00:00:39.690> that's<00:00:40.010> C<00:00:42.140> J<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.820> minor

3 D minor C so again that's C J a minor
and<00:00:47.840> C<00:00:49.550> G<00:00:56.719> so<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.109> how

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280
