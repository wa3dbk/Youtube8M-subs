and<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.799> also<00:01:55.950> see<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.399> these<00:01:57.360> two

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
and you can also see here that these two

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.980 
and you can also see here that these two
outputs<00:01:58.130> one<00:01:59.130> outputs<00:01:59.729> 2000<00:02:00.299> milliamps<00:02:00.780> per

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
outputs one outputs 2000 milliamps per

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.429 
outputs one outputs 2000 milliamps per
hour<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.040> then<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.430> other<00:02:02.579> one<00:02:02.640> output<00:02:03.439> 1000

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
hour and then the other one output 1000

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.800 
hour and then the other one output 1000
million<00:02:04.590> per<00:02:04.979> hour<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.549> one<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.630> course

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
million per hour so one is of course

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.619 
million per hour so one is of course
better<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.619> use<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:08.039> tablets<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.910> output

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
better to use for tablets in the output

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.380 
better to use for tablets in the output
to<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.530> tablets<00:02:10.979> they<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:11.760> require<00:02:12.120> a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
to because tablets they do require a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.110 
to because tablets they do require a
little<00:02:12.599> bit<00:02:12.720> more

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
little bit more

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
here on the side and they use the cable

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.809 
here on the side and they use the cable
and<00:03:07.420> connect<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.650> computer<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:09.609> you<00:03:09.790> can

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
pretty good to have and then also we do

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.830 
pretty good to have and then also we do
get<00:03:16.329> another<00:03:17.079> adapter<00:03:17.919> here<00:03:18.459> that<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.209> might

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
get another adapter here that you might

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.509 
get another adapter here that you might
be<00:03:19.870> able<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.470> use<00:03:20.590> with<00:03:20.889> some<00:03:21.130> of<00:03:21.310> your

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
be able to use with some of your

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.909 
be able to use with some of your
products<00:03:22.000> we<00:03:22.480> need<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.900> charge<00:03:23.230> them<00:03:23.470> up<00:03:23.560> like

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:23.919 
products we need to charge them up like

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.629 
products we need to charge them up like
some<00:03:24.209> problem<00:03:25.560> cameras<00:03:26.560> may<00:03:27.010> use<00:03:27.370> this

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
some problem cameras may use this

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.629 
some problem cameras may use this
connection<00:03:28.269> so<00:03:29.260> then<00:03:29.859> of<00:03:30.010> course<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.400> get

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
connection so then of course you get

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.970 
connection so then of course you get
this<00:03:30.819> cable<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:32.260> just<00:03:32.530> put<00:03:32.799> these

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
this cable and you just put these

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.430 
this cable and you just put these
adapters<00:03:33.609> on<00:03:33.879> when<00:03:34.389> you<00:03:34.510> need<00:03:34.690> one<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.230> these

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
adapters on when you need one of these

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.979 
adapters on when you need one of these
so<00:03:36.129> when<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.489> charge<00:03:36.760> your<00:03:37.060> anchor<00:03:37.599> battery

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
so when you charge your anchor battery

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.050 
so when you charge your anchor battery
through<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.260> computer<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:39.579> just<00:03:39.730> put<00:03:39.940> this

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
through the computer you just put this

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.500 
through the computer you just put this
one<00:03:40.269> on<00:03:40.769> plug<00:03:41.769> this<00:03:42.010> part<00:03:42.459> into<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.209> anchor

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
one on plug this part into the anchor

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.689 
one on plug this part into the anchor
battery<00:03:43.900> in<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:44.260> other<00:03:44.410> part<00:03:44.769> into<00:03:45.669> a

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
battery in the other part into a

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.939 
battery in the other part into a
computer<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.480> then<00:03:47.079> you<00:03:47.319> can<00:03:47.440> charge<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.829> up

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
computer and then you can charge it up

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.420 
computer and then you can charge it up
and<00:03:48.220> then<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:49.180> course<00:03:49.209> if<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.169> have<00:03:50.230> older

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
and then of course if you have older

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.839 
and then of course if you have older
devices<00:03:51.930> it's<00:03:52.930> like<00:03:53.230> this<00:03:53.410> one<00:03:53.590> on<00:03:53.849> older

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
devices it's like this one on older

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.110 
devices it's like this one on older
Apple<00:03:55.389> devices<00:03:55.840> just<00:03:56.199> plug<00:03:56.410> this<00:03:56.530> one<00:03:56.590> on<00:03:56.859> and

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
Apple devices just plug this one on and

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.490 
Apple devices just plug this one on and
then<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.209> can<00:03:58.389> put<00:03:58.660> this<00:03:58.780> one<00:03:58.959> in<00:03:59.079> here<00:03:59.260> on<00:03:59.410> the

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
then you can put this one in here on the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.470 
then you can put this one in here on the
side<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.069> let's<00:04:00.519> take<00:04:00.639> a<00:04:00.669> closer<00:04:00.940> look<00:04:01.060> here

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
side so let's take a closer look here

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.110 
side so let's take a closer look here
now<00:04:01.660> at<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.040> bank<00:04:03.040> your<00:04:03.250> battery<00:04:03.669> which<00:04:04.090> is

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
now at the bank your battery which is

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.300 
now at the bank your battery which is
pretty<00:04:04.419> massive<00:04:04.690> so<00:04:05.379> it<00:04:05.530> has<00:04:05.560> plastic<00:04:06.069> here<00:04:06.220> on

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
pretty massive so it has plastic here on

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.689 
pretty massive so it has plastic here on
the<00:04:06.430> back<00:04:06.690> like<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.720> glossy<00:04:08.410> plastic<00:04:08.829> look<00:04:09.280> kind

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
the back like a glossy plastic look kind

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.990 
the back like a glossy plastic look kind
of<00:04:09.760> minds<00:04:10.319> about<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.980> same<00:04:12.310> feelings<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:12.879> get

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
of minds about the same feelings you get

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.620 
of minds about the same feelings you get
from<00:04:13.269> you<00:04:13.720> know<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.989> new<00:04:14.139> Galaxy<00:04:14.709> devices<00:04:14.829> and

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
from you know the new Galaxy devices and

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.349 
from you know the new Galaxy devices and
then<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.959> over

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
then it over

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.719 
then it over
here<00:04:17.569> you<00:04:17.840> can<00:04:17.989> see<00:04:18.199> the<00:04:18.229> four<00:04:18.799> LED<00:04:19.189> indicators

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
here you can see the four LED indicators

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.129 
here you can see the four LED indicators
so<00:04:19.849> you<00:04:19.909> can<00:04:20.030> see<00:04:20.150> this<00:04:20.239> one<00:04:20.449> has<00:04:20.599> power<00:04:20.870> right

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
so you can see this one has power right

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.899 
so you can see this one has power right
now<00:04:21.169> you<00:04:21.889> also<00:04:22.099> can<00:04:22.639> see<00:04:22.939> that<00:04:24.250> there<00:04:25.250> we<00:04:25.370> go<00:04:25.520> we

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
now you also can see that there we go we

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.969 
now you also can see that there we go we
do<00:04:26.060> have<00:04:26.300> this<00:04:26.449> little<00:04:26.719> flashlight<00:04:27.500> there<00:04:27.740> and

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
do have this little flashlight there and

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.279 
do have this little flashlight there and
so<00:04:28.939> if<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.120> want<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.270> kind<00:04:29.659> of<00:04:29.780> turn<00:04:29.960> this<00:04:30.110> one

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
so if you want to kind of turn this one

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.439 
so if you want to kind of turn this one
off<00:04:30.349> and<00:04:30.650> pretty<00:04:31.280> sure<00:04:31.430> we<00:04:31.550> hold<00:04:31.879> in<00:04:32.090> like<00:04:32.270> this

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
off and pretty sure we hold in like this

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.469 
off and pretty sure we hold in like this
and<00:04:32.719> wait<00:04:34.780> there<00:04:35.780> we<00:04:35.930> go<00:04:36.129> you<00:04:37.129> can<00:04:37.280> see<00:04:37.460> here<00:04:38.270> on

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
and wait there we go you can see here on

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.469 
and wait there we go you can see here on
the<00:04:38.539> left<00:04:38.990> side<00:04:39.259> we<00:04:39.560> do<00:04:39.620> have<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:39.949> in<00:04:40.159> which<00:04:41.150> is

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
the left side we do have the in which is

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.939 
the left side we do have the in which is
where<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.110> place<00:04:42.409> this<00:04:42.650> adapter<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:48.050> then

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
where you place this adapter and then

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.080 
where you place this adapter and then
you<00:04:49.189> can<00:04:49.340> simply<00:04:49.580> put<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.419> arm<00:04:50.750> on<00:04:51.909> here<00:04:52.909> and

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
you can simply put the arm on here and

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.540 
you can simply put the arm on here and
then<00:04:53.659> you<00:04:53.719> plug<00:04:53.930> this<00:04:54.139> other<00:04:54.620> part<00:04:54.979> into<00:04:55.520> a

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
then you plug this other part into a

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.249 
then you plug this other part into a
computer<00:04:55.969> and<00:04:56.300> then<00:04:56.629> you<00:04:56.689> can<00:04:56.810> charge<00:04:57.080> up<00:04:57.229> your

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
computer and then you can charge up your

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.240 
computer and then you can charge up your
anchor<00:04:57.740> when<00:04:58.310> it's<00:04:58.490> running<00:04:58.639> low<00:04:59.029> and<00:05:00.250> then

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
anchor when it's running low and then

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.709 
anchor when it's running low and then
also<00:05:01.490> we<00:05:01.789> have<00:05:01.909> the<00:05:02.029> important<00:05:02.479> thing<00:05:02.689> here

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
also we have the important thing here

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.629 
also we have the important thing here
and<00:05:03.319> that<00:05:03.650> is<00:05:03.800> far<00:05:04.009> too<00:05:04.039> fast<00:05:04.279> like<00:05:04.520> the

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
and that is far too fast like the

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.490 
and that is far too fast like the
portals<00:05:05.060> in<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.479> middle<00:05:05.750> and<00:05:05.960> then<00:05:06.080> we<00:05:06.319> have

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
portals in the middle and then we have

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.490 
portals in the middle and then we have
the<00:05:06.680> help<00:05:06.889> it<00:05:07.069> a<00:05:07.279> the<00:05:08.210> first<00:05:08.449> output<00:05:08.719> here<00:05:09.259> and

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
the help it a the first output here and

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.519 
the help it a the first output here and
that<00:05:10.159> the<00:05:10.460> you<00:05:10.849> know<00:05:10.969> outputs<00:05:11.389> 1000<00:05:12.379> million

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:12.529 
that the you know outputs 1000 million

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.629 
that the you know outputs 1000 million
per<00:05:13.159> hour<00:05:13.370> while<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.419> second<00:05:14.719> outfit<00:05:15.080> here

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
per hour while the second outfit here

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.279 
per hour while the second outfit here
outputs<00:05:16.639> two<00:05:17.449> thousand<00:05:17.779> million<00:05:18.080> per<00:05:18.259> hours

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
outputs two thousand million per hours

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.779 
outputs two thousand million per hours
so<00:05:18.919> let's<00:05:19.159> see<00:05:19.789> here<00:05:20.120> if<00:05:20.330> we<00:05:20.750> can<00:05:21.169> and<00:05:21.729> try<00:05:22.729> this

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
so let's see here if we can and try this

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.999 
so let's see here if we can and try this
one<00:05:23.089> out<00:05:23.319> so<00:05:24.319> we<00:05:24.830> do<00:05:25.009> have<00:05:25.250> a<00:05:25.460> cable<00:05:25.849> here<00:05:27.009> so

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
one out so we do have a cable here so

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:56.719 
one out so we do have a cable here so
let's<00:05:28.819> try<00:05:29.180> it<00:05:29.240> out

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:10.780 

and<00:05:57.729> have<00:05:57.970> the<00:05:58.150> flashlight<00:05:58.750> as<00:05:59.229> well

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.610 

there<00:06:11.790> we<00:06:11.940> go<00:06:12.060> okay<00:06:12.750> so<00:06:12.810> you<00:06:12.990> need<00:06:13.110> to<00:06:13.200> tap<00:06:13.440> on

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
there we go okay so you need to tap on

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.770 
there we go okay so you need to tap on
it<00:06:13.650> once<00:06:13.950> so<00:06:14.730> now<00:06:15.030> you<00:06:15.090> can<00:06:15.240> see<00:06:15.420> that<00:06:15.600> it's

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
it once so now you can see that it's

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.600 
it once so now you can see that it's
charging<00:06:16.200> my<00:06:16.350> device<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:17.070> let's<00:06:17.220> see<00:06:17.340> when<00:06:17.580> I

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
charging my device and let's see when I

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.830 
charging my device and let's see when I
charge<00:06:17.970> my<00:06:18.240> galaxy<00:06:18.720> s4<00:06:19.470> at<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.680> same<00:06:19.890> time

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.880 

then<00:06:24.840> we<00:06:24.990> can<00:06:25.290> go<00:06:25.890> and<00:06:26.250> connect<00:06:26.940> a<00:06:27.320> cable<00:06:28.320> to

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
then we can go and connect a cable to

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:43.430 
then we can go and connect a cable to
this<00:06:29.040> other<00:06:29.250> port<00:06:29.580> here<00:06:40.850> there<00:06:41.850> we<00:06:41.970> go<00:06:42.150> so<00:06:42.900> that

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
this other port here there we go so that

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.820 
this other port here there we go so that
is<00:06:43.530> how<00:06:43.740> easy<00:06:44.100> you<00:06:44.430> use<00:06:44.700> it<00:06:44.910> and<00:06:45.240> of<00:06:45.540> course<00:06:45.870> the

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
is how easy you use it and of course the

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.910 
is how easy you use it and of course the
samsung<00:06:47.460> galaxy<00:06:48.210> s4<00:06:48.570> here<00:06:48.870> will<00:06:49.230> charge<00:06:49.770> up

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920 
samsung galaxy s4 here will charge up

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.850 
samsung galaxy s4 here will charge up
foster<00:06:50.460> yes<00:06:51.090> because<00:06:51.480> it<00:06:51.780> is<00:06:51.960> connected<00:06:52.260> i'm

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
foster yes because it is connected i'm

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.470 
foster yes because it is connected i'm
pretty<00:06:53.010> sure<00:06:53.220> it's<00:06:53.520> connected<00:06:53.970> to<00:06:54.000> the<00:06:54.330> output

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 
pretty sure it's connected to the output

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.960 
pretty sure it's connected to the output
to<00:06:54.870> hear<00:06:55.200> that<00:06:55.650> should<00:06:55.980> output<00:06:56.430> two<00:06:56.640> thousand

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
to hear that should output two thousand

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.210 
to hear that should output two thousand
million<00:06:57.330> per<00:06:57.540> hour<00:06:57.720> and<00:06:58.110> the<00:06:58.560> battery<00:06:58.890> inside

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
million per hour and the battery inside

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.450 
million per hour and the battery inside
of<00:06:59.400> the<00:06:59.520> galaxy<00:07:00.030> s4<00:07:00.450> is<00:07:00.780> a<00:07:01.340> 2600<00:07:02.340> milliamp

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
of the galaxy s4 is a 2600 milliamp

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.000 
of the galaxy s4 is a 2600 milliamp
battery<00:07:03.050> so<00:07:04.050> you<00:07:04.080> should<00:07:04.320> take<00:07:04.530> a<00:07:04.560> little<00:07:04.800> bit

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
battery so you should take a little bit

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.010 
battery so you should take a little bit
more<00:07:05.460> than<00:07:05.610> an<00:07:05.670> hour<00:07:05.790> to<00:07:06.030> charge<00:07:06.390> this<00:07:06.660> one<00:07:06.870> up

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
more than an hour to charge this one up

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.840 
more than an hour to charge this one up
but<00:07:07.410> if<00:07:07.470> you<00:07:07.590> have<00:07:07.860> an<00:07:07.980> older<00:07:08.070> smartphone<00:07:08.760> of

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850 
but if you have an older smartphone of

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.290 
but if you have an older smartphone of
course<00:07:09.090> it<00:07:09.300> will<00:07:09.780> go<00:07:10.020> faster<00:07:10.590> and<00:07:10.980> then<00:07:11.790> we<00:07:12.180> do
