00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.069
 get into the paint section 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.649
 we have to go to mate and paint it 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.849
 gray color is worth it so nothing we take it 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.310
 we painted it in color I saw it as 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:09.759
 serving will be like this and then 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.739
 we'll have to go to pearl for 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.750
 you will see that you can not paint color 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.310
 pearly because we have to paint a 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.099
 Metallic color we just put it 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.680
 to metallic and we do not paint anything we give 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.840
 the circle circulated and circulated now we 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.610
 let's for example to change something by 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.020
 example the wheels and the color of 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.600
 wheels that as it is quite cheap 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.840
 and I say okay so he bought this one that is 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.940
 stopped and it's already like that we catch ourselves 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.400
 we put again color paint 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.430
 pearly and now if they let you clarify 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.020
 the car when they stop loading the car 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.550
 Well, I would simply have to look for the 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.190
 red color like I'm doing here and 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.170
 here is the red that you want to 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.230
 I liked it a lot more but that 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.500
 Well, it 's more aggressive but as I'm already 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.180
 seeing can not be red and gray 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.880
 but nevertheless day is color 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.160
 chocolate as I said earlier and 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.740
 good the truth is that to me this car 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.230
 I like much more than good night 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.030
 that day so well then I hope that 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.690

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.430
