00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.910
 Good day to all I want to show you 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.840
 manicure is very beautiful and it is very 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.779
 visually lengthens the length of the nail 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.930
 I will need a base fixer 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.380
 clear nail polish 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.200
 I also need white daub ca. 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.180
 Here is such a bright pink color 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:36.739
 varnish and it is violet 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:42.140
 blackened the color of the varnish is very beautiful too 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:46.760
 I will need doses and a piece of paper 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:55.090
 where i will wear here so let's start for 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.090
 start i will cover my nails with a base coat 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.450
 devoting to the zone 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.450
 butt end 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.860
 so wait for the varnish to dry well 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.560
 when the varnish is dry I take a bright pink color 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 varnish and put 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.460
 the first not a thick layer 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.330
 so translucent so he quickly 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:35.159
 dried very beautiful color varnish such 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.990
 straight already burning color 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:46.840
 the very ideas that I show on logs 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:49.390
 all this can be done on the gel varnish so 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.119
 now let's wait when the first layer is good 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:57.960
 dries and so dried me up the first layer i 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.960
 apply a second layer 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:06.119
 We pay attention to all areas so as not to 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.119
 we had 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.450
 space bar 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.470
 as we spoke to you in some kind 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.650
 video if we went to the zone 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.730
 cuticles i take such a pusher with rubber 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.730
 tipped and 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.930
 betrayed 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.450
 we are already here 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.120
 neatly and evenly and so now 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.790
 I'll wait when the second layer is good 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.959
 dry I will continue to dry with me 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.350
 second coat of varnish 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.860
 I am a road so black color lacquer very 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:55.150
 beautiful insanely beautiful on 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:02.760
 nails and as monophonic option 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.760
 and take in mind here such a line 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.440
 and paint over 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:28.530
 like this 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:31.670
 and I do the same with the second handles 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.670
 with second finger 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.780
 and paint over 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.020
 and we do it 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:05.519
 here are two fingers 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:10.799
 Now you need to wait for this layer 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:14.370
 dried out well when dried out well blackened 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:19.310

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.310

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:37.620
 take 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.620
 the very same little ball and 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:49.870
 dipping 20 white cycles to 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.870

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.940
 manicure 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:51.440
