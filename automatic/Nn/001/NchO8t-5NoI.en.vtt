they're still strong the visibility is

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.790 
they're still strong the visibility is
still<00:00:10.280> challenging<00:00:11.080> what<00:00:12.080> they<00:00:12.230> were<00:00:12.290> doing

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
still challenging what they were doing

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.100 
still challenging what they were doing
overnight<00:00:13.220> was<00:00:13.580> they<00:00:13.730> brought<00:00:13.880> in<00:00:14.180> for<00:00:14.540> squid

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.900 
overnight was they brought in for squid
fishing<00:00:15.470> boats<00:00:15.710> which<00:00:16.340> have<00:00:16.519> very<00:00:16.760> very

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
fishing boats which have very very

fishing boats which have very very
powerful<00:00:17.510> lights<00:00:17.720> for<00:00:17.960> attracting<00:00:18.350> squid<00:00:18.650> and

powerful lights for attracting squid and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.680 
powerful lights for attracting squid and
as<00:00:19.039> this<00:00:19.190> was<00:00:19.369> an<00:00:19.460> idea<00:00:19.789> proposed<00:00:20.420> by<00:00:20.570> the

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
as this was an idea proposed by the

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.660 
as this was an idea proposed by the
families<00:00:21.170> to<00:00:22.070> enable<00:00:22.340> them<00:00:22.430> to<00:00:22.460> work

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
families to enable them to work

families to enable them to work
overnight<00:00:22.940> those<00:00:23.300> boats<00:00:23.660> have<00:00:23.869> been

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
overnight those boats have been

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.200 
overnight those boats have been
projecting<00:00:24.949> their<00:00:25.160> lights<00:00:25.460> onto<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:25.880> surface

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
projecting their lights onto the surface

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.750 
projecting their lights onto the surface
of<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.420> sea<00:00:26.600> and<00:00:26.840> helping<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.680> divers<00:00:28.100> to

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
of the sea and helping the divers to

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.849 
of the sea and helping the divers to
work<00:00:28.970> their<00:00:29.359> way<00:00:29.390> into<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.019> cabins<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:30.740> for

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
work their way into the cabins and for

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.109 
work their way into the cabins and for
the<00:00:30.920> first<00:00:31.130> time<00:00:31.310> overnight<00:00:31.730> we've<00:00:31.910> had

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
the first time overnight we've had

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.360 
the first time overnight we've had
bodies<00:00:33.050> some<00:00:33.559> of<00:00:33.649> which<00:00:33.770> they<00:00:33.950> were<00:00:34.100> able<00:00:34.220> to

see yesterday they were able to get

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.200 
see yesterday they were able to get
those<00:00:36.380> by<00:00:36.559> breaking<00:00:36.980> windows<00:00:37.309> and<00:00:37.610> pull<00:00:38.090> them

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
those by breaking windows and pull them

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
is still a very slow process and

the ship ready to start lifting it the

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.080 
the ship ready to start lifting it the
reason<00:01:27.469> they<00:01:27.560> haven't<00:01:27.740> done<00:01:27.979> that<00:01:28.039> is<00:01:28.490> because

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
reason they haven't done that is because

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.339 
reason they haven't done that is because
as<00:01:29.209> long<00:01:29.359> as<00:01:29.419> there<00:01:29.689> was<00:01:29.810> even<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.139> faintest

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:30.349 
as long as there was even the faintest

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:32.679

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
hope of survivors they couldn't start

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.419 
hope of survivors they couldn't start
lifting<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:33.200> hull<00:01:33.469> but<00:01:33.709> I<00:01:33.770> think<00:01:34.009> once<00:01:34.219> the

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
lifting that hull but I think once the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:35.769 
lifting that hull but I think once the
families<00:01:34.789> agree<00:01:35.149> and<00:01:35.299> we're<00:01:35.389> not<00:01:35.450> sure<00:01:35.630> they

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:35.779 
families agree and we're not sure they

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:37.779 
families agree and we're not sure they
do<00:01:35.840> yet<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.349> that<00:01:36.499> should<00:01:36.709> start<00:01:36.950> that's<00:01:37.579> the

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
do yet that that should start that's the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.519 
do yet that that should start that's the
way<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.029> operation<00:01:38.149> will<00:01:38.779> go<00:01:38.959> and<00:01:39.169> even<00:01:39.380> that

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:39.529 
way the operation will go and even that

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:41.769 
way the operation will go and even that
will<00:01:39.709> probably<00:01:40.039> take<00:01:40.219> many<00:01:40.399> days<00:01:40.639> and<00:01:41.450> we

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:41.779 
will probably take many days and we

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:44.260 
will probably take many days and we
understand<00:01:42.289> that<00:01:42.529> this<00:01:43.029> operation<00:01:44.029> could

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
understand that this operation could

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.019 
understand that this operation could
take<00:01:44.569> up<00:01:44.779> to<00:01:44.840> two<00:01:45.469> months<00:01:45.499> that<00:01:46.189> is<00:01:46.489> a<00:01:46.520> very

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:47.029 
take up to two months that is a very

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:49.539 
take up to two months that is a very
long<00:01:47.329> time<00:01:47.659> for<00:01:47.989> those<00:01:48.109> family<00:01:49.039> members<00:01:49.399> to

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
long time for those family members to

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.639 
long time for those family members to
wait<00:01:52.179> it's<00:01:53.179> awful<00:01:53.569> but<00:01:53.779> it<00:01:53.869> is<00:01:53.989> the<00:01:54.139> reality<00:01:54.289> of

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649
