00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.360
 the rest is still in development 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.719
 the integral formation of and of our 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.169
 force most players the challenge is 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.549
 focused on trying to produce more 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.549
 number of players 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.310
 if it's how much 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.730
 not only be good and excellent 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.640
 football players but also 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:32.480
 be balanced between 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.579
 directly active in turn the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.379
 goal is to first meet anything with 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.629
 a benefit that we give to the 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.550
 schools that is the provide them 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.720
 training once a year in this case 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.760
 well in the best way of the best 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.949
 quality with a figure as per 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.960
 force one what a character 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.079
 internationally recognized level 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.589
 world and the intention is to give them a 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.940
 methodology already established and that this to 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.290
 its time is translated into the formation of 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.780
 better boys for the two forces 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.910
 Basic from 17 years 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.860
 one year after admission into the 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.800
 public advocacy 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.500
 We invite the child to participate one 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.920
 Striped academy in Monterrey 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.210
 for in the city the first steps and the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.280
 first step for the child would be what goes 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.179
 to the ability to play in football 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.060
 three against three to four goals this 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.810
 we have shown it last year all 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.200
 the technicians were delighted 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.070
 not the technicians the trainers were 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.649
 delighted with this game the basis of 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.950
 system is the space relationship a child 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:48.450
 young space and to the extent that the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.210
 space be very big as the child 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.520
 enter many months much less times 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.060
 in contact with the ball in such a way 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.979
 that if the girl moss the space the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.409
 physical tactical technical participation is 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.990
 much more constant that is the basis of 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.810
 principle of the training method if 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.640
 After that, he's going to put 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.280
 disposition of all coaches 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.500
 so the exercises a catalog of 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.720
 coaches' exercises are going to 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.180
 can consult 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.000
 exercises are those that can apply in 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.360
 the schools of klinsmann a former champion 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.870
 of the world the player of the German team 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.930
 who won the World Cup in 90 he has 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.460
 said you are 20 years ahead of what 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.400
 we think about football damage 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.310
 even scratched can be 20 years 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.430
 in front of all other clubs applying 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.880
 in its basic strengths my method yes 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.560
 we continue to play at a goal 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.140
 centralized as we have done in the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.450
 last 100 years we will not get more 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.630
 far that we have always arrived is 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.840
 desert we have to innovate do things 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.740
 new to improve performance 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.430
 because the methods that have led us to 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.239
 manufacture players 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.629
 how about the year 1950 logically they are not 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.510
 for books 60 years later the 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.790
 benefits is quality training from 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.140
 first line of a century like this 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.540
 have a trainer who 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.220
 nothing more and nothing less trains clubs 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.750

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.300
 important federations such as 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.480

 of power with the part of the forces 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.500
 basic from the point of view 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:55.790
