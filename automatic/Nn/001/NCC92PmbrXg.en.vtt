but essentially what this game is it's a

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.219 
but essentially what this game is it's a
combination<00:00:46.479> of<00:00:46.780> a<00:00:46.870> bunch<00:00:46.899> of<00:00:47.170> different

along<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.929> lines<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.469> magic<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.489> gathering

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
along the lines of magic the gathering

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.000 
along the lines of magic the gathering
where<00:01:01.149> you<00:01:01.269> have<00:01:01.449> cards<00:01:01.989> you<00:01:02.499> have<00:01:02.619> to<00:01:02.739> tap

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
where you have cards you have to tap

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.610 
where you have cards you have to tap
resources<00:01:03.879> with<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.660> ultimate<00:01:04.900> goal<00:01:05.350> of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
resources with the ultimate goal of

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.060 
resources with the ultimate goal of
destroying<00:01:06.370> the<00:01:07.120> five<00:01:07.450> totems<00:01:08.200> or<00:01:08.380> idols<00:01:08.860> on

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
destroying the five totems or idols on

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.660 
destroying the five totems or idols on
the<00:01:09.580> side<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.180> map<00:01:10.390> that<00:01:10.540> you<00:01:10.720> do<00:01:10.930> not<00:01:11.080> own

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the side of the map that you do not own

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.910 
the side of the map that you do not own
so<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.970> gameplay<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.900> very<00:01:14.140> difficult<00:01:14.620> to

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
so the gameplay is very difficult to

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.250 
so the gameplay is very difficult to
break<00:01:15.160> down<00:01:15.400> in<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.910> very<00:01:16.150> short<00:01:16.360> like<00:01:16.870> four<00:01:17.170> or

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
break down in a very short like four or

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.710 
break down in a very short like four or
five<00:01:17.290> minute<00:01:17.710> commentary<00:01:18.280> but<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:19.150> reminds<00:01:19.570> me

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
five minute commentary but it reminds me

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.320

down and like arrows are flying across
the<00:04:50.570> screen<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:50.990> stuff<00:04:51.200> it<00:04:51.350> I<00:04:51.500> mean<00:04:51.830> the

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
the screen and stuff it I mean the

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.950 
the screen and stuff it I mean the
animations<00:04:52.340> are<00:04:52.460> very<00:04:53.030> fluid<00:04:53.450> they're<00:04:53.780> very

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
interesting they're cute to look at but

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.510 
interesting they're cute to look at but
i<00:04:56.180> would<00:04:56.389> say<00:04:56.510> action<00:04:57.080> wise<00:04:57.310> you<00:04:58.310> should

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
i would say action wise you should

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.770 
i would say action wise you should
probably<00:04:58.580> avoid<00:04:58.850> this<00:04:59.180> game<00:04:59.360> if<00:04:59.510> you're<00:04:59.630> not

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
into like the turn-based strategy type

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.840 
into like the turn-based strategy type
game<00:05:02.060> but<00:05:02.600> if<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:03.350> are<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:04.580> love

with<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.680> game<00:05:18.860> I<00:05:19.070> mean<00:05:19.220> the<00:05:19.340> only<00:05:19.490> issue<00:05:19.820> I

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
with the game I mean the only issue I

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.120 
with the game I mean the only issue I
have<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:20.600> far<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:21.080> it<00:05:21.500> might<00:05:21.650> be<00:05:21.680> because<00:05:21.860> I'm

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
have so far and it might be because I'm

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.370 
have so far and it might be because I'm
just<00:05:22.310> pretty<00:05:22.640> inexperienced<00:05:22.970> at<00:05:23.810> this<00:05:24.020> point

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
just pretty inexperienced at this point

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.379 
just pretty inexperienced at this point
right<00:05:24.590> now<00:05:24.620> but<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.490> game<00:05:25.669> can<00:05:25.940> be<00:05:25.970> very

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
right now but the game can be very

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.810 
right now but the game can be very
difficult<00:05:26.780> especially<00:05:27.320> even<00:05:28.100> on<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.550> easy

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
difficult especially even on the easy

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.750 
difficult especially even on the easy
setting<00:05:29.360> I've<00:05:30.140> been<00:05:30.440> getting<00:05:30.770> destroyed<00:05:31.370> by

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
setting I've been getting destroyed by

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.969 
setting I've been getting destroyed by
some<00:05:31.820> things<00:05:32.540> and<00:05:32.690> I'm<00:05:32.810> getting<00:05:33.200> better<00:05:33.410> very

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
some things and I'm getting better very

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.340 
some things and I'm getting better very
slowly<00:05:34.340> so<00:05:34.550> I'm<00:05:34.790> not<00:05:34.970> going<00:05:35.150> to<00:05:35.300> say<00:05:35.540> that<00:05:36.229> the

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
slowly so I'm not going to say that the

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.440 
slowly so I'm not going to say that the
difficulty<00:05:36.860> is<00:05:37.010> too<00:05:37.280> high<00:05:37.580> at<00:05:37.820> this<00:05:37.940> point<00:05:38.270> but

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
difficulty is too high at this point but

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.719 
difficulty is too high at this point but
it's<00:05:39.080> very<00:05:39.530> difficult<00:05:39.890> you<00:05:40.190> have<00:05:40.310> to<00:05:40.430> invest

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
it's very difficult you have to invest

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.540 
it's very difficult you have to invest
some<00:05:40.910> time<00:05:40.940> to<00:05:41.479> study<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:42.050> decks<00:05:42.289> know<00:05:43.010> what

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
some time to study the decks know what

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.550 
some time to study the decks know what
cards<00:05:43.970> do<00:05:44.210> what<00:05:44.539> they<00:05:44.690> actually<00:05:44.840> mean<00:05:45.110> when

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
cards do what they actually mean when

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.529 
cards do what they actually mean when
you<00:05:45.650> put<00:05:45.800> them<00:05:45.950> down<00:05:46.220> and<00:05:46.580> so<00:05:47.120> on<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:47.390> so<00:05:47.419> forth

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
you put them down and so on and so forth

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:48.820 
you put them down and so on and so forth
but<00:05:47.870> I'm<00:05:47.960> gonna<00:05:48.110> end<00:05:48.260> the<00:05:48.320> video<00:05:48.410> there<00:05:48.680> guys
