so I do recommend this product for all
skin<00:04:21.690> types<00:04:21.720> especially<00:04:22.380> for<00:04:22.920> oily<00:04:23.220> skin

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
skin types especially for oily skin

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.360 
skin types especially for oily skin
because<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.780> rest<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.260> my<00:04:25.440> foundation<00:04:25.650> is

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
because the rest of my foundation is

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.600 
because the rest of my foundation is
like<00:04:26.820> oily<00:04:27.270> my<00:04:27.450> t-zone<00:04:27.690> but<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.710> concealer

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
like oily my t-zone but that concealer

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.900 
like oily my t-zone but that concealer
it<00:04:29.850> doesn't<00:04:30.300> crease<00:04:30.510> or<00:04:30.750> oily<00:04:31.170> at<00:04:31.290> all<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:32.340> it

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
it doesn't crease or oily at all and it

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.930 
it doesn't crease or oily at all and it
lasts<00:04:33.240> longer<00:04:33.870> so<00:04:34.560> it's<00:04:34.980> a<00:04:35.160> long-lasting

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
lasts longer so it's a long-lasting

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.230 
lasts longer so it's a long-lasting
concealer<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.780> really<00:04:37.170> love<00:04:37.380> it<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:38.060> it's<00:04:39.060> a

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
concealer I really love it so it's a

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.900 
concealer I really love it so it's a
good<00:04:39.480> concealer<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.860> highlighter<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.490> put

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
good concealer and a highlighter I put

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.620 
good concealer and a highlighter I put
some<00:04:42.180> on<00:04:42.420> my<00:04:42.450> nose<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:44.240> underneath<00:04:45.240> my

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
some on my nose and underneath my

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.550 
some on my nose and underneath my
eyebrows<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:47.570> recommend<00:04:48.570> that<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:48.990> just<00:04:49.320> put

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
eyebrows I recommend that you just put

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.220 
eyebrows I recommend that you just put
it<00:04:49.680> like<00:04:49.710> under<00:04:50.460> your<00:04:50.490> eyes<00:04:50.820> or<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.990> highlight

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
it like under your eyes or to highlight

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.220 
it like under your eyes or to highlight
your<00:04:52.590> face<00:04:52.650> that's<00:04:53.340> it<00:04:53.580> so<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.240> only<00:04:54.420> downside

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
your face that's it so the only downside

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.250 
your face that's it so the only downside
that<00:04:55.260> I<00:04:55.680> can<00:04:56.100> tell<00:04:56.490> you<00:04:56.670> guys<00:04:56.850> is<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.450> little<00:04:58.110> bit

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
that I can tell you guys is a little bit

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.980 
that I can tell you guys is a little bit
pricey<00:04:58.500> but<00:04:59.430> it's<00:04:59.670> worth<00:05:00.000> it<00:05:00.240> because<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.780> has

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
pricey but it's worth it because it has

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.650 
pricey but it's worth it because it has
good<00:05:01.260> packaging<00:05:01.950> and<00:05:02.190> it's<00:05:02.490> long<00:05:02.820> lasting<00:05:03.390> I

good packaging and it's long lasting I

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.810 
good packaging and it's long lasting I
think<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.470> good<00:05:04.770> for<00:05:04.800> all<00:05:05.130> skin<00:05:05.550> tone
