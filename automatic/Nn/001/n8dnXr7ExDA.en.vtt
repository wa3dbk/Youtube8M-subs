00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.070
 I play the game , I say it, I do not play 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.720
 but I've heard a lot about him and 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.170
 my friends are super hooked on him 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.570
 and I do not know, I thought it seemed pretty 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.080

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.840
 we go enough so good to tell you that 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.040
 We are bringing three little things and we are going to 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.680
 see them 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.930
 Well, I'm going to show you the first one 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.619
 first mod let's say or the first thing that 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.240
 add the mod 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.240
 and good to tell you that it is 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.729
 is the barbarian or the barbarian 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.500
 hello how good to tell you that the 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.530
 Barbarian does nothing or it is not 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.010
 a do not say does not act like a creature 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.870
 hostile 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.870
 we are going to put ourselves in 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.180
 in his rival and as you see I hit him and he 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.149
 it does not do anything to me, it's not burning 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.740
 because because it's daytime and for example 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.170
 this is so peaceful but good I'm going to 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.509
 leave it in peaceful and supposedly if 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.759
 was in peace the zombies and 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.460
 all the monsters would not appear and he 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.399
 Well yes it is so good as you see 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.969
 that's the barbarian does nothing that is not 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.060
 it does nothing and it does not take long enough 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.769
 very accomplished not extremely not but 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.980
 good is minecraft are squares that 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.870
 we can do it and we have done it 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.810
 quite 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.690
 quite good because it's the turn of the 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.950
 lady archer and good here you have it is 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.310
 the typical archer of tdt clash of plants 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.959
 and well really this I have not seen photos 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.879
 I have seen photos I do not know if it will look like 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.290
 a lot or not leave it in the comments 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.079
 but come on I think I think if 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.640
 I really do not know, I suppose so, yes 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.470
 barbarian yes it seems because the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.690
 archer we would look and good that 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.690
 does the archer will attack us the goalkeeper 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.010
 let's check it 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.000
 is surrounded 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.770
 As you can see, we are bounced by arrows 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.120
 good fails a few too 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.120
 and if I get in front of me 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.640
 attack attacks but it's not that you do not 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.430
 do nothing 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.500
 it does not do anything to us as you see this is so 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.680
 peaceful therefore this is not 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.239
 moix that they are going to appear worth that is not 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.790
 like a zombie that appears by any 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.530
 site these are not things that 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.730
 I just know 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.910
 if you used to make your small your 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.200
 small village like this and put us then 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.360
 to do battles little by little they will go 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.610
 adding things to the mod as I say still 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.560
 There is one thing to see but we are going 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.870
 these are not things that appear in 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.970
 minecraft naturally 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.349
 good guys then last and not least 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:50.340
 important we have the canyon here we have 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:53.580
 a cannon to camera that cool is seems 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.849
 it looks like an average animal we hit a 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.000
 good animal this doing as this is 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.610
 a cannon that will defend us or attack 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.849
 and you will say how he will attack us as well 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.129
 if I put myself like this if I put myself in 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.409
 his opponent does anything better not me not 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.630
 he attacks me he does not do anything to me but if I do 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.590
 A) Yes 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.590
 Oh 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.000
 this when I go to kill I put a 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.490
 creative but as you can see it attacks us 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.430
 left a heart and a half removed almost 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.970
 four and is more than four hearts 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.280
 by arrow that is very tied and good 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.110
 as I say it can also defend us if 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.060
 and you will say against who is going to 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.620
 defend then good will defend us 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.630
 against the barbarian and the archer is worth and the 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.070
 archer better said these are the three 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.620
 eggs that the mod brings and good ones 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.780
 you find here is worth the mod add this 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.150
 plans but nothing appears here 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.190
 as I say, they have already updated the world and 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.840
 here many other things will appear but 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.240
 good for now as you see you release these 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.760
 three things and well the canyon as you see 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.840
 to attack the barbarian and the barbarian and the 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.840
 barbarian is going to take out the cannon 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.580
 won the cannon the two that the cannon is 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.710
 very powerful is very powerful as you see 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.490
 It takes a lot of damage since it is here so 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.629
 pretty and good is 20 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.300
 has the same life that we could have 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:25.729
 us and the barbarian too and the 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.369
 archer also has 20 life and dj's 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.539
 and because it holds the gun more than the 

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:32.479
 barbarian because of what I have told you 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:35.089
 because the cannon removes more does more damage 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.919
 therefore kills him before and the good 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:39.309
 archer can you look like how they attack 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.309
 among them 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.770
 is what I'm telling you the cannon is 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.990
 very very very op 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.540
 the truth is that I'm pretty cool and nothing 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.760
 I'll put one here and another 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.560
 here and another one here and another one here and 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.690
 I do not know the truth that they quite cool and 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.220
 well this map this map has something that 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.020
 see with the mode this is generated by the mod 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.760
 Well, it's not just any map that has 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.590
 built someone who gets bored a lot 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.080
 that by the way all this you have to the 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.480
 description both the mod and the map and 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.460
 Well the map is just in case 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.930
 if you want to play style putting these 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.460
 little things that if for example you want 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.770
 put you want to put 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.039
 the cannons here you can put them 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:27.190
 cannons in all this and when they appear 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:27.190
 you archer here as you see accents 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.860
 they will fight among themselves and it will fly 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.230
 so guys I hope you like it 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.410
 very much as I say the mod is in phase 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.420
 beta very early beta phase or I do not know how 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.810
 call it but let's say it's in a phase 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.870
 very early yet and soon they will add 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:50.080
 more things be attentive to this mod 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.030
 because it's going to be a joy within 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.020
 very little and if you do not already see it so 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.700
 nothing guys I hope you liked it 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.990
 very much you have the links in the 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:02.540
 description and see you
