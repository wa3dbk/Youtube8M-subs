00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.300 
band that just came out maybe a week ago
I<00:00:57.730> would<00:00:57.790> say<00:00:58.060> and<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:59.320> been<00:00:59.890> a<00:00:59.920> pretty

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
I would say and it's been a pretty

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.220 
I would say and it's been a pretty
highly<00:01:00.610> anticipating<00:01:01.390> maybe<00:01:01.570> not<00:01:01.780> for<00:01:01.960> me<00:01:02.050> but

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
highly anticipating maybe not for me but

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.860 
highly anticipating maybe not for me but
for<00:01:02.290> many<00:01:02.560> people<00:01:02.980> has<00:01:03.220> because<00:01:04.120> really<00:01:04.750> i

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
for many people has because really i

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.840 
for many people has because really i
mean<00:01:05.050> i<00:01:05.290> love<00:01:05.650> them<00:01:05.860> may<00:01:06.100> cry<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.580> this<00:01:06.670> is

pretty much in the style devil may cry
and<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.530> reason<00:01:08.800> was<00:01:08.920> anticipating<00:01:09.640> it<00:01:09.760> that

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
and the reason was anticipating it that

classic<00:02:28.989> ninja<00:02:29.530> scroll<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.130> think<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.700> was

classic ninja scroll I think that was

classic ninja scroll I think that was
her<00:02:30.910> last<00:02:31.180> role<00:02:31.630> she<00:02:32.050> did<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.709> this<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.190> a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
her last role she did so this is a

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.509 
her last role she did so this is a
pretty<00:02:33.550> much<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.730> return<00:02:34.540> for<00:02:34.930> her<00:02:35.019> for<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.190> don't

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
well I mean it's hard I don't think that

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.439 
well I mean it's hard I don't think that
because<00:04:55.520> it<00:04:55.669> isn't<00:04:55.970> i<00:04:56.030> played<00:04:56.270> on<00:04:56.419> easy

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
because it isn't i played on easy

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.749 
because it isn't i played on easy
obviously<00:04:57.259> but<00:04:57.440> usually<00:04:57.889> on<00:04:58.159> devil<00:04:58.460> may<00:04:58.550> cry

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
obviously but usually on devil may cry

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.490

if<00:04:58.940> it's<00:04:59.090> easy<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.780> means<00:04:59.960> it's<00:05:00.110> hard<00:05:00.349> on

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
if it's easy that means it's hard on

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.129 
if it's easy that means it's hard on
most<00:05:00.740> games<00:05:00.979> so<00:05:01.789> yeah<00:05:02.030> it's<00:05:02.419> not<00:05:02.659> that<00:05:02.900> hard

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
most games so yeah it's not that hard

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
definitely the uh you know I said the

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.129 
definitely the uh you know I said the
graphics<00:05:43.090> were<00:05:43.240> the<00:05:43.330> best<00:05:43.510> part<00:05:43.750> I<00:05:43.960> should

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
graphics were the best part I should

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.110 
graphics were the best part I should
have<00:05:44.229> said<00:05:44.350> this<00:05:44.500> was<00:05:44.740> because<00:05:44.949> I<00:05:45.280> wasn't

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120
