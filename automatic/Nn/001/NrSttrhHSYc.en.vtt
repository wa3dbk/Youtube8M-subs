00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:26.240
 First, congratulations on your debut on 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.250
 Berlinale film multi-year trial with 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.779
 many different meanings like 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.430
 would you formulate what you would like 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.620
 make a picture may not be only 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.800
 plot but somehow here in a big sense 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.150
 thematically well first of all my film 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.300
 probably high feelings 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.980
 about what we would like ourselves 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.300
 represent ideally 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:54.079
 about the feelings that we experience every 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:55.489
 day but no one exalted possible and 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.470
 possible aspect 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.420
 despite the fact that the film is present 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.350
 a certain sociality and the film is very 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:07.940
 realistic but nonetheless these people 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.720
 understands a lot what faith is 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.350
 such freedom 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.690
 what is hear yourself what is understand 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.720
 make yourself respect and make 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.810
 respect other people but that's about it 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.569
 probably did not want to speak as a whole 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.340
 your main character is already in the power of choice 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.330
 actress you look like being from 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.390
 another world 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.610
 she's like an alien among those 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.709
 the reality in which she abandoned 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.940
 by fate 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.920
 attention is drawn to what she is like 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.840
 would be a man of another culture 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.970
 she is a musician she appears European 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.509
 music and yet connect something 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.700
 her with roots than with ethnos culture 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:52.160
 I think that primarily with education 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.310
 because elsa anna call mylochka and she 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.209
 grew up in the same atmosphere she is beautiful 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.459
 knows the foundations and mentality of these people and 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.950
 she is probably the same as they are but 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.670
 just her internal state probably 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.259
 bothers her 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.540
 realize your roots and feel 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.580
 this energy in general and feel 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.590
 that we are together because the moment and 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.330
 there is a moment of renunciation in some kind 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.560
 sense of 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.489
 and for me it was important to have a heroine 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.480
 realized 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.519
 who is she from where is she from because in 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.060
 this is our strength the strength of any 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.459
 man know who that is, please pay 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.290
 attention to the film itself to the smallest 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.190
 the details 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.690
 stylized or aged 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.610
 adjusting will say in 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.190
 national Kalmyk blocks literally 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.310
 from a small earring to a kirata logical 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.959
 style in the narrow heroine one Kalmyk 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.670
 language truth himself speak it so and 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.920
 older generation younger notes and 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.930
 still in Russian i also drew 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.209
 attention to the fact that even in episodes 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.599
 even minor persons passing by 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.790
 doctor or by jumping north only 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:05.620
 Kalmyks you wanted to take in the famous 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:09.190
 sense national threw I wanted to take off 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.480
 real movie cinema which reflects 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.760
 Kalmyks today and we live in Russia we 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.690
 a long time living in russia we speak 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.579
 in Russian 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.319
 but still we keep ours from 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.209
 ancient culture and it manifests itself 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.400
 in the details that you noticed 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.739
 and for me it was probably very important 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.220
 use exactly what is inherent 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.280
 Kalmyk and to whom it is to some extent 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.040
 I would not like to shoot in any way 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.139
 happens on a graphic film this is due 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.019
 only with some kind of inner culture 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.609
 upbringing and atmosphere probably 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.690
 some kind of harmonies that are inherent 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:49.030
 it is to us in the program of the berlinale 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.319
 another Kalmyk film tavern zone 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.420
 how Kalmyk road 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.549
 uh it gave occasion to some critics 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.099
 head just the appearance of self 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.859
 Kalmyk cinema is 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.650
 exaggeration or maybe I really hope 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.150
 that this is exactly the day when we 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.000
 We are present at the birth of Kolyvan 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.760
 Cinema and I am very glad that in the world 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.889
 there was an interest in our culture and that 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.840
 for the first time we can talk on such 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.479
 a big site about who we are and 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.479
 show all the beauty let's say our 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.849
 cultures and may be deeper all aspects 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.039
 some kind of well our feature on our 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.930
 cultures and it's very cool what 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.580
 there is such a thing because a lot 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.840
 years ago when I first participated on 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.970
 international festivals of their own rink 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.280
 mitral film asked me what 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.139
 This is a film language, this is a Kalmyk movie and 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.639
 then there was no clue and it was 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.970
 then I got the idea that 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.380
 someday she will appear last 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.180
 question did you work face 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.860
 non-professional actresses who 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.259
 of course get used to the podium my camera well 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.530
 completely different context than more 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.729
 the complexity of how you even worked yourself 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.380
 the fact is that in the movie basically 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.750
 filmed non-professional actors and 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.570
 the difficulty was in creating certain 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.360
 the conditions of her immersion sometimes up must 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.340
 what did we get because zhenya 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.789
 trusted me completely 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.840
 and she researched to the smallest detail 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:16.060
 Well my some advice and never fails 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.330
 doubted what I was saying and this 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.740
 trust of course it gave such a result 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.500
 for non-professional artists 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.430
 very important well very important probably 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.630
 keep one on one side 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.440
 authenticity but on the other hand manage 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:38.199
 put it on screen 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.210
 director and join that concept in 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.650
 In general, fully to 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.020
 the viewer felt 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.810
 and I think that the genie and she succeeded 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.479
 she is very talented i wish her to 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.909
 In general, a big movie career now 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.979
 she studies actress I think we are still 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:55.979
 hear and see it on screen
