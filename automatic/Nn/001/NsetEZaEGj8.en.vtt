we go boom kobe 7 what the kobes what a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.540 
we go boom kobe 7 what the kobes what a
great<00:01:00.270> concept<00:01:00.899> they've<00:01:01.379> had<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.070> donks

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550

great concept they've had what the donks
and<00:01:02.760> i<00:01:02.940> think<00:01:03.780> they've<00:01:03.899> had<00:01:04.049> another<00:01:04.470> model

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and i think they've had another model

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.160 
and i think they've had another model
shoe<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.939> inspired<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
shoe but this inspired by the what the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.070 
shoe but this inspired by the what the
dunk<00:01:07.380> where<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.100> take<00:01:08.340> all<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.659> kobe<00:01:09.930> 7

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
dunk where they take all of the kobe 7

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.200 
dunk where they take all of the kobe 7
predators<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.740> put<00:01:10.920> them<00:01:11.040> into<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.400> shoe<00:01:11.670> but

predators and put them into one shoe but

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
predators and put them into one shoe but
this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.570> unique<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.350> what<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> dump

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
this is unique because the what the dump

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.940 
this is unique because the what the dump
was<00:01:14.100> they<00:01:14.729> cut<00:01:15.509> pieces<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.200> other<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.920> the
