00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.719
 how are you welcome here to this 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.670
 new video and good because this time 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.260
 I bring you more information about 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.180
 Naruto is a 4 with a well ordered 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.099
 revolution and it's good that we've been 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.320
 mentioned the fact that the game to 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.520
 have available now that post 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.470
 fords with scenarios 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.180
 Well, let's say that they are going to be able to alter 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.619
 in the middle of the fight we 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.689
 we remember in these two for example the 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.489
 battle against hitachi what good comes 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.650
 a point at which we change from 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.050
 scenario with the with the destruction of 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.370
 what was the use of kirin and what good 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.589
 it was changed with the use of his 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.030
 blood and other good apparently in what 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.059
 which it is the new generation os 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.040
 playstation 4 pc and xbox one are going to do 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.659
 that these scenarios are dynamic and 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.760
 that the conversion is according to 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.589
 happening the combat there are games of 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.479
 fights in which this happens from a 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.220
 very similar way however good 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.839
 It is the first time that this is going to 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.820
 use what this storm then 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.049
 let's see how they are doing, not them 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.820
 they mention that with the power of 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.040
 playstation 4 will be able to make 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.799
 graphics and all the beauty of this game 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.380
 be after let's say brought to reality 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.850
 ok another important and good thing that to me 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.070
 I think a little more to highlight is 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.780
 the fact that it will be available what 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.850
 that is the stone lic that was a 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.159
 as well as online tournaments that 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.630
 can organize let's say that from the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.119
 good namco page from the page 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.580
 of the storm league that good were species 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.500
 of world tournaments with respect to this 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.299
 it was not available anything more a moment 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.340
 in what was the revolution if I did not 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.960
 wrong and good because apparently they are going 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.479
 to bring back for what is this 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.460
 title ok in the truth is that I find 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.740
 pretty good strategy especially 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.630
 what calls me more attention to me and 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.759
 directly what of the voices since 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.649
 well many people liked what the 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.330
 style that was handled in what was 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.740
 strong 2 and good to nÃ©stor andrÃ©s lost 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.179
 like a little taste the truth 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.090
 that the bottles of these two are 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.220
 especially great club and the good 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.899
 of four tails against orochimaru or as 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.820
 I mentioned the diet with traces that 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.159
 the truth is that they are spectacular 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.380
 so that they can make these changes 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.000
 a little more radical so it's the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.890
 new generation and the truth is that 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.050
 another important thing comes quite well 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.760
 it's good that the fact that 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.370
 the game is going to run at 1080 I would say 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.230
 a rudeness that was not like that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.060
 besides that surely it will be 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.250
 running at whatever 60 frames like that 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.470
 that we will have this game in beauty 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.030
 Total what we could 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.640
 observing for example some gameplays 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.350
 modified from the PC version that 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.910
 good they managed to unlock what is the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.040
 game to run 60 frames and the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.260
 it's true that it's beautiful it looks pretty 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.060
 fluid and good then we can not wait 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.860
 as you will see in what is the new 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.100
 generation let's hope they really do 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.960
 something important and do not simply 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.730
 Well, let's say that something like that simply 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.500
 be able to have the same graphic engine of no 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.240
 do absolutely nothing new with what 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.640
 what is the game and simply because 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.860
 copypaste arlo not the truth is that good 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.450
 let's wait for important things to save 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.340
 with him you know there are things some things 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.080
 that bother us many of the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.400
 users currently at the revolution 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.650
 then let's hope they hear the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.150
 feedback that people give you 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.770
 advice that they want to give and good 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.840
 we hope you are open to listen 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.640
 Well, opinions of us who are the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.870
 that we really enjoy this is not 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.580
 good people so do not forget to leave your 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.860
 like to share with your friends and good 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.980
 I see you next dismissal days I was going 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.980
