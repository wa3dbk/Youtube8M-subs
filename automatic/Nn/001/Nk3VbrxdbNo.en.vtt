to a stop well on a horse it's much like

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.320 
to a stop well on a horse it's much like
that<00:04:21.389> this<00:04:22.290> is<00:04:22.440> he's<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.620> break<00:04:23.070> but<00:04:24.000> it's<00:04:24.120> like

that this is he's a break but it's like

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.750 
that this is he's a break but it's like
a<00:04:24.360> clutch<00:04:24.780> if<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.650> do<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.830> hit<00:04:26.100> this<00:04:26.310> engagement

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
a clutch if I do a hit this engagement

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.300 
a clutch if I do a hit this engagement
it's<00:04:27.240> like<00:04:27.450> spinning<00:04:28.139> your<00:04:28.260> wheel<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:29.280> that

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
it's like spinning your wheel so that

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.950 
it's like spinning your wheel so that
you're<00:04:29.580> doing<00:04:29.790> an<00:04:29.880> itty-bitty<00:04:30.180> little<00:04:30.480> circle

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
you're doing an itty-bitty little circle

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.600 
you're doing an itty-bitty little circle
put<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.530> clutch<00:04:31.770> in<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.040> that's<00:04:32.250> going<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.520> do

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
put the clutch in and that's going to do

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.080 
put the clutch in and that's going to do
a<00:04:32.639> circle<00:04:33.090> until<00:04:33.330> all<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.630> sudden<00:04:33.840> years<00:04:35.060> so<00:04:36.060> I

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
a circle until all the sudden years so I

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.870 
a circle until all the sudden years so I
hit<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:36.480> engagement<00:04:36.950> and<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:38.100> totally<00:04:38.370> takes

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
hit this engagement and it totally takes

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.580 
hit this engagement and it totally takes
the<00:04:39.060> engine<00:04:39.510> power<00:04:39.750> away<00:04:40.229> from<00:04:40.260> the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
the engine power away from the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.500 
the engine power away from the
drivetrain<00:04:41.690> okay<00:04:42.690> what<00:04:43.260> we<00:04:43.530> want<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:44.510> more

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
drivetrain okay what we want is more

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.020 
drivetrain okay what we want is more
than<00:04:45.810> just<00:04:46.020> taking<00:04:46.260> energy<00:04:46.710> away<00:04:46.950> like<00:04:47.850> if

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
than just taking energy away like if

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.540 
than just taking energy away like if
they're<00:04:48.240> running<00:04:48.419> off<00:04:48.889> let's<00:04:49.889> say<00:04:50.100> our<00:04:50.130> horse

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
they're running off let's say our horse

what did for horse likes torero what do
we<00:05:00.300> have<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:00.570> do<00:05:00.690> we<00:05:00.810> have<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:00.990> engage<00:05:01.370> that

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
we have to do we have to engage that

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.659 
we have to do we have to engage that
engine<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:03.000> rear<00:05:03.840> end<00:05:03.919> they<00:05:04.919> have<00:05:04.950> to<00:05:05.340> be<00:05:05.490> on

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
engine that rear end they have to be on

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.969 
engine that rear end they have to be on
their<00:05:05.790> hind<00:05:06.000> quarters<00:05:06.450> to<00:05:06.630> rear<00:05:06.780> up<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:07.290> when

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
their hind quarters to rear up so when

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.430 
their hind quarters to rear up so when
we<00:05:08.250> asked<00:05:08.610> for<00:05:08.910> this<00:05:09.270> movement<00:05:09.660> we<00:05:10.200> have

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
we asked for this movement we have

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.880 
we asked for this movement we have
gained<00:05:10.740> control<00:05:11.160> over<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.940> drivetrain<00:05:12.890> it's

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
gained control over the drivetrain it's

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.310 
gained control over the drivetrain it's
what<00:05:14.190> we<00:05:14.580> want<00:05:14.789> to<00:05:14.880> do<00:05:15.000> with<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.180> after<00:05:15.419> that<00:05:15.840> it

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
what we want to do with it after that it

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.469 
what we want to do with it after that it
makes<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.830> difference<00:05:17.039> then<00:05:17.520> because<00:05:18.300> now

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
makes the difference then because now

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.600 
makes the difference then because now
after<00:05:19.200> we've<00:05:19.350> disengaged<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:20.160> we<00:05:20.250> can<00:05:20.430> ask

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
after we've disengaged and we can ask

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.790 
after we've disengaged and we can ask
them<00:05:20.789> to<00:05:21.060> do<00:05:21.180> something<00:05:21.479> different<00:05:21.660> so<00:05:22.560> if<00:05:22.650> we

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
them to do something different so if we

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.240 
them to do something different so if we
have<00:05:22.919> a<00:05:22.950> horse<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.340> bucks<00:05:23.900> kicks<00:05:24.900> layers<00:05:25.800> or

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
have a horse that bucks kicks layers or

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.360 
have a horse that bucks kicks layers or
both<00:05:26.729> this<00:05:27.660> is<00:05:27.870> a<00:05:27.900> pretty<00:05:28.200> important<00:05:28.800> movement

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
both this is a pretty important movement

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.340 
both this is a pretty important movement
and<00:05:29.550> we<00:05:29.700> want<00:05:29.940> this<00:05:30.060> horse<00:05:30.300> to<00:05:30.479> know<00:05:30.720> how<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.080> do

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
and we want this horse to know how to do

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.700 
and we want this horse to know how to do
it<00:05:31.470> so<00:05:32.160> when<00:05:32.610> we<00:05:32.760> ride<00:05:32.970> this<00:05:33.210> horse<00:05:33.419> we<00:05:34.380> want<00:05:34.620> to

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710

it so when we ride this horse we want to
be<00:05:34.830> able<00:05:34.919> to<00:05:35.190> do<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:35.520> from<00:05:35.760> a<00:05:35.910> safety

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
be able to do that from a safety

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.060 
be able to do that from a safety
perspective<00:05:37.039> and<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:39.810> neat<00:05:40.139> thing<00:05:40.470> is<00:05:40.500> it's

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
perspective and the neat thing is it's

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.750 
perspective and the neat thing is it's
the<00:05:41.400> one<00:05:41.910> of<00:05:42.030> the<00:05:42.090> foundational<00:05:42.840> moves<00:05:43.110> or

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
the one of the foundational moves or

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.219 
the one of the foundational moves or
collection<00:05:45.530> for<00:05:46.700> controlling<00:05:47.700> a<00:05:47.940> site<00:05:48.229> for

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
collection for controlling a site for

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.590 
collection for controlling a site for
many<00:05:49.800> maneuvers<00:05:50.400> that<00:05:50.580> will<00:05:50.729> do<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.300> help<00:05:51.419> a

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
many maneuvers that will do to help a

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.820 
many maneuvers that will do to help a
horse<00:05:51.840> or<00:05:52.020> to<00:05:52.320> control<00:05:53.450> so<00:05:54.450> it<00:05:54.780> is<00:05:55.289> the

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
horse or to control so it is the

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.350 
horse or to control so it is the
important<00:05:56.310> that<00:05:56.490> we<00:05:56.580> teach<00:05:56.820> this<00:05:57.060> on<00:05:57.270> the

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
important that we teach this on the

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.190 
important that we teach this on the
