00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
know he he he's just been a little bit

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.309 
know he he he's just been a little bit
hard<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.610> handle<00:02:14.819> but<00:02:15.000> um<00:02:15.360> he<00:02:15.569> definitely<00:02:16.110> had

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
hard to handle but um he definitely had

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.770 
hard to handle but um he definitely had
such<00:02:16.530> tremendous<00:02:16.710> amount<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.400> talent<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.000> is

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
such tremendous amount of talent and is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.840 
such tremendous amount of talent and is
moving<00:02:19.350> forward<00:02:19.710> with<00:02:19.890> each<00:02:20.130> race<00:02:20.370> but<00:02:20.700> it's

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
moving forward with each race but it's

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.390 
moving forward with each race but it's
not<00:02:21.120> hard<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.600> see<00:02:21.780> why<00:02:21.990> most<00:02:22.350> eyes<00:02:22.680> will<00:02:23.100> be<00:02:23.220> on

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
not hard to see why most eyes will be on

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.030 
not hard to see why most eyes will be on
the<00:02:23.580> grand<00:02:23.970> looking<00:02:24.450> astrology<00:02:25.260> but<00:02:25.770> as<00:02:25.830> he

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
the grand looking astrology but as he

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.370 
the grand looking astrology but as he
hopes<00:02:26.280> his<00:02:26.459> cult<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.940> now<00:02:27.240> ready<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.810> put<00:02:28.140> all

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
hopes his cult is now ready to put all

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.280 
hopes his cult is now ready to put all
the<00:02:28.890> moving<00:02:29.250> parts<00:02:29.550> together<00:02:32.030> on<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.150> outside

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
the moving parts together on the outside

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.530 
the moving parts together on the outside
he<00:02:34.290> was<00:02:34.380> body<00:02:34.800> was<00:02:35.069> always<00:02:35.400> ahead<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.910> his<00:02:36.120> mind

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
he was body was always ahead of his mind

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.590 
he was body was always ahead of his mind
so<00:02:37.190> hopefully<00:02:38.190> we've<00:02:38.340> caught<00:02:39.120> everything's

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
so hopefully we've caught everything's

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.420 
so hopefully we've caught everything's
coming<00:02:39.990> together<00:02:40.080> as<00:02:40.560> far<00:02:40.770> as<00:02:40.860> both<00:02:41.010> those<00:02:41.220> go

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
coming together as far as both those go

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.320 
coming together as far as both those go
and

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.910 
and
you<00:02:42.540> know<00:02:42.600> he's<00:02:42.900> been<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.170> little<00:02:43.440> immature<00:02:43.710> in

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
you know he's been a little immature in

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.460 
you know he's been a little immature in
some<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.220> his<00:02:44.340> races<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.060> lacks<00:02:45.750> some<00:02:45.990> focus

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
some of his races and lacks some focus

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.070 
some of his races and lacks some focus
and<00:02:46.770> ran<00:02:47.430> green<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.720> know

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
and ran green but you know

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.020 
and ran green but you know
I<00:02:49.110> thought<00:02:49.770> his<00:02:49.920> last<00:02:50.130> race<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.610> he<00:02:50.700> got<00:02:50.850> beat

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
I thought his last race that he got beat

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.940 
I thought his last race that he got beat
was<00:02:51.180> actually<00:02:51.510> his<00:02:51.600> best<00:02:51.750> race<00:02:52.020> astrology's

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
was actually his best race astrology's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.650 
was actually his best race astrology's
first<00:02:53.220> start<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.700> year<00:02:53.730> will<00:02:54.060> also<00:02:54.090> mean<00:02:54.630> a

code<00:03:01.910> well<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:02.940> think<00:03:03.300> both<00:03:03.570> my<00:03:03.690> horses<00:03:04.110> are<00:03:04.260> you

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
code well I think both my horses are you

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.890 
code well I think both my horses are you
know<00:03:05.160> they<00:03:05.400> both<00:03:05.790> have<00:03:05.970> some<00:03:06.150> tactical<00:03:06.600> speed

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
know they both have some tactical speed

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.630 
know they both have some tactical speed
I<00:03:07.110> think<00:03:07.170> they're<00:03:07.560> both<00:03:07.680> really<00:03:07.830> manageable

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
I think they're both really manageable

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.480 
I think they're both really manageable
in<00:03:08.760> their<00:03:08.910> races<00:03:09.090> but<00:03:09.510> uh<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:10.380> know<00:03:10.470> I'm<00:03:10.770> not

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
in their races but uh you know I'm not

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.070 
in their races but uh you know I'm not
gonna<00:03:11.640> be<00:03:11.790> off<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.910> back<00:03:12.150> door<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.750> think

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
gonna be off the back door but I think

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.010 
gonna be off the back door but I think
you<00:03:13.950> know<00:03:14.040> Julian<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.670> Justin<00:03:15.030> can<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.930> know

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
you know Julian and Justin can you know

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.020 
you know Julian and Justin can you know
both<00:03:16.290> make<00:03:16.530> decisions<00:03:17.070> on<00:03:17.280> how<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.790> race

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
both make decisions on how the race

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.800 
both make decisions on how the race
unfolds

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
unfolds

I'm<00:03:19.080> with<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.440> serology<00:03:19.710> draw<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
I'm with the serology draw on the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.640 
I'm with the serology draw on the
outside<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.790> think<00:03:21.240> he's<00:03:21.420> gonna<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:22.380> know<00:03:22.500> he'd

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
outside I think he's gonna you know he'd

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
outside I think he's gonna you know he'd
probably<00:03:22.770> have<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.100> clear<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> few<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.580> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
probably have to clear a few of the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.580 
probably have to clear a few of the
horses<00:03:23.970> from<00:03:24.150> his<00:03:24.270> inside<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.930> save<00:03:25.350> some

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
horses from his inside to save some

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.100 
horses from his inside to save some
position<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.250> don't<00:03:26.520> expect<00:03:26.990> and<00:03:27.990> I'll

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
position but I don't expect and I'll

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.630
