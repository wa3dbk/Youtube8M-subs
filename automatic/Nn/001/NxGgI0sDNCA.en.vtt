most recently we ran across the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.380 
most recently we ran across the
full-size<00:01:08.710> General<00:01:09.710> Motors<00:01:09.950> Silverado<00:01:10.670> which

we call the Silverado warrior the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.000 
we call the Silverado warrior the
Silverado<00:01:15.710> warrior<00:01:16.280> is<00:01:16.520> made<00:01:17.119> by<00:01:17.330> SVM<00:01:18.110> from<00:01:18.980> a

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
Silverado warrior is made by SVM from a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.060 
Silverado warrior is made by SVM from a
platform<00:01:19.730> given<00:01:20.120> to<00:01:20.720> them<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:21.380> work<00:01:21.560> with<00:01:21.770> from

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
platform given to them to work with from

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.760 
platform given to them to work with from
General<00:01:22.400> Motors<00:01:22.550> as<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:23.870> can<00:01:24.050> see<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.530> the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
General Motors as you can see that the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.490 
General Motors as you can see that the
device<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:25.640> we<00:01:26.120> have<00:01:26.360> here<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:26.870> a<00:01:26.900> chair<00:01:27.320> that

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
device that we have here is a chair that

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.670 
device that we have here is a chair that
comes<00:01:27.770> down<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:29.080> amputee<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.350> Wounded

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
comes down the amputee and the Wounded

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.940 
comes down the amputee and the Wounded
Warrior<00:01:30.950> can<00:01:31.190> move<00:01:31.460> his<00:01:31.780> chair<00:01:32.780> into<00:01:33.440> onto<00:01:33.830> it

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
Warrior can move his chair into onto it

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.150 
Warrior can move his chair into onto it
and<00:01:34.070> be<00:01:34.700> elevated<00:01:35.270> into<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.690> truck

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
and be elevated into the truck

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.490 
and be elevated into the truck
previously<00:01:37.160> they<00:01:37.730> had<00:01:37.760> vans<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.600> sedans<00:01:39.110> only

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
previously they had vans and sedans only

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.330 
previously they had vans and sedans only
so<00:01:40.130> this<00:01:40.370> is<00:01:40.640> a<00:01:40.670> major<00:01:41.300> milestone<00:01:41.920> for<00:01:42.920> General

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
so this is a major milestone for General

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.060 
so this is a major milestone for General
Motors<00:01:43.370> to<00:01:44.270> embrace<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.050> to<00:01:45.680> make<00:01:45.890> available

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
Motors to embrace and to make available

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.710 
Motors to embrace and to make available
for<00:01:46.550> those<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.090> are<00:01:47.150> wounded<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:47.750> amputees

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720

is unique and second thing is we have to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.300 
is unique and second thing is we have to
remember<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.489> many<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.360> wounded<00:02:17.540> came

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
remember that many of the wounded came

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.920 
remember that many of the wounded came
from<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.430> community<00:02:19.640> where<00:02:20.120> they<00:02:20.299> had<00:02:20.480> pickups
