00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.170
 I believe that all senior citizens work for the fourth force 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.080
 we are advancing so much life that they had a 30-year streak 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.970
 It is very rewarding 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.420
 it is people who demand rough and for all people very grateful 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.999
 people who know how to value the results 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:33.769
 so true people and tepeji to come and trust their victory then work 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.940
 with them that expires wonderful the truth is that my experience is that the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.560
 support is mine the best public complaint is the third and fourth age 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.650
 min 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.500
 3 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.890
 the first entity 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.059
 soon the heating has to be a little longer the temperature 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.070
 of the sweet or higher percent is lower than the beginning of a young man with 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 which four mickeal baskets have to be of longer duration 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.009
 stretches 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.029
 also although they have to be less evolved so that there are no problems 

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:13.220
 with the joints 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.160
 the choreography that on this issue in prison 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.490
 the worst is that there is no doubt 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.130
 in the freeze presented by said action 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.299
 the accident or losing against what we have to do 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.329
 that is, that these criticisms are never made 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.169
 because as a distant percent they also have to remember that 

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:37.649
 has now that comes next is a fantastic mental exercise with what 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.810
 which are we going to continue doing choreography 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.680
 but the agent villar city 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.370
 for a certain level always have as reference the figure of said sector and 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.970
 know that we meet people who are less lion 10 - the slugger this 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.330
 newspaper in contact with them is permanent with which we present 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.320
 our three times the stiglitz turns we got together past the big 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.810
 transnational 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.580
 why are we all more 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.470
 achievable for this reason is that it is easier to follow the hand and 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.790
 then you have to be interrupted as always and the intensity that you 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.380
 dare 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.380
 enough housewives is not of higher impact 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:27.429
 never in fact motril nestares we were tree entity to exhaustion to 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:28.889
 times more than the process 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:29.680
 9 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.489
 this in the analysis documents except before this dispatch 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.010
 and then the same thing that we have seen little by little the temperature and the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.399
 accusations also knows part d 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.829
 certainly has that effect and that of national teams 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:55.329
 little more of the peace set tozzo because it's going to happen for 7 let's take care of 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.209
 cities 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.299
 the phrase 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.029
