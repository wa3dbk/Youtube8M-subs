area does not provide any solar

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.330 
area does not provide any solar
protection<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:37.560> definitely<00:01:37.830> different

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
protection it's definitely different

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.950 
protection it's definitely different
between<00:01:39.290> solar<00:01:40.290> screen<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.979> insect<00:01:41.400> screen

this<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.140> maximum<00:01:43.830> visibility<00:01:44.300> but<00:01:45.300> again<00:01:45.690> no

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
this is maximum visibility but again no

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.500 
this is maximum visibility but again no
solar<00:01:46.320> protection<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.729> primarily<00:01:47.970> just

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
solar protection this is primarily just

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:56.240 
solar protection this is primarily just
to<00:01:49.910> protect<00:01:50.910> from<00:01:51.090> insects<00:01:54.890> I'm<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.160> go

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
to protect from insects I'm going to go

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.220 

so<00:02:09.610> for<00:02:09.879> solar<00:02:10.330> protection<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.959> want<00:02:11.140> to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
so for solar protection you want to

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.960 
so for solar protection you want to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
would allow either ninety percent

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.220 
would allow either ninety percent
protection<00:02:16.510> ninety-five<00:02:16.989> percent

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
protection ninety-five percent
