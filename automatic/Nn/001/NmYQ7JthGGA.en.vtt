a pizza or ask a question oh I wonder
about<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.199> put<00:00:22.470> 64-bit<00:00:23.250> what<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.000> I

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
about you put 64-bit what is this I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.730 
about you put 64-bit what is this I
cater<00:00:24.930> say<00:00:26.240> hey<00:00:27.240> let's<00:00:27.420> do<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.869> play<00:00:28.170> halo<00:00:28.410> 2<00:00:28.619> I

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
cater say hey let's do I play halo 2 I

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.340 
cater say hey let's do I play halo 2 I
and<00:00:30.560> 64-bit<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:33.149> 64-bit<00:00:33.809> version<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.200> halo

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and 64-bit the 64-bit version of halo

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.150 
and 64-bit the 64-bit version of halo
versus<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> 32-bit<00:00:35.370> version<00:00:35.640> mela<00:00:36.980> okay<00:00:37.980> well

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
versus the 32-bit version mela okay well

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.740 
versus the 32-bit version mela okay well
I<00:00:38.190> first<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.910> ask<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> question<00:00:39.540> is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
I first I have to ask the question is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.319 
I first I have to ask the question is
your<00:00:39.989> processors<00:00:40.800> your<00:00:41.070> cpu<00:00:41.730> your<00:00:42.000> central

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
your processors your cpu your central

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.750 
your processors your cpu your central
processing<00:00:42.750> units<00:00:43.350> that's<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.489> technical

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
processing units that's the technical

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
processing units that's the technical
term<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.149> know<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:46.079> 64-bit<00:00:46.710> capable<00:00:47.780> yeah

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
term you know is it 64-bit capable yeah

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.700 
term you know is it 64-bit capable yeah
I<00:00:48.809> think<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.480> 64-bit<00:00:51.480> thanks<00:00:51.930> okay

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
I think so in the 64-bit thanks okay

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.209 
I think so in the 64-bit thanks okay
okay<00:00:53.190> you're<00:00:53.610> fine<00:00:54.410> it's<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.129> was

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
okay you're fine it's like that that was

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.350 
okay you're fine it's like that that was
the<00:00:56.280> first<00:00:56.460> question<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.030> course<00:00:57.239> you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the first question because of course you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.299 
the first question because of course you
need<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.600> 64-bit<00:00:58.410> platform<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.010> order<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
need a 64-bit platform in order to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.939 
need a 64-bit platform in order to
install<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> 64-bit<00:01:00.300> operating<00:01:00.420> system<00:01:00.949> beyond

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
install a 64-bit operating system beyond

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.299 
install a 64-bit operating system beyond
that<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.760> would<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.049> probably<00:01:04.739> look<00:01:05.100> at

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that I would have to probably look at

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
that I would have to probably look at
the<00:01:05.580> benchmarks<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> differences

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the benchmarks in the differences

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.390 
the benchmarks in the differences
between<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:08.930> halo<00:01:09.930> 2<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.409> 32-bit<00:01:10.830> platform

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
between a halo 2 on a 32-bit platform

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.429 
between a halo 2 on a 32-bit platform
versus<00:01:11.729> halo<00:01:11.939> 2<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> 64-bit<00:01:12.780> platform<00:01:13.290> in

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
versus halo 2 on a 64-bit platform in

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.070 
versus halo 2 on a 64-bit platform in
theory<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.580> could<00:01:15.030> work<00:01:15.270> better<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
theory it could work better on the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.749 
theory it could work better on the
64-bit<00:01:16.619> platform<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.460> code<00:01:17.610> is

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
64-bit platform if the code is

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.730 
64-bit platform if the code is
specifically<00:01:18.150> been<00:01:18.360> optimized<00:01:18.810> for<00:01:18.930> 64-bit<00:01:19.590> I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
specifically been optimized for 64-bit I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.679 
specifically been optimized for 64-bit I
do<00:01:19.799> believe<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> low<00:01:20.729> too<00:01:20.790> does<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
do believe that a low too does have a

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.749 
do believe that a low too does have a
64-bit<00:01:22.020> version<00:01:23.689> okay<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.869> believe<00:01:24.930> oh<00:01:25.860> well

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
64-bit version okay I believe oh well

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.249 
64-bit version okay I believe oh well
and<00:01:27.030> that's<00:01:27.360> that's<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> little<00:01:27.960> thing<00:01:28.110> if

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
and that's that's the little thing if

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.960 
and that's that's the little thing if
you've<00:01:28.409> only<00:01:28.560> got<00:01:28.770> us<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> 32-bit<00:01:29.640> version<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you've only got us a 32-bit version of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.850 
you've only got us a 32-bit version of
halo<00:01:30.090> 2<00:01:30.240> i'd<00:01:30.570> stick<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:30.930> 32-bit<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.650> if

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
halo 2 i'd stick with 32-bit but if

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.410 
halo 2 i'd stick with 32-bit but if
there<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.790> you'll<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.090> pardon<00:01:33.299> me

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
there is and you'll have to pardon me

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.810 
there is and you'll have to pardon me
I'm<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.290> must<00:01:35.220> say<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.460> works<00:01:35.610> better

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
I'm not like I must say it works better

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.210 
I'm not like I must say it works better
on<00:01:35.909> 64<00:01:36.540> well<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.290> go<00:01:37.320> hack<00:01:37.650> master<00:01:37.860> says

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
on 64 well there you go hack master says

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.170 
on 64 well there you go hack master says
it's<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.939> good<00:01:39.210> there<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:41.100> i<00:01:41.490> guess<00:01:41.909> i'm

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
it's it's good there so i guess i'm

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.600 
it's it's good there so i guess i'm
going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> use<00:01:42.509> hack<00:01:42.720> masters<00:01:43.170> recommendation

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
going to use hack masters recommendation

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.429 
going to use hack masters recommendation
it's<00:01:44.610> been<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> while<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.329> ended<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.409> I

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
it's been a while I ended up like when I

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.440 
it's been a while I ended up like when I
was<00:01:46.530> doing<00:01:46.740> testing<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.369> ended<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.670> testing<00:01:47.880> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
was doing testing I ended up testing a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.569 
was doing testing I ended up testing a
few<00:01:49.140> different<00:01:49.470> games<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> 64-bit

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
few different games on the 64-bit

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.700 
few different games on the 64-bit
platform<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.780> since<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.110> am<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
platform but since I am not like a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.240 
platform but since I am not like a
hardcore<00:01:53.310> gamer<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.570> only<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.170> know

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
hardcore gamer I I can only you know

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.270 
hardcore gamer I I can only you know
point<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:57.360> generalities<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.950> hack

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
point you to in generalities but if hack

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.859 
point you to in generalities but if hack
master<00:01:59.460> says<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.030> been<00:02:00.149> good<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.450> him<00:02:00.600> then

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
master says it's been good for him then

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.179 
master says it's been good for him then
it's<00:02:01.110> certainly<00:02:01.380> worth<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.680> shot<00:02:03.170> if<00:02:04.170> you're<00:02:05.100> in

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
it's certainly worth a shot if you're in

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.249 
it's certainly worth a shot if you're in
a<00:02:05.310> halo<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.579> course<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.810> currently<00:02:07.020> have

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
a halo of course I do you currently have

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
doing is installing keeping the 32-bit

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.150 
doing is installing keeping the 32-bit
version<00:02:15.430> installed<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.060> then<00:02:16.630> installing<00:02:17.160> on

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
version installed and then installing on

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.530 
version installed and then installing on
a<00:02:18.250> different<00:02:18.640> partition<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.210> different

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
a different partition and a different

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.200 
a different partition and a different
hard<00:02:19.750> drive<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.350> 64<00:02:21.220> bit<00:02:21.250> version<00:02:21.820> of<00:02:21.880> windows

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
hard drive a 64 bit version of windows

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.960 
hard drive a 64 bit version of windows
so<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.080> way<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.830> can<00:02:23.980> boot<00:02:24.490> between<00:02:24.820> them

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
so that way you can boot between them

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.850 
so that way you can boot between them
without<00:02:25.330> wiping<00:02:25.600> out<00:02:25.900> your<00:02:26.080> 32-bit<00:02:26.590> install

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860

without wiping out your 32-bit install
that<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.100> know<00:02:27.340> works<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.300> then<00:02:28.990> do<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.200> boot

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
that you know works and then do a boot

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.290 
that you know works and then do a boot
between<00:02:29.800> them<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.550> see<00:02:30.700> if<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.940> have<00:02:31.090> better
