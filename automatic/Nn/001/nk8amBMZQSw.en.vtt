then I start cycling this through on the
large<00:01:20.400> cup<00:01:20.759> mode<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:23.340> make<00:01:23.759> sure<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.000> don't

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
no no cake ups or pods in there and then

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.069 
no no cake ups or pods in there and then
you<00:01:32.880> filter<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.360> through<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> few<00:01:33.810> times

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
you filter that through a few times

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.270 
you filter that through a few times
until<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:35.310> need<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.549> add<00:01:35.670> water<00:01:35.909> again<00:01:37.280> okay

until you need to add water again okay

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
until you need to add water again okay
so<00:01:38.340> I've<00:01:38.610> gotten<00:01:38.909> my<00:01:39.030> six<00:01:39.390> large<00:01:39.659> cups<00:01:39.960> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so I've gotten my six large cups of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.770 
so I've gotten my six large cups of
water<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.400> water<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.090> vinegar<00:01:42.150> mix<00:01:42.570> through

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
water or water and vinegar mix through

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.929

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
there pouring them out in the sink there

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.120
