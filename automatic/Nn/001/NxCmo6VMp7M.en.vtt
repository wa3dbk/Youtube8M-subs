00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.500
 then they do not accept and I have to be 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.350
 swimming pool 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:31.590
 to see who else accepted for that cause 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:34.820
 in 101 if they do not accept what was removed and sent 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.060
 another that simple 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.780
 I will not be waiting a few more years 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.960
 one ready with two ready with the ready ones 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.640

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.320
 send does not take off the blue dot and 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.089
 that's why I can not invite 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.890
 Sometimes it's not because I do not want to, 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.240

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.570

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.890

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.400
 around here 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.400
 here 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.290
 at 31 very at 31 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.760
 Ah I shot this round but good and 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.460
 had killed like three or four I hope 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.920
 that they just do not know good we're going to 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.480
 go I think like four in Chile but not 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.950
 let's see if we can interpret almost 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.599
 of four 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.129
 I have stuck to the screen because I 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.000
 cost of the second stories of 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.320
 moved from and I do not know why 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.320
 let's go where is 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.629
 when it came from the paper hand but 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.489
 it's big it's a fracture when 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.400
 there everyone with this flight when you 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.579
 raise your hand you can not move well 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.879
 there's nothing worse than having a button that 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.829
 you raise your hand does not work the same 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.700
 it costs an egg to react 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.720
 one is not easy 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.040
 to have olive 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.730
 montenegro 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.730
 like tea 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.769
 before the bad guys 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.550
 kill it where they went finger 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.690
 even if it's where it's standing and I 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.830
 I kill 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.830
 and another highway 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.220
 well I think if we kill each other 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.079
 but I do not know what happened but I think I'm going to 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.510
 notice we go first finally 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.780
 Hallelujah did not touch me counting pro as 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.780

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.950

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.830

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.549

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.860
 We speak 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:27.750
 neither for us to live in the first place 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.750
 I'm going to stay 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.939
 they get 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.939
 to see if he returns 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.560
 around here comes here comes I know that 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.920

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.789
 before the models 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.800

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.270
 we are 1 that took us good 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.060

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.710
 several deaths no problem for now 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.460

 Oh 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.250

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.920

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.010
