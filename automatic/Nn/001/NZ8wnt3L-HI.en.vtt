00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
it's incorporated into the story which

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.850 
it's incorporated into the story which
is<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.240> best<00:01:49.450> way<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.630> do<00:01:49.930> 3d<00:01:50.290> is<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.710> not<00:01:50.830> be

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
is the best way to do 3d is to not be

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.330 
is the best way to do 3d is to not be
like<00:01:51.070> hey<00:01:51.810> here's<00:01:52.810> all<00:01:52.990> this<00:01:53.170> stuff<00:01:53.560> oh<00:01:53.860> boy

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
like hey here's all this stuff oh boy

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.330 
like hey here's all this stuff oh boy
you're<00:01:54.790> like<00:01:54.909> cool<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.320> guess<00:01:56.650> where's<00:01:57.040> that<00:01:57.130> to

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
you're like cool I guess where's that to

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.289 
you're like cool I guess where's that to
do<00:01:57.430> with<00:01:57.549> anything<00:01:57.640> they're<00:01:58.030> able<00:01:58.119> to

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
do with anything they're able to

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.179 
do with anything they're able to
incorporate<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.990> 3d<00:01:59.290> into<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.650> story<00:01:59.950> and

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
incorporate the 3d into the story and

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.530 
incorporate the 3d into the story and
that's<00:02:00.549> one<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.820> reasons<00:02:01.119> why<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.330> worked

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
that's one of the reasons why it worked

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.539 
that's one of the reasons why it worked
because<00:02:01.720> it<00:02:01.869> wasn't<00:02:02.260> just<00:02:02.290> really<00:02:03.159> well<00:02:03.340> done

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
because it wasn't just really well done

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.370 
because it wasn't just really well done
on<00:02:03.760> a<00:02:03.790> technical<00:02:04.390> level<00:02:04.420> it<00:02:04.869> actually<00:02:05.140> worked

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
on a technical level it actually worked

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.719 
on a technical level it actually worked
for<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.590> store<00:02:05.860> which<00:02:06.070> is<00:02:06.100> cool<00:02:06.400> you<00:02:06.549> know<00:02:06.610> as

I said this is one of those movies where

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.020 
I said this is one of those movies where

there<00:02:38.470> was<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.590> point<00:02:38.860> in<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.040> movie<00:02:39.340> where<00:02:39.580> it

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
there was a point in this movie where it

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.150 
there was a point in this movie where it
went<00:02:40.030> from<00:02:40.300> being<00:02:40.690> pretty<00:02:41.290> fun<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:42.010> actually

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160

take<00:04:31.750> them<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:31.960> frozen<00:04:32.200> because<00:04:32.860> it'll<00:04:33.400> just

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
take them to frozen because it'll just

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.719 
take them to frozen because it'll just
it'll<00:04:33.789> just<00:04:34.620> as<00:04:35.620> for<00:04:35.890> negatives<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.490> film

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
it'll just as for negatives to the film

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.190 
it'll just as for negatives to the film
I<00:04:36.909> thought<00:04:37.539> that<00:04:37.720> there<00:04:37.870> were<00:04:37.960> some<00:04:38.169> really

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
I thought that there were some really

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.140 
I thought that there were some really
great<00:04:38.740> action<00:04:39.159> scenes<00:04:39.370> in<00:04:39.490> this<00:04:39.640> movie<00:04:39.700> but

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
great action scenes in this movie but

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.490 
great action scenes in this movie but
not<00:04:40.330> quite<00:04:40.570> enough<00:04:40.810> of<00:04:40.960> him<00:04:41.110> like<00:04:41.320> there<00:04:41.440> were

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
not quite enough of him like there were

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.230 
not quite enough of him like there were
scenes<00:04:41.710> where<00:04:41.919> she<00:04:42.070> tries<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.370> use<00:04:42.520> her<00:04:42.820> powers

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
scenes where she tries to use her powers

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.180 
scenes where she tries to use her powers
and<00:04:43.479> you're<00:04:43.780> like<00:04:43.900> yes<00:04:44.080> yes<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:44.560> is<00:04:44.620> really

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
and you're like yes yes this is really

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.529 
and you're like yes yes this is really
cool<00:04:45.400> but<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.789> thing<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.060> -<00:04:46.240> her<00:04:46.360> parents

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
cool but the thing is - her parents

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.600 
cool but the thing is - her parents
taught<00:04:46.990> her<00:04:47.169> to<00:04:47.380> withhold<00:04:47.860> them<00:04:48.099> and<00:04:48.310> not

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
taught her to withhold them and not

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.579 
taught her to withhold them and not
share<00:04:49.060> them<00:04:49.270> with<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.510> world<00:04:49.539> so<00:04:50.020> you<00:04:50.409> don't

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:50.589 
share them with the world so you don't

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.019 
share them with the world so you don't
get<00:04:50.740> as<00:04:50.890> much<00:04:51.039> of<00:04:51.099> that<00:04:51.279> and<00:04:51.640> when<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:51.909> does

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:52.029 
get as much of that and when it does

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:53.010 
get as much of that and when it does
actually<00:04:52.210> come<00:04:52.390> to<00:04:52.599> the<00:04:52.690> part<00:04:52.870> where<00:04:52.990> she

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
actually come to the part where she

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.220 
actually come to the part where she
starts<00:04:53.349> to<00:04:53.440> use<00:04:53.589> her<00:04:53.710> powers

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
starts to use her powers

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.810 
starts to use her powers
I<00:04:54.260> was<00:04:54.500> like<00:04:54.590> yes<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:54.950> want<00:04:55.160> more<00:04:55.340> of<00:04:55.490> this<00:04:55.640> but

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
I was like yes I want more of this but

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.890 
I was like yes I want more of this but
there<00:04:55.940> wasn't<00:04:56.240> really<00:04:56.330> enough<00:04:56.450> of<00:04:56.870> that

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
there wasn't really enough of that

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.870 
there wasn't really enough of that
intensity<00:04:57.620> because<00:04:58.100> I<00:04:58.340> thought<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:58.730> was<00:04:58.850> a

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
intensity because I thought that was a

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.880 
intensity because I thought that was a
really<00:04:59.180> cool<00:04:59.540> story<00:04:59.930> element<00:05:00.350> that<00:05:00.500> wasn't

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
really cool story element that wasn't

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.530 
really cool story element that wasn't
really<00:05:01.040> exploited<00:05:01.820> as<00:05:01.970> well<00:05:02.180> as<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.420> could

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
really exploited as well as it could

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.030 
really exploited as well as it could
have<00:05:02.600> been<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.990> romance<00:05:03.380> in<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.590> film<00:05:03.830> was

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
have been the romance in the film was

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.430 
have been the romance in the film was
cute<00:05:04.400> but<00:05:04.820> not<00:05:04.970> really<00:05:05.330> involving<00:05:05.900> at<00:05:06.050> all<00:05:06.200> and

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
cute but not really involving at all and

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.710 
cute but not really involving at all and
yes<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.860> is<00:05:06.950> a<00:05:07.010> Disney<00:05:07.340> film<00:05:07.670> so<00:05:08.120> adults

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
yes it is a Disney film so adults

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.020 
yes it is a Disney film so adults
probably<00:05:08.990> won't<00:05:09.380> feel<00:05:09.770> very<00:05:10.400> into<00:05:10.880> the

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
probably won't feel very into the

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.210 
probably won't feel very into the
romance<00:05:11.450> kids<00:05:11.960> will<00:05:12.140> like<00:05:12.350> it<00:05:12.560> adults<00:05:12.860> will

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
romance kids will like it adults will

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.460 
romance kids will like it adults will
kind<00:05:13.460> of<00:05:13.550> smile<00:05:13.910> at<00:05:14.150> it<00:05:14.180> but<00:05:14.840> I<00:05:15.110> wish<00:05:15.290> the

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
kind of smile at it but I wish the

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.100 
kind of smile at it but I wish the
romance<00:05:15.860> was<00:05:16.160> more<00:05:16.670> than<00:05:16.880> just<00:05:17.240> your<00:05:17.480> Disney

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
romance was more than just your Disney

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.390 
romance was more than just your Disney
kind<00:05:18.710> of<00:05:18.860> winking<00:05:19.310> cute<00:05:19.760> eNOS<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.860> standards

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
kind of winking cute eNOS the standards

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.680 
kind of winking cute eNOS the standards
of<00:05:22.520> this<00:05:22.610> film<00:05:22.880> I<00:05:23.060> think<00:05:23.120> it<00:05:23.360> did<00:05:23.480> a<00:05:23.510> really

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
of this film I think it did a really

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.990 
of this film I think it did a really
good<00:05:23.900> job<00:05:23.960> for<00:05:24.650> what<00:05:24.830> it's<00:05:24.980> trying<00:05:25.190> to<00:05:25.280> be<00:05:25.490> yeah

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000
