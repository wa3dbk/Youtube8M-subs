 Hi there, this is the channel im dicky moby 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.320
 first video after the new year here 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.330
 situation means the following video concerns 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.460
 directly those with iphone and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.640
 what kind of connection problem 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.340
 claive and suddenly she appears 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.740
 all these roughly speaking the phone sees but 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 he doesn't want to connect in there 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.910
 cook it correctly the password is wrong 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.279
 no matter it just doesn't connect though 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.960
 network again I repeat he sees now 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.610
 I already have a phone 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.690
 Sit down normally everything works wifi 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.050
 works well, I will explain for those who have such 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.579
 same problem how can i fix it how 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.120
 make it so that the phone is normal 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.730
 connect the phone settings themselves 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.860
 how to do nothing need the whole problem 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.449
 is in the settings of the router with what 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.430
 this is due and unfortunately not explain 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.960
 but i can say that that way 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.600
 which is now on the advice he 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.270
 really works and your phone or 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.719
 there ipad will normally connect 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.769
 as it should be quaife now i will click 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.590
 pause 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.159
 so we continue that he needs it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.229
 open your browser there any which 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.000
 use and then configure the router 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.930
 for this you need in the address bar 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.409
 to lead 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:28.950
 192 . 106 from 8.0.1 all press enter 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:33.570
 Vlazit window where we are asked to enter the name 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.619
 I have a standard user change 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.630
 do not need anything well, as if I did not change 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.880

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.220
 here we enter this data all we go in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.970
 router settings 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.490
 here we need to show you now 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.690
 find wireless we are wireless 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.350
 the network there somehow will be called 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.170
 the point here is already a wireless network to us 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.990
 it is necessary here is this line feed 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.220

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.080
 I was so before 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.910
 connected 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:12.820

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:19.830

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.830
 keep something painfully long retains 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.400
 mean essence following after 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.800
 preserved channel settings become 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.630
 automatic, you can return back 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.510
 him on the channel that you had 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.650
 here everything is preserved I put back 1 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.540
 and save everything and now after that 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.000
 you can easily connect your phone 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.850
 who is from the net but directly to your and 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.220

 that this video will help someone possibly 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.120
 will not help because the problem may 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.790
 be something else which is already needed 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.530
