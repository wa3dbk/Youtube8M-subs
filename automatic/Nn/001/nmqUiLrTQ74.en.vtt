00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.800
 ah 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.559
 welcome to the recommendations of 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.629
 books this time we're going to talk about 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.180
 one of my favorite books the catcher 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.250
 in the rye unfortunately this book 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.109
 has something of a bad name due to a series 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.930
 of bullshit that have nothing to do 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.820
 with the plot to start it turns out that the 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.400
 idiot who murdered john lennon had 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.259
 a copy of this book in your home and 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.329
 then when the police arrived and did 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.310
 public the matter the people started to 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.680
 imagine a series of silly things 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.290
 about the plot that did not have anything that 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.670
 see and they gave me something of bad reputation the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.190
 handsome to have been reading a 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.199
 copy of a cowboy book and if there 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.699
 been the same because they had nothing to 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.219
 see really with the motive of 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.140
 murder on the other hand the book 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.870
 presents a rebellious teenager who 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.640
 smoking and then a series of critics 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.890
 they said that this was bad influence to 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.730
 Sometimes I really do not understand how they think 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.730
 these critics 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.240
 this novel is cataloged as coming 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.920
 of age you know is a teenager who 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.110
 is trying to find himself 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.150
 the language that super fluid uses 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.550
 and is full of meaningless sarcasm from 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.710
 humor I recommend that if you can read 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.480
 the English version as well as 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.400
 which is a very economical version because it is 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.800
 which really reflects the language that 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.630
 used the writer now yes the law 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.270
 in Spanish it is good both to look for 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.740
 a translation that is suitable as 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.930
 he told them the language he uses is 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.920
 typical of a teenager although of that 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.140
 epoch since it was written in 1951 and is 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.729
 full of sarcasm and a lot of 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.690
 characteristic things of the language 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.690
 Teen 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.580
 in a high school called 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.980
 prince which is very prestigious without 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.600
 But they expel him and then he has to 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.520
 face your parents and tell them the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.590
 true however before having to 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.240
 do all this he's going to pass an end to 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.280
 week in new york trying to evade 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.930
 the reality for which it is going to go to 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.700
 BarÃ§a try to get alcohol without 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.620
 that has the age to tempt to leave 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.550
 with some girls and good to do several 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.440
 things that remind them of their childhood 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.960
 of this book is that without you having a 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.700
 plot of the most exceptional gets 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.500
 another part from start to finish 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.270
 this is the merit of salinger who 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.940
 gets into the mind of a 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.620
 interesting teenager and translate it with 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.200
 all its complications with a large 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.730
 mastery in paper leaving aside 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.290
 all those fagots to which 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.290
 hollywood has us used to 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.780
 Saleh was already born in the new city 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.700
 york in 1919 and many other things 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.260
 took a writing course at the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.670
 University of Columbia 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.650
 after this he tried to publish 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.660
 stories in the new yorker however 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.790
 because the Second World War is 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.650
 interrupted this right goes to the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.480
 war and come back from this and finally 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.730
 get published some things between 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.730
 you're catcher in the rye which leaves 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.920
 by way of deliveries 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.989
 when fame is achieved it turns out that 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.480
 he does not like fame and wants to disappear 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.210
 of the public eye that was Michael Jordan 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.250
 what normal 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.890
 misfortune after this there were few 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.440
 stories of that child or those that came out 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.050
 in an unauthorized way for example 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.210
 we have these two stories that I do not know if 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.190
 have actually been authorized by 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.220
 salinger however an editorial 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.110
 current serious devotee are trying to 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.180
 publish your stories already with a 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.100
 authorization which will come 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.810
 accompanied by illustrations and they go to 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.360
 keep coming out in the next few years 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.220
 unfortunately to clean up royalties 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.130
 they will not reach him anymore, be two 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.330
 meters underground since he died in 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.330
 the 2010 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.440
 everyone seems very burdened 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.450
 chaplin less of that line because it turned out 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.810
 do not be so dumb with the girlfriend of this one 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.160
 he took her down and he married her a friend of 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.510
 Ernest Hemingway 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.760
 in the new album of guns and roses 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.420
 Chinese Democracy is a song that 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.260
 titula the catcher in the rye 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.260
