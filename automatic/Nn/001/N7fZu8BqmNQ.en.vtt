00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:13.179
 hello two weeks after 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:16.890
 first shoots and you can see which 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:21.340
 we have grown such seedlings 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:26.220
 they were perfectly shaped by decay lamps 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:31.840
 and it's time to naturally dive them 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:36.550
 today we will do just that 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.700
 we need to do this naturally 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.340
 pretty in Quito grown seedlings to 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:47.200
 there were necessarily two true leaves 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:50.760
 what happened to us now 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.880
 that is, we see that we naturally 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.310
 seedling ready to their 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:04.439
 dive and overexpose them no longer worth 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:08.380
 then we need jar containers with 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.970
 filled with earth here i use 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.750
 plastic bottles 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:20.140
 cropped here in my boxes are ready 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:23.580
 and now there are still others naturally on 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.990
 seedling that will also dive 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:35.830
 need water i use 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:41.950
 rainwater and a pencil to do 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.950
 hole in the ground or handle her old 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:53.490
 spoon to extract 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:58.000
 seedlings from our tank here on example 1 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.030
 1 tit of a jar I once dive 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.020
 I will show how this is done although I already 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:09.420
 repeatedly showed nevertheless still 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.420
 since you can go all over again 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:19.069
 let's try everything for 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:22.909
 of this, we must first be very 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:28.909
 cool wet our capacity seedlings 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:32.349
 so that their root system is more like 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:38.349
 would be easier to remove and blurred 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:42.019
 let's do it here we soaked 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.549
 our land now seedlings will 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:49.269
 easy enough to extract for example i 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:53.090
 specially washed in one session 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.790
 root system and see what it is 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.190
 we have developed powerful 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:07.099
 that is, such a small tight tail of 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:10.849
 the roots are lateral everywhere formed here itself 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:13.510
 you are so fat little pilot 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.030
 everything must take root 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:28.580
 well enough all now times 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:37.010
 dive for this take a glass 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:37.010
 make a hole pour water and 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.680
 insert tits there 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:51.130
 all our tits set once dived 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:56.410
 so do all the rest 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:04:02.260
 cooked jars on this job 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:04.060
 will be finished here in less than an hour or 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.360
 about this and on my windowsill 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:15.329
 This garden has grown from 1 which is even 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:17.519
 tomatoes are now left competently 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:22.720
 grow seedlings 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:26.440
 for transplanting everything in our mission we 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:32.500
 today finished men stand 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:35.130
 take root and grow us up to the joy 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.130
