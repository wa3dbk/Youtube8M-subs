all right so here we are in San Diego at

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.010 
all right so here we are in San Diego at
an<00:00:04.080> aquaponics<00:00:04.740> farm<00:00:05.299> being<00:00:06.299> dismantled

an aquaponics farm being dismantled

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.430 
an aquaponics farm being dismantled
because<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.189> greenhouse<00:00:08.700> space<00:00:09.110> has<00:00:10.110> been

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
because the greenhouse space has been

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.980

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.880 
were intentional the scuds have so far
eaten<00:02:41.920> all<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.580> waste<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:44.440> see<00:02:44.590> all<00:02:44.769> the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
eaten all the waste I can see all the

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.610 
eaten all the waste I can see all the
way<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.220> bottom<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.880> tank<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.620> can

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
way to the bottom of this tank I can

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.280 
way to the bottom of this tank I can
actually<00:02:47.769> see<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.250> white<00:02:48.519> on<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.720> bottom<00:02:50.110> of

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
actually see the white on the bottom of

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.320 
actually see the white on the bottom of
this<00:02:50.590> tank

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.060 

so<00:02:55.330> what<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.630> see<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.200> bottom<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.830> the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
so what you see is the bottom of the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.070 
so what you see is the bottom of the
settling<00:02:57.700> tank<00:02:58.000> there<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.390> no<00:02:58.720> other

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
settling tank there is no other

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
that looked like rapid Reuters okay they

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.940 
that looked like rapid Reuters okay they
they<00:04:07.480> germinate<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.050> sprout<00:04:08.110> into<00:04:08.500> seedlings

they germinate and sprout into seedlings
for<00:04:09.160> three<00:04:09.340> weeks<00:04:09.580> and<00:04:09.910> then<00:04:10.870> they<00:04:10.989> go<00:04:11.170> into

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
for three weeks and then they go into

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.610 
for three weeks and then they go into
grow<00:04:11.770> out<00:04:11.980> here<00:04:12.340> for<00:04:13.020> three<00:04:14.020> to<00:04:14.140> six<00:04:14.350> weeks

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
depending on the season focus

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.000

go

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.860 

and<00:04:26.160> these<00:04:26.730> should<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.420> already<00:04:27.690> been

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
and these should have already been

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.930 
and these should have already been
harvested<00:04:28.620> but<00:04:28.830> they're<00:04:29.040> in<00:04:29.190> between<00:04:29.550> plans

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
harvested but they're in between plans

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.430 
harvested but they're in between plans
here<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:31.040> actually<00:04:32.040> getting<00:04:32.540> overdone<00:04:33.540> you're

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
here so actually getting overdone you're

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.230 
here so actually getting overdone you're
loosening<00:04:34.860> up<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.310> they'll<00:04:35.460> probably<00:04:35.670> start

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
loosening up and they'll probably start

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.320 
loosening up and they'll probably start
bolting<00:04:36.510> any<00:04:36.960> moment<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.680> there's<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.430> lot<00:04:38.820> of

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
bolting any moment and there's a lot of

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.600 
bolting any moment and there's a lot of
lettuce<00:04:39.840> right<00:04:40.200> here<00:04:40.760> is<00:04:41.760> another<00:04:42.030> kind<00:04:43.610> I

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
lettuce right here is another kind I

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.730 
lettuce right here is another kind I
mean<00:04:45.150> literally<00:04:45.390> those<00:04:45.630> are<00:04:45.810> probably<00:04:46.260> three

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
mean literally those are probably three

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.460 
mean literally those are probably three
or<00:04:46.830> four<00:04:47.070> pound<00:04:47.700> heads<00:04:48.480> of<00:04:48.780> lettuce<00:04:48.930> maybe

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
or four pound heads of lettuce maybe

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:56.030 
or four pound heads of lettuce maybe
even<00:04:49.710> five<00:04:49.920> pounds<00:04:50.400> each<00:04:52.250> alright<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:55.620> system

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
even five pounds each alright the system

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.100 
even five pounds each alright the system
can<00:04:56.220> put<00:04:56.400> out<00:04:56.490> twenty<00:04:56.820> five<00:04:57.000> hundred<00:04:57.030> heads<00:04:57.810> of

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
can put out twenty five hundred heads of

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.920 
can put out twenty five hundred heads of
lettuce<00:04:58.290> or<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:59.460> double<00:04:59.850> hook<00:04:59.970> doubling<00:05:00.660> up<00:05:00.780> of

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
lettuce or a double hook doubling up of

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.480 
lettuce or a double hook doubling up of
the<00:05:01.020> holes<00:05:01.230> will<00:05:01.470> produce<00:05:01.620> five<00:05:01.980> thousand

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
the holes will produce five thousand

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:11.630 
the holes will produce five thousand
heads<00:05:02.670> of<00:05:02.910> bok<00:05:03.090> choy<00:05:03.950> every<00:05:04.950> single<00:05:05.310> week<00:05:10.640> and

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
heads of bok choy every single week and

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.090 
heads of bok choy every single week and
in<00:05:12.030> order<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.300> do<00:05:12.600> so<00:05:12.840> these<00:05:13.230> things<00:05:13.590> need<00:05:14.040> to

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
in order to do so these things need to

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.950 
in order to do so these things need to
be<00:05:14.280> planted<00:05:14.850> both<00:05:15.030> levels<00:05:15.480> clear<00:05:15.780> full<00:05:16.700> I

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
be planted both levels clear full I

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.240 
be planted both levels clear full I
think<00:05:19.100> although<00:05:20.100> they<00:05:20.340> seem<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.700> be<00:05:22.250> planted

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
think although they seem to be planted

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.010 
think although they seem to be planted
100<00:05:23.610> percent<00:05:23.940> right<00:05:24.090> now<00:05:24.300> but<00:05:24.570> a<00:05:24.600> lot<00:05:24.810> of<00:05:24.840> it

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
100 percent right now but a lot of it

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:32.930 
100 percent right now but a lot of it
looks<00:05:25.230> recent

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.240 

there's<00:05:33.480> some<00:05:33.720> verbena<00:05:34.170> that<00:05:34.890> one<00:05:35.070> of<00:05:35.190> the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
there's some verbena that one of the

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.850 
there's some verbena that one of the
workers<00:05:35.460> thought<00:05:35.910> he'd<00:05:36.060> try<00:05:36.300> to<00:05:36.330> see<00:05:36.720> if<00:05:36.900> he

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
workers thought he'd try to see if he

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.920

could<00:05:38.010> take<00:05:38.220> cuttings<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:39.030> root<00:05:39.330> him<00:05:39.480> in<00:05:39.600> here

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
could take cuttings and root him in here

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.230 
could take cuttings and root him in here
so<00:05:40.140> he<00:05:40.230> literally<00:05:40.500> took<00:05:41.400> a<00:05:41.550> bunch<00:05:41.730> of<00:05:41.880> verbena

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240
