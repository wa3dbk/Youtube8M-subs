00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.180
 this year the winter has stood out not protracted not 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.830
 waiting for the first spring month 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.230
 positive temperature is already happy as 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.029
 motorists and pedestrians along with 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.939
 spring traditional dinner at installers 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.169
 hot days begin 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.500
 motorists are beginning to bother 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.449
 finally it's time to put the rubber 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.369
 meanwhile special attention for 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.040
 flavoring not only tires but also 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.989
 car wheels many wheels 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.180
 struck bordyurnaya disease others and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.190
 does need a full pack 1 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.710
 today we decided to find out how 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.809
 there is a restoration exactly cast 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.790
 disks and at the same time we will ask about 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.949
 the upcoming hype for services 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.369
 Tire of mist and it's not over 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.589
 by the mountains 

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:54.809
 how much this service is in demand now 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.089
 pre actually this is very relevant and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.920
 a service as not everyone is allowed 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.830
 can afford to buy new wheels 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.930
 instead of there old firemen beaten so 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.640
 any further are subject to recovery. 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.100
 alloy wheels either have any 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.659
 size restrictions either 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.640
 radius or some not 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.289
 there are no recoverable items 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 actually set can be anything and 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:19.439
 also purposes expediency pays for 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.579
 that is, sometimes durable, it is possible to find 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.200
 one important disk get bought up or even 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.850
 sometimes the cost of repairs may cost more 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.049
 than the cost again the same would have 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.079
 easy set of disks 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.360
 and so percent of 90 disks from practice 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.370
 they set 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.540
 hide it all in what damage more often 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.340
 total characteristic for alloy wheels 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.890
 normal punches which are reflected on 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.910
 the dome of the disk that is it is purchased 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.130
 they pit rails curbs 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.170
 nests on flat tire What is the difference 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.290
 between the original and so to speak 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.540
 in Chinese disks either replicas like them 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.120
 called questionable production and 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.700
 you can even define corrections viz. 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.640
 They are at rolling out disc editing very 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.220
 soft amenable of course easy to edit but 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.979
 it is also easy for them to bend the same way 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.820
 cases when the client came and he 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.620
 the disc actually hounded through the metal 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.959
 that is, the air passed through the mental 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.489
 block he was porous otherwise they 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.300
 no different at least by 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.820
 appearance 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.920
 in appearance not possible to distinguish 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.440
 please tell me what is 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.750
 a painting restoration procedure 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.730
 alloy wheels and how long does it take 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.010
 the process itself the process itself from and to in 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.520
 the average takes one working day 1 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.200
 working day 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.470
 the guys at the tire shoot first 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.750
 wheels remove the tires on they further 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.500
 browsing discs for deformation if 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.140
 disk editing is necessary 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.900
 iron wheels then rolling aluminum 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.290
 drives are hydraulically edited 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.850
 further, the border is removed 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.830
 diseases so called 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.310
 after the guys removed the bad bar 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.190
 disc disease ready for blasting 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.130
 cleaning using small fraction is removed 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.880
 old paintwork after 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.130
 of this 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.480
 the disc is processed degreased 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.110
 blown with him are removed pellets 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.170
 and fit 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.880
 into the chamber for heating after 10 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.580
 heated to a certain temperature 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.500
 take off the gases search aluminum 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.569
 metal must be sure to leave the gas 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.909
 filmed after the process 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.550
 this one takes place drawing 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.460
 polymer primer 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.860
 polymer polymer paint and already 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.650
 directly polymer cooking after 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.380
 how discs are baked again when 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.810
 a certain temperature 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.420
 get out of the food goes through the process 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.270
 rejection drives cool 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.160
 after that the guys take the discs they collect 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.280
 on them tires balance set on 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.680
 car and so rules 99 percent 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.550
 cases, the procedure takes no more 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.160
 working day 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.140
 tell me how much is the average 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.090
 pleasure if the client means 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.920
 turns to us with a car they 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.690
 bring wheels in the trunk from the ground then 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.110
 have accordingly provide him services 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.090
 tire mounting and repair 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.690
 polymer painting cleaning itself 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.850
 painting cleaning about half a dash 2 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.830
 million takes a set of disks 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:27.620
 it is worth the tire costs from 350 to 450 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.420
 thousand there is put new ventilation 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.390
 discs in general get discs 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.910
 new drives is an integral part 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.520
 decent appearance of the car 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.340
 Immediately make a reservation not pleasure 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.860
 cheap but if your rollers are dear to you 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.080
 Do not refuse the pleasure of the villa 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.670
 yourself and your car first class 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.670
 appearance guarantee
