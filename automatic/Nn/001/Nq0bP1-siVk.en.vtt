00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
at the launch I think when they first

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.920 
at the launch I think when they first
saw<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:01.920> I'd<00:01:02.100> set<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.329> they<00:01:03.660> told<00:01:03.840> me

saw what I'd set out to do they told me
straight<00:01:04.110> away<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> return<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.369> goods

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
straight away to return the goods

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
straight away to return the goods
because<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:06.540> didn't<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.049> had<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
because they didn't think I had the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.780 
because they didn't think I had the
ability<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:08.640> until

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
ability to do it because I think until

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.880 
ability to do it because I think until
you've<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.240> hammered<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.290> nail<00:01:10.320> into<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
second day of building the boats I

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.929 
second day of building the boats I
actually<00:01:31.290> had<00:01:31.500> my<00:01:31.650> dad<00:01:32.100> come<00:01:32.369> around<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.880> help

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
actually had my dad come around and help

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.780 
actually had my dad come around and help
out<00:01:33.710> we<00:01:34.710> had<00:01:34.829> never<00:01:35.040> built<00:01:35.250> anything<00:01:35.369> together

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
out we had never built anything together

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
out we had never built anything together
before<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.509> he<00:01:37.290> definitely<00:01:37.530> did<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> first

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
before but he definitely did the first

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.130 
before but he definitely did the first
couple<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.520> drills<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.079> know

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
couple of drills and I think you know

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660 
couple of drills and I think you know
seeing<00:01:40.439> him<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:40.950> gave<00:01:41.310> me<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.490> lot<00:01:41.610> more

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
seeing him do it gave me a lot more

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.609 
seeing him do it gave me a lot more
confidence<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.479> what<00:01:42.990> actually<00:01:43.140> needed<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
confidence and what actually needed to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469

good<00:01:57.600> part<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.259> an<00:01:58.380> hour<00:01:58.560> they're<00:01:58.979> talking

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
good part of an hour they're talking

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.200 
good part of an hour they're talking
about<00:01:59.430> different<00:01:59.670> boat<00:02:00.000> pains

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
about different boat pains

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.570 
about different boat pains
talking<00:02:01.960> about<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.290> boat<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.799> I<00:02:02.830> built<00:02:03.190> and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
talking about the boat that I built and

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.460 
talking about the boat that I built and
what<00:02:03.729> type<00:02:03.880> of<00:02:03.909> wood<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.299> been<00:02:04.479> used<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:05.260> think

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
what type of wood it been used I think

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.830 
what type of wood it been used I think
the<00:02:05.590> key<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.640> relationships<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.630> you

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
the key is the relationships that you

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.809 
the key is the relationships that you
have<00:02:07.990> along<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.289> way<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:08.830> can<00:02:09.100> phone<00:02:09.520> up<00:02:09.670> the

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
have along the way you can phone up the

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.030 
have along the way you can phone up the
designer<00:02:10.149> Andrew<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.959> no<00:02:11.530> asking<00:02:11.830> what<00:02:11.950> the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
designer Andrew and no asking what the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.430 
designer Andrew and no asking what the
best<00:02:12.220> way<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.640> put<00:02:12.880> on<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> ceilings<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.660> I

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
best way is to put on the ceilings and I

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.960 
best way is to put on the ceilings and I
guess<00:02:14.620> it's<00:02:14.800> just<00:02:14.860> all<00:02:15.130> those<00:02:15.310> lessons<00:02:15.790> along

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
guess it's just all those lessons along

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.090 
guess it's just all those lessons along
the<00:02:16.030> way<00:02:16.150> which<00:02:16.510> make<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:16.959> so<00:02:17.380> as<00:02:17.560> well<00:02:17.770> when<00:02:18.069> I

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
the way which make it so as well when I

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.280 
the way which make it so as well when I
tell<00:02:18.280> people<00:02:18.459> I've<00:02:18.670> built<00:02:18.910> about<00:02:19.180> they<00:02:19.959> think

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
tell people I've built about they think

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.550 
tell people I've built about they think
from<00:02:20.500> scratch<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.569> I'm<00:02:22.569> like<00:02:22.750> no<00:02:22.780> probably

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
from scratch and I'm like no probably

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.990 
from scratch and I'm like no probably
the<00:02:23.739> most<00:02:23.950> difficult<00:02:24.160> bits<00:02:24.610> have<00:02:24.760> already

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
the most difficult bits have already

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.729 
the most difficult bits have already
been<00:02:25.150> done<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.080> woods<00:02:26.290> already<00:02:26.560> been
