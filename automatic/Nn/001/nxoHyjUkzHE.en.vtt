you<00:01:17.720> try<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.049> spawn<00:01:18.770> trap<00:01:19.100> on<00:01:19.399> this<00:01:19.640> map<00:01:19.880> it's

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
you try to spawn trap on this map it's

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.800 
you try to spawn trap on this map it's
quite<00:01:20.720> it's<00:01:21.619> quite<00:01:21.740> easy<00:01:22.100> really

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
went 92 and 30 on the end of this map

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.870 
went 92 and 30 on the end of this map
here<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:38.619> it's<00:01:39.619> basically<00:01:39.890> going<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.610> show

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
here and it's basically going to show

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.749 
here and it's basically going to show
you<00:01:40.939> here<00:01:41.570> what<00:01:42.110> happens<00:01:42.740> when<00:01:43.189> you<00:01:43.369> place<00:01:43.729> a

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
you here what happens when you place a

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.120 
you here what happens when you place a
guardian<00:01:44.360> there<00:01:44.570> on<00:01:44.689> that<00:01:44.840> left<00:01:45.079> side<00:01:45.289> how

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
guardian there on that left side how

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.380 
guardian there on that left side how
they'll<00:01:46.399> just<00:01:46.610> spawn<00:01:46.939> directly<00:01:47.810> into<00:01:48.320> it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.920 

as<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:53.890> can<00:01:54.010> see<00:01:54.280> they'll<00:01:54.700> keep<00:01:55.240> spawn<00:01:55.630> there

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
as you can see they'll keep spawn there

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.930 
as you can see they'll keep spawn there
and<00:01:56.200> there's<00:01:56.380> no<00:01:56.620> way<00:01:56.860> for<00:01:56.890> them<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.340> possibly

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
and there's no way for them to possibly

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.700 
and there's no way for them to possibly
get<00:01:58.150> out<00:01:58.270> they<00:01:58.540> will<00:01:58.780> spawn<00:01:59.110> in<00:01:59.140> those<00:01:59.470> two

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
get out they will spawn in those two

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.320 
get out they will spawn in those two
corners<00:02:00.130> one<00:02:00.340> against<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.850> wall<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.150> one

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
corners one against the wall and one

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.290 
corners one against the wall and one
against<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.950> ship<00:02:02.950> side<00:02:03.369> on<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.729> left<00:02:04.000> there

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
against the ship side on the left there

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.990 
against the ship side on the left there
as<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.290> can<00:02:05.350> see<00:02:05.440> they<00:02:05.740> keep<00:02:05.950> spawning<00:02:06.580> and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
as you can see they keep spawning and

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.900 
as you can see they keep spawning and
dying<00:02:07.210> spawning<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:08.380> dying<00:02:08.590> there's<00:02:09.399> no<00:02:09.700> way

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
dying spawning and dying there's no way

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.530 
dying spawning and dying there's no way
for<00:02:09.940> them<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.500> get<00:02:11.500> out<00:02:11.680> at<00:02:11.860> all<00:02:12.120> they're<00:02:13.120> just

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
for them to get out at all they're just

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.040 
for them to get out at all they're just
they're<00:02:13.990> totally<00:02:14.500> screwed<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.690> by<00:02:16.690> having

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
they're totally screwed and by having

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.410 
they're totally screwed and by having
the<00:02:17.320> sentry<00:02:17.830> on<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.250> right<00:02:18.400> side<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> door<00:02:19.000> got

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
the sentry on the right side a door got

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.840 
the sentry on the right side a door got
another<00:02:19.660> Guardian<00:02:20.260> possibly<00:02:20.860> on<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.640> other

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
another Guardian possibly on the other

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.430 
another Guardian possibly on the other
side<00:02:22.060> will<00:02:22.300> definitely<00:02:22.810> lock<00:02:23.020> them<00:02:23.260> into

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
side will definitely lock them into

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.460 
side will definitely lock them into

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
they will spawn in the middle now if you
