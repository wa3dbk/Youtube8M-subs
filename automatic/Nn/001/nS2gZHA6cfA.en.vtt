00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
a bit a little so you got the corners

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.160 
a bit a little so you got the corners
here<00:00:59.159> I<00:00:59.309> used<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.970> squeeze<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> plastic<00:01:00.989> up

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
here I used to squeeze the plastic up

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.259 
here I used to squeeze the plastic up
and<00:01:01.799> just<00:01:02.100> pop<00:01:02.339> it<00:01:02.460> over<00:01:02.580> the<00:01:02.729> corners<00:01:03.059> there

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.899 
and just pop it over the corners there
and<00:01:03.540> then<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> same<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.880> other

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
and then you do the same with the other

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.960 
and then you do the same with the other
corner<00:01:07.220> it<00:01:08.220> should<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.610> overlap<00:01:09.570> nicely

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
corner it should just overlap nicely

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.140 
corner it should just overlap nicely

through<00:04:01.050> guys<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.980> is<00:04:02.160> some<00:04:02.340> hard<00:04:02.580> plastic

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
through guys this is some hard plastic

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.710 
through guys this is some hard plastic
here<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.690> it's<00:04:04.019> Brutus<00:04:04.650> it's<00:04:05.640> not<00:04:05.850> thick<00:04:06.209> but

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
here and it's Brutus it's not thick but

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.600 
here and it's Brutus it's not thick but
it<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.019> strong<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:08.040> know<00:04:08.220> you're<00:04:08.519> not

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
it is strong so you know you're not

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.310 
it is strong so you know you're not
going<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.820> get<00:04:08.940> any<00:04:09.060> big<00:04:09.600> scratches<00:04:09.989> through

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
going to get any big scratches through

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.280 
going to get any big scratches through
it<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.620> even<00:04:11.010> if<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.310> do<00:04:11.489> drop<00:04:11.760> it<00:04:11.959> it<00:04:12.959> is<00:04:13.110> not

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
it and even if you do drop it it is not

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.840 
it and even if you do drop it it is not
full<00:04:13.680> protection<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.340> you'll<00:04:14.459> probably<00:04:14.640> get

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
full protection so you'll probably get

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.340 
full protection so you'll probably get
like<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.060> little<00:04:15.150> scratch<00:04:15.750> maybe<00:04:16.019> underneath

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
like a little scratch maybe underneath

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.380 
like a little scratch maybe underneath
but<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.519> know<00:04:17.669> it's<00:04:17.910> not<00:04:18.090> going<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.299> be

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
but you know it's not going to be

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.240 
but you know it's not going to be
anything<00:04:18.600> deadly<00:04:19.230> so<00:04:19.560> it's<00:04:19.769> better<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.130> have

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
anything deadly so it's better to have

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.039 
anything deadly so it's better to have
it<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:20.519> then<00:04:20.760> off<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.390> maybe<00:04:21.570> look<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.930> bit

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049
