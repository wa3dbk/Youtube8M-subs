00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
trimmer which makes cuts in either

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.129 
trimmer which makes cuts in either
either<00:00:12.480> three<00:00:13.049> or<00:00:13.250> just<00:00:14.250> two<00:00:14.549> pieces<00:00:15.509> let<00:00:15.990> me

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
either three or just two pieces let me

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.349 
either three or just two pieces let me
let<00:00:16.350> me<00:00:16.440> show<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.650> what<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.859> mean<00:00:17.240> there<00:00:18.240> are

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
let me show you what I mean there are

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.290 
let me show you what I mean there are
two<00:00:18.539> slots<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.410> put<00:00:19.650> your<00:00:19.800> papers<00:00:20.130> in

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
two slots that you put your papers in

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.259 
two slots that you put your papers in
and<00:00:22.250> this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> first<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.210> actually

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and this is the first one that actually

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.140 
and this is the first one that actually
has<00:00:24.660> two<00:00:25.019> cuts<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.039> makes<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.119> a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
has two cuts so it makes if you have a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.259 
has two cuts so it makes if you have a
full<00:00:27.810> sized<00:00:28.080> paper<00:00:28.349> twelve<00:00:28.949> by<00:00:29.070> twelve<00:00:29.269> you

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
full sized paper twelve by twelve you

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.049 
full sized paper twelve by twelve you
don't<00:00:30.420> cut<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:31.529> three<00:00:33.140> equally<00:00:34.140> sized

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
don't cut it in three equally sized

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.330 
don't cut it in three equally sized
slits<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.390> find<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.320> sometimes<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.129> car

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
slits I find that sometimes the car

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:50.240 
slits I find that sometimes the car
stops<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.969> little<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> that's<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.070> can't

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
stops a little bit so that's if I can't

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.380 
stops a little bit so that's if I can't
manage<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.820> one<00:00:51.030> better

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
manage this one better

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.970 
manage this one better
so<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.600> actually<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.680> pay

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
so you actually actually have to pay

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.700 
so you actually actually have to pay
attention<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.760> how<00:00:54.059> wide<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:54.660> paper<00:00:55.020> from

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
attention to how wide is your paper from

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.680 
attention to how wide is your paper from
the<00:00:55.829> get-go<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.879> now<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the get-go but now I have it in the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.619 
the get-go but now I have it in the
first<00:00:57.960> slot<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.399> see<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> two<00:01:00.059> black

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
first slot and you can see the two black

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.799 
first slot and you can see the two black
lines<00:01:00.899> there<00:01:01.940> might<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.390> give<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
lines there might have to give it a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.370 
lines there might have to give it a
little<00:01:03.960> bit<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> brush<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:09.380> single

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
little bit of a brush so now single

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
little bit of a brush so now single
punch<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.400> actually<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:11.939> three<00:01:12.090> pieces<00:01:12.450> of

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
punch you actually get three pieces of

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.270 
punch you actually get three pieces of
paper<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.080> measure<00:01:13.439> 4<00:01:13.950> by<00:01:14.700> 12<00:01:15.060> inches<00:01:16.220> if<00:01:17.220> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
paper that measure 4 by 12 inches if you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.090 
paper that measure 4 by 12 inches if you
would<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.180> make<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.630> into<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> let's<00:01:19.860> say

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
would like to make this into a let's say

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.480 
would like to make this into a let's say
page<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> pocket<00:01:21.390> page<00:01:21.920> for<00:01:22.920> project

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
page for a pocket page for project

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.730 
page for a pocket page for project
layouts<00:01:23.850> project<00:01:24.750> lines<00:01:24.900> layouts<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.560> such

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
layouts project lines layouts and such

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.440 
layouts project lines layouts and such
you<00:01:26.040> could<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.400> put<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> other<00:01:27.060> slots

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you could just put it in the other slots

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.560 
you could just put it in the other slots
which<00:01:28.259> automatically<00:01:29.100> cuts<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.290> into

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
which automatically cuts it into

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.190 
which automatically cuts it into
so<00:01:33.470> that<00:01:33.650> means<00:01:34.000> as<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:35.120> ended<00:01:35.510> up<00:01:35.630> with<00:01:35.930> two

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
so that means as I ended up with two

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.980 
so that means as I ended up with two
pieces<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.740> paper<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:37.220> are<00:01:37.280> 4<00:01:37.790> by<00:01:38.240> 6<00:01:38.540> inches

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
pieces of paper that are 4 by 6 inches

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.960 
pieces of paper that are 4 by 6 inches
so<00:01:39.260> now<00:01:39.980> you're<00:01:40.160> actually<00:01:40.460> ready<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.820> decorate

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
so now you're actually ready to decorate

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.930 
so now you're actually ready to decorate
on<00:01:41.360> such<00:01:41.600> but<00:01:42.440> let's<00:01:42.680> say<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:43.190> would<00:01:43.430> like<00:01:43.670> to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
on such but let's say I would like to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.500 
on such but let's say I would like to
make<00:01:44.120> this<00:01:44.390> one<00:01:44.690> a<00:01:44.840> little<00:01:44.870> bit<00:01:45.320> smaller<00:01:46.450> all<00:01:47.450> I

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
make this one a little bit smaller all I

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.560 
make this one a little bit smaller all I
have<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:47.930> do<00:01:48.050> is<00:01:48.170> adjust<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:49.160> back<00:01:50.080> handles

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
have to do is adjust the back handles

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.270 
have to do is adjust the back handles
put<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.690> in<00:01:53.810> there

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.250 

so<00:01:58.280> now<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.490> have<00:01:58.700> two<00:01:59.510> pieces<00:01:59.780> of<00:01:59.810> paper<00:02:00.080> that

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
so now you have two pieces of paper that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.170 
so now you have two pieces of paper that
actually<00:02:00.650> are<00:02:00.770> 4<00:02:01.040> by<00:02:01.220> 3<00:02:01.370> inches<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.150> can

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
actually are 4 by 3 inches and you can

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.120 
actually are 4 by 3 inches and you can
put<00:02:02.479> those<00:02:02.630> also<00:02:02.960> into<00:02:03.590> your<00:02:03.680> project<00:02:04.010> life

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
put those also into your project life

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.290 
put those also into your project life
pockets<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:06.170> I<00:02:06.470> go<00:02:06.710> on<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:07.520> course<00:02:07.820> making

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
pockets and I go on of course making

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.350 
pockets and I go on of course making
these<00:02:08.600> this<00:02:09.020> one<00:02:09.229> smaller<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.369> smaller<00:02:10.759> as<00:02:11.150> I

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
these this one smaller and smaller as I

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.410 
these this one smaller and smaller as I
go<00:02:11.540> along<00:02:12.520> let's<00:02:13.520> see<00:02:13.640> if<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.790> can<00:02:13.940> make<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.180> go

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
go along let's see if I can make it go

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.100 
go along let's see if I can make it go
down<00:02:15.730> just<00:02:16.730> make<00:02:16.790> sure<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.209> those<00:02:17.360> arms<00:02:17.810> honk

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
down just make sure that those arms honk

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.280 
down just make sure that those arms honk
at<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.350> paper<00:02:20.200> fish<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.610> base<00:02:22.840> for<00:02:23.840> white<00:02:24.050> you

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
at the paper fish and base for white you

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.350 
at the paper fish and base for white you
worship<00:02:24.650> as<00:02:24.800> opposed<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.880> course<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.239> could

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
worship as opposed and of course I could

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.040 
worship as opposed and of course I could
go<00:02:26.480> even<00:02:26.870> smaller<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:28.340> make<00:02:28.520> sort<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:29.050> portrait

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
go even smaller to make sort of portrait

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.470 
go even smaller to make sort of portrait
photo<00:02:30.560> thing<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:32.450> I'm<00:02:33.020> here<00:02:33.410> so<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:35.270> is

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
photo thing is and I'm here so this is

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.040 
photo thing is and I'm here so this is
the<00:02:35.660> smallest<00:02:35.930> able<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.500> go<00:02:37.720> let's<00:02:38.720> see<00:02:38.870> if<00:02:38.989> I

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
the smallest able to go let's see if I

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.509 
the smallest able to go let's see if I
can<00:02:39.200> get<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.470> we're<00:02:39.920> going<00:02:40.040> through<00:02:40.190> without

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
can get it we're going through without

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.400 
can get it we're going through without
pushing<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.060> so<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.870> smallest<00:02:42.140> I

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
pushing it so this is the smallest I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.560 
pushing it so this is the smallest I
could<00:02:42.560> actually<00:02:42.709> do<00:02:43.100> with<00:02:43.130> this<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.420> they

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
could actually do with this and they

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.280 
could actually do with this and they
just<00:02:44.750> put<00:02:45.019> it<00:02:45.050> small<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.410> must<00:02:45.650> say<00:02:47.019> let's<00:02:48.019> say<00:02:48.260> I

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
just put it small I must say let's say I

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.910 
just put it small I must say let's say I
will<00:02:48.590> go<00:02:48.769> back<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.459> this<00:02:49.580> one<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.739> I<00:02:51.739> would

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
will go back to this one and I would

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.170 
will go back to this one and I would
like<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.370> make<00:02:52.660> four<00:02:53.660> by<00:02:53.870> four<00:02:54.230> inch<00:02:55.180> pages

piece of paper in this direction instead
I<00:03:07.370> end<00:03:08.060> up<00:03:08.209> with<00:03:08.390> three<00:03:08.600> pieces<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:10.190> can

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
I end up with three pieces so you can

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.280 
I end up with three pieces so you can
imagine<00:03:10.790> just<00:03:10.820> by<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.239> couple<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.630> passes<00:03:12.140> in

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.289 
imagine just by a couple of passes in
this<00:03:12.440> machine<00:03:12.650> we<00:03:13.340> could<00:03:13.489> actually<00:03:13.610> get<00:03:13.940> nine

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
this machine we could actually get nine

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.229 
this machine we could actually get nine
pieces<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.049> paper<00:03:15.320> for<00:03:15.920> your<00:03:16.070> mini<00:03:16.310> albums<00:03:16.760> in

quite a few combinations of paper sizes

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.970 
quite a few combinations of paper sizes
I<00:04:10.439> do<00:04:11.189> like<00:04:11.670> this<00:04:12.000> when<00:04:12.359> it<00:04:12.450> comes<00:04:12.689> to<00:04:13.019> using<00:04:13.859> it

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
I do like this when it comes to using it

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.240 
I do like this when it comes to using it
for<00:04:14.189> project<00:04:14.519> life<00:04:14.670> or<00:04:15.030> page<00:04:15.359> pocket<00:04:15.780> things

for project life or page pocket things

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.810 
for project life or page pocket things
so<00:04:17.250> that's<00:04:17.370> it

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
so that's it

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.820
