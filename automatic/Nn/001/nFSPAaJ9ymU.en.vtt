 Hello everyone, you probably heard this 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.309
 history as jazzmen fucking shift filmed 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.039
 covers with your humbucker of in order 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.140
 so that the sound gets brighter to me too 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.330
 it became interesting how much it will change 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.520
 and I conducted an experiment with the results 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.180
 which I offer you now 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.620
 read entries participated 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.890
 Chinese humbucker of which were 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.590
 covers removed no sound processing 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.270
 only pure signal was used and 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.270
 so breeches vaio position 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.930
 but 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.470
 Here is a comparison with me 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.720
 It turned out I called about the cheapest 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.610
 alternative to replacing pickups with well 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.190
 Of course, if they are your covers 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.690
 by the way you can take this chip to your 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.570
 weaponry if you ever 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.530
 need to curb too bright top 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.750
 standing guitar 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.140
 well, that's all and be with you 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.140
 strength
