00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.160 

that's<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.570> K<00:01:34.840> 40<00:01:35.259> electronics<00:01:35.860> RL<00:01:36.520> 360<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.869> is

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
that's a K 40 electronics RL 360 it is

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.810 
that's a K 40 electronics RL 360 it is
like<00:01:38.439> a<00:01:38.470> force<00:01:38.860> field<00:01:39.100> around<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.490> car<00:01:39.670> that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
like a force field around the car that

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.670 
like a force field around the car that
it<00:01:39.909> blocks<00:01:40.119> all<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.479> lasers<00:01:40.960> basically<00:01:41.590> you

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
it blocks all the lasers basically you

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.109 
it blocks all the lasers basically you
can't<00:01:42.039> get<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.340> ticket
