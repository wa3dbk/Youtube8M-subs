complimentary blocks we have to work
with<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:20.210> they're<00:00:21.210> all<00:00:21.330> kind<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.869> kind

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
with here they're all kind of that kind

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.550 
with here they're all kind of that kind
of<00:00:22.140> aquamarine<00:00:22.680> teller<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> I'm<00:00:24.689> thinking<00:00:25.289> if

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
of aquamarine teller so I'm thinking if

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.320 
of aquamarine teller so I'm thinking if
we're<00:00:25.769> gonna<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> wall<00:00:26.670> or<00:00:27.029> something

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
we're gonna do like a wall or something

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.259 
we're gonna do like a wall or something
let's<00:00:27.900> kind<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.349> put<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> basic<00:00:29.130> frame<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:29.910> here

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
let's kind of put a basic frame out here

you know help you come in to see how
some<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.149> these<00:00:39.239> things<00:00:39.300> look<00:00:39.809> together<00:00:40.050> and

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
some of these things look together and

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.369 
some of these things look together and
walls<00:00:41.969> are<00:00:42.270> very<00:00:42.450> cool<00:00:42.750> things<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.260> do

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
walls are very cool things to do

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.160 
walls are very cool things to do
patterns<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.539> see<00:00:45.539> complementary

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
patterns with and see complementary

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.799 
patterns with and see complementary
colors<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.420> gray

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
colors see I kind of like that the gray

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.639 
colors see I kind of like that the gray
in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:50.329> aquamarine<00:00:51.329> color<00:00:51.690> goes<00:00:52.469> well

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
in the aquamarine color goes well

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.959 
in the aquamarine color goes well
together<00:00:52.829> actually<00:00:53.160> yellow<00:00:53.699> from<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
together actually yellow from the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.229 
together actually yellow from the
sandstone<00:00:54.480> goes<00:00:54.780> good<00:00:55.170> there<00:00:55.410> too<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:57.090> it's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
sandstone goes good there too and it's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.240 
sandstone goes good there too and it's
something<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:58.410> let's<00:00:59.100> see

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
something like that and then let's see

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.770 
something like that and then let's see
like<00:01:00.000> brick<00:01:00.359> well<00:01:01.789> not<00:01:02.789> totally<00:01:03.000> against<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
like brick well not totally against it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.230 
like brick well not totally against it
but<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.049> doesn't<00:01:04.199> really<00:01:04.430> pop<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.760> same<00:01:06.000> way

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
but it doesn't really pop the same way

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.859 
but it doesn't really pop the same way
it's<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.200> complementary<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:09.479> I'm<00:01:09.540> thinking

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it's not complementary so I'm thinking

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.899 
it's not complementary so I'm thinking
for<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.200> most<00:01:10.350> part<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.130> gray<00:01:11.430> colors

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
for the most part all the gray colors

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.390 
for the most part all the gray colors
that<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.770> here's<00:01:13.950> polished

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that you have like here here's polished

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.870 
that you have like here here's polished
indoor<00:01:14.820> site<00:01:15.000> next<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:16.400> do<00:01:17.400> something<00:01:17.640> like

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
indoor site next to it do something like

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:28.160 
indoor site next to it do something like
this<00:01:18.240> maybe<00:01:23.119> that<00:01:25.880> kind<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.119> like<00:01:27.240> an<00:01:27.420> weird

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
this maybe that kind of do like an weird

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.249 
this maybe that kind of do like an weird
design<00:01:28.650> here<00:01:29.329> see<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.689> looks<00:01:30.960> getting

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
design here see that looks getting

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.090 
design here see that looks getting
together<00:01:31.880> that's<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.060> kind<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:34.100> complement

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
together that's to kind of complement

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.960 
together that's to kind of complement
each<00:01:35.250> other<00:01:35.549> now<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.170> this

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
each other now if we go like with this

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.080 
each other now if we go like with this
scene<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.329> pretty<00:01:40.049> much<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> same<00:01:40.530> thing<00:01:41.090> all

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
scene see pretty much the same thing all

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:51.709 
scene see pretty much the same thing all
looks<00:01:42.479> really<00:01:42.659> good<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:48.500> man

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
darker Gray's and stuff look at those

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.899 
darker Gray's and stuff look at those
pixels<00:01:56.679> there<00:01:56.979> they<00:01:57.219> kind<00:01:57.399> of<00:01:57.429> match<00:01:57.579> up<00:01:57.609> with

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
pixels there they kind of match up with

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.529 
pixels there they kind of match up with
that<00:01:57.969> oops<00:01:58.719> that<00:01:59.409> color

that<00:02:07.049> yeah<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.759> wood<00:02:09.910> doesn't<00:02:10.239> really

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
that yeah see the wood doesn't really

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.420 
that yeah see the wood doesn't really
it's<00:02:10.929> not<00:02:11.080> complementary<00:02:11.739> or<00:02:12.160> contrasting

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
it's not complementary or contrasting

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.960 
that's so cool it kind of has like the
animated<00:02:23.230> texture<00:02:23.769> there<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.190> like<00:02:25.000> it

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
animated texture there I like it

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.280 
animated texture there I like it
so<00:02:27.970> I'm<00:02:28.090> saying<00:02:28.360> for<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.599> most<00:02:28.660> part<00:02:29.049> these

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
so I'm saying for the most part these

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.990 
so I'm saying for the most part these
kind<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.650> blocks<00:02:30.150> are<00:02:31.150> gonna<00:02:31.390> be<00:02:31.599> handy<00:02:32.140> for

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
kind of blocks are gonna be handy for

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.660 
kind of blocks are gonna be handy for
maybe<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.150> big<00:02:34.420> builds<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.500> adding<00:02:35.829> like

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
maybe like big builds and adding like

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.069 
maybe like big builds and adding like
where<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.000> do<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.299> whole<00:02:37.569> bunch<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.930> this

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
where you do like a whole bunch of this

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.120 
where you do like a whole bunch of this
like<00:02:38.319> blah<00:02:38.709> blah<00:02:38.739> blah<00:02:39.160> blah<00:02:39.519> blah<00:02:40.739> but<00:02:41.739> other

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
like blah blah blah blah blah but other

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.770 
like blah blah blah blah blah but other
than<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.519> it's<00:02:42.880> pretty<00:02:42.970> much<00:02:43.510> be<00:02:43.750> like

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
than that it's pretty much be like

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.539 
than that it's pretty much be like
complementary<00:02:44.680> colors<00:02:46.980> now<00:02:47.980> let's<00:02:48.190> take<00:02:48.519> a

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
complementary colors now let's take a

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.860 
complementary colors now let's take a
look<00:02:48.700> at<00:02:48.819> this<00:02:49.060> what<00:02:49.390> if<00:02:49.450> we<00:02:49.510> kind<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.750> came

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
look at this what if we kind of came

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.350 
look at this what if we kind of came
across<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.349> top<00:02:50.560> with<00:02:50.829> this<00:02:51.040> here<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:52.239> also

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
across the top with this here and also

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.449 
across the top with this here and also
there's<00:02:52.629> no<00:02:52.780> stair<00:02:53.140> variant<00:02:53.829> there's<00:02:54.010> no<00:02:54.160> slab

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
there's no stair variant there's no slab

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.210 
there's no stair variant there's no slab
variant<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.209> it's<00:02:55.329> gonna<00:02:55.420> be<00:02:55.540> really<00:02:55.630> hard<00:02:55.900> to

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
variant so it's gonna be really hard to

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.900 
variant so it's gonna be really hard to
use<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.430> as<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.609> basic<00:02:58.420> building<00:02:58.660> block<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.790> see

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
use it as a basic building block but see

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.729 
use it as a basic building block but see
we<00:03:01.060> already<00:03:01.329> got<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.540> design<00:03:01.989> going<00:03:02.319> there<00:03:02.620> I

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
we already got a design going there I

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.080 
we already got a design going there I
could<00:03:05.739> even<00:03:05.889> just<00:03:06.130> pop<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.489> out<00:03:06.519> even<00:03:06.970> one

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
could even just pop that out even one

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.610 
could even just pop that out even one
more<00:03:07.299> or<00:03:07.660> leave<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:07.989> set<00:03:08.590> back<00:03:10.410> let's<00:03:11.410> look<00:03:11.530> at

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
more or leave it set back let's look at

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.030 
more or leave it set back let's look at
stairs<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.989> quartz<00:03:17.440> is<00:03:17.530> gonna<00:03:17.709> look<00:03:17.829> really

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
stairs that quartz is gonna look really

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.000 
stairs that quartz is gonna look really
good<00:03:18.220> nip<00:03:18.519> next<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.120> too<00:03:19.680> let's<00:03:20.680> do<00:03:20.829> some

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
good nip next to it too let's do some

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.300 
good nip next to it too let's do some
quartz<00:03:21.370> like<00:03:22.380> like<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.220> like<00:03:24.370> that

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
quartz like like this and like that

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.440 
quartz like like this and like that
well<00:03:27.310> quartz<00:03:27.790> doesn't<00:03:28.090> look<00:03:28.180> good<00:03:28.299> with

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
well quartz doesn't look good with

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.699 
well quartz doesn't look good with
anything<00:03:28.569> else<00:03:28.930> though<00:03:29.230> if<00:03:29.349> you're<00:03:29.470> doing

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
anything else though if you're doing

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.909 
anything else though if you're doing
just<00:03:29.859> all<00:03:30.010> quartz<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:31.349> would<00:03:32.349> like<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:34.919> maybe

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
just all quartz I would like it maybe

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.890 
just all quartz I would like it maybe
across<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.489> top<00:03:36.700> there<00:03:37.799> for<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.859> most<00:03:39.040> part<00:03:39.310> I

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
across the top there for the most part I

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.759 
across the top there for the most part I
like<00:03:40.900> this<00:03:43.139> well<00:03:44.139> you<00:03:44.230> got<00:03:44.380> your<00:03:44.560> pattern

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
like this well you got your pattern

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.140 
like this well you got your pattern
there<00:03:45.190> with<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.579> poles

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
there with the poles

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.210 
there with the poles
you<00:03:46.840> got<00:03:47.079> a<00:03:47.440> contrast<00:03:48.220> D<00:03:48.459> thing<00:03:48.730> here<00:03:49.090> with<00:03:49.359> the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
you got a contrast D thing here with the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.979 
you got a contrast D thing here with the
stripe<00:03:51.220> across<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.819> top<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.630> then<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:52.810> got<00:03:52.959> a

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
stripe across the top and then you got a

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.539 
stripe across the top and then you got a
little<00:03:53.079> bit<00:03:53.260> of<00:03:53.349> a<00:03:53.410> pattern<00:03:53.650> down<00:03:54.010> there<00:03:54.250> too

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
little bit of a pattern down there too

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.220 
little bit of a pattern down there too
there's<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.090> lot<00:03:55.239> going<00:03:55.540> on<00:03:55.630> here<00:03:55.690> but<00:03:55.989> it's

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
there's a lot going on here but it's

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.490 
there's a lot going on here but it's
still<00:03:56.290> fairly<00:03:56.680> simple<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.430> do<00:03:58.230> we<00:03:59.230> could<00:03:59.349> even

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
still fairly simple to do we could even

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.680 
still fairly simple to do we could even
add<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.680> back<00:04:00.239> even<00:04:01.239> pop<00:04:01.389> this<00:04:01.570> out<00:04:01.780> one<00:04:01.989> more

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
add that back even pop this out one more

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.350 
add that back even pop this out one more
and<00:04:03.500> just<00:04:03.650> go<00:04:03.740> with<00:04:03.830> a<00:04:03.890> one<00:04:04.130> wide<00:04:04.340> wall<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:08.150> I

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
and just go with a one wide wall so I

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.580 
and just go with a one wide wall so I
hope<00:04:08.570> you've<00:04:08.720> enjoyed<00:04:08.780> this<00:04:09.230> hope<00:04:09.440> you've
