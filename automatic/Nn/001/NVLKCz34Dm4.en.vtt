have some kind of plastic material here
in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.649> back<00:00:46.860> which<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.460> coming<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
in the back which is coming like the

in the back which is coming like the
same<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.289> something<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.680> using<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.309> their

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
same as if something is using on their

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.910 
same as if something is using on their
products<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> back<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.440> think<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
products on the back this I think that

products on the back this I think that
has<00:00:53.399> kind<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> same<00:00:54.059> feeling<00:00:54.539> and

will not damage your device which is
very<00:01:16.680> nice<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.520> how<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.820> works<00:01:18.090> five

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
very nice so how this works five

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.760 
very nice so how this works five
thousand<00:01:18.930> six<00:01:19.080> hundred<00:01:19.200> eighty<00:01:19.500> five

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
thousand six hundred eighty five

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.499 
thousand six hundred eighty five
thousand<00:01:20.100> six<00:01:20.189> hundred<00:01:20.280> milliamps<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.790> first

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
thousand six hundred milliamps so first

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.410 
thousand six hundred milliamps so first
you<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> normal<00:01:22.320> battery<00:01:22.580> over<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:23.880> which

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
you get a normal battery over here which

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
you get a normal battery over here which
is<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> same<00:01:24.869> size<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:25.439> some<00:01:25.770> things<00:01:25.979> own

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
is the same size as some things own

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.300 
is the same size as some things own
original<00:01:26.790> battery<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.900> replace<00:01:28.890> your

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
original battery so you replace your

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.910 
original battery so you replace your
something<00:01:30.240> original<00:01:31.049> battery<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.680> one

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
something original battery with this one

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.050 
something original battery with this one
which<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.310> two<00:01:32.490> thousand<00:01:32.790> six<00:01:33.000> hundred

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
which is two thousand six hundred

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.020 
which is two thousand six hundred
milliamps<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.799> they<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:34.920> 2006<00:01:35.520> under<00:01:35.670> my<00:01:35.790> arms

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
milliamps or they are 2006 under my arms

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.910 
milliamps or they are 2006 under my arms
and<00:01:36.180> then<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> has<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> little<00:01:37.049> thing<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.680> on

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and then it has a little thing here on

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.620 
and then it has a little thing here on
top<00:01:38.930> where<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> option<00:01:41.340> to

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
top where you will have the option to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.950 
top where you will have the option to
this<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.710> not<00:01:43.890> something<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
this one this is not something that the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.240 
this one this is not something that the
original<00:01:45.960> battery<00:01:46.229> has<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
original battery has but this is to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730 
original battery has but this is to
connect<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.119> other<00:01:48.329> part<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.200> piece<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
connect the other part and piece of the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.280 
connect the other part and piece of the
battery<00:01:50.159> which<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.939> inside<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.960> case

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
battery which is inside of this case

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.280 
battery which is inside of this case
which<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.060> 3000<00:01:54.060> milliamp<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.170> add

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
which is 3000 milliamp so if you add

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.249 
which is 3000 milliamp so if you add
that<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.340> becomes<00:01:56.790> five<00:01:57.750> thousand

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
that up then it becomes five thousand

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.010 
that up then it becomes five thousand
six<00:01:58.649> hundred<00:01:58.770> milliamps<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.780> see<00:02:00.899> at

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
six hundred milliamps and you can see at

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.800 
six hundred milliamps and you can see at
this<00:02:01.200> case<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.070> course<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:03.210> starts<00:02:03.630> off<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
this case of course it starts off a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.010 
this case of course it starts off a
little<00:02:04.110> bit<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:06.090> course<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.540> will<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.719> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
little bit so of course it will be a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.169 
little bit so of course it will be a
little<00:02:07.200> bit<00:02:07.350> bulkier<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
little bit bulkier and then if you

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.969 
little bit bulkier and then if you
wouldn't<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:09.929> hey<00:02:10.110> five<00:02:10.679> thousand

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
wouldn't have this but hey five thousand

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.450 
wouldn't have this but hey five thousand
six<00:02:11.190> hundred<00:02:11.280> milliamps<00:02:11.670> it

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
six hundred milliamps it

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.450 
six hundred milliamps it
is<00:02:12.550> at<00:02:13.030> least<00:02:13.240> twice<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.630> amount<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:14.710> battery

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
is at least twice the amount of battery

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.890 
is at least twice the amount of battery
inside<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.450> an<00:02:16.540> s4<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.400> just<00:02:18.400> go<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.910> replace

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
inside of an s4 so just go and replace

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:28.650 
inside of an s4 so just go and replace
the<00:02:20.110> battery<00:02:20.500> here<00:02:20.710> on<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.860> back<00:02:27.090> there<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.210> go

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
the battery here on the back there we go

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.520 
the battery here on the back there we go
fits<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:29.740> like<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.100> normal<00:02:30.310> battery<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.530> then

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
fits just like a normal battery and then

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.270 
fits just like a normal battery and then
what<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.340> do<00:02:33.490> here<00:02:33.850> is<00:02:34.000> we<00:02:34.330> just<00:02:34.690> put<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:36.160> in

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
what we do here is we just put it in

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:53.790 
what we do here is we just put it in
here<00:02:39.030> fits<00:02:40.030> very<00:02:40.360> nicely

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.040 

and<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.580> can<00:02:54.730> see<00:02:54.850> here<00:02:55.000> how<00:02:55.210> easily<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:56.020> is

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
and you can see here how easily it is

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.650 
and you can see here how easily it is
closing<00:02:56.740> I<00:02:58.230> mean<00:02:59.230> here<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.590> snap<00:02:59.800> okay<00:03:00.730> here

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
closing I mean here it is snap okay here

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.920 
closing I mean here it is snap okay here
we<00:03:01.780> go

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
we go

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
so you can just close it pretty quick

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.770 
so you can just close it pretty quick
and<00:03:05.080> it's<00:03:05.230> blocking<00:03:05.560> something<00:03:05.950> close<00:03:09.780> very

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
and it's blocking something close very

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.120 
and it's blocking something close very

more battery a well woah now how does

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.040 
more battery a well woah now how does
this<00:03:44.770> feel<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:46.060> this<00:03:46.270> side<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.540> little<00:03:46.780> bit<00:03:46.930> you

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
this feel on this side a little bit you

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.070 
this feel on this side a little bit you
can<00:03:47.140> feel<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.500> one<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.710> little<00:03:48.040> bit<00:03:48.280> too<00:03:48.490> close

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
can feel this one a little bit too close

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.770 
can feel this one a little bit too close
but<00:03:50.080> you<00:03:50.170> can<00:03:50.290> still<00:03:50.490> easily<00:03:51.490> push<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.480> button

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
but you can still easily push the button

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.370 
but you can still easily push the button
but<00:03:54.030> that's<00:03:55.030> one<00:03:55.270> little<00:03:55.540> thing<00:03:55.840> there<00:03:56.110> is<00:03:56.290> you

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
but that's one little thing there is you

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.490 
but that's one little thing there is you
might<00:03:56.560> think<00:03:57.040> about<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:58.050> still<00:03:59.050> even<00:03:59.380> though

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
might think about and still even though

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.160 
might think about and still even though
it's<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.709> little<00:03:59.800> bit<00:03:59.920> bulky<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.870> still<00:04:01.870> feels

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
it's a little bit bulky it still feels

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.650 
it's a little bit bulky it still feels
not<00:04:02.800> super<00:04:03.490> to<00:04:03.700> much<00:04:03.940> big<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:06.070> it<00:04:07.060> kind<00:04:07.450> of<00:04:07.480> has

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
not super to much big and it kind of has

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.480 
not super to much big and it kind of has
like<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:08.080> interesting<00:04:08.890> look<00:04:09.070> I<00:04:09.250> think<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:12.040> it

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
like a interesting look I think that it

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.090 
like a interesting look I think that it
goes<00:04:12.670> down<00:04:13.209> over<00:04:13.600> here<00:04:13.990> and<00:04:14.230> then<00:04:14.320> goes<00:04:15.040> down

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
goes down over here and then goes down

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.120 
goes down over here and then goes down
here<00:04:15.670> then<00:04:16.209> also<00:04:16.540> on<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:16.780> sides<00:04:17.100> has<00:04:18.100> a

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
here then also on this sides has a

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.280 
here then also on this sides has a
pretty<00:04:18.430> interesting<00:04:18.489> curve<00:04:19.180> here<00:04:19.480> and<00:04:19.660> also

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
pretty interesting curve here and also

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.320 
pretty interesting curve here and also
that<00:04:20.530> they<00:04:20.650> use<00:04:20.859> two<00:04:21.130> different<00:04:21.280> materials<00:04:21.970> to

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
that they use two different materials to

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.450 
that they use two different materials to
make<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.080> front<00:04:23.290> side<00:04:23.590> look<00:04:23.980> a<00:04:24.010> little<00:04:24.280> bit

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
make the front side look a little bit

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.530 
make the front side look a little bit
