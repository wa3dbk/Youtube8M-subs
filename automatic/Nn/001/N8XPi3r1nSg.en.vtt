to<00:02:18.459> weed<00:02:18.640> now<00:02:18.880> cut<00:02:19.570> off<00:02:19.690> one<00:02:19.959> logo<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.620> make<00:02:20.920> a

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
to weed now cut off one logo to make a

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.560 
to weed now cut off one logo to make a
little<00:02:21.220> easier<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.880> know<00:02:22.000> on<00:02:22.150> us<00:02:22.300> for<00:02:22.480> this

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
little easier you know on us for this

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.380 
little easier you know on us for this
demonstration<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:24.100> could<00:02:24.430> mask<00:02:25.090> that

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
demonstration but you could mask that

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.380 
demonstration but you could mask that
whole<00:02:25.570> print<00:02:25.959> job<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.620> we<00:02:26.739> did<00:02:29.970> ok<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.090> just

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
whole print job that we did ok so just

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.000 
whole print job that we did ok so just
started<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.810> corner<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.410> we<00:02:32.530> did<00:02:32.680> just<00:02:32.709> like

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
started a corner in so we did just like

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.060 
started a corner in so we did just like
any<00:02:33.220> other<00:02:33.310> vinyl<00:02:36.269> very<00:02:37.269> simple<00:02:37.660> one<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.950> now

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
any other vinyl very simple one and now

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.620 
any other vinyl very simple one and now
you'll<00:02:39.220> notice<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.519> this<00:02:40.150> transfer<00:02:40.600> is

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
you'll notice that this transfer is

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.300 
you'll notice that this transfer is
printed<00:02:40.989> in<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.140> positive<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.769> that's

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
printed in the positive and that's

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.280 
printed in the positive and that's
because<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:43.239> next<00:02:43.480> step<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.930> use<00:02:44.260> a

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
because the next step is to use a

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.229 
because the next step is to use a
transfer<00:02:44.739> mask<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.190> remove<00:02:45.489> that<00:02:45.519> from<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
transfer mask to remove that from the

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.800 
transfer mask to remove that from the
carrier<00:02:46.600> sheet<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:48.400> we<00:02:48.610> have<00:02:48.819> a<00:02:49.300> piece<00:02:49.780> of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
carrier sheet so we have a piece of

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.780 
carrier sheet so we have a piece of
transfer<00:02:50.260> mask<00:02:50.470> basically<00:02:51.070> all<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.400> transfer

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
transfer mask basically all the transfer

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.300 
transfer mask basically all the transfer
mask<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.299> it's<00:02:53.140> basically<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.500> polyester<00:02:53.950> type

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
mask is it's basically a polyester type

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.520 
mask is it's basically a polyester type
material<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.940> has<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.090> sticky<00:02:55.540> back<00:02:55.720> it's

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
material that has a sticky back it's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.280 
material that has a sticky back it's
just<00:02:56.860> used<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:57.850> over<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.239> top<00:02:58.510> I'm<00:02:59.079> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
just used but over the top I'm the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.000 
just used but over the top I'm the
design<00:02:59.650> to<00:03:00.400> pull<00:03:00.670> it<00:03:00.760> off<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.010> sometimes

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
design to pull it off so that sometimes

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.740 
design to pull it off so that sometimes
if<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.340> know<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.549> have<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.060> heat<00:03:04.480> applied

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
if you know you have a heat applied

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.560 
if you know you have a heat applied
graphic<00:03:05.170> like<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.489> try<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.700> not<00:03:07.329> use

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
graphic like this and you try to not use

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.970 
graphic like this and you try to not use
the<00:03:07.750> mask<00:03:07.930> what<00:03:08.170> will<00:03:08.260> happen<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.650> as<00:03:08.799> it'll

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
the mask what will happen it as it'll

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.680 
the mask what will happen it as it'll
curl<00:03:09.190> up<00:03:09.340> under<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.670> heat<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.570> know

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
curl up under the heat and you know

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.930 
curl up under the heat and you know
basically<00:03:10.900> make<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.560> next<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.190> impossible<00:03:12.220> to

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
basically make it next to impossible to

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.020 
basically make it next to impossible to
heat<00:03:13.120> apply<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.739> also<00:03:14.890> if<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.280> had<00:03:15.459> any<00:03:15.640> text

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
heat apply and also if you had any text

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.390 
heat apply and also if you had any text
you<00:03:16.239> know<00:03:16.750> with<00:03:16.989> this<00:03:17.290> design<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:18.190> know<00:03:18.250> it's

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
you know with this design you know it's

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.979 
you know with this design you know it's
going<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.549> keep<00:03:18.760> all<00:03:18.940> that<00:03:19.090> registration<00:03:19.630> you

here you know anything of that nature

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.660 
here you know anything of that nature
that<00:03:23.410> wasn't<00:03:23.709> connected<00:03:24.100> with<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.430> logo

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
you'll notice this could be a very tough

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.980 
you'll notice this could be a very tough
garment<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.060> decorate<00:04:03.420> because<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.870> these

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
garment to decorate because of these

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.560 
garment to decorate because of these
buttons<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.740> this<00:04:05.250> scene<00:04:05.550> going<00:04:06.090> down<00:04:06.360> for

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
buttons and this scene going down for

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.390 
buttons and this scene going down for
the<00:04:06.690> sleeve<00:04:06.990> so<00:04:07.680> what<00:04:07.860> we're<00:04:07.980> going<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.190> use

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
the sleeve so what we're going to use

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.070 
the sleeve so what we're going to use
today<00:04:08.730> it's<00:04:09.000> called<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.240> print<00:04:09.510> perfect<00:04:09.900> pad

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
today it's called a print perfect pad

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.800 
today it's called a print perfect pad
and<00:04:10.620> what<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.430> print<00:04:11.730> perfect<00:04:12.150> pad<00:04:12.300> does<00:04:12.570> is

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
and what this print perfect pad does is

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.350 
and what this print perfect pad does is
raise<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.830> pressing<00:04:14.250> area<00:04:14.580> so<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.090> those

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
raise the pressing area so that those

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.270 
raise the pressing area so that those
buttons<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:15.990> seams<00:04:16.260> will<00:04:16.470> fall<00:04:16.680> below<00:04:16.890> it<00:04:17.190> and

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
buttons and seams will fall below it and

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.130 
buttons and seams will fall below it and
this<00:04:17.820> will<00:04:18.060> allow<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.450> get<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.600> nice<00:04:18.870> even

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
this will allow you to get a nice even

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.560 
this will allow you to get a nice even

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
pressure on your heat press to ensure a

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.200 
pressure on your heat press to ensure a
proper<00:04:21.810> heat<00:04:22.170> application<00:04:22.700> so<00:04:23.700> what<00:04:23.910> we'll<00:04:24.030> do

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
proper heat application so what we'll do

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.910 
proper heat application so what we'll do
is<00:04:24.240> we'll<00:04:24.480> go<00:04:24.630> ahead<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:24.960> put<00:04:25.140> this<00:04:25.290> inside<00:04:25.860> of

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
is we'll go ahead and put this inside of

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.520 
is we'll go ahead and put this inside of
the<00:04:26.160> jacket<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:27.120> know<00:04:27.300> who<00:04:27.960> are<00:04:28.050> pressing

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
the jacket you know who are pressing

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.719 
the jacket you know who are pressing
area<00:04:30.650> position<00:04:31.650> it

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.049 

and<00:04:36.270> which<00:04:36.599> have<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.169> there<00:04:37.379> you<00:04:37.770> can<00:04:37.919> see

00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:38.059 
and which have that there you can see

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:40.489 
and which have that there you can see
this<00:04:39.059> crease<00:04:39.509> and<00:04:39.719> the<00:04:39.990> buttons<00:04:40.259> are<00:04:40.319> going<00:04:40.439> to

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:40.499 
this crease and the buttons are going to

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:42.709 
this crease and the buttons are going to
fall<00:04:40.710> below<00:04:40.889> it<00:04:41.219> and<00:04:41.309> as<00:04:41.939> well<00:04:42.180> as<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.449> seems

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:42.719 
fall below it and as well as that seems

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.149 
fall below it and as well as that seems
so<00:04:42.930> we're<00:04:43.050> going<00:04:43.199> to<00:04:43.259> get<00:04:43.349> a<00:04:43.409> nice<00:04:43.650> flat

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
so we're going to get a nice flat

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.119 
so we're going to get a nice flat
surface<00:04:44.669> to<00:04:44.909> press<00:04:45.210> on<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.960> anytime<00:04:46.710> you're

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
surface to press on and anytime you're

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:48.769 
surface to press on and anytime you're
using<00:04:47.159> this<00:04:47.639> print<00:04:47.939> perfect<00:04:48.300> pad<00:04:48.449> you<00:04:48.599> always

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:48.779 
using this print perfect pad you always

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:50.209 
using this print perfect pad you always
want<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:48.990> be<00:04:49.110> sure<00:04:49.319> to<00:04:49.589> test<00:04:49.770> your<00:04:49.949> pressure

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:50.219 
want to be sure to test your pressure

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.040 
want to be sure to test your pressure
because<00:04:50.639> it<00:04:50.759> is<00:04:50.879> going<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.270> get<00:04:51.419> much<00:04:51.629> heavier

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
because it is going to get much heavier

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.320 
because it is going to get much heavier
than<00:04:52.259> what<00:04:52.409> it<00:04:52.559> was<00:04:52.589> set<00:04:52.949> at<00:04:53.069> originally<00:04:53.580> so

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
than what it was set at originally so

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.179 
than what it was set at originally so
we'll<00:04:54.479> go<00:04:54.599> ahead<00:04:54.719> and<00:04:54.839> loosen<00:04:55.169> that<00:04:57.949> and<00:04:58.949> the

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
we'll go ahead and loosen that and the

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.100 
we'll go ahead and loosen that and the
color<00:04:59.370> print<00:04:59.639> +<00:04:59.789> it<00:05:00.449> applies<00:05:00.809> at<00:05:01.050> a

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
color print + it applies at a

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.909 
color print + it applies at a
temperature<00:05:01.379> of<00:05:02.569> 334<00:05:03.569> 10<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:03.990> 15<00:05:04.349> seconds<00:05:04.740> with

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
temperature of 334 10 to 15 seconds with

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.260 
temperature of 334 10 to 15 seconds with
a<00:05:04.949> very<00:05:05.129> light<00:05:05.309> prep<00:05:05.639> with<00:05:05.789> a<00:05:05.819> light<00:05:06.029> pressure

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
a very light prep with a light pressure

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.439 
a very light prep with a light pressure
so<00:05:06.870> we'll<00:05:07.050> do<00:05:07.169> it<00:05:07.289> about<00:05:07.469> a<00:05:07.499> three<00:05:07.830> or<00:05:08.129> a<00:05:09.120> full

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
so we'll do it about a three or a full

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.869 
so we'll do it about a three or a full
and<00:05:09.809> do<00:05:09.960> just<00:05:10.169> fine<00:05:10.409> and<00:05:11.309> we'll<00:05:11.610> do<00:05:11.699> a<00:05:11.759> quick

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:11.879 
and do just fine and we'll do a quick

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:13.939 
and do just fine and we'll do a quick
pre-press<00:05:12.449> to<00:05:12.749> get<00:05:12.870> any<00:05:13.050> moisture<00:05:13.469> wrinkles

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
pre-press to get any moisture wrinkles

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.820 
pre-press to get any moisture wrinkles
out<00:05:14.099> of<00:05:14.279> that<00:05:14.399> garment<00:05:14.669> and<00:05:15.379> I<00:05:16.379> will<00:05:16.529> be<00:05:16.649> ready

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
out of that garment and I will be ready

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.029 
out of that garment and I will be ready
to<00:05:16.949> go<00:05:17.270> so<00:05:18.270> go<00:05:18.539> ahead<00:05:18.629> and<00:05:18.749> place<00:05:19.289> our<00:05:19.499> design

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
to go so go ahead and place our design

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.480 
to go so go ahead and place our design
right<00:05:21.029> over<00:05:21.330> our<00:05:21.360> print<00:05:21.719> perfect<00:05:22.110> pad

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.920 

we're<00:05:26.490> get<00:05:26.610> an<00:05:26.700> ice<00:05:26.850> flat<00:05:27.330> pressing<00:05:27.750> surface

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
we're get an ice flat pressing surface

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.790 
we're get an ice flat pressing surface
and<00:05:28.640> lock<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:29.790> down<00:05:29.940> for<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.540> 330<00:05:31.020> for<00:05:31.470> 15

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
and lock it down for the 330 for 15

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:40.280 
and lock it down for the 330 for 15
seconds<00:05:38.090> and<00:05:39.090> that<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.390> application<00:05:39.750> time<00:05:40.080> is

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
seconds and that the application time is

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.830 
seconds and that the application time is
done<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:41.400> color<00:05:41.610> print<00:05:41.850> +<00:05:42.030> is<00:05:42.270> a<00:05:42.300> cold<00:05:42.630> peel

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
done the color print + is a cold peel

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.600 
done the color print + is a cold peel
product<00:05:43.290> so<00:05:43.530> we'll<00:05:43.650> go<00:05:43.770> ahead<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:44.010> remove<00:05:44.160> our

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
product so we'll go ahead and remove our

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.540 
product so we'll go ahead and remove our
jacket<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.200> set<00:05:46.200> it<00:05:46.290> aside<00:05:46.410> so<00:05:46.950> it<00:05:47.160> can<00:05:47.370> cool

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
jacket and set it aside so it can cool

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.330 
jacket and set it aside so it can cool
faster<00:05:48.590> and<00:05:49.590> now<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:49.920> our<00:05:50.010> design<00:05:50.310> is

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
faster and now that our design is

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.520 
faster and now that our design is
completely<00:05:50.970> cooled<00:05:51.240> now<00:05:51.810> we<00:05:51.870> can<00:05:52.050> remove<00:05:52.230> the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
completely cooled now we can remove the

00:05:52.530 --> 00:06:08.129 
completely cooled now we can remove the
mylar<00:05:54.290> to<00:05:55.290> complete<00:05:55.770> our<00:05:55.920> design

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.230 

so<00:06:08.770> there<00:06:08.919> you<00:06:08.949> have<00:06:09.039> it<00:06:09.189> a<00:06:09.490> full-color

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
so there you have it a full-color

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.939 
so there you have it a full-color
decoration<00:06:10.930> applied<00:06:11.499> to<00:06:11.650> one<00:06:11.800> of<00:06:11.889> the
