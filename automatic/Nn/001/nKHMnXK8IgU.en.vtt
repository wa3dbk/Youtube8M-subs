the lightest and thinnest laptop tablet

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.440 
the lightest and thinnest laptop tablet
on<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:32.750> market<00:00:32.840> right<00:00:33.350> now<00:00:34.239> it's<00:00:35.239> running

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
on the market right now it's running

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.830 
on the market right now it's running
about<00:00:35.719> a<00:00:35.780> 7<00:00:36.170> inch<00:00:36.260> screen<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:37.570> it's<00:00:38.570> running

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
about a 7 inch screen and it's running

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.320 
about a 7 inch screen and it's running
as<00:00:39.230> an<00:00:39.410> operating<00:00:39.740> system<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:40.340> Android<00:00:40.760> 4.1

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
as an operating system the Android 4.1

as an operating system the Android 4.1
jelly<00:00:41.720> bean<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:42.380> should<00:00:42.590> be<00:00:42.620> super<00:00:43.130> fast

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
jelly bean so it should be super fast

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.960 
jelly bean so it should be super fast
again<00:00:46.160> that<00:00:46.340> screen<00:00:46.670> is<00:00:46.850> about<00:00:47.060> seven<00:00:47.570> inches

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
again that screen is about seven inches

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.900 
again that screen is about seven inches
it's<00:00:49.970> had<00:00:51.070> 1280<00:00:52.070> x<00:00:52.370> 800<00:00:52.640> pixels<00:00:53.860> that's<00:00:54.910> 216

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
it's had 1280 x 800 pixels that's 216

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.630 
it's had 1280 x 800 pixels that's 216
six<00:00:56.329> less<00:00:56.480> four<00:00:56.510> inch<00:00:57.010> so<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.130> resolution

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
six less four inch so the resolution

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.539 
six less four inch so the resolution
should<00:00:58.790> be<00:00:58.910> super<00:00:59.510> nice<00:01:03.220> there's<00:01:04.220> two

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
should be super nice there's two

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.300 
should be super nice there's two

gig<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:07.939> a<00:01:08.030> 16<00:01:08.479> we<00:01:08.630> opted<00:01:08.930> for<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.200> 16<00:01:09.969> and

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
gig and a 16 we opted for the 16 and

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.370 
gig and a 16 we opted for the 16 and
we'll<00:01:12.200> go<00:01:12.319> ahead<00:01:12.409> and<00:01:13.479> turn<00:01:14.479> it<00:01:14.719> on<00:01:14.869> I

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.550 

mentioned<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.469> it<00:01:18.619> was<00:01:18.740> super<00:01:19.100> fast<00:01:20.560> there

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
mentioned that it was super fast there

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.989 
mentioned that it was super fast there
we<00:01:21.770> go<00:01:22.959> it's<00:01:23.959> running<00:01:24.200> one<00:01:24.469> gigabytes<00:01:25.039> of<00:01:25.310> RAM

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
we go it's running one gigabytes of RAM

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:29.980 
we go it's running one gigabytes of RAM
and<00:01:26.270> it's<00:01:27.130> sitting<00:01:28.130> at<00:01:28.310> a<00:01:28.340> 1.3<00:01:29.030> quad-core

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
and it's sitting at a 1.3 quad-core

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.050 
and it's sitting at a 1.3 quad-core
processor<00:01:30.679> so<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.069> should<00:01:31.249> be<00:01:31.280> fast<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:34.060> couple

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
processor so it should be fast a couple

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.969 
processor so it should be fast a couple
of<00:01:35.179> negatives<00:01:35.659> about<00:01:35.779> this<00:01:36.109> is<00:01:36.319> no<00:01:36.560> expansion

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
of negatives about this is no expansion

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.989 
of negatives about this is no expansion
storage<00:01:37.990> no<00:01:38.990> USB<00:01:39.409> port<00:01:40.009> so<00:01:40.069> you<00:01:40.249> can't<00:01:40.579> throw

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
storage no USB port so you can't throw

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:44.499 
storage no USB port so you can't throw
in<00:01:41.149> a<00:01:41.240> memory<00:01:41.509> stick<00:01:41.569> on<00:01:41.929> this<00:01:42.079> one<00:01:42.289> and<00:01:43.509> it's

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
in a memory stick on this one and it's

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.160 
in a memory stick on this one and it's
not<00:01:45.380> set<00:01:45.590> up<00:01:45.679> for<00:01:45.709> 4G<00:01:46.840> but<00:01:47.840> we<00:01:47.929> do<00:01:48.020> have

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
not set up for 4G but we do have

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.569 
not set up for 4G but we do have
wireless<00:01:48.409> in<00:01:48.709> the<00:01:48.770> house<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.219> just<00:01:49.340> about

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
wireless in the house and just about

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.089 
wireless in the house and just about
anywhere<00:01:49.909> that<00:01:50.119> we<00:01:50.179> go<00:01:50.359> has<00:01:51.349> wireless<00:01:51.920> so

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
anywhere that we go has wireless so

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.480 
anywhere that we go has wireless so
let's<00:01:52.340> go<00:01:52.609> ahead<00:01:52.639> and<00:01:52.939> play<00:01:53.840> around<00:01:53.990> with<00:01:54.259> this

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
let's go ahead and play around with this

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.849 
let's go ahead and play around with this
and<00:01:56.770> I'll<00:01:57.770> give<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.009> review<00:01:58.219> afterwards
