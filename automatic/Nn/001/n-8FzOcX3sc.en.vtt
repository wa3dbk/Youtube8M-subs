00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the gaming range that MSI do they've got

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.459 
the gaming range that MSI do they've got
a<00:00:35.820> wide<00:00:36.420> range<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.809> motherboards<00:00:37.290> for

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
a wide range of motherboards for

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
a wide range of motherboards for
different<00:00:37.710> sockets<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> latest

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and black and one thing you may not be

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
and black and one thing you may not be
able<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.189> now<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.119> kill<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.540> up

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
able to see now but if I kill this up

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.830 
able to see now but if I kill this up
you<00:01:22.710> should<00:01:22.920> see<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:24.060> heat<00:01:24.509> sinks

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
you should see is the heat sinks

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.940 
you should see is the heat sinks
actually<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.890> dragon<00:01:26.280> design<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.970> they<00:01:27.720> look

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
actually the dragon design and they look

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.640 
actually the dragon design and they look
nice<00:01:29.270> also<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> bottom<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.350> we've<00:01:31.470> got

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
nice also on the bottom here we've got

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.370 
nice also on the bottom here we've got
the<00:01:32.180> chipset<00:01:33.180> heatsink<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> dragon

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the chipset heatsink is the dragon

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.080 
the chipset heatsink is the dragon
design<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.710> well<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.100> little<00:01:35.610> MSI<00:01:35.909> logo

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
design as well with this little MSI logo

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.480 
design as well with this little MSI logo
actually<00:01:36.420> glows<00:01:36.659> up<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.079> well<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:38.369> is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
actually glows up as well and there is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.789 
actually glows up as well and there is
some<00:01:38.700> red<00:01:38.970> glow<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.110> goes<00:01:40.259> down<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> board

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
some red glow that goes down the board

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.590 
some red glow that goes down the board
as<00:01:40.920> well<00:01:41.070> where<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> audio<00:01:41.820> boosters<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.420> well

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
as well where the audio boosters as well

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.929 
as well where the audio boosters as well
so<00:01:43.470> let's<00:01:43.649> take<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.890> around<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.490> features<00:01:44.820> on

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
so let's take you around the features on

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.670 
so let's take you around the features on
this<00:01:45.030> board<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.329> yeah<00:01:45.540> core<00:01:45.990> support<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.409> 32

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
this board so yeah core support for 32

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.300 
this board so yeah core support for 32
gigabytes<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> RAM<00:01:48.170> as<00:01:49.170> I've<00:01:49.500> said<00:01:49.979> already

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
gigabytes of RAM as I've said already

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.719 
gigabytes of RAM as I've said already
we've<00:01:50.490> got<00:01:50.610> Forte's<00:01:51.140> CPU<00:01:52.140> fan<00:01:52.649> socket<00:01:53.340> points

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
we've got Forte's CPU fan socket points

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.450 
we've got Forte's CPU fan socket points
so<00:01:54.479> there's<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> one-leg<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.979> fans<00:01:56.250> one

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
so there's a one-leg but for fans one

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.859 
so there's a one-leg but for fans one
there

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
there

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.899 
there
-<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.229> there's<00:01:58.409> CPU<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.009> two<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.430> then

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
- so there's CPU one and two and then

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.950 
- so there's CPU one and two and then
there's<00:02:00.090> two<00:02:00.299> down<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> bottom<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:00.930> well

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
there's two down the bottom as well

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.280 
there's two down the bottom as well
system<00:02:01.469> found<00:02:01.710> -<00:02:02.210> assistant<00:02:03.210> found<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:03.780> as

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
system found - assistant found one as

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.480 
system found - assistant found one as
well

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
well

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.930 
well
we've<00:02:06.790> got<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.090> PCI<00:02:07.510> x16<00:02:08.470> slots<00:02:09.070> or<00:02:09.550> if<00:02:09.820> you're
