00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.180
 to the guys and very good lately 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.970
 several people who are asking me 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.950
 about to see if I can make some videos 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.720
 about the creation of web pages or blogs 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.820
 Well the truth is that I have been 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.680
 also thinking about this but be 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.510
 thinking and what is he thinking 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.670
 Well, I've been thinking about how to do 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.010
 things better I can tell you everything 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.950
 but if I can give you the best 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.690
 information from the beginning as this 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.870
 it's going to make things a lot easier 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.150
 then I have reached the point where 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.520
 I already have enough idea and I have enough 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.470
 things to tell you because I had 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.240
 done things my way but also 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.120
 I had to explore other ways 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.239
 to be able to give you a variety of information 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.310
 and several options on how to create your 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.050
 blog or website but first of all 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.479
 let's see what a block is and what 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.330
 is a web page what are they used for? 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.790
 anyone creates a web page any 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.770
 company anyone and what is it 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.360
 what happens many times they do not know how 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.700
 use it so the only thing 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.990
 they get is to pay an annual fee 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.570
 existence by the accommodation by the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.810
 domain of this web page and nobody enters 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.840
 or if it does not get customers, it does not 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.530
 they get interaction anybody can 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.130
 create a blog and write and realize 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.170
 that does not get any visit or 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.600
 no good comment from time to time 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.540
 for some profile or there, it has been 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.620
 stuck and have read some input but 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:57.100
 anything let's say significant good I 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.470
 until now I had done my blogs and websites 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.150
 every time in a different way to 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.880
 can provide or if this information 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.960
 so let's say detailed and at the same time varied 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.509
 then let's talk in the 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.269
 following videos about 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.099
 in different ways to create the page 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.780
 web and different ways to create the 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.519
 blog but in this video we are going to talk 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.989
 about what is the web what is the blog 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:26.630
 well the website is the site that we 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.260
 represents let's say 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.870
 a greeting a place where a person 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.160
 can enter and find information 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.470
 about what we are doing 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.810
 information let's say a little more in 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.160
 business plan while the block is 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.980
 something totally different is what 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.190
 contrary although it contains information 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.740
 of the same type that the website is something 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.810
 much more personal something that pretends 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.850
 show the same information but from 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.700
 more personal way in order to 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.660
 hook some potential customers or a 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.460
 auditorium that can serve us for 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.980
 help us grow 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.460
 to develop this website or this 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.800
 website then they are working from a 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.560
 way quite different but always 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.570
 they are always related when 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.020
 we want of course but logically 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.680
 they have to be related 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.680
 well we are photographers and for a 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.870
 photographer the web is important for 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.210
 present your work to present 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.490
 your work in such a professional manner 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.220
 way that anyone who goes outside in 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.840
 less than five minutes to be very clear 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.940
 what is this doing? 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.990
 photographer what kind of jobs do you 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.220
 dedicate how much he charges because he charges so much 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.920
 what are your strengths 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.160
 in less than five minutes plus five 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.440
 minutes are a lot 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.210
 our blog is something different our 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.100
 block is the place where people 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.280
 more curious can find more 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.930
 details about our website or about 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.090
 work that we have presented in our 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.150
 web more details about us as 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.490
 people and about our style of 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.260
 work on our workflow and 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.540
 about topics that may interest them 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.550
 topics that maybe are too much 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.090
 detailed detailed how to put them 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.549
 on a website then since we have 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.720
 more or less clear the difference between a 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:27.230
 website and one for a blog we are going to 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.910
 think about how to build them in the 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.460
 following videos we will see different 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.280
 Ways to build a web page 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.910
 different companies that provide us 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.940
 different options to do it in 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.370
 some is easier in others is more 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.610
 profitable and in third parties is more 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.629
 beneficial from the point of view of 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.689
 settings bus I want what is search 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:57.050
 engine optimization or optimization 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:58.580
 search engines so that others 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.620
 other people can find us 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.199
 easily others are cheaper going 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.740
 it will cost us much less to maintain a 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.009
 web site 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.460
 with some with some certain companies and 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:15.449
 others are very easy to create our 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.000
 website in such a way that with very few 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.800
 clicks we can apply a template or 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.349
 create our own template without 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.660
 no type of knowledge of html 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.000
 programming or any kind of things 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.400
 easier than writing a document in 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.470
 word 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.809
 then we will see the different 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:36.849
 ways to create websites 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:39.580
 using the different options that 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:42.680
 we have then we will talk about blogs 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.220
 we will talk about blogs 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.229
 of bloggers that are from google we will talk 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.530
 about the pros and cons of blogs 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.789
 google or blogger we will talk about the 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.600
 creation of these blogs also 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:58.669
 we will talk about the creation of blogs 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.199
 using the wordpress platform and 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:05.280
 we will also talk about 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:07.260
 other totally different platforms 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.230
 that can also be beneficial to 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.810
 certain ways then these topics are 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.580
 very deep for that reason I do not want 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.250
 put everything in a video because you have to 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.139
 be equal three hours long so 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.660
 less we will also talk about seo 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.540
 search engine optimization for 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.770
 that people can find them 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.810
 we will also talk about how to share 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.150
 our tickets how to share our 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.810
 web and how to get the attention of one of 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.280
 a more effective way not simply 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.139
 present ourselves as professionals but 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.720
 present ourselves in such a way that people 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:43.280
 you feel identified with what is 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.720
 watching and call them attention so that 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.480
 they feel more hooked and more 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.010
 interested in what we are doing 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.390
 that is not achieved with some forms 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:55.680
 traditional marketing or advertising 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.750
 like the one we're used to seeing 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.880
 on TV on the radio or on the 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.130
 newspapers online marketing is something 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.860
 very different and very linked to the themes 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.310
 from blogs 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.530
 and the websites and also the photography of 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.569
 we're going to talk about that too but in this 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.550
 video I just wanted to qualify a 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:15.650
 little bit what is the difference between 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.900
 Blogs and websites in the following 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.810
 videos I'm going to focus more on the 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.909
 creation of each of these 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.710
 platforms and how to take advantage of them 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:27.319
 then we'll see you in the next video 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.139
 guys think about what you want to express 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:32.000
 with your website or with your blog and 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:34.069
 from the next video and from the 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.439
 next video let's go moving 

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:39.069
 on this topic until next time 

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:39.069
 bye
