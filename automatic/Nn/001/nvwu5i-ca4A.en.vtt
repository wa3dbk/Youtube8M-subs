every day but that's just a whole nother
subject<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.820> last<00:02:53.000> thing<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.330> violet<00:02:53.690> box

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
subject the last thing the violet box

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.380 
subject the last thing the violet box
was<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.350> triple<00:02:54.650> shine<00:02:54.830> Sally<00:02:55.310> Hansen<00:02:55.940> now<00:02:56.360> I

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
was this triple shine Sally Hansen now I

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.030 
was this triple shine Sally Hansen now I
think<00:02:56.990> that<00:02:57.140> sally<00:02:57.380> hansen<00:02:57.650> has<00:02:57.740> a<00:02:57.800> really

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
think that sally hansen has a really

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.890 
think that sally hansen has a really
decent<00:02:58.280> formula<00:02:58.820> for<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.090> price<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.870> price

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
decent formula for the price the price

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.830 
decent formula for the price the price
on<00:03:00.200> this<00:03:00.350> is<00:03:00.590> around<00:03:01.040> 4<00:03:01.610> 99<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.360> believe<00:03:02.720> it

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
on this is around 4 99 I believe it

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.440 
on this is around 4 99 I believe it
targets<00:03:03.200> even<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.530> little<00:03:03.620> bit<00:03:03.740> less<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:05.210> color

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
targets even a little bit less the color

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.720 
targets even a little bit less the color
I<00:03:05.720> don't<00:03:05.930> really<00:03:06.080> wear<00:03:06.380> red<00:03:06.650> all<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.070> much<00:03:07.250> so

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
I don't really wear red all that much so

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.370 
I don't really wear red all that much so
the<00:03:07.820> color<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.090> was<00:03:08.240> kind<00:03:08.390> of<00:03:08.420> like<00:03:08.510> I'd<00:03:09.230> word

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
the color I was kind of like I'd word

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.260 
the color I was kind of like I'd word
around<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.680> holidays<00:03:10.040> but<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.880> brush<00:03:11.120> I

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
around the holidays but the brush I

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.120 
around the holidays but the brush I
really<00:03:11.510> like<00:03:11.690> on<00:03:11.870> these<00:03:12.050> I<00:03:12.290> may<00:03:12.470> actually<00:03:12.680> look

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
really like on these I may actually look

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.190 
really like on these I may actually look
and<00:03:13.310> try<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.550> get<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.730> different<00:03:13.970> color<00:03:14.270> in<00:03:14.690> the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
and try to get a different color in the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.810 
and try to get a different color in the
same<00:03:15.470> formula<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.130> like<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.580> brush<00:03:16.790> is

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
same formula I like that the brush is

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.510 
same formula I like that the brush is
flat<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.360> wide<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:18.470> honestly<00:03:18.620> reminds<00:03:19.220> me<00:03:19.370> of

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
flat and wide it honestly reminds me of

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.690 
flat and wide it honestly reminds me of
the<00:03:19.670> brush<00:03:19.940> that's<00:03:20.150> on<00:03:20.420> do<00:03:21.200> your<00:03:21.350> polishes<00:03:22.040> so

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
the brush that's on do your polishes so

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.820 
the brush that's on do your polishes so
that's<00:03:22.940> pretty<00:03:23.150> cool<00:03:23.240> and<00:03:23.690> they<00:03:24.500> do<00:03:24.800> have

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
that's pretty cool and they do have

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.350 
that's pretty cool and they do have
pretty<00:03:25.190> good<00:03:25.340> formula<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:25.970> I'm<00:03:26.060> going<00:03:26.210> to<00:03:26.240> try

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
pretty good formula so I'm going to try

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.490 
pretty good formula so I'm going to try
the<00:03:26.450> doubt<00:03:26.660> i'll<00:03:26.780> post<00:03:26.990> pictures<00:03:27.230> on

collars you have these are very

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.120 
collars you have these are very
satisfying<00:06:26.360> like<00:06:26.720> just<00:06:26.930> to<00:06:26.990> eat<00:06:27.169> one<00:06:27.530> or<00:06:27.800> two

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
I actually prefer the texture of the

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.710 
I actually prefer the texture of the
filling<00:06:33.670> in<00:06:33.760> these<00:06:33.880> it's<00:06:34.120> like<00:06:34.210> a<00:06:34.240> smooth

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
filling in these it's like a smooth

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.140 
filling in these it's like a smooth
creamy<00:06:35.200> peanut<00:06:35.440> butter<00:06:35.710> as<00:06:36.580> opposed<00:06:36.940> to<00:06:37.030> like

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
creamy peanut butter as opposed to like

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.000 
creamy peanut butter as opposed to like
a<00:06:37.240> Reese's<00:06:37.630> bar<00:06:37.930> or<00:06:38.320> like<00:06:38.590> you<00:06:38.800> know<00:06:38.860> the

pretty<00:06:41.410> good<00:06:41.530> but<00:06:41.980> i<00:06:42.280> think<00:06:42.640> the<00:06:42.760> peanut

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
pretty good but i think the peanut

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.330 
pretty good but i think the peanut
butter<00:06:43.090> and<00:06:43.390> this<00:06:43.570> is<00:06:43.780> a<00:06:43.840> lot<00:06:44.110> better<00:06:44.290> so<00:06:44.860> um

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
butter and this is a lot better so um

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.370 
butter and this is a lot better so um
