00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.490
 Welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:11.199
 movical.net today as you see on the screen 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.240
 We have the new Nokia C5 03 currently 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.459
 blocked with vodafone that we're going to 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.949
 free by code thanks to the web 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.820
 movical.net simply turn on the 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.789
 terminal 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.520
 and now as you can see we are on the screen 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.650
 initial we can turn it on without any 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.119
 card then we proceed to mark the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.700
 code purchased on the web that is made 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.950
 without any card put we are going to 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.360
 phone we get the dial and we mark the 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.990
 pillow code 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.990
 w 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.070
 once marked this we have to mark 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.870
 the 15 digits of the release code 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.010
 bought on our website that is 31 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.010
 0 17 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.570
 68 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.870
 5 6 7 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.870
 74 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.500
 781 say that this code is unique and 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.930
 exclusive for each model is to say this 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.180
 code does not work for other terminals 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.040
 so do not try to release it because 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.900
 they only have three attempts and each code 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.700
 It is unique and exclusive when we mark 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.530
 all the code we perform well and 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.880
 marc before and before dialing the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.340
 last pad because we only have 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.380
 three opportunities then once 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.360
 revised well we mark the last 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.370
 pad and as you see the terminal 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.330
 indicates restriction of cards without 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.030
 deactivated and it will restart 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.470
 Once the terminal has been restarted, it will be 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.810
 operative to be with any 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.250
 card any operator is to say 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.320
 it is very important that all 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.810
 Current terminals have data network 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.010
 then once released what we have 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.320
 what to do is simply configure with 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.660
 our new operator the settings for 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.090
 for this we must call the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.840
 new operator and will provide us with how 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.840
 do what
