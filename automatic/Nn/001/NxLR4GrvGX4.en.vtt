00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.460 
the icon that we can scroll through all
of<00:01:26.580> our<00:01:27.030> notifications<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> also<00:01:28.140> notice

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that there's an X right up there so if

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.080 
that there's an X right up there so if
we<00:01:31.020> had<00:01:31.170> let's<00:01:31.409> say<00:01:31.500> five<00:01:32.070> icons<00:01:32.369> down<00:01:32.850> here

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
we had let's say five icons down here

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.640 
we had let's say five icons down here
and<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.270> wanted<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.659> rid<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.900> all<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
and we wanted to get rid of all the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.260 
and we wanted to get rid of all the
notifications<00:01:34.979> from<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.759> particular

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
notifications from a particular

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.840 
notifications from a particular
application<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.770> case<00:01:37.829> our<00:01:38.280> messages

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
application in this case our messages

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.880 
application in this case our messages
app<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.420> see<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:40.290> pull<00:01:40.500> down<00:01:40.680> on

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
app and you can see if we pull down on

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.429 
app and you can see if we pull down on
the<00:01:41.100> X<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.579> once<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> turns<00:01:42.570> white<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:43.020> let<00:01:43.229> go

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the X and once it turns white we let go

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.830 
the X and once it turns white we let go
then<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> clear<00:01:44.939> all<00:01:45.180> those

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
then it's going to clear all those

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.690 
then it's going to clear all those
notifications<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.340> particular

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
notifications for that particular

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.270 
notifications for that particular
application<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.350> means<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.920> those

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
application so that means that those

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.340 
application so that means that those
other<00:01:50.549> four<00:01:50.880> icons<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.689> still<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> be

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
other four icons are still going to be

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.350 
other four icons are still going to be
right<00:01:52.560> down<00:01:52.710> there<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.280> only<00:01:53.520> clears<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
right down there this only clears the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.780 
right down there this only clears the
notifications<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.920> application<00:01:56.610> so

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
notifications for that application so

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.149 
notifications for that application so
this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.570> basically<00:01:57.930> what<00:01:58.259> priority<00:01:58.740> hub<00:01:58.890> does

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
this is basically what priority hub does

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.889 
this is basically what priority hub does
it's<00:01:59.579> actually<00:01:59.880> pretty<00:02:00.060> cool<00:02:00.329> pretty<00:02:00.600> nifty
