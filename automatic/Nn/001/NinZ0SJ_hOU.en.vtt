 of waste in new inputs that can be 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.070
 serve for companies or for 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.070
 donate or generate new products 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.570
 home sign of entry to a market that 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.630
 it was completely innovative we perceive 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.560
 that there was an increase in awareness of 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.090
 the consumers and we saw there 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.090
 a business opportunity 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.379
 that we manufacture have several 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.719
 competitive advantages like being that not 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.080
 they require maintenance they do not splinter 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.159
 they do not rot are ideal materials for 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.159
 use the internet 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.450
 with respect to the environmental issue in three 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.180
 aspects the decrease of the footprint of 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.910
 carbon the amount of waste that goes 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.370
 to landfill burials 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.780
 and avoids cutting down trees by preventing 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.780
 Trees are cut down in extinction 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.140
 to level 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.789
 and social on the one hand is education and 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.920
 raising awareness of environmental issues 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.130
 and on the other hand in the case of trace 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.409
 green the creation of green jobs and 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.210
 root of this social inclusion 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.700
 we recommend to employers that 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.399
 want to perform a task similar to the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.350
 our is to know very well the 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.609
 market needs to know if there 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.209
 interest in the products that they 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:58.340
 want to market and try one or 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.920
 two projects like this we did 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.140
 try the circuit know the actors 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.609
 know that the project is already successful 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.609
 based on this, founding the company 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.460
 when we initiate the fears that 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.800
 we had fundamentally was not to be 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.410
 understood in society because no 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.330
 there is a very high environmental awareness 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.090
 in our country and second being 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.700
 confused with an organization of the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.950
 civil society and of course the fear of 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.200
 the imitators that we since we have 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.730
 overcome part of those fears in 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.200
 principle strengthened by our 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.540
 experience and the know how 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.500
 Our company is based on action in 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.239
 constantly make new decisions 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.959
 but followed by a concrete action and 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.959
 I think that only 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.780
 we invite entrepreneurs who want 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.760
 develop a task similar to those to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.700
 our take into account a triple 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.710
 impact that is the environmental the social and 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.480
 the economic never forget that a 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.510
 company is a socio-economic actor 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.980
 We invite you to leave a 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.980
 greenest trail on the planet
