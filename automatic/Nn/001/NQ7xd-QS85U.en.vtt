interesting things going on in the world
of<00:00:10.380> photography<00:00:10.730> since<00:00:11.730> I've<00:00:12.000> done<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> video

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
of photography since I've done a video

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.900 
of photography since I've done a video
last<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.410> figured<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.769> was<00:00:13.830> high<00:00:14.009> time<00:00:14.340> to

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
last so I figured it was high time to

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.550 
last so I figured it was high time to
get<00:00:15.059> back<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.540> look<00:00:16.080> at<00:00:16.199> some<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.470> these

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
get back and look at some of these

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.900 
get back and look at some of these
things<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.310> biggest<00:00:17.580> one<00:00:17.699> I've<00:00:17.789> been

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.880 
things the biggest one I've been

thinking about a lot lately is the Canon
70d<00:00:20.400> now<00:00:21.330> for<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> lot<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.020> reasons<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.500> looks

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
70d now for a lot of reasons it looks

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.220 
70d now for a lot of reasons it looks
like<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> 70d<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.850> gonna<00:00:24.060> be<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.539> real

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
like the 70d is gonna be a real

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.890 
like the 70d is gonna be a real
game-changer<00:00:26.269> especially<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> Canon

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the 70 mark - and the introduction of

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.850 
the 70 mark - and the introduction of
the<00:00:35.460> 70d<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> features<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.050> has<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.649> and

the 70d with the features it has and and
the<00:00:38.010> build<00:00:38.190> quality<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.610> whatnot<00:00:38.879> makes<00:00:39.420> us

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the build quality and whatnot makes us

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.900 
the build quality and whatnot makes us
wonder<00:00:39.809> if<00:00:40.140> even<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.649> 70<00:00:41.040> mark<00:00:41.250> -<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.579> gonna<00:00:41.700> be

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.630 
basically what I got here for you is
nine<00:00:45.270> reasons<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.770> might<00:00:46.920> want<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.280> consider

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
nine reasons you might want to consider

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.250 
nine reasons you might want to consider
the<00:00:47.910> 70d<00:00:48.739> over<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.250> Canon<00:00:50.640> 7d<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> know<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the 70d over the Canon 7d now I know the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.869 
the 70d over the Canon 7d now I know the
70<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.860> an<00:00:53.010> older<00:00:53.280> model<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.699> stew<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.230> a

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
70 is an older model and stew for a

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.330 
70 is an older model and stew for a
replenishment<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.969> new<00:00:57.210> new<00:00:57.840> version<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:59.010> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
replenishment a new new version but I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.040 
replenishment a new new version but I
think<00:00:59.820> what<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.030> need<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.270> look<00:01:00.420> at<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:00.989> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
think what we need to look at here is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.900 
think what we need to look at here is
that<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.559> still<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> market<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.460> lot<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
that it's still on the market a lot of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
that it's still on the market a lot of
people<00:01:03.180> still<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> 7d

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
people still really like the 7d

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.190 
people still really like the 7d
yeah<00:01:05.100> when<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.430> look<00:01:05.760> at<00:01:05.909> what<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> 70d<00:01:06.960> has

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
yeah when we look at what the 70d has

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.649 
yeah when we look at what the 70d has
here<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.250> some<00:01:08.460> significant<00:01:09.240> reasons

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
here we have some significant reasons

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.510 
here we have some significant reasons
nine<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.140> them<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.409> I've<00:01:10.530> got<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.460> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
nine of them that I've got here that I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
nine of them that I've got here that I
think<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.030> might<00:01:12.270> want<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:13.080> you're

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
think you might want to if you're

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
think you might want to if you're
looking<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> 70<00:01:14.220> hold<00:01:14.850> off<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
looking at the 70 hold off and get the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.820 
looking at the 70 hold off and get the
70d<00:01:16.320> first<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.250> foremost<00:01:17.700> we've<00:01:18.180> got<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> new

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
70d first and foremost we've got the new

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.730 
70d first and foremost we've got the new
the<00:01:19.830> new<00:01:19.860> sensor<00:01:20.580> 20<00:01:21.210> megapixels<00:01:21.869> versus<00:01:22.229> 18

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the new sensor 20 megapixels versus 18

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.950 
the new sensor 20 megapixels versus 18
not<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> big<00:01:23.759> difference<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> size<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
not a big difference in the size of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
not a big difference in the size of
megapixels<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.490> expecting<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.240> see

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
megapixels but what I'm expecting to see

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.230 
megapixels but what I'm expecting to see
here<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.650> better<00:01:28.979> sensor<00:01:29.549> something<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
here is a better sensor something that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.030 
here is a better sensor something that
performs<00:01:30.689> better<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.259> gives<00:01:31.590> us<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.829> better

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
performs better and gives us a better

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.030 
performs better and gives us a better
cleaner<00:01:32.400> picture<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.540> would<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:34.079> apparently

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
cleaner picture this would be apparently

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.740 
cleaner picture this would be apparently
backed<00:01:35.340> up<00:01:35.610> when<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.880> look<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.180> my<00:01:36.299> second

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
backed up when you look at my second

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.200 
backed up when you look at my second
reason<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.009> ISO<00:01:38.460> range<00:01:38.729> we've

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
reason and that is the ISO range we've

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.590 
reason and that is the ISO range we've
got<00:01:39.420> about<00:01:39.570> another<00:01:39.720> stop<00:01:40.259> now<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.950> 7d<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.000> iso

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
got about another stop now the 7d is iso

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.969 
got about another stop now the 7d is iso
100<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.320> 6400<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.299> 70d<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
100 to 6400 and the 70d is going up to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.690 
100 to 6400 and the 70d is going up to
12,000<00:01:47.820> 800<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.570> its<00:01:48.780> standard<00:01:49.619> range<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.220> ISO

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
12,000 800 as its standard range for ISO

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.520 
12,000 800 as its standard range for ISO
so<00:01:51.180> you're<00:01:51.270> getting<00:01:51.450> about<00:01:51.600> an<00:01:51.720> extra<00:01:52.020> stop<00:01:52.290> on

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so you're getting about an extra stop on

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.660 
so you're getting about an extra stop on
high<00:01:52.649> ISO<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.280> expect<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.079> cleaner<00:01:55.079> image<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:56.009> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
high ISO so expect a cleaner image and I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.050 
high ISO so expect a cleaner image and I
would<00:01:57.000> think<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.420> after<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.590> age<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.549> 7d

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
would think that after the age of the 7d

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.539 
would think that after the age of the 7d
versus<00:02:00.509> hopefully<00:02:01.439> some<00:02:01.649> newer<00:02:01.799> technology

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
versus hopefully some newer technology

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.480 
versus hopefully some newer technology
here<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.240> 70<00:02:03.719> DS<00:02:03.899> new<00:02:04.469> sensor<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.369> we're

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
here in the 70 DS new sensor that we're

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.459 
here in the 70 DS new sensor that we're
going<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> see<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.180> better<00:02:06.390> overall<00:02:06.960> image

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
going to see just a better overall image

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.940 
going to see just a better overall image
as<00:02:07.649> well<00:02:07.979> as<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.879> enhanced<00:02:09.179> ISO<00:02:09.840> number<00:02:10.619> three

as well as the enhanced ISO number three

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.070 
as well as the enhanced ISO number three
is<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.640> one<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.060> biggies<00:02:12.569> here<00:02:12.780> we've<00:02:12.930> got

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
is the one of the biggies here we've got

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.850 
is the one of the biggies here we've got
the<00:02:13.230> new<00:02:13.379> phase

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the new phase

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.900 
the new phase
detection<00:02:14.190> system<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:16.490> 70d<00:02:17.490> that's<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
detection system on the 70d that's the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.020 
detection system on the 70d that's the
dual<00:02:18.180> pixel<00:02:18.510> CMOS<00:02:19.320> AF<00:02:19.650> sensor<00:02:20.490> they've<00:02:20.820> come

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
dual pixel CMOS AF sensor they've come

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.540 
dual pixel CMOS AF sensor they've come
up<00:02:21.060> with<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.200> hopefully<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:23.040> gonna<00:02:23.280> allow

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
up with so this hopefully is gonna allow

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.070 
up with so this hopefully is gonna allow
what<00:02:24.510> may<00:02:24.810> be<00:02:24.870> industry<00:02:25.830> setting<00:02:26.570> AF<00:02:27.570> when

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
what may be industry setting AF when

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.440 
what may be industry setting AF when
we're<00:02:28.230> doing<00:02:28.380> video<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.520> having<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.180> phase

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
we're doing video so having that phase

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.840 
we're doing video so having that phase
detection<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.740> that<00:02:31.920> new<00:02:32.160> sensor<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> way

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
detection and that new sensor the way

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.480 
detection and that new sensor the way
that<00:02:33.030> handles<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.930> could<00:02:34.710> be<00:02:34.860> as<00:02:34.980> good<00:02:35.280> as

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
that handles that it could be as good as

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.520 
that handles that it could be as good as
a<00:02:35.850> good<00:02:36.120> camcorder<00:02:36.900> which<00:02:37.050> we<00:02:37.260> haven't<00:02:37.410> seen

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
a good camcorder which we haven't seen

a good camcorder which we haven't seen
any<00:02:37.890> DSLR<00:02:38.220> do<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.970> yet<00:02:39.210> so<00:02:39.240> this<00:02:39.630> could<00:02:39.840> be

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
any DSLR do that yet so this could be

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.830 
any DSLR do that yet so this could be
right<00:02:41.250> there<00:02:41.520> could<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.880> extremely<00:02:42.420> great

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
right there could be extremely great

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.050 
right there could be extremely great
groundbreaking<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:43.980> everyone<00:02:44.820> else<00:02:44.970> is

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
groundbreaking and everyone else is

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.760 
groundbreaking and everyone else is
gonna<00:02:45.209> have<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.510> catch<00:02:45.690> up<00:02:45.930> if<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.410> indeed

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
gonna have to catch up if that is indeed

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
with the screen with the screen we've

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.320 
with the screen with the screen we've
got<00:02:57.510> one<00:02:58.260> point<00:02:58.530> zero<00:02:58.980> four<00:02:59.280> million<00:02:59.910> dots

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
got one point zero four million dots

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.960 
got one point zero four million dots
versus<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> nine<00:03:01.620> hundred<00:03:01.920> twenty<00:03:02.160> thousand<00:03:02.850> on

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.010 
versus a nine hundred twenty thousand on
the<00:03:03.270> 70<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.380> 70d<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.670> better<00:03:06.239> than<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.540> 70

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
the 70 so the 70d is better than the 70

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.620 
the 70 so the 70d is better than the 70
in<00:03:07.230> pure<00:03:07.890> resolution<00:03:08.520> by<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.970> little<00:03:09.270> bit<00:03:09.420> there

I<00:03:45.870> think<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.950> way<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.340> future<00:03:47.700> I

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
I think this is the way of the future I

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.009 
I think this is the way of the future I
think<00:03:47.820> you're<00:03:48.180> eventually<00:03:48.360> gonna<00:03:48.690> see

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
think you're eventually gonna see

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.460 
think you're eventually gonna see
compact<00:03:49.799> flash<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:50.790> gonna<00:03:50.910> be<00:03:51.150> no<00:03:51.330> more

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
compact flash is just gonna be no more

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.020 
compact flash is just gonna be no more
because<00:03:52.470> all<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.830> advances<00:03:53.430> all<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.790> speed

problem and they've gotten very

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.140 
problem and they've gotten very
inexpensive<00:04:13.410> which<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.680> great<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.970> can

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
inexpensive which is great and you can

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.259 
inexpensive which is great and you can

keep quite a few in a wallet especially

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.180 
keep quite a few in a wallet especially
over<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.299> size<00:04:18.600> of<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.810> compact<00:04:19.109> flash<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:20.160> I

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
over the size of a compact flash so I

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.349 
over the size of a compact flash so I
would<00:04:20.370> say<00:04:20.519> that's<00:04:20.669> an<00:04:20.850> advantage<00:04:21.120> that's

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
would say that's an advantage that's

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.930 
would say that's an advantage that's
advantage<00:04:21.750> number<00:04:21.870> six<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.800> seven<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.430> eight

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
advantage number six the seven and eight

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.379 
advantage number six the seven and eight
is<00:04:24.150> weight<00:04:24.539> and<00:04:24.780> dimensions<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.910> 70d<00:04:26.910> is

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
is weight and dimensions the 70d is

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.020 
is weight and dimensions the 70d is
smaller<00:04:27.599> and<00:04:27.900> lighter<00:04:28.229> than<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.800> 70<00:04:29.340> some

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
smaller and lighter than the 70 some

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.149 
smaller and lighter than the 70 some
people<00:04:30.419> still<00:04:30.689> like<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:30.900> little<00:04:31.349> bit<00:04:31.620> larger

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
people still like a little bit larger

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.760 
people still like a little bit larger
and<00:04:32.189> heavier<00:04:32.430> camera<00:04:33.120> for<00:04:33.599> me<00:04:33.749> I'm<00:04:34.110> liking<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
and heavier camera for me I'm liking the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.890 
and heavier camera for me I'm liking the
smaller<00:04:35.069> lighter<00:04:35.610> cameras<00:04:36.270> as<00:04:36.449> long<00:04:36.629> as<00:04:36.749> it's

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
smaller lighter cameras as long as it's

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.989 
smaller lighter cameras as long as it's
still<00:04:37.080> lean<00:04:37.319> on<00:04:37.439> a<00:04:37.469> DSLR<00:04:38.069> size<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.699> fits<00:04:38.849> my

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
hands as this camera would be so smaller

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.179 
hands as this camera would be so smaller
and<00:04:42.870> lighter<00:04:43.020> on<00:04:43.199> the<00:04:43.289> 70d<00:04:43.740> side<00:04:43.979> and<00:04:44.129> I'm

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
hopefully all manufacturers will soon be

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:10.490 
hopefully all manufacturers will soon be
moving<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.389> this<00:05:09.509> where<00:05:09.689> it's<00:05:09.810> just<00:05:10.020> built-in

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
moving to this where it's just built-in

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.230 
moving to this where it's just built-in
if<00:05:10.830> you<00:05:11.039> can<00:05:11.219> have<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.580> in<00:05:11.699> your<00:05:11.849> little<00:05:12.090> tiny
