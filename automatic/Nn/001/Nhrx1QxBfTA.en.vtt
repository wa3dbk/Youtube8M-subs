00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:10.230
 today I want to show you my aquarium 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:19.080
 tropical freshwater it comes to one 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:20.369
 of the denner the thirty liters as the first 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.930
 plan 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:31.590
 we made a lawn of and the charis 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.759
 we added a trunk where we have 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.059
 bound 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.719
 when i say we have is because we are in 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.430
 two my wife and I made 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.120
 of the dubian air adhesive and then of the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.020
 java moss to reach of the reach 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.309
 ashton 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.289
 we have linked precisely to the richard 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.800
 whitt hans behind we find a small group 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:03.480
 of crypto goring green and cripto garin 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:08.040
 brown on this side a large group 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:16.409
 of little coat of arms in the wound and as a plant 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:20.430
 background of the ludwig repens as background 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.060
 we used the aquarium 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:32.340
 of water I know the Amazonian mime is a 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:37.740
 very light substrate unique both in the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.590
 its kind that in using it in a 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.960
 aquarium replaces me the fertile bottom 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.390
 and the game is spent for those who do n't say it 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.979
 background the same result 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:54.030
 the same even superior you see well 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.380
 like leo fish wonderfully 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.630
 charis expands weighs this is one 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.600
 time they were two small jars of the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.300
 nubia has become 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.600
 a wonderful song you see here me 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:18.290
 he covered entirely as a starter 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:22.100
 real of the aquarium and here it is already seen 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.080
 how it's starting to jarring going 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:31.250
 in a short time to fill this too 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:38.450
 part of the aquarium the ludwig that has one 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:41.390
 fast growth an excellent plant for 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:47.050
 contain nitrate nitrites to values 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.330
 very low as filtering 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:54.110
 to the original supplied nano filter 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.880
 approached a brief niagara 190 where I have 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.060
 replaced the filter cartridge with 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.550
 of cyrax mines and filter wool 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.100
 above that helps me contain all the 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.260
 in fact impurity can well be seen 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.860
 the water is crystal clear 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.680
 the only things in suspension that 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.660
 they sat are just the bubbles 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:22.310
 the system of carbon dioxide as 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.880
 lighting system to its in 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:30.860
 I used another one 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.519
 identical where, however, I replaced the 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.239
 light bulb 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.519
 also because old in this here yes 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.680
 can see by color 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.890
 this is a 840 slam bought 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.260
 quietly in a store 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.580
 electrical items 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:54.170
 readily available is a cost 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:04:00.140
 insignificant and in the first through a site of 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:04.540
 fishkeeping a wave pl 11 of 6.500 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.400
 kilpin because this solution for 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.310
 an economic question why 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.900
 the original costs around 13 euros e 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.989
 50 just because of the protection here 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.919
 against splashes and humidity what that 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:22.479
 to me anyway it doesn't give me any problems because me 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:32.440
 here I usually put the glass precisely for 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:34.270
 contain evaporation as 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.840
 fertilization use of products 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.070
 of the evening which therefore affects the 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.979
 potassium 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:47.590
 the basic fertilization trail 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:51.610
 obviously, in addition to the LED, it carbonised 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.470
 then we also recently added a 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.449
 Indian almond leaf indeed 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.490
 do you know the properties of the leaves of 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.320
 Indian almond release substances 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:05.830
 humic protect the mucous membranes of fish 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:11.050
 adjust the ph is the almond leaves 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:13.479
 both Indian from Amazonia and thesis 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:21.729
 of the coals that I can have a ph 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:24.340
 equal to 6 and cup h4 and a gh therefore to the 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:29.020
 total hardness equal to 7 nitrites e 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:32.050
 nitrate nitrites 0n mitrate at 0.05 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:37.990
 milligrams liter so almost nothing 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.960
 of the temperature set by 25 degrees e 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.870
 both fish and plants 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.699
 I think they just attack this 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:49.020
 this temperature and these values e 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.020
 especially water 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:10.620
 you see bright and intense colors 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:12.510
 especially the police and I haven't yet 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:17.090
 then weekly cleaning done 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:22.080
 I usually change the water change 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:29.820
 4 liters of water per week two those 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:36.350
 mosey and two of bio conditioning network 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:36.350
 previously with evening water from 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:45.800
 lawn from above viewed as a photo 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.130
 very beautifull 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:07:02.840
 I hope I enjoyed it 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:02.840
 thanks for having seen it is a hello
