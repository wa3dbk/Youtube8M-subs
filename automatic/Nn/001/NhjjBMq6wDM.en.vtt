00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.980
 hi people thank you that turn on and 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.160
 Welcome to my unboxing 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.990
 samsung of course knew something again 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.639
 was in the box and have nothing else 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.230
 Now we want to see what 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.730
 I then exactly in it is what we at 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.199
 have accessories and so on 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.090
 The packaging is as always very 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.690
 we do not want to be unsupported anymore 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.210
 look at 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.680
 here we have the samsung we tackle 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.440
 Lose it and see what we have 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.120
 drive underneath 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.320
 Of course they have and I have something to read 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.869
 the quick start guide the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.780
 sr information and so on us 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.269
 We already know that too 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.519
 even the internet does that 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.829
 Looks like this is the typical collection 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.140
 has a decent quality like 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.210
 I'm fine 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.069
 the normal data files with the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.379
 pc exchange or the whole on 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:52.870
 notebook or pc to load or if 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.249
 we use together with the power supply 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.539
 You can also do the whole thing a socket 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:58.359
 load normally 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.460
 We have nice to see again 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.999
 a loose battery you change and 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.800
 can even use this comes with 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:08.380
 2300 milliliters so much to that 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.300
 what's in the box now is the device 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.770
 and that looks like they will be first 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.290
 times the two films remove 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.330
 the back is already halfway anyway 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.400
 We do not need to get it down 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.500
 more on the front now comes the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.400
 span is the moment we do it that way 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.280
 and away with it 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.440
 it looks completely without any 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.190
 slides and so forth from what is that 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.140
 first impression 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.240
 So we see here on the back 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.370
 I'll show you this nice 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.710
 aluminum brasch airline from samsung 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.110
 galaxy note 2 or galaxy s3 too 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.580
 Unfortunately it is only the one who knows it 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.950
 look because unfortunately we have no 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.690
 aluminum installed as we like to 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.580
 would have wished at times that is now 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.580
 Accordingly, the device is easy 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.200
 also the light relatively good relatively large 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.960
 in the hand the shape reminds a lot 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.460
 note 2 and galaxy s3 I think who 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.180
 only realizes that we have one here 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.659
 physical home button have good 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.840
 impressed we have 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.970
 outside this silver frame is yes 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.009
 relatively typical of devices today behind 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.140
 then the thin backside down here very much 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.360
 the speaker accentuates one more 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.910
 extra not just chrome frame 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.610
 and friends that normally 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.590
 we will go into the detail we 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.780
 Carefully turn to the left 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.060
 There we see the loudly quiet 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.650
 We got the one ordinary light 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.660
 pressure point has a little bit 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.000
 stands out and feels good when we 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.010
 Going down the frame we see nothing 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.660
 more to the right side, however, the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.370
 we turn one off power button 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.890
 This one is also a little bit 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.590
 It feels wonderful to walk on 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.270
 further down we come to the extra 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.160
 two-stage camera button two-stage 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.420
 lightly press and light once 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.490
 focus and once again 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.480
 trigger 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.700
 on the top of course we see 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.230
 the 3.5 mm jack connection for the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.250
 headset is a secondary to them 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.080
 microphone for active 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.740
 noise cancellation and otherwise 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.420
 nothing more 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.360
 this little rag here we look 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.040
 it is even more accurate on the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.870
 bottom we see the 35 mm 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.660
 jack connection and the microphone too 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.500
 We are talking on the phone enough 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.450
 the backside 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.760
 there we see how already said 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.900
 round out the accented speaker 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.760
 is not about the whole width 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.130
 processed the few but still equal 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.100
 a windows phone logo and this per 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.430
 chrome frame brushed aluminum back 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.650
 Samsung lettering and an 8 megapixel 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.060
 camera including single end the videos 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.050
 we can of course in full hd 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.550
 record 1920 x 1080p and moan 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.000
 integrated image stabilizer 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.470
 We see here we do this step 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.150
 the finger his body the back 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.400
 seen losing weight 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.160
 typical samsung was very very thin 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.959
 movable great material if we 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.150
 you can see more about this here 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.920
 really small therefore small normal 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.360
 great speaker though 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.370
 not as broad as it is here 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.090
 is shown here comes naturally 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.100
 the accordion one 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.630
 here comes a micro sd card purely 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.850
 more precisely , the whole um 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.910
 a maximum of 64 gigabytes expand 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.310
 internally 16 gb are installed here on the 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.590
 side comes the micro sim card to 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.120
 call and so on here in the rest 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.340
 of the housing are of course still at canon 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.850
 for example, wlan telephony and 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.890
 engels ii installed 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.799
 Let's do it all again 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.709
 is accompanied by a small one 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.330
 with some cracking and that rag 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.340
 By the way, the film is over here 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.569
 camera on the flash I wanted you 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.150
 because still have said 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:31.750
 So now I'll be the front page 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.250
 from my freshly trapped 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.440
 free fingerprint from the hand 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.720
 beautiful German otherwise the way you do it 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.180
 loves and then we continue 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.979
 see starting at the top 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.159
 of course the typical me too 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.840
 for it again purely quickly sharp 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.879
 and then comes that we see first times 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.770
 Of course, frame the vine around it 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:53.479
 housing then pulls the earpiece 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.800
 do not see the collection lettering 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.680
 and proximity sensor and a 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.990
 front camera which resolves with 12 megapixels 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.180
 and photos also in videos in 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.889
 full-hd records when we do it all the time 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.180
 down a bit going for seeking 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.949
 I'll see club out again , of course 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.629
 the display that we will see you soon 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.560
 will take a closer look at the 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:14.330
 lateral edge 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.129
 it's about 34 mm thinner but needs to be 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.409
 Do not always be down and down with time 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.849
 visit capacitive and back and one 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:22.340
 physical home button 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.650
 so the display will take a closer look 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.500
 it is not necessarily at her 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.380
 the smallest display 48 is supposed to be 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.009
 12.9 ten inches in the diagonal 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:37.460
 is a hd super amoled panel so have 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:41.659
 resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels and is 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:45.319
 protected by gorilla glas 21 landed 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:48.949
 the device is 137 mm high and 71 mm wide 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:51.770
 say correct with 87 mm 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.690
 it weighs just 135 grams with it 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.759
 the battery when he is in it is a 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.490
 neat will definitely fit well 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:00.529
 Shoe size we have battery capacity of 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.340
 2,300 milliamps have it 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:03.199
 just seen 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.710
 16 gigabytes of internal memory plus 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:09.979
 maximum 64 GB via micro SD card and one 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:13.879
 sar value of 0 27 4 watts per kilogram 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:15.650
 on the head and 03 09 watts per kilogram 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:17.360
 already a small on the body 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.080
 size comparison and a small thickness 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.110
 compare to 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.919
 the samsung galaxy note and the htc 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.590
 desire hd 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.479
 so look at the size here 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.099
 you can also see the typical collection 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.319
 shape thanks now makes 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:33.569
 from the side looks the whole and so 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.399
 In comparison, I hope that has you 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:38.399
 helped a little bit if not 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:40.009
 surely you have not said such a thing 

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:43.069
 now just my handkerchief at home 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:45.719
 the size looks like this 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:47.549
 loosely covers a thick thumb 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:49.799
 I got him out to the side one 

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:51.329
 little finger from the ceiling here must 

00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:55.139
 because I think I do not look much 

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:56.909
 so it looks good what else can I 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.989
 say it cold device is in the color 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:00.059
 aluminum silver 

00:06:57.989 --> 00:07:01.709
 we can see them from the back here 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:04.439
 really succeeded very well 

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:06.239
 if you want to have a windows 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:08.399
 phone 8 does not come from nokia 

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:10.529
 or htc comes from 400 euros 

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:13.679
 lie down and for example with money 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:16.409
 short amazon or notebooksbilliger is 

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:17.939
 to have it so in stock good that was it 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:22.529
 already from my unboxing to 

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:24.300
 samsung tvs says it thanks to earlier time 

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:26.939
 tell me what you get from this 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.629
 Keep what you expect and if it is you 

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:30.259
 would lay 

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:30.259
 take care
