because<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.020> overlooked<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.649> little<00:00:56.129> thing

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
because I overlooked that little thing

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.819 
because I overlooked that little thing
now<00:00:56.550> unfortunately<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.449> kind<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.559> pretty

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
now unfortunately I know kind of pretty

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.740 
now unfortunately I know kind of pretty
much<00:00:58.949> condom<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.359> that's<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.600> good

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
much condom but I think that's a good

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
much condom but I think that's a good
thing<00:01:00.989> because<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.920> level<00:01:02.190> design<00:01:02.520> isn't

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
thing because the level design isn't

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
thing because the level design isn't
actually<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.359> good<00:01:06.290> how<00:01:07.290> was<00:01:07.320> your<00:01:07.650> way<00:01:07.830> into

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
actually that good how was your way into

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.390 
actually that good how was your way into
it<00:01:08.540> okay<00:01:09.540> see<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.350> does<00:01:10.530> instead<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it okay see what it does instead is that

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.690 
it okay see what it does instead is that
it<00:01:11.580> does<00:01:11.939> slow<00:01:12.330> down<00:01:12.590> instead<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.650> Frank<00:01:14.189> skip

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
it does slow down instead of Frank skip

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.219 
it does slow down instead of Frank skip
which<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:16.520> kinda<00:01:17.520> more<00:01:17.759> livable<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.810> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
which is kinda more livable with you

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.940 
which is kinda more livable with you
know<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.369> also<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.119> less<00:01:21.360> super<00:01:21.990> helper

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
know and also is less super helper

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.070 
know and also is less super helper
mediating<00:01:23.700> because<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.420> thought<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.900> place

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
mediating because I thought this place

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.749 
mediating because I thought this place
was<00:01:25.320> kind<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> neat<00:01:26.040> clever

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
was kind of neat clever

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.590 
was kind of neat clever
although<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.860> soapbox<00:01:29.729> like

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
although I think that the soapbox like

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600 
although I think that the soapbox like
know<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.079> soapstone<00:01:31.380> platform<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.460> this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
know that a soapstone platform that this

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.230 
know that a soapstone platform that this
creates<00:01:33.409> disappear<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.979> too<00:01:35.340> fast<00:01:35.790> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
creates disappear a bit too fast it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.649 
creates disappear a bit too fast it
doesn't<00:01:36.659> show<00:01:37.170> very<00:01:37.619> well<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> kind

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you kind of just need to go you know you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.300 
you kind of just need to go you know you
just<00:02:13.460> just<00:02:14.460> go<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:15.090> go<00:02:15.410> go

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
just just go just go go

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.250 
just just go just go go
Oh<00:02:17.720> everywhere<00:02:19.460> midpoint<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:20.730> my<00:02:20.940> hair<00:02:21.480> and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
Oh everywhere midpoint in my hair and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.690 
Oh everywhere midpoint in my hair and
here<00:02:23.010> there<00:02:23.370> land<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:24.330> rise<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.990> falls<00:02:25.700> okay

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
here there land it rise and falls okay

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.600 
here there land it rise and falls okay
this<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.120> harder<00:02:27.690> then<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.530> looks<00:02:28.860> because

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
this is harder then that looks because

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.300 
this is harder then that looks because
you<00:02:30.060> can't<00:02:30.330> just<00:02:30.720> run<00:02:31.110> off<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.620> thing<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.070> its

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
you can't just run off the thing on its

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.990 
you can't just run off the thing on its
own<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:33.560> think<00:02:34.560> went<00:02:34.890> higher<00:02:35.160> than<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.610> when<00:02:35.880> I

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
own I think went higher than that when I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.540 
own I think went higher than that when I
play<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.300> but<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.840> guess<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.530> was<00:02:37.860> making<00:02:38.430> a

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
play that but I guess I was making a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.610 
play that but I guess I was making a
mistake

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
mistake

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.460 
mistake
everyone<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:41.070> sausages<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.930> something

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
everyone is sausages not something

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.250 
everyone is sausages not something
everyone<00:02:43.980> should<00:02:44.040> say<00:02:44.490> at<00:02:44.670> least<00:02:44.850> once<00:02:45.300> before

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
everyone should say at least once before

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.070 
everyone should say at least once before
their<00:02:46.710> birthday<00:02:47.240> yeah<00:02:48.240> that's<00:02:48.690> what<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.900> want

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
their birthday yeah that's what you want

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.540 
their birthday yeah that's what you want
to<00:02:49.200> do<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:49.620> want<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.830> type<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.160> well<00:02:50.340> so

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
to do you just want to type it well so

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.360 
to do you just want to type it well so
that<00:02:50.750> actually<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.840> kind<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.320> works<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.250> then

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
that actually it kind of works and then

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.110 
that actually it kind of works and then
it<00:02:53.550> works<00:02:53.790> again<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.220> misjudge<00:02:56.790> where

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
it works again you you misjudge where

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.210 
it works again you you misjudge where
the<00:02:57.300> last<00:02:57.540> thing<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.110> gotten<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> sprite<00:02:58.830> okay

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
the last thing is gotten the sprite okay

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.430 
the last thing is gotten the sprite okay
actually<00:02:59.850> this<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.300> going<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.720> lot<00:03:00.870> better<00:03:01.170> than

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
actually this is going a lot better than

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.550 
actually this is going a lot better than
I<00:03:01.530> thought<00:03:01.700> again<00:03:02.700> probably<00:03:03.450> because<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:04.200> kind

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
I thought again probably because I kind

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.970 
I thought again probably because I kind
of<00:03:04.620> know<00:03:04.770> what's<00:03:05.040> going<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.550> happen<00:03:06.090> but<00:03:06.980> hey

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
of know what's going to happen but hey

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.440 
of know what's going to happen but hey
at<00:03:08.250> least<00:03:08.310> we<00:03:08.520> can<00:03:08.640> judge<00:03:08.880> this<00:03:09.120> level

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
at least we can judge this level

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.800 
at least we can judge this level
accurately<00:03:10.170> for<00:03:10.470> what<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.640> cave<00:03:12.300> level

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
accurately for what it is a cave level

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.550 
accurately for what it is a cave level
with<00:03:12.989> lava<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.070> it's<00:03:14.700> pretty<00:03:15.270> great<00:03:15.600> sure<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
with lava in it it's pretty great sure I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.770 
with lava in it it's pretty great sure I
think<00:03:17.430> what<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.730> should<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.150> yeah<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.420> just

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
think what you should do yeah you just

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.380 
think what you should do yeah you just
kind<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.019> jump<00:03:19.260> back<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.060> you're<00:03:21.060> gonna<00:03:21.209> be

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
kind of jump back and you're gonna be

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.810 
kind of jump back and you're gonna be
able<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:22.019> eat<00:03:22.170> all<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.709> sarsaparilla<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.640> can

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
able to eat all the sarsaparilla you can

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.030 
able to eat all the sarsaparilla you can
shove<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.300> your<00:03:24.330> mouth<00:03:24.660> this<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.800> part

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
shove in your mouth this is the part

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.070 
shove in your mouth this is the part
where<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.340> ladder<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.880> super<00:03:27.540> huge<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:28.050> you

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
where the ladder is super huge but you

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.660 
where the ladder is super huge but you
just<00:03:28.320> kind<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.560> do<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.830> out<00:03:29.070> of<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.250> law<00:03:29.400> I

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
just kind of do this out of the law I

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.290 
just kind of do this out of the law I
think<00:03:30.769> because<00:03:31.769> they're<00:03:32.370> all<00:03:32.610> going<00:03:33.150> up

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
think because they're all going up

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.690 
think because they're all going up
pretty<00:03:33.690> much<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.080> same<00:03:34.350> speed<00:03:34.860> oh<00:03:35.040> my<00:03:35.280> god<00:03:35.519> you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
pretty much the same speed oh my god you

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.320 
pretty much the same speed oh my god you
don't<00:03:35.850> want<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.510> let<00:03:36.870> them<00:03:37.760> build<00:03:38.760> up<00:03:39.030> though

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
don't want to let them build up though

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.800 
don't want to let them build up though
because<00:03:40.160> it's<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.250> lot<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.519> them<00:03:41.880> it's<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.540> pota

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
because it's a lot of them it's the pota

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.500 
because it's a lot of them it's the pota
beause<00:03:43.140> they<00:03:43.950> go<00:03:44.130> oh<00:03:44.370> oh<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.239> then<00:03:45.390> you're
