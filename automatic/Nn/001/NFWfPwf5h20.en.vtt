kind<00:02:31.359> of<00:02:31.480> as<00:02:31.780> long<00:02:32.560> as<00:02:32.709> they're<00:02:32.829> in<00:02:32.859> the<00:02:33.010> trough

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
kind of as long as they're in the trough

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.789 
kind of as long as they're in the trough
give<00:02:33.579> them<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.760> little<00:02:33.969> pop<00:02:34.209> down<00:02:34.480> but<00:02:35.469> you

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
give them a little pop down but you

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.110 
give them a little pop down but you
definitely<00:02:36.400> want<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.579> make<00:02:36.639> sure<00:02:36.909> they're<00:02:37.090> in

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120

that little trough and you've seen its
lined<00:02:39.219> up<00:02:39.459> or<00:02:40.150> else<00:02:40.329> you'll<00:02:40.480> end<00:02:40.510> up<00:02:40.750> with

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
lined up or else you'll end up with

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.970 
lined up or else you'll end up with
something<00:02:41.109> where<00:02:41.349> you've<00:02:41.500> been<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.859> little

something where you've been the little
clip<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.459> that's<00:02:43.180> not<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> fun<00:02:43.689> deal<00:02:43.870> with<00:02:44.019> deal

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
clip and that's not a fun deal with deal

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.069 
clip and that's not a fun deal with deal
with<00:02:44.379> now<00:02:44.889> on<00:02:45.040> this<00:02:45.159> one<00:02:45.659> you<00:02:46.659> got<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> deal

with now on this one you got a deal

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.259 
with now on this one you got a deal
where<00:02:47.379> this<00:02:47.799> piece<00:02:48.239> have<00:02:49.239> came<00:02:49.510> undone<00:02:49.840> and

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.440 
cladding but it's a very very very
simple<00:03:02.079> fix<00:03:02.969> just<00:03:03.969> don't<00:03:04.120> know<00:03:04.209> if<00:03:04.299> I'll<00:03:04.419> be

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
simple fix just don't know if I'll be

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.780 
simple fix just don't know if I'll be
able<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:04.780> do<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.109> right<00:03:05.260> now<00:03:05.469> the<00:03:06.250> same<00:03:06.489> kind<00:03:06.760> of

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
able to do it right now the same kind of

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.399

deal<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.209> got<00:03:07.329> a<00:03:07.359> little<00:03:07.629> clip<00:03:07.870> right<00:03:08.109> there

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
deal you got a little clip right there

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.199 
deal you got a little clip right there
and<00:03:09.189> I<00:03:09.280> hope<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.549> can<00:03:09.700> see<00:03:09.909> it<00:03:10.000> now<00:03:10.180> on

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:12.969 
Samantha to come here and look - you can

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.959 
Samantha to come here and look - you can
see<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.239> white<00:03:13.419> clip<00:03:13.719> right<00:03:13.900> here<00:03:14.609> and<00:03:15.609> it

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:15.969 
see the white clip right here and it

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.319 
see the white clip right here and it
turns<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:17.530> should<00:03:17.829> go<00:03:18.010> into<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.400> little<00:03:18.760> tray

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
turns it should go into that little tray

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.629 
turns it should go into that little tray
right<00:03:19.599> there<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.650> pop<00:03:21.040> through<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.400> holes

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
right there and pop through the holes

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.780 
right there and pop through the holes
but<00:03:22.889> basically<00:03:23.889> what<00:03:24.040> you've<00:03:24.190> got<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.549> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
but basically what you've got is the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.610 
but basically what you've got is the
clip<00:03:25.769> should<00:03:26.769> likely<00:03:27.159> be<00:03:27.280> in<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.519> door<00:03:27.819> and

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
clip should likely be in the door and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.110 
clip should likely be in the door and
not<00:03:29.620> trying<00:03:29.949> to<00:03:30.040> go<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.400> this<00:03:30.639> I<00:03:30.760> mean<00:03:30.849> in<00:03:31.000> the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
not trying to go in this I mean in the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.449 
not trying to go in this I mean in the
cladding<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:31.780> not<00:03:32.650> trying<00:03:32.949> to<00:03:33.069> go<00:03:33.189> in<00:03:33.310> this

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
cladding and not trying to go in this

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.619 
cladding and not trying to go in this
way<00:03:33.699> so<00:03:34.439> I'm<00:03:35.439> gonna<00:03:35.590> give<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:36.069> slight<00:03:36.879> pop

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
way so I'm gonna give it a slight pop

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.009 
way so I'm gonna give it a slight pop
but<00:03:38.560> not<00:03:39.489> very<00:03:39.939> much<00:03:40.299> because<00:03:40.540> if<00:03:40.870> you're<00:03:40.989> not

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
but not very much because if you're not

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.439 
but not very much because if you're not
lined<00:03:41.470> up<00:03:41.709> you're<00:03:42.519> just<00:03:42.879> gonna<00:03:43.000> break<00:03:43.299> the

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
lined up you're just gonna break the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.999 
lined up you're just gonna break the
clips<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:47.079> is<00:03:47.199> what<00:03:47.349> most<00:03:47.530> people<00:03:47.620> end

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:48.009 
clips and that is what most people end

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.580 
clips and that is what most people end
up<00:03:48.069> doing<00:03:48.340> on<00:03:48.430> this<00:03:48.579> hole<00:03:48.759> the<00:03:48.879> camera<00:03:49.180> here<00:03:49.590> if

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
up doing on this hole the camera here if

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.289 
up doing on this hole the camera here if
you<00:03:50.680> apply<00:03:50.769> proper<00:03:51.430> pressure<00:03:51.699> when<00:03:52.060> doing

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
you apply proper pressure when doing

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.319 
you apply proper pressure when doing
this<00:03:52.449> it<00:03:52.689> should<00:03:53.579> not<00:03:54.579> break<00:03:54.849> it

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
this it should not break it

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:05.550 
this it should not break it
I<00:03:58.799> got<00:03:59.799> it<00:03:59.979> without<00:04:00.430> taking<00:04:00.909> it<00:04:01.000> out<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:05.470> you

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
I got it without taking it out and you

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.069 
I got it without taking it out and you
can<00:04:05.709> feel<00:04:05.949> if<00:04:06.069> they're<00:04:06.220> all<00:04:06.340> in<00:04:06.579> -<00:04:07.079> because

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
there's a top and a bottom there but

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.659 
there's a top and a bottom there but
look<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.049> up<00:04:11.139> it's<00:04:11.349> a<00:04:11.409> very<00:04:11.769> easy<00:04:12.009> fix<00:04:12.370> just

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
look it up it's a very easy fix just
