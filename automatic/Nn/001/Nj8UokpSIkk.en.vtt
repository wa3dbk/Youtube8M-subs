right I think outside the box but some
of<00:00:53.850> them<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.329> really<00:00:54.660> really<00:00:55.500> simple<00:00:57.620> so

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
of them are just really really simple so

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.970 
of them are just really really simple so
