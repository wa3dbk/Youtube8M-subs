get breakfast in the morning

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.900 
get breakfast in the morning
so<00:07:32.450> I<00:07:32.810> like<00:07:32.990> the<00:07:33.200> cereal<00:07:33.650> with<00:07:33.890> the<00:07:34.640> girls<00:07:34.850> are

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:34.910 
so I like the cereal with the girls are

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.190 
so I like the cereal with the girls are
gonna<00:07:34.970> laugh<00:07:35.180> at<00:07:35.300> me<00:07:35.390> but<00:07:35.510> I<00:07:35.600> like<00:07:35.750> cereal<00:07:36.140> and

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.250 
gonna laugh at me but I like cereal and
water<00:07:36.470> because<00:07:37.100> I<00:07:37.160> don't<00:07:37.310> drink<00:07:37.490> milk<00:07:38.230> so<00:07:39.230> I

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:39.260 
water because I don't drink milk so I

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.350 
water because I don't drink milk so I
think<00:07:39.350> it's<00:07:39.560> a<00:07:39.590> little<00:07:39.770> weird<00:07:39.950> but<00:07:40.190> I<00:07:41.150> really

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 
think it's a little weird but I really

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.480 
think it's a little weird but I really
like<00:07:41.750> Syrian<00:07:42.140> water<00:07:42.320> were<00:07:42.470> before<00:07:42.830> pregame<00:07:43.220> so

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.490 
like Syrian water were before pregame so

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.980 
like Syrian water were before pregame so
Syria<00:07:43.850> and<00:07:43.970> water<00:07:44.150> is<00:07:44.360> definitely<00:07:44.510> my<00:07:44.780> pregame

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:44.990 
Syria and water is definitely my pregame

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.970 
Syria and water is definitely my pregame
meal<00:07:46.540> it<00:07:47.540> was<00:07:47.630> a<00:07:47.690> nighttime<00:07:47.960> game<00:07:48.470> I<00:07:48.770> would

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:48.980 
meal it was a nighttime game I would

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.420 
meal it was a nighttime game I would
probably<00:07:49.190> eat<00:07:49.640> a<00:07:50.200> chicken<00:07:51.200> breast<00:07:51.590> and<00:07:51.920> fruit

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:52.430 
probably eat a chicken breast and fruit

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.450 
probably eat a chicken breast and fruit
unless<00:07:53.000> bought<00:07:53.270> it
