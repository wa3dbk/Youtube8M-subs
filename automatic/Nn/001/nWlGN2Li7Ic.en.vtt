00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 today we are talking about micro-invasive techniques 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.330
 a little bit borderline between the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.670
 Plastic and cosmetic surgery 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.469
 aesthetic medicine with regard to the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.469
 speech about facial rejuvenation 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.640
 we put them together are two techniques has 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.000
 it is recently acquired 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.960
 that of aesthetic medicine he uses 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 of the micro filaments that are inserted 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.070
 with a bland but extended to local in 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.430
 derma and are sons that are reabsorbed into 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.340
 six months and I am able through 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.850
 stimulation process that lead to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.640
 giving a generation of the dermis therefore a 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.039
 create more connective tissue 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.350
 especially collagen that actually 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.789
 the state in the state greatly improves 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.949
 of the skin 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.440
 also because sometimes we talk about 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.050
 facial cosmetic plastic surgery 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.660
 without taking into account what instead 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.070
 the appearance of the skin because it is a skin 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.830
 of 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.430
 in good health certainly allows us 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.229
 to have results even by doing 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.060
 of which surgery and who they are 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.040
 certainly of better quality these 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.710
 new techniques as I said before 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.000
 very recent introduction though 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.370
 old like 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.160
 concept think of the sixties 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.260
 seventy when injected subcutaneously 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.660
 of gold threads to stimulate the 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.990
 collagen to give support to the dermis 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.470
 same I must say that innovative meanwhile 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.290
 for the speed and for the relative 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.450
 ease as which one is used can 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.100
 be used on the face but also on the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.080
 body and it is true that I am personally 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.170
 carrying out a usage study 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.270
 of these threads with regard to 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.800
 so-called critical areas of the body that 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.300
 they are the inner arms and the inner thighs 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.170
 which as we know 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.820
 after 50 60 years they represent 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.950
 really a challenge for the surgeon 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.620
 because apart from the surgical treatment 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.490
 traditional in the thigh or leasing 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.130
 indoor arms 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.320
 certainly not other ways than that 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.960
 of the use of substances in some 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.300
 so they can help give you more back 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.650
 to the skin and to eliminate that effect a 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.650
 flag so unpleasant
