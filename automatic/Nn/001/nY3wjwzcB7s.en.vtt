00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 hello all beach figures heartily 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.639
 welcome to a new video and indeed 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.380
 butter versus margarine what comes to me 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.000
 not in the household or what 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.590
 I think it's better that I can do that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.330
 already realize that I'm here only 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.820
 the mother at home and the margarine 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.949
 not at all in this new one 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.949
 I still wanted our new video fire 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.689
 zero to hero dot net page show 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.160
 that's how the logo looks now 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.260
 Project I was one again today 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.869
 quantity rotate with tai chi together were 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.210
 Gym we have together 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.820
 shopped and I have to be like that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.530
 i have pimped culinara nutrition plan 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.120
 now just about in the jacket is still 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.920
 I just got it in there 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.860
 simply , okay, that's what he is 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.629
 everything now just currently the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.309
 it led to him holding a double child 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.710
 get and no sixpack and so on 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.840
 has and we have analyzed the whole 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.940
 and then I now have a kind it is 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.320
 made a comparison that is now 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.050
 I showed him what he has to do instead 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.539
 food and so on and so forth and us 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.280
 make huge huge program now 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.090
 So it goes off every day with the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.640
 filming 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.680
 and if you are informed about it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.960
 then you can go to zero to 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.520
 Just enter hero dot net here then 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.409
 I will always keep up to date with 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.380
 but the progress now back to 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.470
 video margarine would butter it 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.840
 why does margarine not come to my house? 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.720
 Now the following should be the following 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.119
 things about the butter brain grass 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.880
 fed cows kerrygold irish butter 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.280
 how to make butter it's on 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.720
 quite a simple process because of that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.420
 is the mother already some 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.259
 decades and some much longer 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.689
 is that you just take milk and with 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.939
 leaves natural fat content and then 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.579
 simply in principle in German said 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.009
 always at the earliest until the frame 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.600
 that's why you have to leave me 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.310
 just stir stirring stir 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.829
 Stir and stop stirring and at some point 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.200
 arises butter that means mother is on 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.560
 It's one of the most natural fats in the world 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.299
 Anyway, you're taking a cow 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.439
 the milk comes out and then you hear 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.180
 all the stuff around 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.069
 and if this diet is still grass fed 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.619
 that is not a soja pampe and 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.489
 fodder and so far then you have one 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.980
 excellent food 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.959
 the whole sees 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.569
 Margarine a little bit different then 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:22.040
 as we all know are herbal 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.200
 vettel nature usually liquid so 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.810
 something like olive oil or 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.970
 also sunflower oil and so on though 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.910
 I press them out and I have to 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.349
 then to produce margarine 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.599
 spreadable and a bit too 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.910
 story of margarine if you can 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.599
 company procter &amp; gamble knows that 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.940
 is one of the largest even the largest 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.440
 So the biggest mixed company of the 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.239
 worldwide food and so on 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.640
 processed and so on 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.470
 similar to nestlé procter &amp; gamble in 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.269
 america huge company and that 's it 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.819
 been a while and who have 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.319
 beginning or end of the nineteenth 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.620
 centuries have sometime 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.720
 put together because they have namely 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.019
 soap made and candles ours 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.099
 junk and for that they have everything 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.650
 lard uses lard 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.470
 lard is the stuff but always 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.879
 more in disrepute because of the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.239
 conditions which hold so has 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.889
 in the industries since before predecessors 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.209
 died and it became more expensive 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:23.840
 so they are looking for alternatives 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.060
 looked around and the best alternative 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.669
 always economic nature is when you 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.290
 simply agricultural 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.790
 Waste products processed so that the 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.819
 people can eat and that's exactly what 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.310
 they did with the so-called 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.950
 cottonseed oil and that became then 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.419
 by a german chemist and by 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.849
 a new process was the part 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:46.549
 These are hardened this one 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.319
 Baums want his oil could partially 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.599
 be cured and thereby you could 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.630
 make it spreadable and the whole 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:57.049
 then they called christo so cs 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.569
 ceo chris cola peppy name and that 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:06.290
 stands for crystallized cards and then 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:08.510
 Today the biggest marketing and advertising 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.209
 campaign in the history of 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.910
 then mankind came to have that 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.949
 then this margarine in the end 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.199
 started promoting everywhere 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:19.880
 Did the American housewife know? 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.620
 she will not love her so easily 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.479
 mother replaced by any 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.960
 so by some marin because of that 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.259
 have the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.550
 1 1 enormous effort operated around this 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.310
 push margarine 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.840
 and then we finally noticed 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.300
 shit we have two problems 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.880
 First, margarine through this part 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.949
 Hardening arise the beautiful nice ones 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.539
 Trans fatty acids are not so good for 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.669
 Above all, our health is not 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:46.190
 for the cardiovascular system and above all 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.620
 not for ours so above all they are 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.150
 very good for cancer cells growth yes 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.370
 now you have it now 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.830
 figured out how to do the whole thing too 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.360
 produce largely without trans fats 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.370
 marina he can be a bit 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.740
 but still there is not as much the 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.710
 far bigger problem now 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.860
 exists is the so-called omega 6 too 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.020
 learn omega 3 ratio of fatty acids 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.759
 if you're a natural fat from the 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.090
 nature take like my beautiful fish 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:16.159
 yes then and the fish festival is yes then 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.520
 do you have a nearly perfect relationship 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:22.370
 from omega 3 to omega 6 fatty acids 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.550
 yes, if you have this now 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:29.960
 sunflower oil will take yes or any 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.610
 other so vegetable oil with which one 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.409
 So a long chain has multiple times 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.460
 unsaturated fatty acids imst and 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:39.289
 Start eating in large quantities 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.250
 then you have a sunflower oil, for example 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:47.599
 ratio of 122 to one from omega 6 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.610
 203 and that in our diet always 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.889
 more and more so we always eat a lot 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.719
 cereal ago we first lot of 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.310
 these oils because everywhere now times 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:58.009
 in it are just like hidden sugar 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.409
 For example, sunflower oil is almost 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:02.419
 every baking agent and in almost every one 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.320
 somehow industrially produced 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.500
 product in it 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.330
 for example in margarine very much and 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.310
 that had meant that we always 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.370
 less of the omega 3 and more and more 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.009
 who more of omega 6 fatty acids 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.930
 record and you can do that nowadays 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.630
 at the current state of science 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.430
 that causes many problems in the 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.159
 human organism especially in 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.099
 relating to inflammations and whenever 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:29.930
 the body on the smallest level with 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.729
 will also have to fight inflammations 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.620
 such other things as for example 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:36.169
 sugar and saturated fats and such 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.330
 continue to one at a time 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.919
 lehman why that is in the end the 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.699
 Great reason why it is in my household 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:45.650
 only this butter gives margarine 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:48.080
 yes and I hope you come from this 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.189
 video what to take again and we 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.689
 then see us on the beach and at 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.400
 next video as I said if you want more 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:53.449
 want to learn from zero to hero wear 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.099
 I'm in the list here 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.330
 and I would say let's go 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.340
 Afterwards everything is nice together 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.719
 train or what do you not think so 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.289
 screaming loud otherwise the sound is here 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:03.139
 not so good 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:06.199
 okay, that's it, I'm one 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:08.090
 some still full so the home because I 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:11.539
 you have worked so much the last few years 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.919
 But sometimes it will not be 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:15.800
 necessarily better the next few weeks 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:18.610
 so please have indulgence see you 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.610
 on the beach and
