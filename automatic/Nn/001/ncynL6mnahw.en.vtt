00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
have one try I was thinking that maybe I

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.870

could<00:04:26.660> do<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:26.960> like<00:04:27.050> multiple<00:04:27.410> times<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:27.919> don't

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
could do it like multiple times I don't

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.640 
could do it like multiple times I don't
think<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.030> can't<00:04:29.300> think<00:04:29.960> these<00:04:30.050> first<00:04:30.290> blocks

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
think I can't think these first blocks
