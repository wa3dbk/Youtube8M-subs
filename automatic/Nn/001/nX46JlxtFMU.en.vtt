00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
you saying that to a certain extent that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.230 
you saying that to a certain extent that
was<00:01:20.460> predictable<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.420> coming<00:01:22.409> from<00:01:22.650> 10<00:01:23.240> dance

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
to specializing standard there is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.859 
to specializing standard there is
usually<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.250> drop<00:01:29.610> how<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.479> explain<00:01:30.780> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869

well i think the the thing is that we

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.569 
well i think the the thing is that we
before<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.680> course<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.979> 10-inch<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.460> the

before of course the 10-inch was the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.420 
before of course the 10-inch was the
main<00:01:35.759> thing<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.710> we<00:01:37.710> did<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> standard<00:01:38.369> of

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
main thing and we did the standard of

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
main thing and we did the standard of
course<00:01:38.670> very<00:01:38.909> seriously<00:01:39.540> same<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> latin

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
course very seriously same with a latin

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.200 
course very seriously same with a latin
very<00:01:40.439> seriously<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.520> main<00:01:41.729> focus<00:01:41.759> was

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
very seriously but the main focus was

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.870 
very seriously but the main focus was
the<00:01:42.270> tendons<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:43.409> as<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:44.070> changed<00:01:44.549> over<00:01:44.759> to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
start to go up so me we expected this is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.820 
start to go up so me we expected this is
not

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
not

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.650 
not
we<00:02:14.190> had<00:02:14.340> hoped<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.790> course<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.330> wouldn't

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
we had hoped of course that it wouldn't

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.490 
we had hoped of course that it wouldn't
but<00:02:16.430> unfortunately<00:02:17.430> he<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:17.820> right<00:02:18.470> nah<00:02:19.470> but

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
but unfortunately he was right nah but

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.100 
but unfortunately he was right nah but
then<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.920> other<00:02:20.010> hand<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.610> were<00:02:20.820> not<00:02:21.110> very

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
then on the other hand you were not very

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.070 
then on the other hand you were not very
far<00:02:22.560> away<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.890> mean<00:02:23.250> coming<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.240> seventh<00:02:24.690> time

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
far away I mean coming in seventh time

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.020 
far away I mean coming in seventh time
after<00:02:25.590> time<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:26.010> can<00:02:26.370> imagine<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.880> frustration

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
after time I can imagine the frustration

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.660 
after time I can imagine the frustration
yeah<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.770> was<00:02:28.890> very<00:02:28.950> frustrating<00:02:29.280> but

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
yeah it was very frustrating but

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.570 
yeah it was very frustrating but
actually<00:02:30.180> I'm<00:02:30.660> also<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.890> was<00:02:32.160> ok<00:02:32.400> with<00:02:32.430> it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
actually I'm also I was ok with it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.740 
actually I'm also I was ok with it
because<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.940> felt<00:02:33.180> we<00:02:33.270> didn't<00:02:33.480> really<00:02:33.660> dance

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
because I felt we didn't really dance

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.480 
because I felt we didn't really dance
good<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.260> know<00:02:34.320> in<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.830> end<00:02:35.100> if<00:02:35.370> you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
good and I know in the end if you

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.310 
good and I know in the end if you
improve<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:36.090> lot<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.930> if<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.080> dance<00:02:37.230> really

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
improve a lot and if you dance really

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.530 
improve a lot and if you dance really
good<00:02:37.710> in<00:02:38.130> time<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.670> will<00:02:38.700> get<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.000> result<00:02:39.150> for

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
good in time you will get the result for

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.070 
good in time you will get the result for
sure<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:41.130> now<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.370> briefly<00:02:42.090> talked<00:02:42.420> about<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
sure and now we briefly talked about the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.590 
sure and now we briefly talked about the
venue<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.800> was<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> big<00:02:44.430> venue<00:02:44.610> last<00:02:45.030> year<00:02:45.390> it

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
venue it was a big venue last year it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.520 
venue it was a big venue last year it
was<00:02:45.630> not<00:02:46.100> filled<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.730> last<00:02:48.060> seat<00:02:48.960> but<00:02:49.350> it

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
was not filled to the last seat but it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.940 
was not filled to the last seat but it
was<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:50.310> was<00:02:50.580> too<00:02:50.880> big<00:02:51.150> with<00:02:51.750> about<00:02:51.990> 12,000<00:02:52.800> now

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
was it was too big with about 12,000 now

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.199 
was it was too big with about 12,000 now
tomorrow<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.490> going<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.670> be<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.820> little<00:02:54.060> bit

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
tomorrow it's going to be a little bit

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.540 
tomorrow it's going to be a little bit
smaller<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.959> would<00:02:55.110> assume<00:02:55.290> like<00:02:55.800> 4000<00:02:56.490> or

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
smaller I would assume like 4000 or

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.930 
smaller I would assume like 4000 or
something<00:02:56.880> like<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.470> how<00:02:58.470> does<00:02:58.830> that

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
something like that how does that

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.880 
something like that how does that
basically<00:02:59.940> work<00:03:00.480> better<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.530> is

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
basically work better for you it is

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.530 
basically work better for you it is
really<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.610> makes<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.820> big<00:03:02.940> difference<00:03:03.000> because

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
really it makes a big difference because

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.370 
really it makes a big difference because
then<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:03.870> connect<00:03:04.170> with<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.320> audience

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
then you can connect with the audience

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.930 
then you can connect with the audience
when<00:03:04.800> you're<00:03:04.920> dancing<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.490> feel<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
when you're dancing you can feel the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.820 
when you're dancing you can feel the
atmosphere<00:03:06.030> if<00:03:06.600> people<00:03:07.230> are<00:03:07.320> either<00:03:07.470> sitting

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
atmosphere if people are either sitting

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.770 
atmosphere if people are either sitting
too<00:03:08.070> far<00:03:08.100> away<00:03:08.400> if<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.670> arena<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.090> too<00:03:09.330> big<00:03:09.570> and

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
too far away if the arena is too big and

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.990 
too far away if the arena is too big and
there's<00:03:10.320> too<00:03:10.530> much<00:03:10.950> space<00:03:11.160> in<00:03:11.459> between<00:03:11.580> people

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
there's too much space in between people

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.670 
there's too much space in between people
you<00:03:12.180> don't<00:03:12.360> really<00:03:12.540> get<00:03:12.840> there<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.560> don't

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
you don't really get there you don't

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.080 
you don't really get there you don't
feel<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.010> atmosphere<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.790> audience

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
feel the atmosphere and the audience

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.699 
feel the atmosphere and the audience
don't<00:03:15.360> feel<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.990> experience<00:03:16.530> for

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
don't feel it so the experience for

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.949 
don't feel it so the experience for
either<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.190> dancer<00:03:18.030> or<00:03:18.150> for<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.510> denser<00:03:18.810> and

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
either the dancer or for the denser and

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.360 
either the dancer or for the denser and
for<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.230> audience<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.590> not<00:03:19.680> as<00:03:19.800> good<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.130> this

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
for the audience is not as good so this

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.130 
for the audience is not as good so this
to<00:03:20.580> tomorrow<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.300> this<00:03:21.390> weekend<00:03:21.780> will<00:03:21.959> be

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
to tomorrow and this weekend will be

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.090 
to tomorrow and this weekend will be
fantastic<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:24.080> everybody<00:03:25.080> knows<00:03:25.320> like<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
fantastic and everybody knows like the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.009 
fantastic and everybody knows like the
Chinese<00:03:26.340> public<00:03:26.670> is<00:03:26.910> very<00:03:27.150> appreciative<00:03:27.810> and

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
Chinese public is very appreciative and

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.240 
Chinese public is very appreciative and
very<00:03:28.500> appreciative<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.190> think<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:32.010> standard

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
very appreciative I think of standard

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.759 
very appreciative I think of standard
more<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:32.850> than<00:03:32.970> Latin<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.530> do<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.620> look

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
more so than Latin and do you look

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.500 
more so than Latin and do you look
forward<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.220> dance<00:03:35.370> tomorrow<00:03:35.730> yes<00:03:36.090> very<00:03:36.360> much

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
forward to dance tomorrow yes very much

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.990 
forward to dance tomorrow yes very much
I<00:03:36.750> think<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.110> culture<00:03:37.470> in<00:03:37.590> China<00:03:37.860> is<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.489> little

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
I think the culture in China is a little

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.540 
I think the culture in China is a little
bit<00:03:39.090> more<00:03:39.239> standard<00:03:39.660> orientated<00:03:40.230> in<00:03:41.130> this<00:03:41.400> way

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
bit more standard orientated in this way

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.770 
bit more standard orientated in this way
I<00:03:41.580> think<00:03:41.700> also<00:03:42.000> they're<00:03:42.209> fantastic<00:03:42.690> and

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
I think also they're fantastic and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.570 
I think also they're fantastic and
lesson<00:03:43.080> as<00:03:43.200> well<00:03:43.230> but<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:44.160> standard<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.550> think

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
lesson as well but the standard I think

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.640 
lesson as well but the standard I think
really<00:03:44.880> hits<00:03:45.150> home<00:03:45.209> somehow<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.780> culture<00:03:46.530> is

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
really hits home somehow the culture is

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.180 
really hits home somehow the culture is
more<00:03:46.920> fine<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.480> refined<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.410> elegant<00:03:49.560> and

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
more fine and refined and elegant and

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.800 
more fine and refined and elegant and
and<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.519> think<00:03:50.730> this<00:03:50.850> really<00:03:51.090> suits<00:03:51.510> the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
and I think this really suits the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.449 
and I think this really suits the
standard<00:03:52.320> with<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.560> long<00:03:52.739> dresses<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.400> the

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
standard with the long dresses and the

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.220 
standard with the long dresses and the
elegance<00:03:53.760> in<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.480> way<00:03:54.570> we<00:03:54.750> move<00:03:54.930> across<00:03:55.140> the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
elegance in the way we move across the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.930 
elegance in the way we move across the
floor<00:03:55.560> slightly<00:03:56.190> different<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.760> lesson

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
floor slightly different to the lesson

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.000 
floor slightly different to the lesson
whereas<00:03:57.780> maybe<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.170> could<00:03:58.320> go<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.500> Cuba<00:03:58.860> and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
whereas maybe you could go to Cuba and

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.500 
whereas maybe you could go to Cuba and
maybe<00:03:59.160> it's<00:03:59.370> completely<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.030> opposite<00:04:00.360> way

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
maybe it's completely the opposite way

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.900 
maybe it's completely the opposite way
so<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:00.870> think<00:04:01.019> every<00:04:01.440> every<00:04:01.830> place<00:04:02.070> has<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.489> has

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
so I think every every place has it has

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.620 
so I think every every place has it has
its<00:04:03.090> charms<00:04:03.420> yeah<00:04:03.959> oh<00:04:04.850> ok<00:04:05.850> thank<00:04:06.300> you<00:04:06.450> very
