00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hi hi welcome to the second episode 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.080
 of our brains the fall in love 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.480
 gonna show you today at your room 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.920
 cotton field our cozy and cozy autumn 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.179
 paradise 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.309
 there are a number of tips and tricks with which 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.770
 your room without too much trouble anyway 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.920
 can make it look much more atmospheric 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.779
 and yes we will show how we do that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.609
 yes s maybe a little thing 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.029
 you have noticed because normally I sit 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.439
 Always in my room but today it 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.750
 different 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.420
 there are in my room i thought as 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.370
 you have seen my room so often 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.500
 maybe it is having and knowing 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.570
 nice to leave leds room 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.350
 because she has a very nice room 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.360
 there are bc or sprays beforehand if you need 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.730
 are looking for cozy and out for it 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.969
 a house for an affordable price then 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.070
 I she is really wearing is place and we 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.320
 So here are scarce and stuff and so 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.690
 bought and I will tell me what what 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.850
 There are some things that we do 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.199
 that will be the fox that we 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.390
 already had at home 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.170
 but that they tell and yes that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.170
 speed up the start 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.640
 I think there is bed the most 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.930
 is present in every bedroom and dances 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.760
 and the first thing that we are going to tackle 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.830
 because your bed has overpressure and the cushions 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.580
 Also within are making a really 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.580
 big difference 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.679
 look it seems to him once more 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.749
 choose warmer in the fall school 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.250
 colors and brown tones 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:29.929
 but for example, once had hedges 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.710
 also make it a lot warmer immediately 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.710
 more atmospheric 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.450
 and if you want to do it all right 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.350
 you have to choose to put a plate down 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.759
 to lay 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.759
 and this immediately makes it complete 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.850
 something else that completely takes up the space 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.470
 gets his natural candles and I can 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.120
 you choose to keep it simple 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.280
 but it may be a bit of fun 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.350
 as we do here we start with 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.060
 choose a silver bowl then 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.380
 a few nice candles from we have 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.790
 for this 3 different colors and 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.620
 sizes selected 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.930
 add some atmosphere and we have it 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.540
 opted for an app image 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.890
 pine cones and cinnamon sticks too 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.899
 again about great fucking 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.010
 finally how nice it is to ignite 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.010
 and then you are all set 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.790
 nice about tickets that you are really infinite 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.049
 can mix and match 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.540
 here you have everything 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.519
 different tea light holders ordinary 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.799
 candles but also a lantern one 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.060
 scented candle and so you can have a lot of fun 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.920
 combine yourself 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.750
 you can of course just literally 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.200
 bring Christmas into your home with these letters 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.200
 to put down 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.129
 the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.500
 a nice photo can also be very nice 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.090
 these are from ikea but you can 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.140
 for example also just yourself from tumblr 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.420
 or the like 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.420
 print beautiful pictures and hang them up 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.319
 this is already the last tip and it is 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.510
 very simple yet effective, you close 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.370
 buy a favorite quote on a leaf 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.060
 liked a list and put it somewhere 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.060
 in your room 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.200
 And don't be afraid of being creative 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.200
 to be 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.459
 So 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.570
