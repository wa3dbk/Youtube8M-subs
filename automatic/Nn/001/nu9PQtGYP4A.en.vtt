00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
like they did so now I started my second

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.750 
like they did so now I started my second
placement<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> surgical<00:01:11.070> assessment

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.780 
placement I'm on a surgical assessment
unit<00:01:11.880> but<00:01:12.869> because<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.920> way<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> NHS<00:01:14.549> is

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
unit but because of the way the NHS is

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.399 
unit but because of the way the NHS is
it<00:01:15.000> hardly<00:01:15.240> ever<00:01:15.360> gets<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> run<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> surgical

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
it hardly ever gets to run as a surgical

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.570 
it hardly ever gets to run as a surgical
assessment<00:01:16.830> unit<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.549> basically<00:01:18.680> most<00:01:19.680> it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
assessment unit it's basically most it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.710 
assessment unit it's basically most it

basically comes everything like

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.249 
basically comes everything like
orthopedic<00:01:22.020> patients<00:01:23.450> medical<00:01:24.450> patients

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259

orthopedic patients medical patients
surgical<00:01:25.770> patients<00:01:27.470> trauma<00:01:28.470> patients<00:01:29.460> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
surgical patients trauma patients it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.380 
surgical patients trauma patients it
covers<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> lot<00:01:31.159> it's<00:01:32.159> very<00:01:32.430> interesting<00:01:33.090> it's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
covers a lot it's very interesting it's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.819 
covers a lot it's very interesting it's
very<00:01:33.780> different<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.110> my<00:01:34.200> last<00:01:34.350> word<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
very different to my last word it's a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.460 
very different to my last word it's a
lot<00:01:34.950> smaller<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.909> there's<00:01:36.509> more<00:01:36.659> staff<00:01:37.020> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
lot smaller so there's more staff to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.520 
lot smaller so there's more staff to
each<00:01:37.770> patient<00:01:38.369> which<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.640> great<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.530> really

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
each patient which is great I really

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.929 
each patient which is great I really
enjoyed<00:01:40.770> my<00:01:40.890> last<00:01:41.040> placement<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.729> one's

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
enjoyed my last placement but this one's

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.410 
enjoyed my last placement but this one's
more<00:01:42.439> is<00:01:43.439> more<00:01:44.280> specialized<00:01:44.880> whereas<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
more is more specialized whereas the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.780 
more is more specialized whereas the
last<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:45.840> was<00:01:45.960> chronically<00:01:46.770> ill<00:01:47.009> patients

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
last one was chronically ill patients

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
a couple of them but this is more

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.440 
a couple of them but this is more
patients<00:01:53.700> coming<00:01:53.850> back<00:01:54.000> from<00:01:54.119> surgery
