00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:13.589
 hello let's reduce a shoulder of elexalde lamb 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.650
 we have asked that you presented it to us 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.990
 because in this way we are going to support her 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.310
 put better in the trunk 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.949
 we're going to make it to the pot and not in the oven 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.640
 The ingredients that we will use are the following lemon 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.820
 laurean 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.510
 Pepper 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.310
 Health 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.810
 grated onion 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.860
 each one of 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.750
 and red wine 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.519
 half an hour before cooking them such an entity yesterday that is to put it 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.559
 what to marinate with a while 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.190
 Health 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.950
 lemon and lauren 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.950
 let's start doing it 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.550
 we pepper 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.710
 We put it quite stable because then when we put the face was which is 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.920
 they come off 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 so we are also going to the president 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010
 we add the lemon 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.330
 and we put the bay leaves 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.850
 well short distance 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 so that I go taking samples I remember 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.170
 this 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.570
 we let it marinate 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.360
 well, half an hour 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.650
 then let's start to cry 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.219
 with the oil that is hot 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.839
 all this in order to generate 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.159
 that's pretty good costa rica 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.259
 well I'm up to the tablets p 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:44.289
 if it goes beyond 10 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.079
 the onion 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.849
 is hot the ceoe is already affecting the end you get to take 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.029
 alcohol 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.029
 you have to take care that you do not have 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.759
 well that already looks pretty good 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.689
 however, it is still missing 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.689
 a little bit more of the sentence below 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.259
 we add the wine 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.480
 and let it evaporate anyway I'm going to put a little more fire 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.399
 to accelerate a little 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.659
 the wine has evaporated and now we are going to fulfill it 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:45.249
 pollan sin 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.099
 and she's practically Indian speaking all the work she had to give 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.969
 now it's a matter of what's going on, it has to be taking an hour 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.919
 and after an hour we will not let you reduce 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.679
 good one hour has already elapsed and I imagine that this will be tender we are going to 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:13.679
 see him 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.909
 let's click the balloon 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.459
 the needle in almost no difficulty 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.120
 the rustic in a casserole makes the meat they look very mellow 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.319
 then also the advantage is that this type of eroski there is nothing any 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.319
 work once you put it in the trunk you have to wait for the time 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.069
 and we'll take it out the streets 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.099
 and let it reduce the sauce and if it will be ready 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:55.129
 well this was already finished we have reduced the sauce you see that it has been 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.360
 very specific 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.979
 and then I took advantage that they had brussels sprouts will serve without that 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.270
 place to decorate 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.849
 Thus 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.849
 we put the sauce on top 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:20.529
 of this is the caramelized onion 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.709
 I hope you like good food
