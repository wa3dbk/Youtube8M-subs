00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
inside it was actually wearing a little

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.920 
inside it was actually wearing a little
bit<00:01:11.430> too<00:01:11.610> much<00:01:11.880> more<00:01:12.240> than<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> would

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
bit too much more than what I would

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.050 
bit too much more than what I would
expect<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.800> an<00:01:14.070> item<00:01:14.400> that's<00:01:14.430> under<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> year

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
expect for an item that's under a year

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.170 
expect for an item that's under a year
old<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:16.530> use<00:01:16.980> the<00:01:17.130> piece<00:01:17.310> every<00:01:17.700> day<00:01:17.940> I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
old I do use the piece every day I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.850 
old I do use the piece every day I
should<00:01:18.300> expect<00:01:18.960> some<00:01:19.110> wear<00:01:19.440> and<00:01:19.470> tear<00:01:19.680> but

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
should expect some wear and tear but

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.760 
should expect some wear and tear but
obviously<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.940> just<00:01:21.600> wasn't<00:01:22.020> quite<00:01:22.260> how<00:01:22.740> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
obviously it just wasn't quite how it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.040 
obviously it just wasn't quite how it
should<00:01:23.130> well<00:01:23.310> how<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.550> would<00:01:24.150> expect<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.750> piece

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
should well how I would expect the piece

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.330 
should well how I would expect the piece
to<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.320> especially<00:01:25.590> when<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.950> pay<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> lot<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to be especially when you pay a lot of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.060 
to be especially when you pay a lot of
money<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.670> these<00:01:26.790> things<00:01:27.230> so<00:01:28.230> basically<00:01:28.890> I

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
money for these things so basically I

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.580 
money for these things so basically I
took<00:01:29.190> it<00:01:29.550> into<00:01:29.670> Manchester<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.720> my<00:01:31.350> sales

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and so that made me quite worried to be

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.229 
and so that made me quite worried to be
honest<00:02:43.170> because<00:02:43.349> move<00:02:44.069> some<00:02:44.340> pieces<00:02:44.549> we<00:02:45.090> all

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239

know and the well known for all being

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.819 
know and the well known for all being
exactly<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.450> same<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:49.319> when<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.590> one<00:02:49.799> was

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
exactly the same so when this one was

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.949 
exactly the same so when this one was
different<00:02:50.099> it<00:02:50.730> really<00:02:51.180> really<00:02:51.359> worried<00:02:51.780> me

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
different it really really worried me

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.050

also<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.099> addition<00:02:54.769> when<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:55.799> open<00:02:56.159> it<00:02:56.250> up<00:02:56.489> got<00:02:57.030> a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
also in addition when I open it up got a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.960 
also in addition when I open it up got a
key<00:02:57.299> out<00:02:57.389> of<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.510> way<00:02:57.659> it's<00:02:58.530> quite<00:02:58.739> buggy<00:02:58.970> you

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.470 
can see that and my old piece really
wasn't<00:03:04.019> as<00:03:04.139> bad<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:05.159> I<00:03:05.730> was<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.239> little

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.830 
issue is mine it really is okay and I'm
not<00:05:41.950> worried<00:05:42.220> about<00:05:42.310> it<00:05:42.490> now<00:05:42.880> because<00:05:43.450> I<00:05:43.479> can

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
not worried about it now because I can

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.840 
not worried about it now because I can
clearly<00:05:44.260> see<00:05:44.680> that<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.190> many<00:05:45.370> other<00:05:45.640> pieces

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
clearly see that so many other pieces

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.800 
clearly see that so many other pieces
are<00:05:46.390> just<00:05:47.169> the<00:05:47.530> same<00:05:48.030> another<00:05:49.030> good<00:05:49.210> reason<00:05:49.450> of

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
are just the same another good reason of

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.020 
are just the same another good reason of
me<00:05:49.990> keeping<00:05:50.350> this<00:05:50.560> is<00:05:50.860> because<00:05:51.490> for<00:05:51.910> me

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
me keeping this is because for me

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.620 
me keeping this is because for me
personally<00:05:52.440> if<00:05:53.440> it<00:05:54.370> turns<00:05:54.700> out<00:05:54.880> that<00:05:54.940> Lobaton

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
personally if it turns out that Lobaton

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.379 
personally if it turns out that Lobaton
have<00:05:55.840> done<00:05:56.020> it<00:05:56.169> for<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.590> reason<00:05:57.039> and<00:05:57.160> it<00:05:57.940> isn't

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
have done it for a reason and it isn't

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.210 
have done it for a reason and it isn't
that<00:05:58.539> good<00:05:58.750> of<00:05:58.780> a<00:05:58.930> reason<00:05:59.350> and<00:05:59.530> it<00:05:59.680> it<00:05:59.919> does

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
that good of a reason and it it does

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.610 
that good of a reason and it it does
cause<00:06:00.490> some<00:06:00.729> other<00:06:00.880> issue<00:06:01.090> I<00:06:01.510> use<00:06:02.229> this<00:06:02.410> thing

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
cause some other issue I use this thing

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.830 
cause some other issue I use this thing
every<00:06:03.100> single<00:06:03.220> day<00:06:03.580> if<00:06:04.030> there's<00:06:04.570> going<00:06:04.720> to<00:06:04.810> be

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
every single day if there's going to be

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.080
