00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:13.370
 hello my name is George 2 chuk and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:17.279
 these are my top five games of 2013 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.250
 in fifth place I have settled 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.859
 starcraft's best strategy of the year 2 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.600
 hour to do starcraft I like 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.570
 a few things first here 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.279
 great single player who don't 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.340
 remind here these here all banal 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.030
 strategy 90 need something to go take 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.160
 raise bring to build a building 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.079
 shake the base and only but not the whole 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.890
 single mode starcraft charts for 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.590
 a layer built on various by evil and 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.149
 puzzles if you can call it that 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.510
 which simply requires a special approach 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.899
 player to this topic is also in the game 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.739
 temptation lovers 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.600
 compete with other players 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.600
 will find a great 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.180
 balanced multiplayer 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.489
 sofa mode only can alone 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.520
 kick ass to other opponents but also in 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.100
 friend companies from luptsevat those 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.770
 two guys from america who decided 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.150
 prove that they are better than you in general 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.720
 my opinion is the best competitive 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.159
 A game with a great solo company storyline 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.310
 which will end 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.310
 next and maybe in 2016 i 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.400
 the fourth place of my top is located 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.880
 exciting interactive story gown 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.700
 home do what i fell in love with this game 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.570
 not immediately and not immediately understood all of her 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 charms 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.460
 but it is worth noting that she is very 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.000
 atmospheric 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.250
 dark mysterious and 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.800
 It seemed to me that its passage 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.940
 now here's here now that's something 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.820
 something will happen and not ok but 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.400
 as it seemed quite ordinary very 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.680
 interesting story in the course of which I 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.229
 constantly whipping something of your whale 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.830
 fantasy trying to win and what will happen 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.240
 then 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:15.500
 and I will not say that she is shocking you with something 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.500
 or will open for you something new but it 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.610
 very very unusual and interesting 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.370
 general approach 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.090
 to the narrative process and i'm for 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.390
 I love this race 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.489
 the third place of my top is located 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.300
 a great game called the 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.630
 stanley parable honestly i dont 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.390
 I know how much I played it after the first 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.600
 run on i can tell exactly u the game 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.049
 there is one can 2 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.590
 maybe dozens of all the different possible 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.250
 plots that are interestingly interesting 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.890
 to study 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.180
 the fact is that the heroes of stanley parable 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.810
 it is you yourself and your own 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.769
 by hands 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.140
 make history where to go where 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.970
 see where to fall and at the same time you 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.930
 constantly have to interact with 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.160
 the narrator 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.680
 and as a result you can play it 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.780
 as much time as you want 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.780
 basically can go on as long 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.790
 until you get this voice from above and 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.799
 you do not say yet 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.579
 the second place of my personal top 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:38.230
 located this loftus brothers game 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:40.970
 Sans very touching kind and 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.540
 for real 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.480
 interesting game in which there is a great 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.420
 plot wonderful gameplay absolute 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:55.130
 non-repetitive next game stages 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.950
 here everything is very cool your heroes are they 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.210
 don't have any there 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.070
 superpowers as usual do 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.430
 the guys 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.070
 other stuff in general this story is about 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.820
 two ordinary people can even say 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.430
 about 3 because 3 is you man 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.630
 who manages these brothers 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:21.920
 helps them you feel full 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:29.480
 party to all that is happening and the end 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:36.320
 games i admit to you i know i'm just i'm from 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:39.050
 I will pay the first place of my top best 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.110
 games located dota 2 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.169
 and this though wait yes here at all 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.400
 bioshock okay, you got me 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:53.560
 before the history of booker david and elizabeth 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.180
 this is the most important event for me 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.520
 games in 2013 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.880
 you can talk for a long time there about 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.630
 doubtful joker and all sorts of such 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.040
 things on you can say for sure first 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.650
 it is very beautiful 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.780
 amazing in all respects a game of 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.690
 which first is present huge 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.650
 number of possibilities including from 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:25.310
 combat point of view and secondly here 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.130
 so cool plot that i'm over 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.790
 generally precipitated I began to search 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:36.080
 phone and ask who who played this 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:39.620
 Well, I learned the game later, but I 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.540
 it was very directly necessary with somebody 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.490
 talk about how everything is 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.110
 is over 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.260
 At first, of course, I thought that everything 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.740
 will be somewhat banal but then ken 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.610
 Levin know me 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:59.180
 right so here is shorter than the muzzle table 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.180
 I give this game first place
