spawn<00:00:30.570> trapping<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.800> actually<00:00:32.009> playing

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
spawn trapping and I'm actually playing

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.459 
spawn trapping and I'm actually playing
completely<00:00:32.669> solo<00:00:33.270> which<00:00:33.510> makes<00:00:33.930> us<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.290> little

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
completely solo which makes us a little

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.709 
completely solo which makes us a little
bit<00:00:34.680> more<00:00:34.890> crazy<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.850> usually<00:00:36.510> if<00:00:36.600> your

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
bit more crazy because usually if your

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.119 
bit more crazy because usually if your
spawn<00:00:36.989> trapping<00:00:37.260> you're<00:00:37.590> always<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.100> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
up under 100 seconds which would be like

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.130 
up under 100 seconds which would be like
a<00:01:14.100> 1<00:01:14.310> minute<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.670> 40<00:01:15.000> seconds<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.689> 13
