00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
first area you come to in the game I

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.389 
first area you come to in the game I
came<00:00:45.870> down<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.590> bit<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.039> where<00:00:47.250> I'm

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
came down this bit here where I'm

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.799 
came down this bit here where I'm
standing<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:49.219> walked<00:00:50.219> around<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
standing and walked around a bit and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.540 
standing and walked around a bit and
it's<00:00:52.140> very<00:00:52.469> difficult<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.430> you're

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
it's very difficult to see what you're

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.510 
it's very difficult to see what you're
looking<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:55.520> it's

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
looking at it's all just really it's

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.779 
looking at it's all just really it's
horrible<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.140> these<00:00:58.649> textures<00:00:59.219> are<00:00:59.520> so

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
horrible it's all these textures are so

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.759 
horrible it's all these textures are so
busy<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:03.170> indistinct<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> can't

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
busy and indistinct that you can't

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.050 
busy and indistinct that you can't
actually<00:01:04.979> tell<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.460> you're<00:01:05.610> looking<00:01:05.939> at

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
actually tell what you're looking at

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.200 
actually tell what you're looking at
it's<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.540> mess<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> anyway<00:01:08.670> I'm<00:01:08.909> looking

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it's just a mess so anyway I'm looking

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.660 
it's just a mess so anyway I'm looking
around<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.290> guess<00:01:10.950> I've<00:01:11.159> got<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.610> up

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
around and I guess I've got to get up

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.780 
around and I guess I've got to get up
there<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.710> all<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.979> tearing<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
there you go all that tearing and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.609 
there you go all that tearing and
whatnot<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> seams<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> polygons

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
whatnot with the seams on the polygons

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.190 
whatnot with the seams on the polygons
again<00:01:16.920> which<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.250> pretty<00:01:17.430> ugly

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
again which is pretty ugly

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.499 
again which is pretty ugly
I<00:01:19.430> guess<00:01:20.430> I've<00:01:20.640> gotta<00:01:20.850> get<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.150> it's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
I guess I've gotta get up there it's

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.690 
I guess I've gotta get up there it's
really<00:01:21.960> hard<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.530> how<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.950> meant<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> do

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
really hard to see how you meant to do

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.420 
really hard to see how you meant to do
that<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.020> also<00:01:25.250> indistinct<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
that because it is also indistinct and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.690 
that because it is also indistinct and
just<00:01:26.729> dirty<00:01:27.630> looking<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.860> can't<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.369> see

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
just dirty looking you can't really see

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.280 
just dirty looking you can't really see
where<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.030> meant<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:31.310> now<00:01:32.780> there<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.960> up

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
where you meant to go now there is up

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.830 
where you meant to go now there is up
here<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:35.040> front<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.610> Lara<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.270> Ledge<00:01:38.570> only<00:01:39.570> you

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
here in front of Lara a Ledge only you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.179 
here in front of Lara a Ledge only you
can't<00:01:40.079> get<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.560> from<00:01:40.650> where<00:01:40.860> I'm<00:01:40.890> standing

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
can't get to it from where I'm standing

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.170 
can't get to it from where I'm standing
you<00:01:42.799> have<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.130> go<00:01:44.460> around<00:01:45.030> here<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:47.430> there's<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
you have to go around here but there's a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.080 
you have to go around here but there's a
tiger<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.899> there<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.350> he<00:01:49.740> came<00:01:50.090> sauntering

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
tiger just there that he came sauntering

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.569 
tiger just there that he came sauntering
down<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.689> shot<00:01:52.079> him<00:01:52.259> which<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.310> really

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
down and I shot him which is not really

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.280 
down and I shot him which is not really
very<00:01:53.909> responsible<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.869> terms<00:01:54.930> of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
very responsible in terms of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.990 
very responsible in terms of
conservation<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> heck<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.670> yes<00:01:59.880> I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
conservation but what the heck so yes I

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.789 
conservation but what the heck so yes I
found<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.420> purely<00:02:00.750> by<00:02:00.869> chance<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.350> fell<00:02:01.649> in

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
found this purely by chance I fell in

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.410 
found this purely by chance I fell in
the<00:02:01.860> water<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.399> was<00:02:02.490> trying<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> walk<00:02:02.969> one<00:02:03.210> way

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the water I was trying to walk one way

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.289 
the water I was trying to walk one way
and<00:02:03.570> did<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> usual<00:02:03.960> hour<00:02:04.320> crafting<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.310> went

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and did the usual hour crafting and went

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.700 
and did the usual hour crafting and went
completely<00:02:06.570> somewhere<00:02:07.079> other<00:02:07.290> than<00:02:07.409> where<00:02:07.560> I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
completely somewhere other than where I

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.540 
completely somewhere other than where I
was<00:02:07.829> trying<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.250> go

going to find out if this game is any

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.690 
going to find out if this game is any
good<00:03:14.660> or<00:03:14.780> not<00:03:14.810> because<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.290> can't<00:03:15.650> get<00:03:15.950> off<00:03:16.130> this

I<00:03:17.000> mean<00:03:17.269> if<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.690> know<00:03:18.620> one<00:03:18.920> or<00:03:19.040> two<00:03:19.070> people<00:03:19.370> said

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
I mean if I know one or two people said

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.360 
I mean if I know one or two people said
on<00:03:19.910> my<00:03:20.120> Tomb<00:03:20.540> Raider<00:03:20.570> at<00:03:21.079> one<00:03:21.320> video<00:03:21.920> that<00:03:21.950> they

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
on my Tomb Raider at one video that they

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.890 
on my Tomb Raider at one video that they
never<00:03:22.549> got<00:03:22.760> off<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:22.910> first<00:03:23.239> level<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.750> I'm

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
never got off the first level and I'm

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.150 
never got off the first level and I'm
wondering<00:03:24.109> actually<00:03:24.380> if<00:03:24.590> they<00:03:24.739> were<00:03:24.890> playing

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
wondering actually if they were playing

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.520 
wondering actually if they were playing
Tomb<00:03:25.459> Raider<00:03:25.549> 2<00:03:25.970> because<00:03:26.570> I<00:03:26.780> can<00:03:27.320> totally

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
understand how a person could not get

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.920 
understand how a person could not get
off<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:29.989> this<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:33.880> mean<00:03:34.880> this<00:03:35.209> game<00:03:35.420> had<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:35.690> good
