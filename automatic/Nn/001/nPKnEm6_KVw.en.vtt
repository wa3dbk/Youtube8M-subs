this<00:01:10.350> more<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> spray<00:01:11.040> pattern<00:01:11.250> would

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
this more of the spray pattern would

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.320 
this more of the spray pattern would
evening<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:11.970> where<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.240> actually

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
evening to see where it's actually

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.600 
evening to see where it's actually
blocked<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.140> gray<00:01:13.490> padding<00:01:14.490> around

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
blocked it's like a gray padding around

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.399 
blocked it's like a gray padding around
the<00:01:14.909> black<00:01:15.090> scale<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.840> shows<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.200> pretty

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the black scale so it shows up pretty

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.890 
the black scale so it shows up pretty
well<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:19.049> skills<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:19.439> pretty<00:01:19.500> large<00:01:19.890> too<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
well the skills are pretty large too I

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.789 
well the skills are pretty large too I
think<00:01:21.900> he<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.020> he<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.950> used<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.250> people

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
think he just he just so used to people

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.469 
think he just he just so used to people
he's<00:01:25.799> assimilated<00:01:26.490> into<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> human<00:01:26.909> race<00:01:27.210> now

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
he's assimilated into the human race now

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.350 
he's assimilated into the human race now
so<00:01:28.310> there's<00:01:29.310> thing<00:01:29.490> he<00:01:29.579> does<00:01:29.759> too<00:01:29.970> sometimes

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
so there's thing he does too sometimes

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.730 
so there's thing he does too sometimes
we<00:01:30.450> laugh<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.810> he'll<00:01:30.990> sit<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.290> there<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.560> look
