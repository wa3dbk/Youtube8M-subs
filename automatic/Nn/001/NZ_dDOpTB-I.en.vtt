00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.149 
containers because it's great drainage
and<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.720> great<00:01:37.020> for<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> roots<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.040> have

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
and it's great for the roots to have

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.800 
and it's great for the roots to have
that<00:01:38.340> air<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.790> nature<00:01:39.119> that's<00:01:39.270> how<00:01:39.450> they<00:01:39.600> grow

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
that air in nature that's how they grow

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.289 
that air in nature that's how they grow
so<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> always<00:01:40.799> put<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.369> lot<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> layer<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.180> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
so I always put a lot a layer of that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:51.810 
so I always put a lot a layer of that
over<00:01:42.500> my<00:01:43.500> bottles

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.910 

so<00:01:52.820> my<00:01:52.939> goal<00:01:53.180> is<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.780> use<00:01:54.049> all<00:01:54.290> these<00:01:54.409> recycled

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
so my goal is to use all these recycled

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.859 
so my goal is to use all these recycled
materials<00:01:55.430> because<00:01:55.759> really<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.329> roots<00:01:56.570> can

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
materials because really the roots can

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.260 
materials because really the roots can
even<00:01:57.200> grow<00:01:57.380> into<00:01:57.770> that<00:01:57.799> but<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:58.640> want<00:01:58.880> good<00:01:59.030> soil

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
even grow into that but I want good soil

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.300 
even grow into that but I want good soil
on<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.509> top<00:01:59.689> so<00:02:00.320> it's<00:02:00.439> really<00:02:00.619> easy<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.130> use

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
on the top so it's really easy to use

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.920 
on the top so it's really easy to use
recycled<00:02:01.549> materials<00:02:02.240> in<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.450> bottom<00:02:02.720> of<00:02:02.840> your

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
recycled materials in the bottom of your

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.929 
recycled materials in the bottom of your
containers<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:03.590> can<00:02:03.619> use<00:02:03.979> moss<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.579> can<00:02:04.759> use

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
containers you can use moss you can use

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.460 
containers you can use moss you can use
sticks<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.390> can<00:02:05.539> use<00:02:05.659> stones<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.229> can<00:02:06.259> use

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
sticks you can use stones you can use

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.889 
sticks you can use stones you can use
gravel<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.520> can<00:02:07.670> use<00:02:07.820> metal<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.599> can<00:02:08.750> use

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
gravel you can use metal you can use

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.550 
gravel you can use metal you can use
pretty<00:02:09.140> much<00:02:09.289> anything<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:11.560> garbage

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
pretty much anything that is garbage

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.890 
pretty much anything that is garbage
that<00:02:13.069> can<00:02:13.400> drain<00:02:13.700> well<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.569> great<00:02:14.599> way

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
that can drain well and it's a great way

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.140 
that can drain well and it's a great way
to<00:02:14.930> recycle<00:02:15.370> next<00:02:16.370> we'll<00:02:16.489> talk<00:02:16.610> about<00:02:16.880> how<00:02:17.090> to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
to recycle next we'll talk about how to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.650 
to recycle next we'll talk about how to
select<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.630> soil<00:02:17.900> for<00:02:18.170> your<00:02:18.230> planters
