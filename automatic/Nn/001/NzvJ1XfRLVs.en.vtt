ways and so I really wanted to get one
but<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> didn't<00:01:02.879> want<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> buy<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> Mac<00:01:03.480> one

but I didn't want to buy the Mac one

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.240 
but I didn't want to buy the Mac one
because<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.229> didn't<00:01:04.680> think<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.949> was<00:01:05.010> worth

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
because I just didn't think it was worth

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.090 
because I just didn't think it was worth
like<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> $30.00<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:07.049> such<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> small<00:01:07.799> brush

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
like the $30.00 for such a small brush

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.410 
like the $30.00 for such a small brush
that<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.340> wasn't<00:01:08.549> sure<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.210> gonna

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that I wasn't sure if I was really gonna

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.870 
that I wasn't sure if I was really gonna
use<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> lot<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.650> thought<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> Sigma

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
use a lot so I thought that the Sigma

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.210 
use a lot so I thought that the Sigma
one<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:13.080> great<00:01:13.409> alternative<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
one was a really great alternative to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.850 
one was a really great alternative to
having<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.880> spend<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.450> thirty<00:01:15.990> dollars<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
having to spend like thirty dollars on a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.880 
having to spend like thirty dollars on a
brush<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.140> believe<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.740> was

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
brush and I believe this one was

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.429 
brush and I believe this one was
fourteen<00:01:20.580> dollars<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.110> far<00:01:22.320> I've<00:01:22.409> been

trying<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> find<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.600> ideal<00:01:58.170> application

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
trying to find my ideal application

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.770 
trying to find my ideal application
method<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> thought<00:02:00.630> maybe

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
method for it and so I thought maybe

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.430 
method for it and so I thought maybe
this<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.439> something<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.040> like

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
this would be something I like

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.250 
this would be something I like
more<00:02:02.620> light<00:02:02.890> coverage<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.850> as<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.390> know<00:02:04.600> duo

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
more light coverage and as you know duo

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.900 
more light coverage and as you know duo
fiber<00:02:05.560> brushes<00:02:05.920> kind<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.340> give<00:02:06.460> you<00:02:06.550> like<00:02:06.760> a

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
fiber brushes kind of give you like a

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.870 
fiber brushes kind of give you like a
little<00:02:07.090> bit<00:02:07.300> more<00:02:07.510> of<00:02:07.660> a<00:02:07.810> light<00:02:08.590> coverage<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:09.760> I

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
little bit more of a light coverage so I

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.190 
little bit more of a light coverage so I
thought<00:02:10.150> that<00:02:10.300> this<00:02:10.390> would<00:02:10.540> be<00:02:10.600> good<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.990> kind

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
thought that this would be good to kind

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.430 
thought that this would be good to kind
of<00:02:11.260> get<00:02:11.610> more<00:02:12.610> precise<00:02:13.060> in<00:02:13.300> areas<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.900> face

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
of get more precise in areas of the face

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.830 
of get more precise in areas of the face
however<00:02:15.280> after<00:02:15.550> trying<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.330> out<00:02:16.570> of

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
however after trying this out of

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.070 
however after trying this out of
surprised<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:18.160> find<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.240> didn't<00:02:19.930> really

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
surprised to find that I didn't really

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.560 
surprised to find that I didn't really
enjoy<00:02:20.290> using<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.220> brush<00:02:21.550> as<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:21.850> foundation

face so quickly it's just it's totally a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.830 
face so quickly it's just it's totally a
no-brainer<00:02:41.050> but<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.010> felt<00:02:42.310> with<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.640> 188<00:02:43.390> I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
no-brainer but I felt with the 188 I

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.020 
no-brainer but I felt with the 188 I
just<00:02:44.170> kept<00:02:44.380> blending<00:02:45.010> blending<00:02:45.250> blending<00:02:45.460> is

just kept blending blending blending is

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.270 
just kept blending blending blending is
just<00:02:46.300> taking<00:02:46.600> forever<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:47.320> just<00:02:47.830> really<00:02:48.100> had<00:02:48.250> to

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
just taking forever I just really had to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.010 
just taking forever I just really had to
keep<00:02:48.490> getting<00:02:48.580> more<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.000> more<00:02:49.150> product<00:02:49.690> and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
keep getting more and more product and

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.810 
keep getting more and more product and
it<00:02:50.110> just<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.800> doesn't<00:02:51.010> cover<00:02:51.340> enough<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.730> the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
it just it doesn't cover enough of the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.910 
it just it doesn't cover enough of the
face<00:02:52.030> like<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.750> didn't<00:02:53.110> really<00:02:53.290> feel<00:02:53.590> like<00:02:53.650> I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
face like I didn't really feel like I

needed<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.760> be<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:55.000> precise<00:02:55.420> because<00:02:55.990> it

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
needed it to be that precise because it

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.080 
needed it to be that precise because it
is<00:02:56.380> such<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> light<00:02:56.920> application<00:02:57.070> method<00:02:57.910> it's

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
is such a light application method it's

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.080 
is such a light application method it's
not<00:02:58.270> like<00:02:58.420> I'm<00:02:58.570> covering<00:02:58.930> up<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.170> ton<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.380> stuff

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
for a while but really when you think

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.759 
for a while but really when you think
about<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.670> it's<00:03:34.150> just<00:03:34.239> covering<00:03:34.780> such<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.320> large

enough for blush application it was okay

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.310 
enough for blush application it was okay
for<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.390> while<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.780> know<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:40.900> was<00:03:41.019> just<00:03:41.170> really

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
shedding but nothing really out of the

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.399 
shedding but nothing really out of the
ordinary<00:05:37.190> I<00:05:37.909> think<00:05:38.419> that's<00:05:38.599> just<00:05:38.810> kind<00:05:39.229> of<00:05:39.289> to

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
ordinary I think that's just kind of to

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.379 
ordinary I think that's just kind of to
be<00:05:39.500> expected<00:05:39.530> especially<00:05:40.430> when<00:05:41.030> you're<00:05:41.150> using

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
be expected especially when you're using

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.240 
be expected especially when you're using
clean<00:05:41.780> products<00:05:42.289> because<00:05:42.590> some<00:05:43.099> of<00:05:43.130> the

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
clean products because some of the

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.550 
clean products because some of the
bristles<00:05:43.789> tend<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.180> get<00:05:44.300> stuck<00:05:44.720> in<00:05:44.960> that<00:05:45.020> cream

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
bristles tend to get stuck in that cream

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.939 
bristles tend to get stuck in that cream
so<00:05:46.539> yeah<00:05:47.539> my<00:05:47.840> only<00:05:48.080> complaint<00:05:48.320> is<00:05:48.530> really<00:05:48.830> the

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
so yeah my only complaint is really the

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.219 
so yeah my only complaint is really the
dye<00:05:49.159> that<00:05:49.460> I<00:05:49.490> saw<00:05:49.820> come<00:05:50.210> out<00:05:50.240> it's<00:05:50.990> sort<00:05:51.169> of

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
dye that I saw come out it's sort of

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.290 
dye that I saw come out it's sort of
tinted<00:05:51.710> some<00:05:51.919> of<00:05:52.039> the<00:05:52.130> bristles<00:05:52.400> like<00:05:53.240> a

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
tinted some of the bristles like a

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.540 
tinted some of the bristles like a
purplish<00:05:53.810> color<00:05:53.840> at<00:05:54.320> first<00:05:54.590> so<00:05:55.159> that<00:05:55.280> I<00:05:55.340> had<00:05:55.460> to

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
purplish color at first so that I had to

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.399 
purplish color at first so that I had to
rewash<00:05:55.880> it<00:05:56.060> again<00:05:56.270> to<00:05:56.449> get<00:05:56.539> the<00:05:56.659> dye<00:05:56.870> out<00:05:56.900> and

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
rewash it again to get the dye out and

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.230 
rewash it again to get the dye out and
so<00:05:57.860> I<00:05:57.889> guess<00:05:58.190> if<00:05:58.460> you're<00:05:58.610> gonna<00:05:58.729> consider

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
so I guess if you're gonna consider

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.480 
so I guess if you're gonna consider
