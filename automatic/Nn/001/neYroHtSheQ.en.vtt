alright one of the most common problems

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.730 
alright one of the most common problems
that<00:00:03.629> these<00:00:03.959> little<00:00:04.259> motors<00:00:04.470> have<00:00:06.049> is<00:00:07.049> that

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
that these little motors have is that

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.080 
that these little motors have is that
they<00:00:07.950> leak<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.389> oil<00:00:10.349> out<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.219> lower<00:00:11.700> unit

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
they leak the oil out of the lower unit

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.259 
they leak the oil out of the lower unit
the<00:00:12.480> lower<00:00:12.690> unit<00:00:12.960> runs<00:00:13.349> dry<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.940> breaks

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
the lower unit runs dry and it breaks

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.500 
the lower unit runs dry and it breaks
the<00:00:15.570> gear<00:00:15.870> or<00:00:16.199> both<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.100> gears<00:00:17.460> or<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.000> seizes

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the gear or both the gears or it seizes

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.230 
the gear or both the gears or it seizes
a<00:00:18.539> ship<00:00:19.039> many<00:00:20.039> times<00:00:20.430> these<00:00:20.760> little<00:00:21.060> lower

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
a ship many times these little lower

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.240 
a ship many times these little lower
units<00:00:21.720> are<00:00:21.900> found<00:00:22.199> these<00:00:22.470> motors<00:00:22.859> are<00:00:22.980> found

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
units are found these motors are found

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.000 
units are found these motors are found
in<00:00:23.490> good<00:00:23.760> condition<00:00:24.420> otherwise<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.680> the

stripped so what we're going to do here
is<00:00:33.680> show<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.309> how<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.550> check<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.180> oil<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
is show you how to check the oil and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.780 
is show you how to check the oil and
fill<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.250> needed<00:00:40.340> most<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.640> these

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
fill it if you needed most of these

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.139 
fill it if you needed most of these
engines<00:00:42.649> before<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.890> even<00:00:44.040> started<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.910> this

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
engines before I even started with this

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.150 
engines before I even started with this
and<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.469> motor<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:46.950> of

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and I just got this motor out of

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.510 
and I just got this motor out of
somebody's<00:00:47.850> garage<00:00:48.110> I<00:00:49.110> would<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.250> first

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
somebody's garage I would the first

thing I would do would be to check to me

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.100 
thing I would do would be to check to me
for<00:00:52.949> Iran<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.670> would<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.510> check<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> make

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
for Iran it would be to check to make

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.010 
for Iran it would be to check to make
sure<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:55.829> was<00:00:55.860> oil<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:57.030> these<00:00:57.390> lower

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
sure that there was oil in these lower

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.299 
sure that there was oil in these lower

recommendation<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.210> got<00:01:27.390> from<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
recommendation that we got from the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.510 
recommendation that we got from the
owners<00:01:27.960> manual<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.159> from<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
owners manual that we got from the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.330 
owners manual that we got from the
owner's<00:01:29.880> name<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:33.380> believe<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.680> at<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:35.070> point

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
owner's name I believe that at one point

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.719 
owner's name I believe that at one point
in<00:01:35.520> time<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.790> checked<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.930> filled<00:01:37.530> it

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
in time we checked this and filled it

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.260 
in time we checked this and filled it
but<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:39.030> was<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.450> long<00:01:40.140> ago<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.770> don't<00:01:40.890> remember

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
but it was so long ago I don't remember

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.190 
but it was so long ago I don't remember
so<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:44.640> first<00:01:44.939> thing<00:01:45.240> there<00:01:45.540> are<00:01:45.630> two<00:01:45.840> plugs

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
so the first thing there are two plugs

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.490 
so the first thing there are two plugs
there<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> vent<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.820> fill<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:49.110> first

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
there is a vent and a fill the first

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.370 
there is a vent and a fill the first
thing<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.729> pull<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> vent

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.260 

and<00:01:55.479> we<00:01:56.479> get<00:01:56.689> grease<00:01:57.140> running<00:01:57.590> or<00:01:57.920> oil<00:01:58.280> running

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
and we get grease running or oil running

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.780 
and we get grease running or oil running
out<00:01:59.600> it<00:01:59.840> looks<00:02:00.170> like<00:02:00.350> dirty<00:02:00.740> oil<00:02:01.100> but<00:02:01.610> it's

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
out it looks like dirty oil but it's

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.410 
out it looks like dirty oil but it's
full<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.299> oil<00:02:02.619> we<00:02:03.619> would<00:02:03.920> leave<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.090> vent<00:02:05.299> out

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
full of oil we would leave the vent out

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.080 
full of oil we would leave the vent out
the<00:02:08.420> other<00:02:08.539> side<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.140> motor<00:02:12.040> has<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.459> plug

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
the other side of the motor has a plug

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.630 
the other side of the motor has a plug
which<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:15.620> marked<00:02:16.280> fill<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.860> helps<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.459> you

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
which is marked fill and it helps if you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:28.180 
which is marked fill and it helps if you
use<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:21.080> right<00:02:21.350> size<00:02:21.680> screwdriver<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:28.010> that

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
use the right size screwdriver so that

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.630 
use the right size screwdriver so that
you<00:02:28.340> don't<00:02:28.550> bugger<00:02:28.940> up<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.300> threads<00:02:33.640> the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
you don't bugger up the threads the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.180 
you don't bugger up the threads the
lower<00:02:34.850> unit<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:35.450> filled<00:02:35.870> through<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:36.830> plug

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
lower unit is filled through this plug

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.250 
lower unit is filled through this plug
until<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:39.140> runs<00:02:39.380> out<00:02:39.739> of<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.690> vent<00:02:41.959> on<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
until it runs out of the vent on the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:51.479 
until it runs out of the vent on the
other<00:02:42.560> side<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:47.120> we<00:02:47.330> know<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.569> this<00:02:48.049> has<00:02:48.200> got

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:03:00.790 

oil<00:02:52.489> in<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.269> we<00:02:53.360> get<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.690> other<00:02:53.840> side

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.890 

there<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.610> can<00:03:01.640> see<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.120> running<00:03:02.450> out<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.630> lot

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
there you can see it running out a lot

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.180
