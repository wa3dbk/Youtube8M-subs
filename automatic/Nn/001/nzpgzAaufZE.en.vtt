grid line right here on the end then

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.010 
grid line right here on the end then
another<00:00:58.050> grid<00:00:58.559> line<00:00:58.800> I'm<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> come<00:00:59.670> in

another grid line I'm going to come in
one<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> half<00:01:01.469> inches<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.550> grid

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
line and then from this edge up here one

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.649 
line and then from this edge up here one

really neat thing using the Ray feature
similar<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.860> how<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.070> copied<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.820> fenders

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
similar to how we copied the fenders

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.550 
similar to how we copied the fenders
earlier<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> grab

selected<00:01:26.759> both<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.270> these<00:01:27.390> gridlines<00:01:27.770> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
selected both of these gridlines and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.440 
selected both of these gridlines and
what<00:01:29.070> I'm<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.729> hit<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> control

equally<00:01:48.420> these<00:01:48.750> gridlines<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:51.479> now<00:01:51.659> what

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
equally these gridlines and so now what

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.539 
equally these gridlines and so now what
I'll<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.200> I'll<00:01:52.470> go<00:01:52.619> ahead<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.950> draw<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> box

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
I'll do is I'll go ahead and draw a box

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.740 
I'll do is I'll go ahead and draw a box
right<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:54.710> on<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.950> grid<00:01:56.250> line<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.790> then

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
right here on this grid line and then

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.090 
right here on this grid line and then
I'm<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.200> put<00:01:58.380> three<00:01:58.590> inch<00:01:58.829> radius

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
I'm going to put three inch radius

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.130 
I'm going to put three inch radius
circles<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.030> here<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.509> need<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.810> put<00:02:00.990> some

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
circles on here so I need to put some

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.800 
circles on here so I need to put some
more<00:02:01.290> gridlines<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.909> I'll<00:02:03.060> go<00:02:03.329> three

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
more gridlines in here so I'll go three

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:12.780 
more gridlines in here so I'll go three
inches<00:02:04.200> all<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.469> way<00:02:04.590> around

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.890 

again<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:13.910> want<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.150> make<00:02:14.210> sure<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.720> you

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
again you want to make sure that you

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.680 
again you want to make sure that you
stay<00:02:16.870> within<00:02:17.870> your<00:02:18.490> right<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:20.120> same<00:02:20.360> plane

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
stay within your right the same plane

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.990 
stay within your right the same plane
and<00:02:21.500> I'll<00:02:21.590> do<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.830> circle<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.460> again<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.790> use

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
and I'll do a circle it again I use

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.110 
and I'll do a circle it again I use
Hunter<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.870> segment<00:02:24.590> circles<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.880> just

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
Hunter to segment circles that I just

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.810 
Hunter to segment circles that I just
like<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.630> makes<00:02:26.660> cleaner<00:02:27.170> circles<00:02:27.820> and

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
like it it makes cleaner circles and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.650 
like it it makes cleaner circles and
then<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.660> connect<00:02:30.820> these<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.120> outside<00:02:32.480> edge

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
then I connect these to the outside edge

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.320 
then I connect these to the outside edge
and<00:02:32.960> then<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.620> can<00:02:33.800> go<00:02:33.950> ahead<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.220> delete<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
and then I can go ahead and delete the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.460 
and then I can go ahead and delete the
parts<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.560> circle<00:02:37.070> I<00:02:37.100> don't<00:02:37.400> need<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.470> and

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
parts of the circle I don't need and and

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.130 
parts of the circle I don't need and and
these<00:02:39.830> outer<00:02:40.100> squares<00:02:40.660> now<00:02:41.660> some<00:02:41.990> of<00:02:42.020> my

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
these outer squares now some of my

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.320 
these outer squares now some of my
gridlines<00:02:42.860> will<00:02:43.130> delay<00:02:43.460> here<00:02:43.820> but<00:02:44.030> we<00:02:44.150> can

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
gridlines will delay here but we can

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.370 
gridlines will delay here but we can
still<00:02:44.540> copy<00:02:44.930> them<00:02:45.230> no<00:02:45.440> problem<00:02:46.660> okay<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.930> so

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
still copy them no problem okay and so

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.220 
still copy them no problem okay and so
what<00:02:48.590> I'll<00:02:48.709> do<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.100> I'll<00:02:49.250> swing<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:49.910> around

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
what I'll do is I'll swing this around

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.380 
what I'll do is I'll swing this around
to<00:02:51.230> square<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.980> straighten<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:52.610> up<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.030> it's

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
to square that straighten it up so it's

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.650 
to square that straighten it up so it's
easier<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.900> copy<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.440> Parts<00:02:54.740> I<00:02:54.860> need

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
easier to copy the Parts I need

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.240 
easier to copy the Parts I need
so<00:02:57.490> all<00:02:58.490> right<00:02:58.550> copy<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.270> circle<00:02:59.959> now<00:03:00.709> again

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
so all right copy that circle now again

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.350 
so all right copy that circle now again
using<00:03:01.550> that<00:03:01.700> same<00:03:02.440> copy<00:03:03.459> move<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.910> do<00:03:05.240> the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
using that same copy move you do the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.160 
using that same copy move you do the
move<00:03:05.540> hit<00:03:06.200> control<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:08.030> drag<00:03:08.270> it<00:03:08.450> over<00:03:08.540> place

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
move hit control and drag it over place

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.590 
move hit control and drag it over place
it<00:03:09.320> on<00:03:09.440> line<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.459> I'm<00:03:10.640> only<00:03:10.850> doing<00:03:11.209> one<00:03:11.390> at<00:03:11.540> a

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
it on line and I'm only doing one at a

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.090 
it on line and I'm only doing one at a
time<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:13.160> could<00:03:13.430> do<00:03:14.080> multiple<00:03:15.080> ones<00:03:15.680> there's

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
time you could do multiple ones there's

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.840 
time you could do multiple ones there's
different<00:03:17.030> ways<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.420> do<00:03:17.570> that<00:03:18.130> okay<00:03:19.130> now<00:03:19.670> what

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
different ways to do that okay now what

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.160 
different ways to do that okay now what
we're<00:03:20.000> going<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.269> do<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:22.209> just<00:03:23.209> delete<00:03:23.390> these

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
we're going to do is just delete these

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.130 
we're going to do is just delete these
so<00:03:24.620> I'm<00:03:25.090> open<00:03:26.090> up<00:03:26.209> these<00:03:26.360> holes<00:03:26.600> so<00:03:26.780> I'm<00:03:26.930> using

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
so I'm open up these holes so I'm using

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.500 
so I'm open up these holes so I'm using
the<00:03:27.350> push-pull<00:03:27.950> I'll<00:03:28.640> click<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:29.390> then

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
the push-pull I'll click on it and then

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.390 
the push-pull I'll click on it and then
I'll<00:03:29.630> actually<00:03:29.870> come<00:03:30.410> back<00:03:30.590> here<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.250> this

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
I'll actually come back here to this

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.759 
I'll actually come back here to this
back<00:03:31.730> edge<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.420> you'll<00:03:32.989> see<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.320> goes<00:03:33.530> away<00:03:35.769> so

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
back edge and you'll see it goes away so

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.259 
back edge and you'll see it goes away so
sometimes<00:03:37.340> it's<00:03:37.519> hard<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.790> get<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.060> right<00:03:38.090> on

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
sometimes it's hard to get it right on

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.550 
sometimes it's hard to get it right on
the<00:03:38.480> right<00:03:38.660> edge<00:03:38.900> if<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:41.050> have<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.080> hard<00:03:42.350> time

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
the right edge if you have a hard time

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.380 
the right edge if you have a hard time
but<00:03:42.739> you<00:03:42.890> get<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.160> back<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:43.670> end<00:03:43.880> just

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
but you get it back to the end just

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.720 
but you get it back to the end just
delete<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.930> parts<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.320> don't<00:03:45.500> need<00:03:45.680> now<00:03:46.459> what

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
delete the parts you don't need now what

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.340 
delete the parts you don't need now what
I<00:03:46.760> need<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.120> do<00:03:47.269> is<00:03:47.360> you<00:03:47.510> can<00:03:47.660> see<00:03:47.840> there's<00:03:48.080> some

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
I need to do is you can see there's some

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.890 
I need to do is you can see there's some
lines<00:03:48.590> right<00:03:48.950> here<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.459> here<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.720> we're

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
lines right here and here and we're

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.740 
lines right here and here and we're
going<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.170> try<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.530> smooth<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.220> up<00:03:52.630> get<00:03:53.630> rid

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
going to try to smooth that up get rid

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.290 
going to try to smooth that up get rid
of<00:03:53.870> those<00:03:53.989> lines<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:54.650> just<00:03:54.950> highlight<00:03:55.300> those

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
of those lines so I just highlight those

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.270 
of those lines so I just highlight those
sections<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.170> doesn't<00:03:57.739> really<00:03:57.830> matter<00:03:58.100> we

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
sections and doesn't really matter we

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.320 
sections and doesn't really matter we
got<00:03:58.430> some<00:03:58.730> more<00:03:58.940> there<00:03:59.150> go<00:03:59.810> up<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.080> add<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.530> and

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
got some more there go up to add it and

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.270 
got some more there go up to add it and
then<00:04:02.330> down<00:04:02.600> here<00:04:02.930> towards<00:04:03.350> have<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:04.100> in

then down here towards have the in

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.449 
then down here towards have the in
entities<00:04:05.269> and<00:04:05.600> then<00:04:06.260> smooth<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:07.130> can<00:04:07.280> also

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
entities and then smooth you can also

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.789 
entities and then smooth you can also
right-click<00:04:07.910> on<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:08.570> as<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.840> showed<00:04:09.110> earlier<00:04:09.290> in

right-click on it as I showed earlier in

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.520 
right-click on it as I showed earlier in
early<00:04:10.549> videos<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.269> just<00:04:11.450> right-click<00:04:12.320> on<00:04:12.500> it
