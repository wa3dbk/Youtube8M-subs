everyone<00:00:01.589> I'm<00:00:01.680> Jason<00:00:02.070> with<00:00:02.129> beer<00:00:02.310> talk<00:00:02.550> and

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
everyone I'm Jason with beer talk and

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:12.379 
everyone I'm Jason with beer talk and
this<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.510> caldera<00:00:03.899> Cohen<00:00:04.259> cooking<00:00:04.589> system

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.119 

for<00:00:13.110> those<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.379> you<00:00:13.500> who<00:00:13.769> aren't<00:00:13.950> familiar

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:14.129 
for those of you who aren't familiar

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.790 
for those of you who aren't familiar
with<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.670> caldera<00:00:15.059> cone<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:16.379> two-part

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
with it the caldera cone is a two-part

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040 
with it the caldera cone is a two-part
system<00:00:16.890> from<00:00:17.430> fail<00:00:17.640> designs<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.630> basically

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
system from fail designs and basically

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.260 
system from fail designs and basically
the<00:00:19.710> first<00:00:19.920> part<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.250> just<00:00:20.369> an<00:00:20.580> alcohol<00:00:20.970> stove

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the first part is just an alcohol stove

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.120 
the first part is just an alcohol stove
and<00:00:22.020> I'm<00:00:22.200> not<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.500> go<00:00:22.590> into<00:00:22.740> too<00:00:23.099> much

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
and I'm not going to go into too much

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.609 
and I'm not going to go into too much
depth<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.700> that<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.599> the<00:00:24.900> main<00:00:25.079> part<00:00:25.349> the<00:00:25.439> most

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
depth on that the the main part the most

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.109 
depth on that the the main part the most
interesting<00:00:26.070> part<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.610> window<00:00:26.849> screen

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
interesting part is the window screen

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.670 
interesting part is the window screen
and<00:00:27.660> as<00:00:27.930> you'll<00:00:28.079> see<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> little<00:00:28.500> bit

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and as you'll see it's a little bit

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.080 
and as you'll see it's a little bit
different<00:00:28.829> for<00:00:29.099> most<00:00:29.250> wind<00:00:29.550> screens<00:00:29.880> as

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
different for most wind screens as

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.380 
different for most wind screens as
conical-shaped<00:00:30.860> kind<00:00:31.860> of<00:00:32.000> almost<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
conical-shaped kind of almost like a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.830 
conical-shaped kind of almost like a
like<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> cone<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:36.059> slides<00:00:36.300> together<00:00:36.540> with

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
like a cone and it slides together with

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.090 
like a cone and it slides together with
this<00:00:36.989> dovetail<00:00:37.469> closure

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
this dovetail closure

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.819 
this dovetail closure
now<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.940> one's<00:00:39.180> aluminum<00:00:39.660> they<00:00:40.350> also<00:00:40.469> make<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
now this one's aluminum they also make a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.400 
now this one's aluminum they also make a
titanium<00:00:41.579> version<00:00:41.760> which<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.870> actually<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.379> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
titanium version which I actually like a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.480 
titanium version which I actually like a
little<00:00:43.530> bit<00:00:43.710> better<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
little bit better just because it's a

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.250 
little bit better just because it's a
little<00:00:44.550> bit<00:00:44.730> more<00:00:44.940> durable<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.750> also<00:00:45.840> because

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
little bit more durable but also because

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.170 
little bit more durable but also because
the<00:00:46.410> dovetails<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.100> snap<00:00:47.430> together<00:00:47.730> instead

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the dovetails can snap together instead

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.810 
the dovetails can snap together instead
of<00:00:48.240> having<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:49.260> slide<00:00:49.770> them<00:00:49.980> together<00:00:50.130> so<00:00:50.610> I

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
of having to slide them together so I

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.160 
of having to slide them together so I
kind<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.150> like<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> titanium<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:51.989> that's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
kind of like the titanium one that's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.040 
kind of like the titanium one that's
better<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.250> work<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.120> same<00:00:54.150> so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
better but the work just the same so

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.170 
better but the work just the same so
basically<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.880> this<00:00:56.970> system

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
basically I just put this system

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.610 
basically I just put this system
together<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.380> there's<00:00:58.560> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
together like this you can see there's a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.970 
together like this you can see there's a
knots<00:00:58.829> cut<00:00:59.130> out<00:00:59.250> here<00:00:59.550> for<00:00:59.880> my<00:01:00.210> snow-peak<00:01:00.980> 600

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
knots cut out here for my snow-peak 600

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.069 
knots cut out here for my snow-peak 600
which<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:02.399> using<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.210> slides<00:01:03.750> right<00:01:04.019> on

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
which I'm using it just slides right on

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.370 
which I'm using it just slides right on
there<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.790> top<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> cone

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
there like that and the top of the cone

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.469 
there like that and the top of the cone
catches<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> rim<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.880> pot<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.090> that's

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
catches the rim of the pot so that's

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.120 
catches the rim of the pot so that's
what<00:01:09.659> holds<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.560> kind<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.799> nice<00:01:10.920> because

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
what holds it it's kind of nice because

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.950 
what holds it it's kind of nice because
you<00:01:11.280> don't<00:01:11.369> need<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.579> separate<00:01:11.909> pot<00:01:12.119> stand<00:01:12.420> from

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
you don't need a separate pot stand from

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.569 
you don't need a separate pot stand from
the<00:01:12.990> windscreen<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> window<00:01:14.219> screen<00:01:14.430> is

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
the windscreen but the window screen is

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.280 
the windscreen but the window screen is
the<00:01:14.729> pot<00:01:14.880> stand<00:01:15.149> so<00:01:15.329> I<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.780> nice

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
the pot stand so I like this nice

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.140 
the pot stand so I like this nice
integrated<00:01:16.890> system<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.670> let's<00:01:17.790> go<00:01:17.909> ahead<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
integrated system so let's go ahead and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.880 
integrated system so let's go ahead and
light<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:18.870> how<00:01:19.260> efficient<00:01:19.620> -<00:01:19.770> this

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
light it up and see how efficient - this

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.910 
light it up and see how efficient - this
first<00:01:20.580> I'm<00:01:20.700> going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> fill<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> stove<00:01:21.420> with

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
first I'm going to fill the stove with

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.310 
first I'm going to fill the stove with
denatured<00:01:22.920> alcohol<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.810> usually<00:01:24.810> put<00:01:25.020> about<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
denatured alcohol I usually put about a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.810 
denatured alcohol I usually put about a
little<00:01:25.590> bit<00:01:25.680> more<00:01:25.860> than<00:01:26.040> half<00:01:26.190> an<00:01:26.370> ounce<00:01:26.490> in

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
little bit more than half an ounce in

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.850 
little bit more than half an ounce in
here<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.240> I'd<00:01:27.900> say<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.229> kind<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> cold<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
here but I'd say it's kind of cold I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
here but I'd say it's kind of cold I
know<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.190> alcohol<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.640> colds<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> pool<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
know this alcohol is colds in the pool a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.750 
know this alcohol is colds in the pool a
bit<00:01:30.600> more<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.680> there's<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.979> built-in<00:01:32.430> primer

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
bit more then there's a built-in primer

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.190 
bit more then there's a built-in primer
ring<00:01:33.119> around<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> edge<00:01:33.570> you'll<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:33.990> want<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
ring around the edge you'll just want to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.450 
ring around the edge you'll just want to
put<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.440> alcohol<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.280> just

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
put a little alcohol in there that just

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.960 
put a little alcohol in there that just
helps<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.850> stoke<00:01:36.060> prime<00:01:36.360> faster<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:38.040> light<00:01:38.850> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
helps to stoke prime faster and light it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.590 
helps to stoke prime faster and light it
up<00:01:42.890> right<00:01:43.890> away<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:44.159> gonna<00:01:44.250> put<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.640> cone<00:01:45.330> on

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
up right away I'm gonna put the cone on

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080 
up right away I'm gonna put the cone on
there<00:01:46.130> let<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.250> stove<00:01:47.549> heat<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.939> little

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
there let that stove heat up a little

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.370 
there let that stove heat up a little
bit<00:01:48.210> before<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> put<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> pot<00:01:48.900> on

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.100 

all<00:01:53.310> right<00:01:53.430> nice<00:01:54.119> thing<00:01:54.299> about<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.630> system<00:01:54.990> is

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
all right nice thing about the system is

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.990 
all right nice thing about the system is
that<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.770> always<00:01:56.100> tell<00:01:56.460> when<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> stove

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that you can always tell when the stove

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.310 
that you can always tell when the stove
the<00:01:57.119> center<00:01:57.420> because<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.840> look<00:01:57.960> down<00:01:58.110> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the center because you can look down in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.630 
the center because you can look down in
there<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:59.039> when<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.219> put<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> pot<00:01:59.610> on

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
there and then when you put the pot on

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.100 
there and then when you put the pot on
its<00:01:59.969> gonna<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.180> perfectly<00:02:00.570> aligned<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.990> hit

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
its gonna be perfectly aligned to hit

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.929 
its gonna be perfectly aligned to hit
the<00:02:01.229> bottom<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> pot<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.759> makes

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the bottom of the pot so that just makes

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.130 
the bottom of the pot so that just makes
a<00:02:03.000> little<00:02:03.090> bit<00:02:03.240> easier<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.539> center<00:02:03.930> rather

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
a little bit easier to center rather

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.690 
a little bit easier to center rather
than<00:02:04.320> having<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.649> guess<00:02:07.310> okay<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.580> looks

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
than having to guess okay so it looks

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.639 
than having to guess okay so it looks
like<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:08.940> about<00:02:09.000> ready<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.569> go<00:02:09.690> let's<00:02:10.110> put<00:02:10.560> it

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
like it's about ready to go let's put it

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.940 
like it's about ready to go let's put it
on<00:02:10.739> there<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:10.950> start<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> timer<00:02:12.080> see<00:02:13.080> okay

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
on there and start the timer see okay

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.830 
on there and start the timer see okay
we've<00:02:14.130> got<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> rolling<00:02:14.550> boil<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.660> about

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
we've got a rolling boil in just about

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:27.440 
we've got a rolling boil in just about
six<00:02:16.800> minutes<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.519> 15<00:02:17.880> seconds<00:02:26.209> one<00:02:27.209> thing<00:02:27.390> I

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
six minutes and 15 seconds one thing I

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.759 
six minutes and 15 seconds one thing I
want<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.690> point<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:27.989> about<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.230> caldera

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
want to point out about that caldera

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.440 
want to point out about that caldera
cone<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.190> lot<00:02:29.519> of<00:02:29.610> people<00:02:29.819> complain<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.209> it

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
cone is a lot of people complain that it

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.940 
cone is a lot of people complain that it
sticks<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.900> pot<00:02:31.140> when<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.470> lift<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.739> pot

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
sticks to the pot when you lift the pot

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.039 
sticks to the pot when you lift the pot
off<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.519> wanted<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> show<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.049> mine

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
off and I just wanted to show that mine

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.470 
off and I just wanted to show that mine
doesn't<00:02:34.440> stick<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.519> don't<00:02:36.060> know<00:02:36.239> what

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
doesn't stick so I don't know what

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.820 
doesn't stick so I don't know what
people<00:02:36.720> are<00:02:36.780> doing<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.110> make<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.290> stick<00:02:37.650> if

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
people are doing to make it stick if

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.009 
people are doing to make it stick if
it's<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.190> one<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.480> like<00:02:39.840> that

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
it's just the one I have but I like that

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.089 
it's just the one I have but I like that
I<00:02:40.049> was<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> little<00:02:40.380> bit<00:02:40.500> worried<00:02:40.739> about<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.040> I

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
I was a little bit worried about it I

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.259 
I was a little bit worried about it I
thought<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.340> might<00:02:41.549> have<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.849> stake<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.239> down

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
thought I might have to stake it down

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.449 
thought I might have to stake it down
from<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.750> vent<00:02:42.930> holes<00:02:43.140> with<00:02:43.410> some<00:02:43.620> Shepherd

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
from the vent holes with some Shepherd

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.280 
from the vent holes with some Shepherd
hooks<00:02:44.579> or<00:02:44.819> something<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.299> obviously<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:46.170> can

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
hooks or something but obviously you can

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.690 
hooks or something but obviously you can
see<00:02:46.319> I've<00:02:46.650> got<00:02:46.769> nothing<00:02:47.099> holding<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.489> down

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
see I've got nothing holding this down

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.780 
see I've got nothing holding this down
and<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.750> definitely<00:02:49.049> not<00:02:49.260> sticking<00:02:49.769> some<00:02:50.700> of

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
and it's definitely not sticking some of

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.640 
and it's definitely not sticking some of
you<00:02:50.940> are<00:02:51.030> probably<00:02:51.239> thinking<00:02:51.390> okay<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.440> looks

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
you are probably thinking okay it looks

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.130 
you are probably thinking okay it looks
great<00:02:52.890> looks<00:02:53.519> very<00:02:53.880> efficient<00:02:54.390> good<00:02:54.810> design

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
great looks very efficient good design

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.259 
great looks very efficient good design
how<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.709> heck<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.069> store<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:56.940> actually

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
how the heck do I store it and actually

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.150 
how the heck do I store it and actually
that<00:02:57.510> was<00:02:57.630> my<00:02:57.810> first<00:02:58.049> question<00:02:58.230> -<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.920> first

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
that was my first question - the first

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.410 
that was my first question - the first
thing<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.370> thought<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.609> is<00:02:59.819> wow<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.239> looks

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
thing I thought of is wow that looks

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.360 
thing I thought of is wow that looks
like<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.569> really<00:03:00.780> big<00:03:01.079> kind<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.739> thing<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.250> might

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
like a really big kind of thing it might

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.710 
like a really big kind of thing it might
be<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.519> little<00:03:02.670> fragile<00:03:02.850> how<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.390> heck<00:03:03.540> am<00:03:03.569> I

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
be a little fragile how the heck am I

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.150 
be a little fragile how the heck am I
going<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.930> store<00:03:04.079> this<00:03:04.260> without<00:03:04.500> damaging<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
going to store this without damaging it

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.759 
going to store this without damaging it
and<00:03:05.609> if<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:06.359> go<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.780> trail<00:03:07.410> designs

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
and if you go to the trail designs

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.259 
and if you go to the trail designs
website<00:03:08.250> they<00:03:08.370> actually<00:03:08.670> have<00:03:08.790> some<00:03:08.940> ideas

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
website they actually have some ideas

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.849 
website they actually have some ideas
there<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.660> different<00:03:09.780> ways<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.079> store<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.620> and

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
there of different ways to store it and

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.650 
there of different ways to store it and
I<00:03:11.400> even<00:03:11.670> thought<00:03:11.819> about<00:03:12.000> some<00:03:12.359> different

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
I even thought about some different

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.530 
I even thought about some different
things<00:03:12.780> about<00:03:12.959> rolling<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.470> up<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:14.040> know

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
things about rolling it up you know

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.789 
things about rolling it up you know
taking<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.600> apart<00:03:15.930> rolling<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.260> up<00:03:16.350> inside<00:03:16.620> my

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
taking it apart rolling it up inside my

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.620 
taking it apart rolling it up inside my
sleeping<00:03:17.220> pad<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.180> have<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:18.389> be<00:03:18.480> careful

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
sleeping pad you just have to be careful

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.390 
sleeping pad you just have to be careful
of<00:03:18.870> these<00:03:18.989> dovetail<00:03:19.470> closures<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:19.980> just

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
of these dovetail closures you just

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.770 
of these dovetail closures you just
don't<00:03:20.549> want<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.000> know<00:03:21.120> crush<00:03:21.389> them<00:03:21.600> right
