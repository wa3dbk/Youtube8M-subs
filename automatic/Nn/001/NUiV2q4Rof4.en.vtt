00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 friends of pro evolution soccer here 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.880
 We are here to show you how to import 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.950
 equipment to the fish 2014 then you have already 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.680
 all the equipment in your usb pendrive what 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.180
 connect to your playstation 3 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.210
 you go to saved data tools and 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.730
 you can copy all the files that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.940
 They have a little flag of the country or the logo 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.640
 of the club 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.330
 I think the copy and all these are 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.060
 will be recorded on your hard drive more 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:39.460
 will not be in 2014 yet 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.770
 in this case we are importing the 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.710
 selections of Central America and 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.440
 North America 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.360
 when we have already all we get a 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.120
 message that the copy has been completed 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.290
 we go 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.060
 there are products in soccer 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.640
 we enter the game is going to load everything 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.700
 we are between the main menu and then 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.460
 let's go edit 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.920
 when we enter to edit that great your 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.140
 data that you have edited or not 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.009
 and we're going to address in the menu 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.580
 start the import menu to import 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.140
 let's import the equipment and we're going to 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.880
 give import into the team of your want 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.940
 then in this case we choose coast 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.710
 delicious 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.710
 will load that file 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.870
 with the full face 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.230
 will show you 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.660
 the team the players is the team that 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.420
 it was already set and you are going to apply the 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.920
 schools so the names will change 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.100
 for example costa rica they have names 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.400
 fictional in this case 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.920
 as it was edited low of the players 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.270
 with their real names 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.270
 besides the uniforms 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.619
 and with this will be recorded already in your 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.619
 game and in your console 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.310
 let's try to do one more time we're going 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.649
 to import equipment you need data from 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.009
 team in this case let's catch 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.239
 Honduras 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.239
 let's load it 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.610
 this is loaded very fast 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.960
 the cove was complete and we are going to demonstrate 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.950
 the players who loves to join 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.210
 the raisins Honduras apply in cases 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.790
 of the elections there is no how 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.350
 will change for example if you wanted to import 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.900
 to Honduras on another selection is not 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.360
 could be about which the game you the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.350
 did not the team always ticket 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.350
 import the equipment that was 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.470
 about which it was created in another way 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.290
 would have problems in this case in the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.580
 elections there is no chance that you 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.830
 you can fail 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.750
 I'm going to show you that we can leave 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.210
 import I would like to record first 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.010
 before leaving this then I'm going to 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.300
 save so you do not have any 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.000
 problem 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.050
 about I write the data I had this 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.050
 it would be recorded 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.390
 in the edit data 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.640
 and now if I can exit the mode 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.780
 edit and also leave the game 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.780
 you can continue the game 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.580
 and we go back to the initial part 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.170
 of playstation 3 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.700
 remember the folder is called 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.700
 saved data tools 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:50.530
 let's go to that 3 and what I'm going to do 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:56.400
 now it's erase 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:04:00.670
 the files that we copy from the usb 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.630
 pendrive because I do this because of 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.720
 this way I can import more equipment 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.460
 then he selected the six countries that 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.920
 I had imported 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:16.350
 or delete deleted those 6 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.410
 and for example now he's going to put it back 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.730
 the usb of change in the 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.730
 computer other equipment 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.539
 let's go to another recipe if your voice looks 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:29.480
 now I have the South American sessions 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:33.090
 for example 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.040
 and I will give copy everything 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.660
 multiple copy copy all 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.030
 to put them on the hard drive and then 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.890
 If you go back to the same steps 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.340
 we want three can against 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:52.950
