the<00:01:50.729> full<00:01:50.999> tighten<00:01:51.420> later<00:01:51.719> after<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.289> install

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
the full tighten later after we install

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.160 
the full tighten later after we install
the<00:01:53.520> skid<00:01:53.999> plate<00:01:54.119> itself<00:01:54.539> so<00:01:54.869> right<00:01:55.049> now

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the skid plate itself so right now

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.840 
the skid plate itself so right now
you're<00:01:55.319> just<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.619> hand<00:01:55.859> tighten<00:01:56.069> it<00:01:56.310> so

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
you're just going to hand tighten it so

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.859 
you're just going to hand tighten it so
we're<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.029> to<00:01:57.090> do<00:01:57.209> that<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.539> we'll<00:01:57.840> be

we're going to do that and we'll be
right<00:01:58.109> back<00:01:58.289> so<00:01:59.009> here's<00:01:59.279> the<00:01:59.429> stock<00:01:59.609> bracket

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:00.029 
right back so here's the stock bracket

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:02.499 
right back so here's the stock bracket
from<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> driver's<00:02:01.049> side<00:02:01.200> or<00:02:01.499> left<00:02:01.709> hand<00:02:01.920> side

from the driver's side or left hand side

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.359 
from the driver's side or left hand side
the<00:02:03.509> bracket<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.350> damped<00:02:04.770> LH<00:02:05.069> that

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
the bracket here is damped LH that

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.919 
the bracket here is damped LH that
you're<00:02:05.520> going<00:02:05.639> to<00:02:05.729> install<00:02:06.329> with<00:02:06.600> it

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
you're going to install with it

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.070 
you're going to install with it
again<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.159> like<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.429> other<00:02:08.580> side<00:02:09.080> you're

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
again just like the other side you're

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.300 
again just like the other side you're
going<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.259> put<00:02:10.409> it<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.649> something<00:02:11.250> like<00:02:11.340> this

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
going to put it on something like this

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.990 
going to put it on something like this
two<00:02:13.300> washers<00:02:14.099> then<00:02:15.099> again<00:02:15.610> I'm<00:02:15.700> going<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.880> put

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
two washers then again I'm going to put

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.460 
two washers then again I'm going to put
some<00:02:16.120> Loctite<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:16.959> we're<00:02:17.140> just<00:02:17.170> going

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
some Loctite on it and we're just going

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.030 
some Loctite on it and we're just going
to<00:02:17.560> put<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.830> on<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:20.140> snug<00:02:20.380> at<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.650> moment

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
to put this on just snug at the moment

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.229 
to put this on just snug at the moment
so<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:22.150> only<00:02:22.360> fits<00:02:22.800> for<00:02:23.800> four<00:02:24.010> runners<00:02:24.370> 96<00:02:25.120> to

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
so this only fits for four runners 96 to

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.809 
so this only fits for four runners 96 to
98<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.590> some<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.220> four<00:02:27.370> runners<00:02:27.640> have<00:02:27.790> a

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
98 so some of the four runners have a

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.550 
98 so some of the four runners have a
different<00:02:28.180> front<00:02:28.420> bumper<00:02:28.810> after<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.349> year

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
different front bumper after that year

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.220 
different front bumper after that year
so<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.610> whole<00:02:31.300> kit<00:02:31.510> was<00:02:31.630> really<00:02:31.810> made<00:02:31.989> for

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
so this whole kit was really made for

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.820 
so this whole kit was really made for
Tacoma

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
Tacoma

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.330 
Tacoma
so<00:02:33.519> again<00:02:34.330> 96<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.989> 98<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:35.590> runners<00:02:35.860> any<00:02:36.160> other

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
so again 96 to 98 for runners any other

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.559 
so again 96 to 98 for runners any other
years<00:02:36.610> you'll<00:02:36.819> have<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.060> make<00:02:37.209> custom

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
years you'll have to make custom

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.120 
years you'll have to make custom
brackets<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.470> I'm<00:02:38.530> going<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.709> install<00:02:38.920> these

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
brackets so I'm going to install these

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.550 
brackets so I'm going to install these
and<00:02:39.340> we'll<00:02:39.430> be<00:02:39.519> right<00:02:39.670> back<00:02:39.880> here's<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.080> skid

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
and we'll be right back here's the skid

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.020 
and we'll be right back here's the skid
plate<00:02:41.650> we're<00:02:41.890> going<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.040> install<00:02:42.340> comes<00:02:42.849> with

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
plate we're going to install comes with

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.570 
plate we're going to install comes with
these<00:02:43.180> four<00:02:43.510> bolts<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.110> it's<00:02:45.069> going<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.250> go<00:02:45.430> on

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
these four bolts and it's going to go on

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.050 
these four bolts and it's going to go on
the<00:02:45.670> brackets<00:02:46.060> something<00:02:46.930> like<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.530> and

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
the brackets something like this and

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.520 
the brackets something like this and
then<00:02:49.060> we're<00:02:49.239> going<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.540> gap<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.319> 20

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
then we're going to gap it for 20

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.960 
then we're going to gap it for 20
millimeters<00:02:51.010> I'll<00:02:51.220> show<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.549> gap<00:02:51.790> in

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
millimeters I'll show you that gap in

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.490 
millimeters I'll show you that gap in
here<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.239> minute<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:53.140> what<00:02:53.230> I'm<00:02:53.350> going<00:02:53.470> to

here in a minute but what I'm going to
do<00:02:53.620> now<00:02:53.799> is<00:02:54.010> put<00:02:54.190> some<00:02:54.310> Loctite<00:02:54.519> on<00:02:54.819> those

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
do now is put some Loctite on those

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.820 
do now is put some Loctite on those
bolts<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.540> I'm<00:02:56.110> just<00:02:56.230> going<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.440> put<00:02:56.620> them<00:02:56.709> in

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
bolts and I'm just going to put them in

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.400 
bolts and I'm just going to put them in
here<00:02:56.940> finger<00:02:57.940> tight<00:02:58.150> at<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.420> moment<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:59.260> will

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
here finger tight at the moment it will

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.630 
here finger tight at the moment it will
come<00:02:59.560> back<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.950> make<00:03:00.099> the<00:03:00.250> gapping

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
come back and make the gapping

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.130 
come back and make the gapping
adjustment<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.269> then<00:03:01.630> we'll<00:03:01.750> start<00:03:01.900> snugging

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
adjustment and then we'll start snugging

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.750 
adjustment and then we'll start snugging
things<00:03:02.500> up<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:03.069> I'll<00:03:03.220> give<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.549> torque

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
things up and I'll give you the torque

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.300 
things up and I'll give you the torque
settings<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.140> skid<00:03:05.440> plates<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.830> here<00:03:06.040> just

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
settings so the skid plates on here just

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.460 
settings so the skid plates on here just
sort<00:03:06.519> of<00:03:06.580> hand<00:03:07.000> tightened<00:03:07.420> we're<00:03:08.170> taking<00:03:08.410> a

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
sort of hand tightened we're taking a

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.710 
sort of hand tightened we're taking a
metric<00:03:08.769> ruler<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.370> right<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.180> center<00:03:10.540> or

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
metric ruler and right in the center or

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.839 
metric ruler and right in the center or
approximately<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.260> center<00:03:11.549> we<00:03:12.549> measured

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
approximately the center we measured

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.720 
approximately the center we measured
about<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.060> 20<00:03:13.450> millimeter<00:03:13.870> gap<00:03:14.459> then<00:03:15.459> on<00:03:15.549> each

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
about a 20 millimeter gap then on each

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.580 
about a 20 millimeter gap then on each
side<00:03:16.000> here<00:03:16.269> it's<00:03:16.420> about<00:03:16.570> 15<00:03:16.959> millimeters<00:03:17.410> we

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
side here it's about 15 millimeters we

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.650 
side here it's about 15 millimeters we
made<00:03:17.739> them<00:03:17.890> even<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:19.090> now<00:03:19.269> what<00:03:19.420> I'm<00:03:19.480> going<00:03:19.510> to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
made them even so now what I'm going to

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.870 
made them even so now what I'm going to
do<00:03:19.750> is<00:03:19.870> carefully<00:03:20.109> snug<00:03:20.769> up<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:20.980> bolts<00:03:21.489> and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
do is carefully snug up the bolts and

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.420 
do is carefully snug up the bolts and
then<00:03:22.600> these<00:03:22.810> bolts<00:03:23.230> up<00:03:23.380> here<00:03:23.590> on<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:24.130> front

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
then these bolts up here on the front

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.720 
then these bolts up here on the front
get<00:03:25.120> torque<00:03:25.420> 227<00:03:26.109> Newton<00:03:26.410> meters<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.920> then

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
get torque 227 Newton meters and then

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.870 
get torque 227 Newton meters and then
the<00:03:27.850> tie-down<00:03:28.239> hook<00:03:28.480> bolts<00:03:28.840> get<00:03:28.989> torqued<00:03:29.319> to

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
the tie-down hook bolts get torqued to

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.090 
the tie-down hook bolts get torqued to
122<00:03:30.880> Newton<00:03:31.359> meters<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:32.500> I'm<00:03:32.620> going<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.799> start

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
122 Newton meters so I'm going to start

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.710 
122 Newton meters so I'm going to start
doing<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.340> here<00:03:33.640> in<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.819> second<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.299> I'll

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
doing that here in a second and I'll

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.780 
doing that here in a second and I'll
show<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:34.959> how<00:03:35.079> that's<00:03:35.260> done

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
show you how that's done

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
show you how that's done
alright<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:37.150> my<00:03:37.359> snap-on<00:03:39.569> low<00:03:40.569> reading

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
alright I have my snap-on low reading

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.599 
alright I have my snap-on low reading
torque<00:03:41.290> wrench<00:03:41.530> set<00:03:42.040> for<00:03:42.250> 27<00:03:42.819> Newton<00:03:43.120> meters

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
torque wrench set for 27 Newton meters

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.640 
torque wrench set for 27 Newton meters
that's<00:03:45.609> funny<00:03:45.850> a<00:03:45.940> hard<00:03:46.150> even<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:47.170> snugged<00:03:47.500> it

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
that's funny a hard even it snugged it

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.900 
that's funny a hard even it snugged it
up<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.920> it's<00:03:48.040> already<00:03:48.220> tight<00:03:50.310> okay<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:51.730> that's

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
up and it's already tight okay so that's

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.410 
up and it's already tight okay so that's
tight<00:03:52.209> I'll<00:03:53.079> do<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.350> other<00:03:53.380> side<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:54.420> then

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
tight I'll do the other side and then

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.729 
tight I'll do the other side and then
I'll<00:03:55.510> take<00:03:55.660> my<00:03:55.690> other<00:03:55.900> torque<00:03:56.200> wrench<00:03:56.440> and

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
I'll take my other torque wrench and

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.479 
I'll take my other torque wrench and
I'll<00:03:57.100> tighten<00:03:57.370> up<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:59.230> other<00:03:59.920> bracket<00:04:00.370> so

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
I'll tighten up the other bracket so

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.340 
I'll tighten up the other bracket so
I'll<00:04:00.549> show<00:04:00.700> you<00:04:00.730> that<00:04:00.790> here<00:04:00.880> in<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.150> second<00:04:01.540> okay

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
I'll show you that here in a second okay

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.210 
I'll show you that here in a second okay
so<00:04:02.410> these<00:04:02.799> are<00:04:02.859> set<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.400> 122<00:04:04.269> Newton<00:04:04.780> meters

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
so these are set to 122 Newton meters

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.660 
so these are set to 122 Newton meters
and<00:04:07.230> they<00:04:08.230> were<00:04:08.290> hard<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.739> get<00:04:08.829> off<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.370> can

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
and they were hard to get off so I can

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.890 
and they were hard to get off so I can
see<00:04:09.940> that<00:04:10.299> they<00:04:10.450> take<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.690> lot<00:04:10.780> of<00:04:10.959> torque<00:04:11.380> so

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
see that they take a lot of torque so

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.370 
see that they take a lot of torque so
I'm<00:04:13.900> going<00:04:14.049> to<00:04:14.109> torque<00:04:14.350> them<00:04:14.500> all

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
I'm going to torque them all

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.270 
I'm going to torque them all
and<00:04:17.420> then<00:04:18.440> I'll<00:04:19.440> show<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.830> looks<00:04:19.980> like<00:04:20.100> when

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
and then I'll show it looks like when

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.980 
and then I'll show it looks like when
it's<00:04:20.400> finished

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:20.990 
it's finished

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.270 
it's finished
alright<00:04:21.990> so<00:04:22.140> here's<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.410> finished<00:04:22.770> kid<00:04:23.040> plate

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
alright so here's the finished kid plate

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.720 
alright so here's the finished kid plate
