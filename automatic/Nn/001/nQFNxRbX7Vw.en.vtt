00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.970 
to draw on this and sort of show you how
it<00:02:36.070> does<00:02:36.100> live<00:02:36.880> with<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.840> tablet<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.710> this<00:02:38.860> is

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
it does live with the tablet so this is

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.500 
it does live with the tablet so this is
using<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.370> live<00:02:39.520> draw<00:02:39.820> feature<00:02:40.120> you

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
using the live draw feature you

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.420 
using the live draw feature you
literally<00:02:41.050> just<00:02:41.320> hit<00:02:41.530> live<00:02:41.740> draw<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
literally just hit live draw in the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.310 
literally just hit live draw in the
application<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.630> whatever<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:44.020> do<00:02:44.140> over

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
application and whatever you do over

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.310

here<00:02:44.580> shows<00:02:45.580> up<00:02:45.790> on<00:02:45.940> your<00:02:45.970> device<00:02:46.450> real<00:02:47.020> time

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
here shows up on your device real time

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.220 
here shows up on your device real time
really<00:02:48.010> accurate<00:02:48.490> and<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.760> like<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.480> sort<00:02:50.140> of

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
really accurate and I like the sort of

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.810 
really accurate and I like the sort of
way<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.680> feels<00:02:50.890> like<00:02:51.100> using<00:02:51.460> an<00:02:51.550> actual

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
way that it feels like using an actual

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.760 
way that it feels like using an actual
ink<00:02:52.120> pen<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.570> it's<00:02:52.690> pretty<00:02:52.870> cool<00:02:53.230> especially

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
ink pen so it's pretty cool especially

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.710 
ink pen so it's pretty cool especially
for<00:02:54.190> people<00:02:54.310> who<00:02:54.520> are<00:02:54.610> into<00:02:54.820> illustration<00:02:55.420> and

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
for people who are into illustration and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.480 
for people who are into illustration and
drawing<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:56.920> like<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:57.160> said<00:02:57.340> it'd<00:02:57.430> be

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
drawing and it's like I said it'd be

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.760 
drawing and it's like I said it'd be
great<00:02:57.610> for<00:02:57.730> teachers<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.510> use<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.470> illustrate

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
great for teachers to use to illustrate

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.500 
great for teachers to use to illustrate
things<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.610> their<00:03:00.730> students<00:03:01.150> or<00:03:01.240> to<00:03:01.300> just

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
things to their students or to just

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.990 
things to their students or to just
teach<00:03:01.690> with<00:03:01.900> overall<00:03:02.470> as<00:03:02.710> far<00:03:02.980> as<00:03:03.160> devices<00:03:03.880> go

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
teach with overall as far as devices go

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.580 
teach with overall as far as devices go
this<00:03:04.210> is<00:03:04.330> actually<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.840> favorite<00:03:05.170> for<00:03:05.470> me<00:03:05.560> I
