00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
to pick up my finger again that's the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.379 
to pick up my finger again that's the
control<00:02:24.900> issue<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.680> had<00:02:26.010> which<00:02:26.879> is<00:02:26.909> that<00:02:27.359> I

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
control issue that I had which is that I

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.720 
control issue that I had which is that I
get<00:02:27.599> outside<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.709> zone<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.189> it<00:02:29.280> starts<00:02:29.609> to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
get outside of the zone and it starts to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.649 
get outside of the zone and it starts to
drift<00:02:29.969> back<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.269> center<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.049> I'm<00:02:31.980> dead<00:02:32.659> I'm

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
drift back to center and I'm dead I'm

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.050 
drift back to center and I'm dead I'm
not<00:02:33.689> very<00:02:33.959> good<00:02:34.170> at<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.409> yet<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:35.400> think<00:02:35.790> that

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
not very good at this yet I think that

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.640 
not very good at this yet I think that
you<00:02:36.120> could<00:02:36.269> tweak<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.659> controls<00:02:37.019> on<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.409> and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
you could tweak the controls on this and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.979 
you could tweak the controls on this and
make<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.250> lot<00:02:38.400> more<00:02:38.549> fun<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.450> design<00:02:39.780> is

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
make it a lot more fun but the design is

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.879 
make it a lot more fun but the design is
so<00:02:40.609> so<00:02:41.609> compelling<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.329> I<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.959> want<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.260> go
