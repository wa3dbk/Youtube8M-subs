 as the school is trying to 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.989
 invite people to join a little 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.840
 with nature they make trips to take 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.879
 classes travel simply that they can 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.879
 enjoy a little in the company of friends 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.010
 these conditions that gives us good 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.769
 Here we have a style of 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.530
 kayak that is mainly for use 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.829

 be able to navigate with any condition and 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.860
 without having to technically master the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.369
 sports are broadly stable and if one is 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.229
 turn around do not make us water 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.590
 we can return to your life the idea is 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.509
 to be able to navigate in 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.220
 any condition and any age and 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.230
 anyone simply to 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:39.200
 have fun and do some sport

 we have the simple and double the parrot 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.430
 up to three people can go and what 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.590
 we mainly do are crossings and 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.130
 recreational outings within the area of 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.679
 river silver 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.079
 anyone can climb and row with 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.810
 all ease are designed for that 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.869
 this fall that we have here is double and 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.439
 normally the person who is going to give 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.600
 higher index and greater weight and will give the 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.280
 rima gives more main back in each 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.300
 flight 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.210
 whenever we go out to rhyme 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.000
 main the life jacket after 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:20.160
 well just try to economize 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.240
 a little bit the effort we take the oar 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.470
 in a 90 degree position and the elbows 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.230
 try not to separate much arms and 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.880
 approach the many but in the center and 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.890
 then see if we can coordinate between 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.870
 the two people and not shove the shovel very 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.240
 in the water afterwards it costs us 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.910
 take it out and we slow down then the 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.440
 jail forward is setting the pace and 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.680
 the one behind has to accompany his 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.189
 intimate unit 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.780

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:49.130
 mark the rhythm 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.500
 and I accompany him 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.640
 having a little more weight should 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.640
 have a little more strength 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.170
 and give the rhythm to accompany the rhythm 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:13.139
 science mainly
