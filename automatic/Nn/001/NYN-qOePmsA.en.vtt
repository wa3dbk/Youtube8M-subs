arrangement that you can use on your

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.080 
arrangement that you can use on your
table<00:00:06.890> something<00:00:07.890> pretty<00:00:08.130> simple<00:00:08.429> so<00:00:08.910> that

table something pretty simple so that
you<00:00:09.179> can<00:00:09.360> make<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.630> at<00:00:09.719> home<00:00:10.340> what<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.370> do<00:00:11.519> first

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
you can make it at home what I do first

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.629 
you can make it at home what I do first
I<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.540> glue<00:00:12.809> pan<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.920> use<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.309> at<00:00:14.490> work

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I have the glue pan we use that at work

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.090 
I have the glue pan we use that at work
but<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.000> can<00:00:15.030> use<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> glue<00:00:15.630> gun<00:00:15.660> or<00:00:16.650> some<00:00:16.859> tape

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
but you can use a glue gun or some tape

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.760 
but you can use a glue gun or some tape
and<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.730> take<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> piece<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.449> Sahara<00:00:18.869> first

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
and you take a piece of the Sahara first

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.679 
and you take a piece of the Sahara first
our<00:00:20.039> thumb<00:00:20.340> press<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.880> into<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> container

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
our thumb press it into the container

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.970 
our thumb press it into the container
and<00:00:24.689> then<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.019> take<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> little<00:00:25.560> bit<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
and then I take a little bit of the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.759 
and then I take a little bit of the
Spanish<00:00:26.430> moss<00:00:26.699> or<00:00:27.180> some<00:00:27.539> moss<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.590> use

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
Spanish moss or some moss and use

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.410 
Spanish moss or some moss and use
whatever<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.609> home<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.820> cover<00:00:30.179> this

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
whatever you have at home and cover this

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.690 
whatever you have at home and cover this
a<00:00:30.449> hair<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.470> don't<00:00:31.500> see<00:00:31.980> what's

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
a hair up so that you don't see what's

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.930 
a hair up so that you don't see what's
in<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> container<00:00:34.070> then<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.370> would<00:00:35.520> take<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.790> few

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
in the container then I would take a few

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.150 
in the container then I would take a few
of<00:00:36.270> these<00:00:36.600> twigs<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.440> found<00:00:37.710> outside<00:00:37.920> in

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
of these twigs that I found outside in

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.130 
of these twigs that I found outside in
New<00:00:38.309> York<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.329> use<00:00:39.510> things<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.930> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
New York so you can use things that you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.610 
New York so you can use things that you
have<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.480> stick<00:00:42.690> those<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.140> there<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> like

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
have so we stick those in there I like

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.900 
have so we stick those in there I like
to<00:00:43.770> put<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> little<00:00:44.129> bit<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.430> glue<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
to put a little bit of glue on the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.540 
to put a little bit of glue on the
bottom<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.360> every<00:00:45.660> stick<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.250> it's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
bottom of every stick so I know it's

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.740 
bottom of every stick so I know it's
really<00:00:47.730> secure<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.510> arrangement

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.360 

so<00:00:53.750> what<00:00:53.930> we<00:00:54.050> want<00:00:54.260> is<00:00:54.350> is<00:00:54.800> something<00:00:55.220> with<00:00:55.340> a

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
so what we want is is something with a

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.040 
so what we want is is something with a
little<00:00:55.670> bit<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:55.880> height<00:00:56.060> then<00:00:56.300> I<00:00:56.390> have<00:00:56.630> this<00:00:56.870> I

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
little bit of height then I have this I

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.370 
little bit of height then I have this I
try<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.350> shape<00:00:57.710> each<00:00:58.040> a<00:00:58.460> little<00:00:59.420> part<00:00:59.720> up<00:01:00.020> so

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
try to shape each a little part up so

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.689 
try to shape each a little part up so
that<00:01:00.560> has<00:01:00.830> some<00:01:01.480> motion<00:01:02.480> or<00:01:02.660> fluidity<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.260> it

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
that has some motion or fluidity to it

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.920 
that has some motion or fluidity to it
so<00:01:04.699> we'll<00:01:04.820> put<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:05.030> there<00:01:05.390> in<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:05.540> center

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
so we'll put that there in the center

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.650 
so we'll put that there in the center
and<00:01:06.620> then<00:01:07.340> we<00:01:07.490> want<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.760> put<00:01:07.970> in<00:01:08.150> some<00:01:08.390> foliage

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
and then we want to put in some foliage

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.130 
and then we want to put in some foliage
so<00:01:09.440> that<00:01:09.590> we<00:01:09.680> cover<00:01:09.950> up<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.810> mechanics<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:11.960> the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
so that we cover up the mechanics of the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.610 
so that we cover up the mechanics of the
arrangement<00:01:12.880> like<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.060> Sahara<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:15.380> any

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
arrangement like the Sahara and any

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.860 
arrangement like the Sahara and any
space<00:01:16.040> that<00:01:16.310> might<00:01:16.460> be<00:01:16.640> there<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.510> you<00:01:17.690> can

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
space that might be there and you can

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.180 
space that might be there and you can
use<00:01:17.990> several<00:01:18.320> different<00:01:18.590> kinds<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:18.980> foliage

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
use several different kinds of foliage

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.370 
use several different kinds of foliage
on<00:01:19.460> this<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.690> that<00:01:20.870> you<00:01:20.930> can<00:01:21.110> keep<00:01:21.230> it

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
on this so that you can keep it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.030 
on this so that you can keep it
interesting<00:01:21.620> looking

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
interesting looking

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.530 
interesting looking
we'll<00:01:25.040> keep<00:01:25.190> it<00:01:25.369> kind<00:01:25.580> of<00:01:25.700> small<00:01:26.000> at<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.330> base

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
we'll keep it kind of small at the base

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.719 
we'll keep it kind of small at the base
each<00:01:27.260> one<00:01:27.619> of<00:01:27.740> these<00:01:27.830> that<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:28.190> put<00:01:28.400> in<00:01:28.550> you

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
each one of these that you put in you

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.010 
each one of these that you put in you
want<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:28.970> give<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.210> a<00:01:29.270> little<00:01:29.450> bit<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.780> shape

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
want to give it a little bit of shape

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.290 
want to give it a little bit of shape
too<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:30.650> that<00:01:30.800> your<00:01:31.090> arrangement<00:01:32.090> doesn't

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
too so that your arrangement doesn't

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.630 
too so that your arrangement doesn't
look<00:01:32.630> real<00:01:33.170> rigid<00:01:33.500> or<00:01:33.950> unnatural<00:01:36.220> so<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.460> was

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
look real rigid or unnatural so that was

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.950 
look real rigid or unnatural so that was
a<00:01:37.670> little<00:01:37.880> bit<00:01:38.119> of<00:01:38.240> Patania

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
a little bit of Patania

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.260 
a little bit of Patania
and<00:01:39.650> now<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:40.130> can<00:01:40.400> use<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.610> little<00:01:40.910> bit<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.119> this

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
and now we can use a little bit of this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.480 
and now we can use a little bit of this
variegated<00:01:41.900> ivy<00:01:42.080> in<00:01:42.380> here<00:01:42.770> which<00:01:43.070> all<00:01:43.280> has<00:01:43.460> a

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
variegated ivy in here which all has a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.840 
variegated ivy in here which all has a
spring<00:01:43.910> look<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.540> I<00:01:47.710> usually<00:01:48.710> cut<00:01:49.310> apart

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
spring look to it I usually cut apart

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.150 
spring look to it I usually cut apart
each<00:01:50.119> stem<00:01:50.509> because<00:01:50.990> some<00:01:51.440> of<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.650> stems<00:01:51.950> are

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
each stem because some of the stems are

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.520 
each stem because some of the stems are
real<00:01:52.400> long<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.479> we<00:01:53.630> don't<00:01:53.840> need<00:01:53.990> that<00:01:54.170> kind<00:01:54.410> of

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
real long and we don't need that kind of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.730 
real long and we don't need that kind of
length<00:01:54.710> in<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.070> arrangement<00:01:59.440> so<00:02:00.440> we'll<00:02:00.590> keep

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
length in the arrangement so we'll keep

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.730 
length in the arrangement so we'll keep
it<00:02:00.890> kind<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.250> short<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.880> compact<00:02:02.570> that<00:02:02.960> way<00:02:03.560> if

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
it kind of short and compact that way if

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.290 
it kind of short and compact that way if
you<00:02:03.860> use<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.160> on<00:02:04.250> your<00:02:04.310> table<00:02:04.850> during<00:02:05.030> the

Easter dinner you won't have to move the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.430 
Easter dinner you won't have to move the
arrangement<00:02:08.239> you<00:02:08.330> can<00:02:08.360> leave<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.840> right<00:02:08.989> there

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
arrangement you can leave it right there

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.500 
arrangement you can leave it right there
people<00:02:09.739> can<00:02:09.920> see<00:02:10.390> over<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.540> or<00:02:11.780> through<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:13.510> and

people can see over it or through it and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.570 
people can see over it or through it and
right<00:02:14.810> now<00:02:14.959> what<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.320> really<00:02:15.620> popular<00:02:15.860> too<00:02:16.340> is

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
right now what is really popular too is

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.729 
right now what is really popular too is
the<00:02:16.850> grass<00:02:17.200> very<00:02:18.200> natural-looking

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
the grass very natural-looking

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.210 
the grass very natural-looking
arrangement<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:21.350> we<00:02:21.500> use<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> little<00:02:21.890> bit<00:02:22.040> of

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
arrangement so we use a little bit of

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.240 
arrangement so we use a little bit of
grass<00:02:22.400> in<00:02:22.700> here

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.720 

I'm<00:02:28.250> thinking<00:02:28.969> in<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:29.360> arrangement<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:30.730> might

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
I'm thinking in this arrangement I might

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.530 
I'm thinking in this arrangement I might
use<00:02:31.879> a<00:02:31.909> little<00:02:32.060> nest<00:02:32.890> with<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.920> bird<00:02:34.069> in<00:02:34.579> it<00:02:34.790> put

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
use a little nest with a bird in it put

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.720 
use a little nest with a bird in it put
a<00:02:35.569> little<00:02:35.719> bit<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.930> glue<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.920> try<00:02:37.700> and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.699 
a little bit of glue on that I try and
stick<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.780> foliage<00:02:39.290> in<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
stick it to the foliage in the

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.759 
stick it to the foliage in the
arrangement<00:02:40.959> we'll<00:02:41.959> put<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.200> little<00:02:42.439> bit<00:02:42.650> of
