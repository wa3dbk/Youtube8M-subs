I'll make a couple of Units like droning
up<00:00:02.669> more<00:00:02.970> but<00:00:03.570> but<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.080> last<00:00:04.290> thing<00:00:04.560> you<00:00:04.710> want

he keeps bringing more zealots or
something<00:00:26.400> then<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.820> make<00:00:26.910> like<00:00:27.150> 12<00:00:27.510> or

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810

overlooked but I don't see any on the
other<00:00:48.660> hand<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.230> saw<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.770> his<00:00:49.950> Forge<00:00:50.250> is

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
other hand I saw that his Forge is

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.060 
other hand I saw that his Forge is
upgrading<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.140> usually<00:00:52.620> something

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
upgrading and that is usually something

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.970 
upgrading and that is usually something
like<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.820> don't<00:00:54.030> see<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.530> Corsair

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
like you don't see you the Corsair

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.889 
like you don't see you the Corsair
doesn't<00:00:56.340> comma<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.030> very<00:00:57.239> late<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
doesn't comma or it's very late and the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.139 
doesn't comma or it's very late and the
forge<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.440> creating<00:00:58.890> those<00:00:59.609> are<00:00:59.850> usually

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
forge is up creating those are usually

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.299 
forge is up creating those are usually
signs<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.780> he's<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.199> go<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:02.039> math

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
signs that he's going to go like math

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.630 
signs that he's going to go like math
see<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> lot<00:01:02.820> early<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.329> or<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.739> he<00:01:04.860> even<00:01:05.339> has

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
see a lot early on or and if he even has

see a lot early on or and if he even has
a<00:01:05.670> very<00:01:06.030> late<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.540> simulator<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.890> all

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
a very late that simulator or not at all

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.980 
a very late that simulator or not at all
um<00:01:08.570> then<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.740> usually<00:01:11.250> even<00:01:11.990> more

occurrence or don't have is that they're

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.440 
occurrence or don't have is that they're
huge<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:37.080> second<00:03:37.410> thing<00:03:37.440> is<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:37.799> are

the bare hands they're not to goethe on

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.979 
the bare hands they're not to goethe on
an<00:03:43.650> attacking<00:03:44.100> munis<00:03:44.579> against<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.299> but<00:03:45.510> when<00:03:45.959> I

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
an attacking munis against it but when I

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.420 
an attacking munis against it but when I
have<00:03:46.230> all<00:03:46.410> these<00:03:46.560> buildings<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.190> mineral

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
have all these buildings and mineral

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.699 
have all these buildings and mineral
alliances<00:03:47.910> someone<00:03:48.209> has<00:03:48.360> my<00:03:48.510> cover<00:03:48.810> however<00:03:49.650> i

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
alliances someone has my cover however i

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.069 
alliances someone has my cover however i
was<00:03:49.920> already<00:03:50.220> able<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:50.850> longing<00:03:51.030> down<00:03:51.360> slow

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
was already able just longing down slow

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.190 
was already able just longing down slow
him<00:03:52.230> down<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.440> great<00:03:52.709> deal<00:03:53.780> like<00:03:54.780> over<00:03:55.019> there<00:03:55.140> I

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
him down a great deal like over there I

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.840 
him down a great deal like over there I
definitely<00:03:55.739> was<00:03:56.010> truly<00:03:56.310> careless<00:03:56.700> with<00:03:56.820> my

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
definitely was truly careless with my

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.370 
definitely was truly careless with my
meters<00:03:57.239> i<00:03:57.329> shouldn'ta<00:03:57.660> forgotten<00:03:58.079> that<00:03:58.230> you

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
meters i shouldn'ta forgotten that you

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.170 
meters i shouldn'ta forgotten that you
really<00:03:58.620> obvious<00:03:59.280> like<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.640> wouldn't<00:04:00.030> be<00:04:00.120> able

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
really obvious like I wouldn't be able

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.330 
really obvious like I wouldn't be able
to<00:04:00.390> kill<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:00.690> arc<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:01.140> which<00:04:01.980> he<00:04:02.190> was

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
to kill that arc on which he was

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.130 
to kill that arc on which he was
morphing<00:04:02.820> so<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:03.360> should<00:04:03.630> have<00:04:03.720> just<00:04:03.900> dropped

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
morphing so I should have just dropped

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.990 
morphing so I should have just dropped
it<00:04:04.350> down<00:04:04.470> got<00:04:04.799> in<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.040> maybe<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.310> couple<00:04:05.579> hits<00:04:05.790> at

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
it down got in it maybe a couple hits at

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.690 
it down got in it maybe a couple hits at
editor<00:04:06.810> at<00:04:07.079> most<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.620> then<00:04:07.680> ran<00:04:07.920> away<00:04:08.040> but

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
editor at most and then ran away but

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.150 
editor at most and then ran away but
over<00:04:08.940> here<00:04:09.150> there<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:09.510> totally<00:04:10.290> lost<00:04:10.500> immunised

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
over here there I totally lost immunised

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.740 
over here there I totally lost immunised
uselessly<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:12.060> should<00:04:12.510> have<00:04:12.600> been<00:04:12.690> more

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
uselessly I should have been more

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.159 
uselessly I should have been more
careful<00:04:13.110> with<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:14.660> another<00:04:15.660> he's<00:04:15.900> in<00:04:16.049> his

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
careful with that another he's in his

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.190 
careful with that another he's in his
mandal<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:17.209> I'm<00:04:18.209> kind<00:04:18.450> of<00:04:18.479> mass<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.840> hydras

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
mandal and I'm kind of mass in hydras

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.810 
mandal and I'm kind of mass in hydras
well<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.650> my<00:04:19.739> economy<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:20.340> up<00:04:20.549> and

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
well and my economy is up and

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.270 
well and my economy is up and
just<00:04:22.000> begin<00:04:22.720> massing<00:04:23.200> units<00:04:23.560> without<00:04:23.770> making

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
just begin massing units without making

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.440 
just begin massing units without making
too<00:04:24.310> many<00:04:24.580> drones<00:04:25.830> then<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:27.250> can<00:04:27.700> also<00:04:27.850> expand

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
too many drones then I can also expand

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.770 
too many drones then I can also expand
and<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:29.290> brought<00:04:29.860> over<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.160> drone<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.180> i<00:04:31.210> can

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
and I brought over a drone so that i can

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.030 
and I brought over a drone so that i can
get<00:04:32.020> at<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.140> new<00:04:32.350> expansion<00:04:32.770> out<00:04:32.860> then

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
get at that new expansion out then

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.160 
get at that new expansion out then
especially<00:04:33.340> in<00:04:33.700> Heartbreak<00:04:34.240> Ridge<00:04:34.270> getting

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
especially in Heartbreak Ridge getting

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.290 
especially in Heartbreak Ridge getting
that<00:04:35.320> expansion<00:04:35.740> up<00:04:36.040> is<00:04:36.250> huge<00:04:36.640> because<00:04:36.880> then

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
that expansion up is huge because then

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.140 
that expansion up is huge because then
you<00:04:37.480> will<00:04:37.600> be<00:04:38.170> able<00:04:38.290> to<00:04:38.440> take<00:04:39.220> your<00:04:39.580> control

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
you will be able to take your control

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.520 
you will be able to take your control
over<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.600> map<00:04:40.780> much<00:04:41.140> easier<00:04:42.300> on<00:04:43.300> like<00:04:44.080> if<00:04:44.380> you

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
over the map much easier on like if you

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.110 
over the map much easier on like if you
delay<00:04:44.830> too<00:04:44.890> much<00:04:45.310> then<00:04:45.640> it's<00:04:45.790> going<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.030> be

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
delay too much then it's going to be

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.510 
delay too much then it's going to be
very<00:04:46.270> hard<00:04:46.570> for<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.930> so<00:04:47.920> I<00:04:47.950> attack<00:04:48.280> with<00:04:48.310> my

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
very hard for you so I attack with my

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.250 
very hard for you so I attack with my
hydras<00:04:48.970> bring<00:04:49.270> out<00:04:49.420> these<00:04:49.600> mutants<00:04:50.020> as<00:04:50.080> well

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
hydras bring out these mutants as well

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.800 
hydras bring out these mutants as well
but<00:04:50.650> are<00:04:50.890> trying<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.580> avoid<00:04:51.790> those<00:04:52.060> arkin<00:04:52.510> hits

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
but are trying to avoid those arkin hits

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.930 
but are trying to avoid those arkin hits
a<00:04:52.900> bit<00:04:53.080> but<00:04:53.290> these<00:04:53.860> five<00:04:54.130> meters<00:04:54.550> won't<00:04:54.760> make

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
a bit but these five meters won't make

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.610 
a bit but these five meters won't make
that<00:04:55.240> huge<00:04:55.660> of<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.900> difference<00:04:56.290> at<00:04:56.410> this<00:04:56.560> point

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
that huge of a difference at this point

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.760 
that huge of a difference at this point
anymore<00:04:57.690> now<00:04:58.690> none<00:04:59.020> of<00:04:59.170> that<00:04:59.200> I'm<00:04:59.560> just

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
anymore now none of that I'm just

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.560 
anymore now none of that I'm just
massing<00:05:00.190> hydras<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:00.730> he's<00:05:01.120> completely

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
massing hydras and he's completely

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.800 
massing hydras and he's completely
unprepared<00:05:02.170> he<00:05:02.980> cut<00:05:03.190> our<00:05:03.400> and<00:05:03.880> he<00:05:04.330> was<00:05:04.480> forced

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
unprepared he cut our and he was forced

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.470 
unprepared he cut our and he was forced
to<00:05:04.900> make<00:05:05.020> kind<00:05:05.230> of<00:05:05.350> some<00:05:05.560> archons<00:05:06.450> instead<00:05:07.450> of

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
to make kind of some archons instead of

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.190 
to make kind of some archons instead of
high<00:05:07.720> templars<00:05:08.200> and<00:05:08.760> that<00:05:09.760> allowed<00:05:10.150> me<00:05:10.180> me<00:05:10.960> too

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
high templars and that allowed me me too

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.770 
high templars and that allowed me me too
kind<00:05:11.470> of<00:05:11.560> attack<00:05:11.830> me<00:05:11.860> before<00:05:12.520> he<00:05:12.880> has<00:05:13.000> too<00:05:13.660> many

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
kind of attack me before he has too many

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.350 
kind of attack me before he has too many
psionic<00:05:14.410> storms<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.550> the<00:05:15.760> game<00:05:16.240> is

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
psionic storms and and the game is

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.790 
psionic storms and and the game is
pretty<00:05:16.510> much<00:05:16.660> over<00:05:16.840> when<00:05:17.110> i'm<00:05:17.230> able<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.530> break

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
pretty much over when i'm able to break

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.920 
pretty much over when i'm able to break
him<00:05:17.950> up<00:05:18.250> to<00:05:18.460> this<00:05:18.610> point<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:19.150> i<00:05:19.570> have<00:05:19.780> this

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
him up to this point and i have this
