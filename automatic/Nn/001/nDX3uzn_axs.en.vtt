something<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.380> actually<00:02:47.560> figured<00:02:48.069> out

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
something that I actually figured out

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.900 
something that I actually figured out
for<00:02:48.310> myself

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
for myself

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.010 
for myself
and<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:49.480> should<00:02:49.660> probably<00:02:49.720> have<00:02:49.959> it

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
and I should probably have it

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:00.970 
and I should probably have it
and<00:02:52.110> we<00:02:52.320> make<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.920> shovel<00:02:53.700> also

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.520 

and<00:03:01.550> most<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.940> what<00:03:01.970> I've<00:03:03.099> learned<00:03:04.099> in

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
and most of what I've learned in

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.860 
and most of what I've learned in
Minecraft<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:07.360> figured<00:03:08.360> out<00:03:08.450> from<00:03:08.660> watching

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
Minecraft I figured out from watching

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.140 
Minecraft I figured out from watching
videos<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.860> looking<00:03:10.310> at<00:03:10.430> websites

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.490 

this<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.299> one<00:03:17.480> thing<00:03:17.659> I<00:03:17.780> actually<00:03:17.930> figured<00:03:18.409> out

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
this is one thing I actually figured out

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.180 
this is one thing I actually figured out
on<00:03:18.680> my<00:03:18.709> own

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.180 

I<00:03:26.250> should<00:03:26.940> also<00:03:27.060> say<00:03:27.240> this<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:28.230> test<00:03:28.890> what

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
I should also say this is a test what

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.700 
I should also say this is a test what
I'm<00:03:29.310> doing<00:03:29.610> here<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.090> test<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.810> my<00:03:31.230> ability

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
I'm doing here is a test of my ability

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
I'm doing here is a test of my ability
to<00:03:31.740> record<00:03:32.870> video<00:03:35.120> during<00:03:36.120> gameplay

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.570 

and<00:03:38.819> my<00:03:39.450> first<00:03:39.810> attempt<00:03:40.379> at<00:03:40.470> this<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:40.950> had<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
and my first attempt at this I had the

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.610 
and my first attempt at this I had the

win the game running into window and the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.520 
win the game running into window and the
and<00:03:47.129> it<00:03:47.640> performance<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.659> okay<00:03:49.019> but<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.349> looked

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
and it performance is okay but it looked

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.660 
and it performance is okay but it looked
it<00:03:50.010> looked<00:03:50.040> horrible

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
it looked horrible

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.650 
it looked horrible
you<00:03:50.819> know<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.090> resolutions<00:03:51.690> was<00:03:52.110> crap

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.350 

the<00:03:55.170> next<00:03:55.530> time

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.690 

the<00:03:58.900> second<00:03:59.260> time<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.440> tried<00:03:59.770> this<00:03:59.800> I<00:04:00.040> tried<00:04:00.520> the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
the second time I tried this I tried the

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.839 
the second time I tried this I tried the
full-screen<00:04:01.120> mode

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.050 

and

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.980 

for<00:04:08.630> that<00:04:08.780> one

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
for that one

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.330 
for that one
look<00:04:10.500> up<00:04:10.650> here

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.270 

the<00:04:14.930> when<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.019> tried<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.380> full-screen<00:04:16.829> mode<00:04:16.950> it

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
the when I tried the full-screen mode it

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.400 
the when I tried the full-screen mode it
looked<00:04:17.430> great<00:04:17.700> but<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.180> was<00:04:18.299> very<00:04:18.660> laggy<00:04:19.019> you

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
looked great but it was very laggy you

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.319 
looked great but it was very laggy you
know<00:04:19.530> my<00:04:19.709> computer<00:04:20.070> was<00:04:20.639> having<00:04:20.940> trouble

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
know my computer was having trouble

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:28.909 
know my computer was having trouble
recording<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:25.730> playing<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.850> actual<00:04:26.970> game

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
recording and playing the actual game

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.330 
recording and playing the actual game
okay<00:04:29.520> next<00:04:29.819> step<00:04:30.150> here<00:04:30.449> is<00:04:30.479> to<00:04:30.749> make<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.379> furnace

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
okay next step here is to make a furnace

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.560 
okay next step here is to make a furnace
so<00:04:32.699> I'll<00:04:32.789> do<00:04:32.999> that

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.450 

with<00:04:37.990> this<00:04:38.110> cobblestone

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.770 

drop<00:04:44.090> that<00:04:44.270> over<00:04:44.330> here

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
drop that over here

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.379 
drop that over here
okay<00:04:47.380> I<00:04:47.410> think<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.770> need<00:04:47.920> some<00:04:48.100> wood

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:58.030 

chopped<00:04:51.750> down<00:04:51.930> another<00:04:52.169> tree

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.680 

this<00:04:59.040> time<00:04:59.310> what<00:04:59.490> I'm<00:04:59.610> doing

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
this time what I'm doing

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.290 
this time what I'm doing
now<00:05:01.200> normally<00:05:01.650> my<00:05:01.800> computer<00:05:02.280> my<00:05:02.820> computer<00:05:03.180> has

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
now normally my computer my computer has

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.890 
now normally my computer my computer has
a<00:05:03.330> lot<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.140> resolution<00:05:04.950> on<00:05:05.040> the<00:05:05.130> screen<00:05:05.900> the

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
a lot of resolution on the screen the

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.390 
a lot of resolution on the screen the
native<00:05:07.200> resolution<00:05:07.230> on<00:05:08.010> the<00:05:08.160> monitor<00:05:08.520> is<00:05:10.400> 1920

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
native resolution on the monitor is 1920

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.689 
native resolution on the monitor is 1920
by<00:05:11.730> 1200<00:05:13.010> which<00:05:14.010> is<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.310> lot<00:05:14.670> of<00:05:14.790> pixels

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.260 

for<00:05:18.150> this<00:05:18.330> recording<00:05:19.199> I<00:05:19.440> changed<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.820> I'm

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
for this recording I changed the I'm

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.180 
for this recording I changed the I'm
doing<00:05:21.600> a<00:05:21.690> full<00:05:21.900> screen<00:05:22.199> but<00:05:22.500> I<00:05:22.530> changed<00:05:22.830> the

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
doing a full screen but I changed the

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:35.230 
doing a full screen but I changed the
screen<00:05:23.550> resolution<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:28.010> 1152<00:05:29.010> by<00:05:30.380> 864

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.749 

so<00:05:35.780> I<00:05:35.840> thought<00:05:36.020> I'd<00:05:36.139> see<00:05:36.350> how<00:05:36.380> how<00:05:37.340> this<00:05:37.520> goes

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
so I thought I'd see how how this goes

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.260 
so I thought I'd see how how this goes
it's

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
it's

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.300 
it's
I<00:05:39.360> don't<00:05:39.870> know<00:05:39.930> how<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:40.140> looks<00:05:40.470> but

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
I don't know how it looks but

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.010 
I don't know how it looks but
performance<00:05:42.150> is<00:05:42.270> pretty<00:05:42.570> good<00:05:42.750> it's<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:42.990> little

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
performance is pretty good it's a little

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.570 
performance is pretty good it's a little
bit<00:05:43.650> sluggish<00:05:44.490> but<00:05:45.030> not<00:05:45.330> too<00:05:45.510> bad

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
bit sluggish but not too bad

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.100 
bit sluggish but not too bad
maybe<00:05:47.580> I<00:05:47.670> can<00:05:47.880> actually<00:05:47.970> do<00:05:48.300> this

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
maybe I can actually do this

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.959 
maybe I can actually do this
oops

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
you have to have a furnace and you can

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.540 
you have to have a furnace and you can
fuel<00:06:07.569> it<00:06:07.719> with<00:06:07.899> wooden<00:06:08.229> planks<00:06:08.770> so<00:06:08.949> put<00:06:09.430> those

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
fuel it with wooden planks so put those

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.170 
fuel it with wooden planks so put those
in<00:06:09.729> the<00:06:09.819> bottom<00:06:10.289> but<00:06:11.289> if<00:06:11.409> you<00:06:11.529> put<00:06:11.830> logs<00:06:12.490> you

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
in the bottom but if you put logs you

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.029 
in the bottom but if you put logs you
know<00:06:13.300> wood<00:06:13.809> that<00:06:13.990> has<00:06:14.110> not<00:06:14.409> been<00:06:14.680> turned<00:06:14.860> into

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
know wood that has not been turned into

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.170 
know wood that has not been turned into
planks<00:06:15.520> yet<00:06:15.699> up<00:06:16.149> here<00:06:17.490> this<00:06:18.490> will<00:06:18.729> turn<00:06:18.969> this

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
planks yet up here this will turn this

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.859 
planks yet up here this will turn this
into<00:06:19.479> charcoal<00:06:20.610> which<00:06:21.610> looks<00:06:21.939> just<00:06:22.330> like<00:06:22.539> coal

00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:22.869 
into charcoal which looks just like coal

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:26.519 
into charcoal which looks just like coal
and<00:06:23.520> performs<00:06:24.520> just<00:06:24.669> like<00:06:25.029> coal<00:06:25.330> but<00:06:26.319> it's

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:26.529 
and performs just like coal but it's

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:32.909 
and performs just like coal but it's
called<00:06:27.189> charcoal<00:06:27.669> and<00:06:27.789> it<00:06:27.879> comes<00:06:28.059> from<00:06:28.270> wood

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:37.209 

so<00:06:33.610> let's<00:06:34.150> see

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.710 

just<00:06:37.729> grab<00:06:38.059> a<00:06:38.089> couple<00:06:38.209> of<00:06:38.629> these

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
just grab a couple of these

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
just grab a couple of these
then<00:06:41.230> you<00:06:41.320> make<00:06:41.500> a<00:06:41.530> torch<00:06:41.890> by<00:06:42.190> putting<00:06:42.580> a<00:06:42.670> stick

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
then you make a torch by putting a stick

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.740 
then you make a torch by putting a stick
underneath<00:06:44.740> a<00:06:44.980> piece<00:06:45.220> of<00:06:45.400> coal<00:06:45.730> and<00:06:46.480> you<00:06:46.570> can

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
underneath a piece of coal and you can

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.510 
underneath a piece of coal and you can
see<00:06:46.990> it<00:06:47.080> does<00:06:47.260> say<00:06:47.470> charcoal<00:06:48.100> they're<00:06:48.280> not

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
see it does say charcoal they're not

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.360 
see it does say charcoal they're not
cold

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370

and boom

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.450 
and boom
we<00:06:54.180> have<00:06:54.419> torches

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.950 

which<00:06:59.030> you<00:06:59.360> can

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
which you can

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.490 
which you can
oops
