00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.920
 public please before hand to the 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.550

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.730

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.560
 issue the girls that came out today 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.900
 ponchadas as they will explain to dad 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.470
 that 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.980
 I'll see them not for 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.980
 do not 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.880
 the next comedian we do not know if he has 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.200
 had sex in the last 24 hours by 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.920
 please just with loud applause at 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.920
 Mr. Freddy BeltrÃ¡n 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.839
 the answer to Ivan Marin is no 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.020
 on the canvas 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.240
 a little while ago the movie premiered what 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.310
 impossible it was not said any one saw it 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.220
 which is about the history of a 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.640
 family that survived a tsunami but 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 there is 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.040
 the catastrophic scene is in a pool 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.260
 those scenes just lacked calm 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.110
 light is not very gang 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.760
 and puna and here the tsunami yo yo that very 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.890
 traumatized with that movie to those who 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.960
 you were seen you know what I'm talking about 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.580
 but the worst thing is that the next day I 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.580
 they called that I was a pool 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.280
 but why is it that suddenly a 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.510
 tsunami 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.970
 tambos and amos anapoima 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.200
 it does not matter suddenly a tsunami arrives 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.960
 that pool plan instead of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.130
 rest one as it stresses more 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.070
 because originally pools and cool but 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.300
 your head starts thinking to my god a 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.300
 panning you naked 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.289
 I'm like chubby scars on a 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.239
 pool should not be too ugly 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.129
 to get attention but not so 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.260
 nice not to create the video 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.790
 obviously a man is simple yes or no 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.670
 boys a man violence in pool 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.170
 already a shorts and already and no longer 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.349
 but that yes guys please no 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.750
 Take bermuda that looks very ticket that 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.460
 Hawaiian with pastel color 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.200
 I stay out of the pool I am very 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.569
 nasty grossman getting up that 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.569
 sheath 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.160
 and even more annoying the one who takes a 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.830
 soccer shorts 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.760
 and the damned sit on the edge that 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.760
 You see the white mesh 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.630
 and here the friends of the neighborhood 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.390
 also a woman starts with tone there 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.710
 that you have to carry blockers 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.230
 women buy a swimsuit 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.540
 but some get into the pool with 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.430
 pants and shirt 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.290
 that's how it happens girls went to the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.930
 hairdresser and will last one hour 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.380
 arranging and as soon as they come out they put on a 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.030
 cap 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.560
 is that soon the blog is damaged see 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.660
 nothing 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.810
 and I looked at the blocker the blocker there 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.250
 that apply it do not anoint it there are people who 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.250
 it seems that is your face with that 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.819
 but one a pool looks like a 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.450
 mime convention does not think that 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.450
 any moment 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.210
 and also what gives me more laughter are the 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:44.570
 bald is this address 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.440
 is to apply sunscreen here but the 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.330
 red head 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.350
 here white red that seems with a 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.350
 residence bulb 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.580
 and the children who sin put those 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.490
 floats that pulls inflated since 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.010
 inflate arms and arms 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.010
 is a cheeky daddy nobody daddy 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.669
 follow the towel obviously the towel is not 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.570
 is to dry is to mark 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.570
 territory 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.320
 for which are the tables to ascend the 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.660
 towel and 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.600
 it might not be that you do not feel in 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.390
 all day and put the towel and the 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.310
 flip flops on chairs 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.569
 I'm not happy from the pool watching 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.460
 that 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.460
 I have not touched the good towel 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.659
 obviously one does not reach the pool myself 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.520
 sometimes I feel like stupid when 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.760
 there is say bathe before entering the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.050
 swimming pool 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.390
 I am going to bathe 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.610
 they do not make him put on the ridiculous hat 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.320
 and it is that for the hair that one remains 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.370
 like a retractable spheroid 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.100
 good 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.070
 and childhood there is where a guy is known 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.169
 how shy it is because if they are of those 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.800
 manes that go to the pool and grope in 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.500
 Water 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.100
 so they do like this 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.170
 nokia ticket but whose girls of those 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.560
 manes that do not like the foot but 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.560
 crouch 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.610
 with the manes that intimacy says nothing 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.550
 and not my love, turn off the light, do not look at me 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.400
 he does not look at me 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.310
 violet and I did not I never understood those 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.350
 pool games are not supposed to 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.770
 to a pool to swim not to stay 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.099
 still there 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.110
 is that I do not know anything but even worse is 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:56.099
 those guys who walk through the bag that 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.099
 it goes like this by the edge 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.210
 that's the cure 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.920
 there is not the most daring thing is to sink 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.090
 background bands 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.669
 those games start seven missiles 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:31.740
 I've never had fun with the slide 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:34.699
 he has a sheath that slips and 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.699
 he puts the shorts 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.849
 and also when you mess that does not 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.830
 They cover my nose, I'm not my god 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.839
 I believe that one enjoyed the pool 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:50.409
 it was childhood one of children and had fun 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:52.509
 in that pod so that the pool 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:54.529
 one half only took three hours of 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:56.799
 genetic more 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:07:00.109
 you see children that their fingers like 

00:06:56.799 --> 00:07:02.689
 they look like raisins and it's also for the 

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:04.830
 house on top with the towel like this 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:08.750
 shivering 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.750
 Mommy, leave me another mouse 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:15.809
 but has a premium no mommy is 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:15.809
 I am me 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:31.030
 and the worst is when that is water dries 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:34.000
 to keep going up rolled in salt and 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:36.340
 hard hair very poor 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.930
 women but not one who looks 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.930
 got into the point it was a pool 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.990
 and the last time they invited me was to a 

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.730
 paseo berrÃ­o but those impressions 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.510
 will attract after many thanks 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.510
 very friendly
