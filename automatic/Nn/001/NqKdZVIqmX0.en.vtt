00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.530 
went and got a recordable singing card
and<00:01:08.229> took<00:01:09.130> it<00:01:09.250> apart<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.729> played<00:01:10.060> around<00:01:10.240> it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
and took it apart and played around it

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:18.580 
and took it apart and played around it
to<00:01:10.750> see<00:01:10.930> how<00:01:11.080> it<00:01:11.110> worked

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.530 

once<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.010> parts<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.400> needed<00:01:20.730> i<00:01:20.910> sized

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
once I have the parts I needed i sized

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.180 
once I have the parts I needed i sized
them<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.140> make<00:01:22.290> sure<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> boombox<00:01:22.800> was

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
them out to make sure the boombox was

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.070 
them out to make sure the boombox was
big<00:01:23.340> enough<00:01:23.370> to<00:01:23.760> set<00:01:24.030> each<00:01:24.180> component<00:01:24.750> inside

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
big enough to set each component inside

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
big enough to set each component inside
I<00:01:27.140> use<00:01:28.140> tin<00:01:28.410> foil<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.770> make<00:01:29.010> a<00:01:29.040> stencil<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
I use tin foil to make a stencil to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.110 
I use tin foil to make a stencil to
sculpt<00:01:30.060> my<00:01:30.210> boombox<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:34.700> put<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.760> piece<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
sculpt my boombox on I put the piece of

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.480 
sculpt my boombox on I put the piece of
tin<00:01:36.270> foil<00:01:36.510> inside<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.050> plastic<00:01:37.290> bag<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.950> use

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
tin foil inside a plastic bag and use

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280 
tin foil inside a plastic bag and use
black<00:01:38.730> acrylic<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.540> sculpt<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.960> front<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.230> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
black acrylic to sculpt the front of the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:51.630 
black acrylic to sculpt the front of the
boombox<00:01:40.440> on

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.980 

once<00:01:52.640> I<00:01:52.760> had<00:01:52.910> my<00:01:53.090> front<00:01:53.330> panel<00:01:53.540> done

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
once I had my front panel done

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.050 
once I had my front panel done
I<00:01:54.020> created<00:01:54.620> the<00:01:54.740> rest<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.100> pieces<00:01:55.430> two

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
I created the rest of the pieces two

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.420 
I created the rest of the pieces two
sides<00:01:56.330> at<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.720> bottom<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.560> top<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.280> back

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
sides at the bottom the top and the back

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
sides at the bottom the top and the back
piece

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.780 

I<00:02:12.510> used<00:02:13.379> gray<00:02:13.590> acrylic<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.250> sculpt<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.610> knob

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
I used gray acrylic to sculpt the knob

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:29.270 
I used gray acrylic to sculpt the knob
that<00:02:15.150> made<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.420> music<00:02:15.720> play<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:28.160> started<00:02:29.160> off

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
that made the music play I started off

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.860 
that made the music play I started off
by<00:02:29.310> gluing<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.849> circuit<00:02:30.180> board<00:02:30.360> onto<00:02:30.599> the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
by gluing the circuit board onto the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.460 
by gluing the circuit board onto the
inside<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.319> back<00:02:31.470> panel

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.380 

once<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.650> had<00:02:39.860> set<00:02:40.099> I<00:02:40.340> glued<00:02:40.909> the<00:02:41.060> speakers

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
once that had set I glued the speakers

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.009 
once that had set I glued the speakers
to<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:41.629> back<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:43.450> didn't<00:02:44.450> put<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.690> speakers

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
to the back I didn't put the speakers

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.110 
to the back I didn't put the speakers
