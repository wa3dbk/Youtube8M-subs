00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.380
 now release it 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.429
 so you're a masseuse 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:25.720
 and I was saying that there are no men in 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.720
 this party for those who feel 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.879
 I like to be comfortable 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.720
 that little bird 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.780
 two 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.440
 yes 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.790
 and not for second marriages is better 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.770
 when everyone is a little more 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.270
 old and beyond that work is 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.800
 makes a very nice woman that 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.170
 she talked a lot about her ex-husband she 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.720
 Horrible in bed and very clumsy without 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.680
 very irritating sense of humor I hope 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.680
 that was not a woman 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.869
 you are a loser 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.350
 this new client is the ex - wife of something 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.270
 I've been listening to that woman say 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.870
 the worst things about man that from 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.120
 it really starts to like me a lot 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.930
 yellow color we start to get out here 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.440
 that delicious dish spaghetti 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.560
 but it was the only thing that knew cooking 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.960
 it's like a guy paisa albert is not not you 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.440
 if you can avoid staying with a bad one 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.440
 you would not do that 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.900
 how many calories does something have because 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.320
 I feel like I just spent the night with 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.320
 my wife 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.570
 You are doing 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.520
 when people ask you why we 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.900
 We divorce what you say why you tell them 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.750
 that was because I was a monster 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.690
 tocapelotas 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.260
 6 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.260
 two
