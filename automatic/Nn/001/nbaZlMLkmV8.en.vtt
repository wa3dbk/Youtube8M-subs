 known and is very easy to read 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.680
 because it is easy to read because that 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.200
 it tells you as a story what 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.690
 this man had to the truth that 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.159
 I do not know if it is true or not, it is 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.320
 one thing that tells you in mode 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.580
 history talks about humanities and if it is 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.649
 true or not 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.950
 and see how nice I am there are some books 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.950
 his 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.450
 in mind that he had a rich father 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.880
 poor father be his father really that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.590
 had one is not that he was poor but if 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.840
 was poor in Italy with respect to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.180
 money was an employee an employee of the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.860
 government and then there was the father of his 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.960
 best friend who did have a 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.810
 mentality a mentality rich in the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.880
 mentality of a person to risk 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.310
 investing from having few benefits 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.350
 personal because the benefits of their 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.260
 projects reinvest them to follow 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.440
 generating a cash-flow and so on 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.390
 achieve therefore a financial freedom and 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.740
 with the example of these two parents then 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.110
 and from here he was advancing in his in his 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.000
 life and good then riding his first 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.300

 well in the person of success that is to day 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.550
 from today 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.710
 the book as that is very very 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.160
 recommended for any entrepreneur 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.140
 for any staff because the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.070
 problem of money especially in the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.290
 Latin societies is that it is a subject 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.200
 taboo I do not know if to you in your house 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.090
 They have spoken to you about money if the ropes 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.430
 they are talking about money as vice raimon 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.620
 sales are money level class 1 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.030
 money 2 money 3 instead of technology and 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.250
 music or history of the Gothic kings 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.920
 but as it is not the case there is a sentence and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.860
 is that if we know little of something little 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.810
 we can do about it therefore 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.400
 I invite you to start reading about 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.590

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.370

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.680
 to have a more full ability 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.110
 more satisfying and more so with what 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.160
 it comes on because we are 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.510

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.430

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.730
