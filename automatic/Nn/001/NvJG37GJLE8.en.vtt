so<00:02:37.799> it's<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.980> little<00:02:38.220> cheap<00:02:38.459> achieve<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.269> they

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
so it's a little cheap achieve that they

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.960 
so it's a little cheap achieve that they
use<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.109> same<00:02:40.140> sounds<00:02:40.769> but<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.519> cool<00:02:41.730> you

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
use the same sounds but it's so cool you

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.839 
use the same sounds but it's so cool you
get<00:02:42.180> armor<00:02:42.840> inbound<00:02:43.560> missile<00:02:43.889> attack<00:02:46.849> local

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
get armor inbound missile attack local

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.949 
get armor inbound missile attack local
reactors<00:02:48.299> overloading

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.390 

so<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.019> give<00:02:52.230> all<00:02:52.379> flight<00:02:52.680> sounds<00:02:53.129> so<00:02:53.250> it

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
so you give all flight sounds so it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.009 
so you give all flight sounds so it
appears<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.790> be<00:02:53.909> Jarvis<00:02:54.359> you<00:02:54.540> know<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:54.870> not

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
appears to be Jarvis you know it's not

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.500 
appears to be Jarvis you know it's not

diagnostic but still it's cool as you

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.080 
diagnostic but still it's cool as you
get<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:01.980> little<00:03:02.069> Jarvis<00:03:02.489> sound<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:02.879> you<00:03:02.939> also

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
