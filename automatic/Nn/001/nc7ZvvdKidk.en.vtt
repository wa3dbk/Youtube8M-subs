00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.110
 awards and universal respect will go to 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.260
 rider but for every victory worth 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.520
 good set of wheels 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.070
 first of all they are made of very 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.090
 durable low alloy steels are very 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.090
 reliable mother 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.680
 The first series of press attaches to the central 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.420
 disc concave shape and sconces do 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.250
 special loops 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.350
 subsequent press is done 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.980
 big from the top those in the middle small 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.650
 Around him 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.989
 let's comfortable but don't let the brake 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.770
 cool does not lose speed and when 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.770
 it's necessary 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.740
 sometimes superimposed and so-called 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.720
 rings this process is called chasing 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.250
 then the suit looks better, besides 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.920
 impose it on the whole 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.640
 extra steel making it still 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.640
 stronger 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.770
 The next press is especially important. 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.050
 pressing the disc into a mold resembling 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.800
 a bowl that prepares it for docking with 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.320
 brakes 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.320
 while laying a special 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.090
 after a long 3 weave drive for racing 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.479
 wheels 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.479
 finally ready 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.740
 then three more are put on 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.870
 small holes which said 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.980
 previously it was thanks to him wheel 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.980
 mounted on the car 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.150
 thereafter, the disk undergoes thorough 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.780
 processing 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.780
 now he is ready 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.210
 to make an experience machine 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.740
 unwraps coiled steel and 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:51.720
 then smoothes down the pipeline 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.490
 distributed steel falls under the knife 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.980
 blades called scissors 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.480
 steel cut at the length of caviar you do 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.480
 put on her company book 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.520
 the operator then divides the steel into 3 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.679
 roll of which then make rings 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.679
 then brazing each ring 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.710
 we have 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.989
 after that the rings are placed in 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.360
 special machine where there is not 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.099
 materials in spike 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.120
 ground off before it gets cold and 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.120
 easy to remove 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.650
 then the rings come under serious 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.140
 press pressure david about them both 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.140
 sides to bend the sides of the naruto 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.330
 from here but get to the next conveyor 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.330
 where are internal 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.690
 This part of the rim is worn with a saddle 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.690
 they put rims on her shell 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.250
 can then grind so that the edges are 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.080
 perfect 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.080
 this malt work is complete 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.490
 the disk is put in here when it starts 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:19.020
 rotate and heat it up inside 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:22.940
 burners result become expanded and 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.940
 risk plunges deeper blog 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.310
 as here begins to cool 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.310
 he is tight fitting beach 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.209
 now these two parts are connected 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.870
 about the welding process they will be the last 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.870
 a week 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.600
 further the wheel is drilled threaded 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.740
 holes to connect the stock 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.750
 valve 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.270
 when 200 done drill start 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.840
 spin in the opposite direction 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.840
 so as not to spoil 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.720
 after painting you valves 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:07.590
 fixed with glue and 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.590
 wrapped in from Lensk 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.250
 these valves will be used for 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.400
 tire swapping 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.630
 the wheel rotates and on about were drawn 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.320
 bright yellow 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.360
 etoken number plate is placed 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.110
 now this wheel is ready to cross 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.110
 home stretch 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.170
 let's hope that along with the car
