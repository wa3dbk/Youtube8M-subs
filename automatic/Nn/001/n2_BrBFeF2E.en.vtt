00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
to move to in Ireland was a tough enough

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.340 
to move to in Ireland was a tough enough
decision<00:00:56.489> because<00:00:57.270> I'm<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:57.809> Leinster

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350

that's<00:00:58.800> where<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> live<00:00:59.309> and<00:01:00.710> whenever<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.890> was

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that's where I live and whenever I was

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.189 
that's where I live and whenever I was
playing<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.609> red<00:01:02.850> rugby<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.629> always<00:01:03.899> used<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
playing on red rugby we always used to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.250 
playing on red rugby we always used to
compete<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.650> conduct<00:01:05.610> competitions<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.080> like

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
compete in conduct competitions so like

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260 
compete in conduct competitions so like
if<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.590> ever<00:01:07.619> did<00:01:08.040> make<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.580> real<00:01:08.790> life<00:01:08.970> it'd

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
if I ever did make it in real life it'd

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.679 
if I ever did make it in real life it'd
be<00:01:09.330> likely<00:01:09.689> died<00:01:10.080> later<00:01:10.970> because<00:01:11.970> there's

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
be likely died later because there's

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.010 
be likely died later because there's
just<00:01:12.780> too<00:01:13.170> many<00:01:13.350> teams<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.310> Leicester<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.030> we

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
just too many teams in Leicester so we

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.910 
just too many teams in Leicester so we
had<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.380> move<00:01:16.560> into<00:01:16.799> connet<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.549> then<00:01:18.360> also<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
had to move into connet and then also I

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.210 
had to move into connet and then also I
got<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> university<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.560> Limerick<00:01:22.560> witches<00:01:22.920> in

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
got a university in Limerick witches in

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.179 
got a university in Limerick witches in
Monster<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.509> heart<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.619> monster

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
Monster it's like the heart of monster

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.450 
Monster it's like the heart of monster
rugby<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.960> I'd<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> monster<00:01:28.950> team<00:01:29.130> train

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
rugby and I'd see the monster team train

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.370 
rugby and I'd see the monster team train
and<00:01:29.670> they're<00:01:29.790> quite<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.090> bit<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.540> sometimes<00:01:31.229> I

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and they're quite a bit and sometimes I

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.620 
and they're quite a bit and sometimes I
go<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.829> watch<00:01:32.009> their<00:01:32.390> practice<00:01:33.390> games

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
go out to watch their practice games

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.710 
go out to watch their practice games
whenever<00:01:34.020> they're<00:01:34.229> training<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.970> I'd

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
whenever they're training there so I'd

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.270 
whenever they're training there so I'd
support<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.470> them<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.159> decided

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
support all of them but I just decided

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.609 
support all of them but I just decided
to<00:01:38.610> go<00:01:38.790> for<00:01:38.820> Connacht<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:41.869> well<00:01:42.869> it's

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
to go for Connacht so I get well it's

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.560 
to go for Connacht so I get well it's
the<00:01:43.799> most<00:01:43.950> likely<00:01:44.250> team<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.909> could<00:01:45.000> transfer<00:01:45.390> to

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the most likely team I could transfer to

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.350 
the most likely team I could transfer to
so<00:01:45.960> that's<00:01:46.380> why<00:01:46.560> pretty<00:01:46.829> much<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.880> 22

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so that's why pretty much so we have 22

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.679 
so that's why pretty much so we have 22
games<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> season<00:01:49.409> before<00:01:50.299> we<00:01:51.299> reach<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
games in the season before we reach the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
games in the season before we reach the
semifinals<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.590> finals<00:01:53.280> if<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.790> manage<00:01:53.970> to

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
semifinals and finals if we do manage to

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.389 
semifinals and finals if we do manage to
get<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.530> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.979> show<00:01:56.130> us

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
episodes I'm just I won't talk about in

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.670 
episodes I'm just I won't talk about in
this<00:04:21.640> series<00:04:21.880> I'll<00:04:22.210> just<00:04:22.390> make<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.680> separate

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
this series I'll just make a separate

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.800 
this series I'll just make a separate
video<00:04:23.860> for

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
video for

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.600 
video for
which<00:04:26.810> would<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.410> easiest<00:04:27.770> thing<00:04:27.889> to<00:04:28.040> do

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
which would be the easiest thing to do

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.290 
which would be the easiest thing to do
but<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.330> have<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:29.780> few<00:04:30.080> ideas<00:04:30.740> for<00:04:31.100> Robi<00:04:31.610> 15<00:04:31.970> it's

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
but I have a few ideas for Robi 15 it's

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.779 
but I have a few ideas for Robi 15 it's
probably<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.720> bit<00:04:32.900> late<00:04:33.139> now<00:04:33.169> but<00:04:33.620> just<00:04:33.789> shown

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
probably a bit late now but just shown

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.120 
probably a bit late now but just shown
what<00:04:35.000> would<00:04:35.840> be<00:04:36.020> good<00:04:36.199> if<00:04:36.320> they<00:04:36.530> implemented

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
what would be good if they implemented

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.550 
what would be good if they implemented
it<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:37.970> run<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.210> camera<00:04:38.690> got<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.990> trailer<00:04:39.259> in

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
it so run the camera got the trailer in

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.310 
it so run the camera got the trailer in
the<00:04:39.680> corner<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.220> I<00:04:40.940> think<00:04:41.690> that's<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:41.990> end<00:04:42.139> of

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
the corner and I think that's the end of

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.219 
the corner and I think that's the end of
the<00:04:42.410> game<00:04:42.620> then<00:04:42.889> we<00:04:43.430> went<00:04:43.610> 29<00:04:44.210> 7<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:47.229> rugby

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
the game then we went 29 7 so rugby

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.890 
the game then we went 29 7 so rugby
gamer<00:04:48.500> again<00:04:49.100> he<00:04:49.430> he<00:04:50.210> ends<00:04:50.419> up<00:04:50.449> getting<00:04:50.660> an

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
gamer again he he ends up getting an

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.620 
gamer again he he ends up getting an
