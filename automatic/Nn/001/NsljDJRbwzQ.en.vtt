more<00:00:09.630> RAM<00:00:09.900> change<00:00:10.769> hard<00:00:11.130> drive<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.290> is<00:00:13.290> it

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
more RAM change hard drive and is it

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.110 
more RAM change hard drive and is it
possible<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:14.070> open<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> device<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:15.059> on

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
possible to open the device and so on

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.429 
possible to open the device and so on
and<00:00:16.100> I<00:00:17.100> would<00:00:17.250> say<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.900> but<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.140> took<00:00:19.320> me

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
and I would say it is but it took me

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.150 
and I would say it is but it took me
like<00:00:22.439> 15<00:00:23.279> screws<00:00:23.970> or<00:00:24.210> something<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.600> so

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
like 15 screws or something like that so

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.250 
like 15 screws or something like that so
and<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> main<00:00:28.260> board<00:00:28.820> how<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.970> looks

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
and this is the main board how it looks

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.490 
and this is the main board how it looks
when<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.890> mountain<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:33.170> if<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> look

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
when it's the mountain and if you look

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.299 
when it's the mountain and if you look
at<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> back<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:36.020> we<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.500> memory

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
at the back of it we see the memory

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
at the back of it we see the memory
slots<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:40.280> there's<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:42.200> available

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
slots here and there's one available

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.990 
slots here and there's one available
slots<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:45.000> memory<00:00:45.360> type<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:46.160> it's<00:00:47.160> two<00:00:47.520> gb<00:00:47.550> by

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
slots the memory type is it's two gb by

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.560 
slots the memory type is it's two gb by
to<00:00:48.059> ram<00:00:49.010> it<00:00:50.010> looks<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> ordinary<00:00:51.059> memory

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
to ram it looks like the ordinary memory

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.029 
to ram it looks like the ordinary memory
slots<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.699> TC<00:00:53.699> 3l<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.960> says<00:00:55.199> i'll<00:00:55.469> make<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
slots and TC 3l it says i'll make it

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.430 
slots and TC 3l it says i'll make it
photo<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.030> attached<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:58.280> and<00:01:00.440> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
photo this and attached to it and the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.609 
photo this and attached to it and the
storage<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:03.180> easy<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.809> replace<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.409> well

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
storage is it's easy to replace as well

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.100 
storage is it's easy to replace as well
and<00:01:05.030> if<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.659> well<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.470> wireless<00:01:09.200> card<00:01:12.110> one

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and if as well as the wireless card one

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.800 
and if as well as the wireless card one
thing<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.560> found<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:14.010> interesting<00:01:14.810> was

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
thing that I found very interesting was

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.590 
thing that I found very interesting was
this<00:01:16.680> part<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:18.000> holds<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.750> SD<00:01:19.380> card<00:01:20.390> if<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
this part that holds the SD card if you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.260 
this part that holds the SD card if you
look<00:01:21.750> closely<00:01:21.810> here

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.560 

it's<00:01:31.270> a<00:01:31.390> slot<00:01:31.690> over<00:01:31.990> here<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:34.060> using<00:01:34.420> these

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
it's a slot over here so using these

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:43.360 
it's a slot over here so using these
slots

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.020 

because<00:01:44.150> I<00:01:44.450> would<00:01:45.140> say<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:45.440> possible<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.700> add

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
because I would say it's possible to add

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.940 
because I would say it's possible to add
internal<00:01:47.960> storage<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.650> there's<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.610> little

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
internal storage and there's a little

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.490 
internal storage and there's a little
screw<00:01:52.420> dated<00:01:53.420> then<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:53.690> can<00:01:53.900> use<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.260> tighten

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
screw dated then you can use to tighten

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.010 
screw dated then you can use to tighten
their<00:01:54.860> storage<00:01:55.280> as<00:01:55.580> well<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.690> could

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
their storage as well so you could

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.470 
their storage as well so you could
extend<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.950> storage<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.640> on<00:01:59.000> top<00:01:59.210> of<00:01:59.360> the

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
extend the storage and on top of the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.500 
extend the storage and on top of the
internal<00:01:59.810> storage<00:02:00.140> add<00:02:01.150> external<00:02:02.150> storage

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
internal storage add external storage

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.820 
internal storage add external storage
but<00:02:02.870> mounted<00:02:03.770> within<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.820> device<00:02:05.090> if<00:02:05.830> anybody

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
but mounted within the device if anybody

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.639 
but mounted within the device if anybody
of<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.310> know<00:02:07.610> what<00:02:08.450> kind<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.930> storage<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.500> can

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
of you know what kind of storage you can

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.330 
of you know what kind of storage you can
add<00:02:09.830> there<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.750> seems<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:12.560> be<00:02:12.680> connected<00:02:12.980> to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
add there it seems to be connected to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.210 
add there it seems to be connected to
the<00:02:13.550> SD<00:02:14.090> card<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.810> some<00:02:14.990> kind<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.320> internal<00:02:15.800> SD

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
the SD card so some kind of internal SD

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.370 
the SD card so some kind of internal SD
card<00:02:16.780> slot<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.970> was<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.750> needed<00:02:21.080> just<00:02:21.230> a

card slot so it was you needed just a

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.040 
card slot so it was you needed just a
little<00:02:21.650> screwdriver<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.970> fan<00:02:26.270> for<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.780> guys

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
that wonder if there's a plan on this

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.340 
that wonder if there's a plan on this
device<00:02:29.210> or<00:02:29.450> not<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:30.340> heat<00:02:31.340> pipe<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.090> on<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:33.320> I

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
device or not a heat pipe and so on so I

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.950
