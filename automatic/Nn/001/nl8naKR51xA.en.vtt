that the Salem witch trials went down

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.440 
that the Salem witch trials went down
now<00:01:49.039> here's<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.579> second<00:01:49.909> principle<00:01:50.329> to

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
now here's the second principle to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.190 
now here's the second principle to
consider<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.530> universe<00:01:52.039> is<00:01:52.279> expanding

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
consider the universe is expanding

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.870 
consider the universe is expanding
expanding<00:01:54.200> from<00:01:54.709> where<00:01:54.920> well<00:01:55.520> that's<00:01:55.700> the

expanding from where well that's the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.529 
expanding from where well that's the
tricky<00:01:56.179> part

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
tricky part

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.349
