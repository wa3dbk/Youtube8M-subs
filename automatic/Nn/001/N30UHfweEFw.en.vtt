00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
darker thing I mean trust me it was a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.399 
darker thing I mean trust me it was a
little<00:01:59.549> light<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.359> decided<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> mix<00:02:01.200> it

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
little light so I just decided to mix it

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.349 
little light so I just decided to mix it
and<00:02:01.529> the<00:02:02.219> burnt<00:02:02.429> amber<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.850> gives<00:02:03.029> it<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.209> nice

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
and the burnt amber it gives it a nice

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.629 
and the burnt amber it gives it a nice
effect<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.139> it<00:02:04.590> looks<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.889> little<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.340> looks<00:02:05.520> a

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:05.639 
effect and it looks a little it looks a

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:07.580 
effect and it looks a little it looks a
lot<00:02:05.789> lighter<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.240> my<00:02:06.389> camera<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.560> person

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
lot lighter on my camera but in person

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.540 
lot lighter on my camera but in person
it<00:02:08.100> looks<00:02:08.130> pretty<00:02:08.580> nice<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.100> one<00:02:11.370> makes

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
it looks pretty nice so this one makes

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.880 
it looks pretty nice so this one makes
it<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> little<00:02:11.850> bit

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
it a little bit

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.740 
it a little bit
um<00:02:13.100> I<00:02:13.340> wouldn't<00:02:13.850> recommend<00:02:14.090> putting<00:02:14.360> water<00:02:14.569> in

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
um I wouldn't recommend putting water in

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.809 
um I wouldn't recommend putting water in
it<00:02:14.870> just<00:02:15.170> because<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.800> might<00:02:15.980> make<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.190> like<00:02:16.520> a

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
it just because it might make it like a

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.699 
it just because it might make it like a
little<00:02:17.420> water<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.050> won't<00:02:18.230> come<00:02:18.380> out<00:02:18.470> to

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
little water and it won't come out to

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:27.180 
little water and it won't come out to
even<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.670> it'll<00:02:19.970> be<00:02:20.750> all<00:02:20.870> paint<00:02:21.380> stroke<00:02:25.600> and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
even and it'll be all paint stroke and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.280 
even and it'll be all paint stroke and
now<00:02:28.190> I'm<00:02:28.640> going<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.030> take<00:02:29.270> whether<00:02:29.450> it's<00:02:30.080> nice

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
now I'm going to take whether it's nice

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.420

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
doesn't matter if those paint strokes on

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.580 
doesn't matter if those paint strokes on
