00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
much just want to just put it on again

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.850 
much just want to just put it on again
just<00:01:56.660> keep<00:01:56.870> in<00:01:57.020> mind<00:01:57.050> that<00:01:57.350> everything<00:01:57.560> is

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
just keep in mind that everything is

just keep in mind that everything is
going<00:01:58.010> to<00:01:58.070> be<00:01:58.160> rustic<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.790> distress<00:01:59.240> so<00:01:59.450> we're

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
going to be rustic and distress so we're

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.590 
going to be rustic and distress so we're
not<00:01:59.660> looking<00:01:59.960> for<00:02:00.140> any<00:02:00.230> sort<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.740> perfection

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
not looking for any sort of a perfection

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.650 
not looking for any sort of a perfection
just<00:02:06.550> basically<00:02:07.550> have<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.910> get<00:02:08.030> coverage<00:02:08.450> on

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
just basically have to get coverage on

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.400 
just basically have to get coverage on
it<00:02:08.690> don't<00:02:09.290> worry<00:02:09.470> too<00:02:09.710> much<00:02:09.740> about<00:02:11.050> any<00:02:12.050> voids

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
it don't worry too much about any voids

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.380 
it don't worry too much about any voids
in<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.710> paint<00:02:13.060> anything<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.210> that<00:02:14.240> nature

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
in the paint anything of that nature

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.910 
in the paint anything of that nature
because<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.320> want<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.730> again<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.910> look<00:02:17.060> aged

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
because you want it again to look aged

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.080 
because you want it again to look aged
like<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.130> been<00:02:19.280> sitting<00:02:19.459> around<00:02:19.640> for<00:02:20.030> a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
like it's been sitting around for a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.210 
like it's been sitting around for a
hundred<00:02:20.209> years<00:02:20.570> or<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:21.800> do<00:02:21.920> want<00:02:22.130> to

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
hundred years or so you do want to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.699 
hundred years or so you do want to
minimize<00:02:22.580> any<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.940> your<00:02:23.110> brush<00:02:24.110> strokes<00:02:24.290> like

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709

minimize any of your brush strokes like
this<00:02:24.920> sort<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.220> stuff<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.970> doesn't

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
this sort of stuff that that doesn't

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.840 
this sort of stuff that that doesn't
kind<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.570> come<00:02:26.930> into<00:02:27.140> play<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:28.489> just<00:02:28.670> want

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
kind of come into play so you just want

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.240 
kind of come into play so you just want
to<00:02:28.910> finish<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.510> off<00:02:29.630> with<00:02:29.840> just<00:02:29.959> long<00:02:30.230> strokes

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.560 

again<00:02:34.250> make<00:02:34.700> sure<00:02:34.730> you're<00:02:35.060> using<00:02:35.239> a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
again make sure you're using a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.979 
again make sure you're using a
semi-gloss<00:02:37.000> hit<00:02:38.000> all<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.300> areas<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.690> you

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
semi-gloss hit all the areas that you

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.070 
semi-gloss hit all the areas that you
want<00:02:39.190> coverage<00:02:40.190> on<00:02:40.570> now<00:02:41.570> we've<00:02:41.720> applied<00:02:42.020> our

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
want coverage on now we've applied our

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.990 
want coverage on now we've applied our
first<00:02:42.440> base<00:02:42.680> coat<00:02:43.010> we're<00:02:43.700> going<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:43.880> let<00:02:43.970> it

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
first base coat we're going to let it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.880 
first base coat we're going to let it
dry<00:02:44.209> for<00:02:44.360> about<00:02:44.660> fifteen<00:02:45.170> or<00:02:45.230> twenty<00:02:45.590> minutes

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
dry for about fifteen or twenty minutes

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.340 
dry for about fifteen or twenty minutes
possibly<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.730> little<00:02:46.940> longer<00:02:47.180> considering<00:02:48.170> the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
possibly a little longer considering the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.590 
possibly a little longer considering the
conditions<00:02:48.830> you're<00:02:48.980> in<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:50.150> then<00:02:50.270> once<00:02:50.450> this

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
conditions you're in and then once this

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.860 
conditions you're in and then once this
dry<00:02:50.870> we'll<00:02:51.590> move<00:02:52.520> on<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.880> next<00:02:53.120> step<00:02:53.330> okay

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
dry we'll move on to the next step okay

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.920 
dry we'll move on to the next step okay
our<00:02:54.110> first<00:02:54.830> code<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.790> our<00:02:56.120> base<00:02:56.330> coat<00:02:56.600> has

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
our first code of the our base coat has

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.620 
our first code of the our base coat has
dried<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:58.280> next<00:02:58.550> step<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:59.030> we<00:02:59.360> want<00:02:59.390> to

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
dried and the next step is we want to

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.890 
dried and the next step is we want to
take<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.140> whatever<00:03:00.620> color<00:03:00.920> were<00:03:01.900> whatever

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
take the whatever color were whatever

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.699 
take the whatever color were whatever
color<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.320> choose<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.560> use<00:03:03.920> for<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.640> top<00:03:04.880> coat

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
color you choose to use for the top coat

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.340 
color you choose to use for the top coat
really<00:03:06.709> all<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:06.980> do<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.370> just<00:03:07.580> put<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.209> on

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
really all you do is just put it on

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.780 
really all you do is just put it on
apply<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.590> same<00:03:09.620> way<00:03:10.390> just<00:03:12.489> go<00:03:13.489> ahead<00:03:13.580> and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
apply it the same way just go ahead and

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.350 
apply it the same way just go ahead and
put<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.000> on<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.330> know<00:03:14.590> haphazardly<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:15.830> you

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
put it on you know haphazardly if you

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.130 
put it on you know haphazardly if you
guess<00:03:17.360> you<00:03:17.540> can<00:03:17.660> call<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.019> that

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
guess you can call it that

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.310 
guess you can call it that
not<00:03:19.800> trying<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.340> get<00:03:21.150> full<00:03:21.390> coverage<00:03:21.840> because

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
not trying to get full coverage because

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.590 
not trying to get full coverage because
the<00:03:22.830> purpose<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.400> top<00:03:23.790> car<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.270> first

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
the purpose of the top car the first

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.200 
the purpose of the top car the first
coat<00:03:25.110> base<00:03:25.830> coat<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:26.370> what's<00:03:27.000> going<00:03:27.120> to

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
coat base coat is what's going to

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.900 
coat base coat is what's going to
basically<00:03:28.170> be<00:03:28.320> bleeding<00:03:28.950> through<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.520> second

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
basically be bleeding through the second

basically be bleeding through the second
coat<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.240> color<00:03:30.450> coat<00:03:32.840> just<00:03:33.840> apply<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.290> on<00:03:34.470> all

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
coat the color coat just apply it on all

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.900 
coat the color coat just apply it on all
over<00:03:36.290> now<00:03:37.290> after<00:03:37.740> you<00:03:37.830> get<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.100> on<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.790> don't

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
over now after you get this on you don't

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.080 
over now after you get this on you don't
want<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.360> wait<00:03:40.080> any<00:03:40.290> length<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.740> time<00:03:41.010> for<00:03:41.970> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
want to wait any length of time for the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.960 
want to wait any length of time for the
second<00:03:42.480> step<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:44.040> want<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.280> do<00:03:44.460> it<00:03:44.610> right<00:03:44.820> away

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
second step you want to do it right away

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.540 
second step you want to do it right away
before<00:03:45.240> the<00:03:45.510> paint<00:03:45.780> dries<00:03:46.310> otherwise<00:03:47.310> you've

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
before the paint dries otherwise you've

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.960 
before the paint dries otherwise you've
defeated<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.120> whole<00:03:48.270> purpose<00:03:49.670> just<00:03:50.670> get<00:03:50.880> it

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
defeated the whole purpose just get it

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:59.180 
defeated the whole purpose just get it
on<00:03:51.060> there<00:03:57.080> sometimes<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.440> second<00:03:58.830> coat<00:03:59.010> you

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
on there sometimes the second coat you

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.860 
on there sometimes the second coat you
can<00:03:59.220> just<00:03:59.459> use<00:03:59.640> an<00:03:59.760> old<00:03:59.850> dingy<00:04:00.150> brush<00:04:00.570> because

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
can just use an old dingy brush because

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.780 
can just use an old dingy brush because
the<00:04:01.200> harder<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.709> brush<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.220> actual<00:04:04.790> grain

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
the harder the brush is the actual grain

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.670 
the harder the brush is the actual grain
I<00:04:06.300> mean<00:04:07.070> just<00:04:08.070> better<00:04:10.760> okay<00:04:11.760> once<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.060> is<00:04:12.360> on

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
I mean just better okay once that is on
