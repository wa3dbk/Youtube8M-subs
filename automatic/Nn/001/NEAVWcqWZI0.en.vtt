you'll see it actually chose me to host
this<00:00:05.520> game<00:00:05.819> that<00:00:06.240> doesn't<00:00:06.390> really<00:00:06.629> mean<00:00:06.930> a

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
this game that doesn't really mean a

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.390 
this game that doesn't really mean a
whole<00:00:07.080> lot<00:00:07.379> because<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.740> actually<00:00:07.890> have<00:00:08.220> my

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
whole lot because I actually have my

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.100 
whole lot because I actually have my
router<00:00:08.610> set<00:00:08.880> up<00:00:08.970> perfectly<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.809> do<00:00:09.870> have<00:00:10.080> a

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
router set up perfectly and I do have a

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.900 
router set up perfectly and I do have a
fairly<00:00:10.380> quick<00:00:10.650> internet<00:00:10.889> standard<00:00:11.460> t1<00:00:11.759> by

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
fairly quick internet standard t1 by

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.430 
fairly quick internet standard t1 by
American<00:00:12.330> standards<00:00:12.690> that's<00:00:12.840> about<00:00:13.019> 25

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
American standards that's about 25

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.169

megabits<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.889> second<00:00:14.190> download<00:00:14.460> speed<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:14.910> 4

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
megabits a second download speed about 4

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.680 
megabits a second download speed about 4
or<00:00:15.210> 5<00:00:15.330> upload<00:00:15.990> speed<00:00:16.230> which<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.480> exactly<00:00:18.480> what

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
or 5 upload speed which is exactly what

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.179 
or 5 upload speed which is exactly what
you<00:00:18.779> want<00:00:19.050> for<00:00:19.260> doing<00:00:19.590> things<00:00:19.740> online

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
you want for doing things online

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.590 
you want for doing things online
basically<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.730> mean<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.910> could<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.119> faster

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
basically I mean you could have faster

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.009 
basically I mean you could have faster
but<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.710> pretty<00:00:23.369> much<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:24.210> expectation

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
but this is pretty much the expectation

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.689 
but this is pretty much the expectation
of<00:00:25.199> what<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.890> game<00:00:26.099> should<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:26.310> running<00:00:26.609> on

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
of what this game should be running on

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.429 
of what this game should be running on
this<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> expectation<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.720> how<00:00:27.960> fast<00:00:28.199> your

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
this is the expectation of how fast your

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.200 
this is the expectation of how fast your
internet<00:00:28.470> should<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.580> that's<00:00:29.970> what<00:00:30.119> they

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
internet should be and that's what they

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.650 
internet should be and that's what they
have<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.390> set<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:31.309> now<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.520> think<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.420> extra

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
have it set up for now I think the extra

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.150 
have it set up for now I think the extra
step<00:00:33.899> because<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.260> do<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> lot<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.680> hosting

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
step because I do a lot of hosting

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.860 
step because I do a lot of hosting
through<00:00:35.910> Steam<00:00:36.120> servers<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.660> things<00:00:36.809> like

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
through Steam servers for things like

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.630 
through Steam servers for things like
killing<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.350> whatnot<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.860> people<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.520> be

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
killing for whatnot so people have to be

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.400 
killing for whatnot so people have to be
able<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.820> connect<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.149> me<00:00:39.300> people<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.290> be

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
able to connect to me people have to be

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.600 
able to connect to me people have to be
able<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> good<00:00:41.010> connection<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.579> you

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.660 
choose someone like me to host all the
time<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.280> here<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:05.519> getting

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
time and as you see here I'm getting

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.120 
time and as you see here I'm getting
stuck<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.180> Rover<00:01:06.740> it's<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.830> lot<00:01:08.010> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
stuck on this Rover it's a lot of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.620 
stuck on this Rover it's a lot of
wide-open<00:01:08.490> space<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:08.970> map<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.450> very

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
wide-open space on this map so it's very

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.149 
wide-open space on this map so it's very
hard<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.049> use<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.650> pretty<00:01:10.830> much<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
hard to use you pretty much you have to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.710 
hard to use you pretty much you have to
set<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> trap<00:01:11.700> which<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:11.909> fairly<00:01:12.180> easy<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.689> on

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
set a trap which is fairly easy to do on

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.969 
set a trap which is fairly easy to do on
this<00:01:12.900> map<00:01:13.080> there's<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> lot<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.590> areas<00:01:13.860> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
this map there's a lot of areas to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.219 
this map there's a lot of areas to
ambush<00:01:14.220> people<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.760> yeah<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.750> did<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:16.020> stuck

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
ambush people so yeah I did get stuck

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.630 
ambush people so yeah I did get stuck
for<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.439> while<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> eventually<00:01:17.040> do<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.430> past

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
for a while but I eventually do get past

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.890 
for a while but I eventually do get past
this<00:01:17.759> -<00:01:17.880> Robert<00:01:20.240> man<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> can't<00:01:21.509> stop<00:01:21.659> coughing

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
this - Robert man I can't stop coughing

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
this - Robert man I can't stop coughing
I've<00:01:22.590> been<00:01:22.710> telling<00:01:22.950> myself<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.549> hope<00:01:23.700> I
