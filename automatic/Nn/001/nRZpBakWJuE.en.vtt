automotive invention the Golf GTI would

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.220 
automotive invention the Golf GTI would
and<00:02:41.109> did<00:02:41.620> actually<00:02:42.159> get<00:02:42.400> my<00:02:42.609> vote<00:02:43.000> there's<00:02:43.870> car

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
and did actually get my vote there's car

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.890 
and did actually get my vote there's car
of<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.560> century

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.710 

it's<00:02:52.500> body<00:02:52.860> panels<00:02:53.370> were<00:02:53.670> from<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.060> normal<00:02:54.480> golf

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
it's body panels were from a normal golf

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.729 
it's body panels were from a normal golf
so<00:02:55.110> they<00:02:55.260> were<00:02:55.319> simple<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.040> cheap<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.819> mend<00:02:57.120> it

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
so they were simple and cheap to mend it

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.890 
so they were simple and cheap to mend it
had<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.769> normal<00:02:59.220> hatchback<00:02:59.459> boot<00:03:00.090> too<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.840> you

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
had a normal hatchback boot too so you

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.380 
had a normal hatchback boot too so you
could<00:03:01.110> use<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:01.379> to<00:03:01.709> move<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.250> filing<00:03:02.700> cabinet

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
could use it to move a filing cabinet

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.630 
could use it to move a filing cabinet
it<00:03:03.989> was<00:03:04.200> sensible<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:04.950> practical<00:03:04.980> but

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
it was sensible and practical but

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.699 
it was sensible and practical but
underneath<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.480> plain<00:03:06.750> wrapping<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.470> had<00:03:07.680> a

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
underneath the plain wrapping it had a

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.660 
underneath the plain wrapping it had a
powerful<00:03:08.310> engine<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.849> firm<00:03:09.750> suspension

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.690 

so<00:03:15.569> on<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.050> open<00:03:16.380> road<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.830> could<00:03:16.980> send<00:03:17.310> five

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
so on the open road it could send five

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.680 
so on the open road it could send five
million<00:03:18.300> volts<00:03:18.959> -<00:03:19.470> yeah

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
million volts - yeah

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.809 
million volts - yeah
Deanna<00:03:21.690> Golf<00:03:21.930> GTI<00:03:22.350> obviously<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:24.959> did<00:03:25.170> she

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
Deanna Golf GTI obviously and so did she

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.030 
Deanna Golf GTI obviously and so did she
and<00:03:26.819> he<00:03:27.750> broke<00:03:27.930> his<00:03:28.140> around<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.650> Reverse

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
and he broke his around in Reverse

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.630 
and he broke his around in Reverse
however<00:03:32.040> let's<00:03:32.310> get<00:03:32.610> one<00:03:32.940> thing<00:03:32.970> straight

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640
