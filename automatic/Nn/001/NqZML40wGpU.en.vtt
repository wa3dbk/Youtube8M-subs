00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.470 
have three types of washers one has a
hook<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.220> that's<00:02:23.670> going<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.060> go<00:02:24.180> into<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
hook and that's going to go into the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.560 
hook and that's going to go into the
hole<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.050> bike<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.880> second<00:02:27.270> one<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.540> a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
hole on the bike the second one is a

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.050 
hole on the bike the second one is a
flat<00:02:27.959> washer<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.980> goes<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.459> next<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.910> that

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
flat washer that goes up next to that

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.380 
flat washer that goes up next to that
one<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.480> then<00:02:30.800> finally<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.250> nut<00:02:32.489> secures<00:02:33.180> it

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
one and then finally the nut secures it

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.960 
one and then finally the nut secures it
all<00:02:33.630> together<00:02:34.730> here<00:02:35.730> we<00:02:35.880> go<00:02:37.790> washer<00:02:38.790> with<00:02:38.940> the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
all together here we go washer with the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.940 
all together here we go washer with the
hook<00:02:39.209> going<00:02:39.870> into<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.170> hole<00:02:42.410> flat<00:02:43.410> washer

hook going into the hole flat washer
going<00:02:44.220> up<00:02:44.370> against<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:46.550> then<00:02:47.550> we're

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
going up against that one and then we're

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.479 
going up against that one and then we're
going<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.940> tighten<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.930> nut<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:50.160> clockwise

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
pedals out one has an L on it one has an

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.410 
pedals out one has an L on it one has an
R<00:03:28.390> on<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:29.440> know<00:03:29.560> what<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.830> means<00:03:30.070> right

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
R on it you know what that means right

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.220 
R on it you know what that means right
you<00:03:31.420> got<00:03:31.989> it

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
you got it

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.040 
you got it
the<00:03:32.830> R<00:03:32.980> goes<00:03:33.280> on<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.520> right<00:03:33.700> side<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.630> when

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
the R goes on the right side and when

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.780 
the R goes on the right side and when
you<00:03:35.140> put<00:03:35.319> it<00:03:35.410> in<00:03:35.530> you're<00:03:36.250> going<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.430> turn<00:03:36.640> it

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
you put it in you're going to turn it

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.180 
you put it in you're going to turn it
clockwise<00:03:38.850> now<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.910> reason<00:03:40.300> I<00:03:40.390> say<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.660> is

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
clockwise now the reason I say that is

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.710 
clockwise now the reason I say that is
when<00:03:42.190> we<00:03:42.280> do<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.430> left<00:03:42.670> one<00:03:43.000> you're<00:03:43.570> going<00:03:43.660> to

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
when we do the left one you're going to

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.870 
when we do the left one you're going to
be<00:03:43.780> turning<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.290> counterclockwise<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.640> get<00:03:45.760> it

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
be turning it counterclockwise to get it

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.699 
be turning it counterclockwise to get it
in

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:58.610 

all<00:03:50.159> right<00:03:51.680> left<00:03:52.819> counterclockwise

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.740 

it<00:03:58.709> may<00:03:59.370> seem<00:03:59.640> counterintuitive<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.569> go

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
it may seem counterintuitive to go

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.710 
it may seem counterintuitive to go
counterclockwise<00:04:01.489> however<00:04:02.489> that's<00:04:03.120> just<00:04:03.330> the

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
counterclockwise however that's just the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.649 
counterclockwise however that's just the
way<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.290> is<00:04:04.970> once<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.060> find<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.420> groove

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
way that it is once you find the groove

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.050 
way that it is once you find the groove
you<00:04:07.500> can<00:04:07.650> really<00:04:08.000> twist<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.209> in<00:04:10.819> twist<00:04:11.819> it<00:04:11.970> in

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
you can really twist it in twist it in

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.539 
you can really twist it in twist it in
as<00:04:12.150> snug<00:04:12.450> as<00:04:12.569> you<00:04:12.659> can<00:04:12.810> with<00:04:12.959> your<00:04:12.989> hands<00:04:13.549> and

then I want you to use the tool that was

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.990 
then I want you to use the tool that was
