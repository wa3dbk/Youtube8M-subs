00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
all right for the next few minutes we

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.680 
all right for the next few minutes we
want<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.700> show<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.910> how<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.120> rebuild<00:00:09.480> your

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
want to show you how to rebuild your

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.150 
want to show you how to rebuild your
spindles<00:00:10.170> because<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.590> know<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
spindles because you know one of the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.100 
spindles because you know one of the
things<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.670> racers<00:00:12.120> probably<00:00:12.780> overlooked

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
things that racers probably overlooked

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.390 
things that racers probably overlooked
the<00:00:13.200> most<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.559> maintenance<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:14.040> their<00:00:14.160> carts

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
the most is maintenance of their carts

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.920 
the most is maintenance of their carts
and<00:00:15.289> whenever<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.529> designed<00:00:16.980> or<00:00:17.840> when<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
and whenever we designed or when the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.960 
and whenever we designed or when the
icon<00:00:19.320> chassis<00:00:19.770> come<00:00:19.949> out<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.279> redesigned<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
icon chassis come out we redesigned the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
icon chassis come out we redesigned the
kingpins<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.779> all<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.289> our<00:00:22.410> chances<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.039> we

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
kingpins on all of our chances and we

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.400 
kingpins on all of our chances and we
went<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> different<00:00:24.900> inner<00:00:25.080> sleeve

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
went to a to a different inner sleeve

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.859 
went to a to a different inner sleeve
design<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.130> just<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.060> way<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.359> put<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> whole

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
design and just the way we put the whole

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.810 
design and just the way we put the whole
spindle<00:00:28.320> together<00:00:28.619> changed<00:00:29.189> all<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.730> our

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
spindle together changed all of our

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.209 
spindle together changed all of our
spindles<00:00:30.300> prior<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.050> time<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.859> bearings

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
spindles prior to that time the bearings

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.700 
spindles prior to that time the bearings
would<00:00:32.369> press<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.239> which<00:00:33.989> put<00:00:34.320> an<00:00:34.410> extra

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
would press in and which put an extra

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.990 
would press in and which put an extra
load<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> outer<00:00:35.489> race<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.940> bearing

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
load on the outer race of the bearing

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
load on the outer race of the bearing
well<00:00:36.780> whenever<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:37.140> went<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> icon<00:00:37.800> style

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
well whenever we went to the icon style

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.650 
well whenever we went to the icon style
spindles<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.579> went<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> slip<00:00:39.239> fit<00:00:39.480> which

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
spindles we went to a slip fit which

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.600 
spindles we went to a slip fit which
I'll<00:00:39.809> show<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.260> few<00:00:40.440> minutes<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.399> what

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
I'll show you in a few minutes so what

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.990 
I'll show you in a few minutes so what
happens<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.180> or<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:43.140> happen<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.969> over<00:00:44.969> a

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
happens is or what can happen is over a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.330 
happens is or what can happen is over a
period<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.510> time<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.320> spindle<00:00:46.770> bearings<00:00:47.100> can

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
period of time the spindle bearings can

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.520 
period of time the spindle bearings can
get<00:00:47.489> loose<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.239> spindles<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.350> not

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
get loose in the spindles and it's not

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.290 
get loose in the spindles and it's not
because<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.039> manufacturing<00:00:50.730> defect<00:00:51.120> that's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
because of a manufacturing defect that's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.619 
because of a manufacturing defect that's
by<00:00:51.510> design<00:00:51.980> we<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.820> prolong<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.420> life

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
by design we do this to prolong the life

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.200 
by design we do this to prolong the life
of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> bearing<00:00:55.050> itself<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.340> anyway<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.969> just

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
of the bearing itself so anyway I just

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.610 
of the bearing itself so anyway I just
want<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> take<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> few<00:00:57.960> minutes<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.379> show<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
want to take a few minutes to show you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
want to take a few minutes to show you
how<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> rebuild<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.520> spendings<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.780> right

how to rebuild your spendings all right
a<00:01:00.930> good<00:01:01.109> way<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> tell<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:02.129> your<00:01:02.160> spindles<00:01:02.820> are

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
a good way to tell if your spindles are

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.780 
a good way to tell if your spindles are
in<00:01:03.960> need<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> repair<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.739> when<00:01:05.220> they're<00:01:05.369> bolted

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and rebuild your spindles the first

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
and rebuild your spindles the first
thing<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.340> take<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> old<00:01:38.820> spin

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
thing you do is you take the old spin

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.609 
thing you do is you take the old spin
that<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> old<00:01:39.570> bearings<00:01:39.930> out<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.470> is

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that the old bearings out which this is

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.109 
that the old bearings out which this is
a<00:01:40.650> new<00:01:40.860> spindle<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.970> take

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
a new spindle but you just have to take

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.630 
a new spindle but you just have to take
them<00:01:42.270> out<00:01:45.710> okay<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:46.860> we've<00:01:46.979> got<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.130> snap<00:01:47.399> ring

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640

if you notice I cut it right at the ring
which<00:03:36.069> makes<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.459> where<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.670> can<00:03:36.819> get<00:03:36.940> you

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
which makes it where you can get you

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.770 
which makes it where you can get you
stuff<00:03:37.420> your<00:03:37.600> your<00:03:38.819> compound<00:03:39.819> out<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.569> what<00:03:40.720> I

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
stuff your your compound out so what I

on<00:04:48.580> what<00:04:48.790> will<00:04:48.880> happen<00:04:49.180> is<00:04:49.300> when<00:04:49.450> you<00:04:49.540> put<00:04:49.720> it

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
on what will happen is when you put it

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.360 
on what will happen is when you put it
together<00:04:49.900> some<00:04:50.320> of<00:04:50.350> it<00:04:50.530> can<00:04:50.620> get<00:04:50.770> inside<00:04:51.190> the

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
together some of it can get inside the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.080 
together some of it can get inside the
bearing<00:04:51.700> which<00:04:52.360> will<00:04:52.600> lock<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.020> bearing<00:04:53.320> up

is<00:05:52.930> a<00:05:52.960> good<00:05:53.080> idea<00:05:53.140> to<00:05:53.500> rebuild<00:05:53.830> your<00:05:53.950> spindles

is a good idea to rebuild your spindles

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.210 
is a good idea to rebuild your spindles
as<00:05:54.520> they<00:05:55.090> get<00:05:55.210> loose<00:05:55.480> if<00:05:56.410> you've<00:05:56.620> got<00:05:56.830> a<00:05:56.860> lot<00:05:57.190> of

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
try to try to rebuild your spindles

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.060 
try to try to rebuild your spindles
during<00:06:16.540> the<00:06:16.630> week<00:06:16.810> because<00:06:17.470> the<00:06:17.710> retaining

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
during the week because the retaining

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.400 
during the week because the retaining
compound<00:06:18.670> needs<00:06:18.910> approximately<00:06:19.540> 24<00:06:19.960> to<00:06:20.110> 48

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410

hours to set up to it to its full
hardness<00:06:23.200> so<00:06:23.770> this<00:06:23.950> is<00:06:24.070> really<00:06:24.310> not<00:06:24.400> something

that<00:06:24.910> we<00:06:25.030> recommend<00:06:25.330> doing<00:06:25.600> at<00:06:25.870> the<00:06:26.020> track<00:06:26.310> you

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
that we recommend doing at the track you

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.620 
that we recommend doing at the track you
know<00:06:27.400> court<00:06:27.670> maintenance<00:06:28.060> is<00:06:28.150> something<00:06:28.510> that

a lot of people overlook they just they
