that's a good question it's going to

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350 
that's a good question it's going to
depend<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.860> bit<00:02:37.890> on<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.190> draw<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.700> where<00:02:39.000> where

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
depend a bit on the draw and where where

she's she's a semi-finalist she's we've

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.800 
she's she's a semi-finalist she's we've
got<00:02:44.490> a<00:02:44.520> really<00:02:44.760> good<00:02:44.910> chance<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.420> get<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
got a really good chance to get to the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.280 
got a really good chance to get to the
semi-final<00:02:46.820> then<00:02:47.820> then<00:02:48.030> again<00:02:48.390> similar<00:02:49.170> to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
semi-final then then again similar to

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.050 
semi-final then then again similar to
trench<00:02:49.920> he's<00:02:50.100> probably<00:02:50.310> gonna<00:02:50.700> come<00:02:50.940> up

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060
