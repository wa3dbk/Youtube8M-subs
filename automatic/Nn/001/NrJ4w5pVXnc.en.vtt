00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
also matching dies to cut these out I

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.180 
also matching dies to cut these out I
will<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:33.899> using<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.350> stamp<00:00:34.620> set<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.130> a

if<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.410> has<00:02:55.680> been<00:02:55.890> heat<00:02:56.129> set<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.209> great

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
if it has been heat set this is a great

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.330 
if it has been heat set this is a great
quality<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.230> allows<00:02:58.590> from<00:02:58.859> many<00:02:59.129> different

quality that allows from many different

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.880 
quality that allows from many different
techniques<00:02:59.849> so<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.930> makes<00:03:01.230> chalk<00:03:01.620> ink

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
techniques so this makes chalk ink

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.280 
techniques so this makes chalk ink

back to our background I'm also going to

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.150 
back to our background I'm also going to
stamp<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.690> smaller<00:03:09.959> flower<00:03:10.319> using<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.920> same

color of ink and I'm stamping this one

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.380 
color of ink and I'm stamping this one
four<00:03:13.379> times<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.430> together<00:03:14.790> with<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> large

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
way these inks work on this grey paper

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.490

bit<00:03:34.079> more<00:03:34.230> vibrant<00:03:34.380> colors<00:03:34.859> if<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.190> stamp

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
bit more vibrant colors if you stamp

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.080 
image on top in chalk and chalk ink so

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
I've also stamped several additional

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.199 
I've also stamped several additional
leaves<00:03:45.359> largely<00:03:46.260> using<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:47.040> pair<00:03:47.310> ink<00:03:47.639> color

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
leaves largely using the pair ink color

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.670 
leaves largely using the pair ink color
and<00:03:48.510> added<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.840> couple<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.230> these<00:03:49.380> little

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
and added a couple of these little

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.400 
and added a couple of these little
dragonflies<00:03:50.459> on<00:03:50.700> top<00:03:51.060> using<00:03:51.419> the<00:03:51.720> footstep

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
dragonflies on top using the footstep

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.729 
dragonflies on top using the footstep
ink<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:53.700> rest<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.209> fairly<00:03:54.510> simple<00:03:55.049> I've<00:03:55.410> added

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
ink the rest is fairly simple I've added

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.099 
ink the rest is fairly simple I've added
a<00:03:55.980> layer<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.459> black<00:03:56.669> fun<00:03:57.120> foam<00:03:57.359> to<00:03:57.629> the<00:03:57.780> back<00:03:57.930> of

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
a layer of black fun foam to the back of

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.259 
a layer of black fun foam to the back of
my<00:03:58.139> stamped<00:03:58.560> pieces<00:03:58.799> both<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.730> these<00:03:59.819> worked

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
my stamped pieces both of these worked

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.449 
my stamped pieces both of these worked
slightly<00:04:00.930> from<00:04:01.230> heat<00:04:01.440> embossing<00:04:01.739> a<00:04:02.010> sentiment

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
slightly from heat embossing a sentiment

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.699 
slightly from heat embossing a sentiment
and<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.970> find<00:04:03.569> that<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.750> layer<00:04:04.049> of<00:04:04.260> fun<00:04:04.470> foam

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
and I find that a layer of fun foam

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.920 
and I find that a layer of fun foam
helps<00:04:05.129> a<00:04:05.250> great<00:04:05.489> deal<00:04:05.639> to<00:04:06.090> flatten<00:04:06.450> these<00:04:06.569> it

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
helps a great deal to flatten these it

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.629 
helps a great deal to flatten these it
also<00:04:07.079> works<00:04:07.410> great<00:04:07.560> for<00:04:07.769> editing<00:04:08.160> dimension

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
also works great for editing dimension

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.420 
also works great for editing dimension

close-up images for you to take a better
look<00:04:15.480> at<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.959> chalk<00:04:16.229> ink<00:04:16.560> on<00:04:16.919> dark<00:04:17.220> paper<00:04:17.459> and

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
look at the chalk ink on dark paper and

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.849 
look at the chalk ink on dark paper and

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
also notice how well the images and

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.790 
also notice how well the images and
colors<00:04:20.250> overlap<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:22.079> is<00:04:22.229> it<00:04:22.349> for<00:04:22.380> me<00:04:22.560> for
