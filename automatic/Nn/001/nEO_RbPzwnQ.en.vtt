00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
would dress up whether it's a suit or

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.120 
would dress up whether it's a suit or
something<00:02:48.720> at<00:02:48.840> least<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.140> at<00:02:49.650> least<00:02:49.829> gives

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
something at least that at least gives

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.650 
something at least that at least gives
an<00:02:50.280> impression<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:50.819> you're<00:02:51.150> about

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
an impression that you're about

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.729 
an impression that you're about
something<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:53.989> that's<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.140> big<00:02:55.290> thing<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.650> then

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
something so that's a big thing and then

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.190 
something so that's a big thing and then
I<00:02:55.829> also<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.579> think<00:02:57.299> I<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.690> answered<00:02:57.870> their

responses<00:02:58.769> pretty<00:02:59.670> accurately<00:03:00.390> or<00:03:00.720> what<00:03:00.989> they

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
responses pretty accurately or what they

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.220 
responses pretty accurately or what they
were<00:03:01.170> looking<00:03:01.319> for<00:03:02.420> what<00:03:03.420> other<00:03:03.660> advice<00:03:04.019> would
