00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.430
 ohohopllil asking 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.400
 What is the culture of boys in Korea and what is the ideal model? 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.110
 Are they like the men we see in dramas? Do we really need knowledge? 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.410
 So we asked Susie about this 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.580
 And it found some interesting reading resources 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.910
 The first one, is a study by women about what kind of ideal man 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.420
 The second was a cynical site about how girls can be hard to please 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.220
 When it comes to meeting the ideal lover. 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.060
 Now obviously this will not be what every Korean girl wants 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.860
 Like Suzy does not concoct with these things 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.930
 But this is a mass topic that girls may talk about with each other 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.230
 Things that are looking at men. 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.730
 There is also a lot of dating culture arranged in Korea 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.440
 Or as it is called in Korea SoGaeTing 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.770
 This Jamaican way of saying that ... 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.340
 It's more like sogaeting 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.670
 Dating arranged. Joinings. 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.610
 It seems better than blind dating. 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.040
 Sogaeting ~ 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.680
 SoGae / SoGhei 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.950
 Now there are some obvious characteristics when it comes to the ideal type you can have 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.720
 Concept globally. 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.300
 Like: 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.290
 Having an attractive body. 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.790
 Having a wonderful fashion taste 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.490
 He has a cheerful and bright personality 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.290
 Do not lose his temper and be polite 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.560
 He has a charming smile 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.030
 Be good in sex 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.060
 He listens to what women say 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.300
 Now if you ask me, I do not know anyone does not agree with these 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.200
 I am not looking for a man who has an attractive body 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.240
 I want a rude person who does not listen to me. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.700
 I am looking for a stranger. 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.840
 Like "man this was an excellent sex session because I'm very good at it" 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.880
 "I'm going to put on thinner clothes" 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.140
 "It's time to smile charming" 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.550
 The relationship is over. 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.420
 Then there are some characteristics that seem to be specifically embedded in Korean culture 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.120
 Not necessarily something we know 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.490
 One of them, for example is 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.860
 Must graduate from Sky SKY University. 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.330
 This is Seoul University, Korea University, or Yonsei University 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.700
 Are you sure it's not super delicious cookie? 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.030
 Cookie starts with "C" 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.270
 Not all cookies [Simon] seem like you failed that university 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.410
 Now I do not know about you, but I have never cared about what universities they graduated from 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.040
 That would not be the truth I'm looking for in a relationship 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.240
 The thing that people may not realize about Korea is that 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.880
 There are tons of universities you can go to in Korea 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.550
 Everywhere 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.580
 But there are only 3 that are the most competitive 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.490
 If you do not go to one of these universities 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.550
 You can not get girlfriend forever 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.790
 Well this is not true. 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.860
 I circulated it. 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.520
 You can not be the ideal type for a person. 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.530
 You want to know what the lowest college of a university in Korea 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.330
 Between the promised culture? 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.730
 School of Art 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.860
 Suzy did not you go to art school? 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.330
 Yay 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.500
 We love Susie 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.900
 Simon the Great Susie Martina got our love, Susie 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.310
 Another one of the requirements is that you have a job that earns 100mln Wan Korean in a year 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.010
 Which is nearly $ 100K 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.180
 You must be either a public servant 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.010
 Or working in large companies 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.150
 Such as Samsung or LG, or KIA 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.350
 Mainly work for a well-known brand 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.280
 This kind of company 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.920
 The problem is that these cumbersome work in 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.360
 Make a lot of money 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.790
 But working for crazy hours 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.460
 And also when you have time to meet someone 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.030
 If you work until midnight all the time? 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.030
 These companies require a lot of dedication 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.030
 Some people live on campus 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.130
 Like, we went to ... Where did we go? 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.170
 Was it LG? 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.870
 We saw that they have a campus for people working there. 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.070
 She lives in the factory where she works. 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.780
 Another condition is: you have to be 180 centimeters or longer 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.450
 Which means pretty much, you will not date Ki Idol Bob except perhaps 3 like them 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.280
 Hey boy ... 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.220
 I'm sorry. Look at their identity they say they are tall 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.990
 But it is more like their ideal length but not their actual length. 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.920
 Ok, listen. I would say this. 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.290
 I know that in North America many girls want to date tall men 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.430
 this thing 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.300
 I found that some of my students prefer dating 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.830
 I did like studying with them 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.630
 This was really strange 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.000
 We were talking about describing the manifestations of people 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.770
 That kind of thing 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.640
 One of the things we talked about was ... 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.170
 They prefer dating a tall-looking man who treats them badly 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.510
 From a good-looking short man who treats them well. 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.250
 I told them like "no" 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.810
 Like self-respect Martina came and went out of me and was like ... 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.320
 A happy relationship should be more important than how tall your lover is ... 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.620
 Another condition is: 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.190
 The perfect man must be studied for one year in another country. 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.290
 It's a country that speaks English 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.330
 To be more mundane, so you can speak other languages 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.730
 But I heard, the key of being one year is because you have studied for a year 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.370
 And you were not messing around 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.600
 Because if you go ... As we know from the series "heirs", if you go abroad for more than a year 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.540
 You will hang around with the young [Simon] who do nothing but give drugs all the time 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.480
 exactly. One year means "I did not go there and messed with someone 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.810
 I went there to study. I returned. I speak English " 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.480
 Speaking of this, you need to have a TOEIC score of at least 850 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.290
 I do not really know what 850 means, to be honest 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.890
 Because I have never taken TOEIC 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:28.000
 What is TOEIC? Teach ... tomato ... on ... interesting [s] total ... ovaries ... interesting ... english ... calculated 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Suzy, Suzy What does TOEIC mean? 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.100
 TOEIC is a test ... no, what does that mean? TOEIC? 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.340
 Suzy Something English ... 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.980
 Suzy failed! 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.250
 Suzy did not take the TOEIC test? 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.950
 I did. What is your TOEIC score? Suzy 930? 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.260
 Suzy is the ideal type. She has lived abroad 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.060
 I just want to know how girls flirt? 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.230
 You will be like: "My love, check the TOIEC signs you want it?" [Martina] Give your charming smile. Come on! 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.160
 Well, well now I lost it. 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.270
 870, you want it ,, the girl? 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.070
 What is your height? 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.310
 Well I'm 195. Centimeter want that girl? Woo loves numbers. 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.710
 Question: Can you drink 2 glasses of sogo? 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.440
 Easily. 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.910
 Do you enjoy drinking it? 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.910
 not at all. 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.580
 Well then you are the ideal model, because it seems 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.580
 If you drink at least 2 bottles of sogo and you do not get drunk 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.120
 Tskr [reference to Gonso in "Tskr"] 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.920
 But you do not really enjoy drinking 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.790
 Then you are the ideal type. 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.460
 Now some interesting things about Korean family life 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.490
 Ideally you should be a single child 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.500
 Ideally your loved ones should live outside the city 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.330
 They visit probably once a year. 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.570
 So that they do not interfere in your life too much. 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.400
 I think this is something from all over the world. 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.370
 I hope my husband's parents live on top of me so we can visit each other. 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.410
 There are a few things that we think are a little "What a fuck this" 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.080
 I touch your ass now. You guys can not see this, but ... 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.920
 Base # 3 You should be able to touch the back of each other 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.120
 Is actually really funny one 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.850
 Which I think is a joke 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.990
 Who is nice and bold enough to dance naked if the wife tells him to do. 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.520
 I do not know .. dance you monkey, dance! 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.160
 If you are adamant on Ki Idol Bob I'm sure he will definitely do this all the time 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.300
 Rennes does it anyway. 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.170
 Give me your charming smile! 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.510
 Now the negative thing that comes from all this example is that a lot of Korean men 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.680
 Feel a lot of tension 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.310
 Because much of this example is very unrealistic 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.810
 With the pressure they have in society 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.620
 Not only is it stressful for a man as to how much money he earns 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.890
 And the task they have. 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.450
 It seems that there was not much emphasis on personality? 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.420
 If you do not agree well. 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.020
 Such as: Are they the artist together? 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.160
 Do they have the same interests? 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.700
 It's more than how you're founded 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.960
 You can not tell me that. 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.900
 You may meet someone who is a dinosaur who likes dancing [Simon] I do my charming smile 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.070
 It's a really charming smile 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.210
 But you know what I'm saying. 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.310
 You will not know who will meet the future. 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.680
 I did not meet a student and I fell in love with him 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.350
 And he's sweet, wonderful, amazing man 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.010
 Who wants to open a cafe 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.010
 It does not make a lot of money. 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.780
 But you can be really happy for the rest of your life. 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.890
 And you will not agree just because some guy graduated from a better university? 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.050
 I do not know ... What do you guys think about this list of ideal types? 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.060
 Are they the same things that are in your country? 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.360
 Or are there perfect things in your country that are not on this list? 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.300
 Let us know in the comment section below. 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.460
 So that's it all this week, 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.530
 If you have the next question; leave your question in the comment section below. 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.570
 Or check out the questions already asked and you can thumb them to bring them to our attention. 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.910
 Do not forget to subscribe to our channel 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.580
 I would not follow this advice to fall in love 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.580
 This was bad advice. 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.680
 It's a kind of arranged marriage 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.250
 It does not seem well arranged
