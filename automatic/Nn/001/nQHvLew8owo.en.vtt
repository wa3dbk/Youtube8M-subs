00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.200
 Tell us the beauty of borges here and today. 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.900
 I'm bringing another video from 1024 to 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.330
 you but a video of the series review of 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.799
 accessories today guys a little about 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.290
 his jeep grand cherokee class 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.960
 rich in batting class here for 15 in 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.550
 port days like me then we have 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.840
 five children billions from here to every 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.270
 three of them are fixed or 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.980
 offensive and defensive are the shadow 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.599
 present in all the classics you 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.270
 You can see it here in support 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.420
 you can see that in engineer ennahda 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.520
 also salt and the other two are the 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.540
 rights that are unique to each 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.550
 class 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.370
 in the case of an icon class that I go 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.149
 speak today we have special operations of 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.829
 snape 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.710
 I made a video talking about the kids. 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.870
 Ingrid of which if the salt is but today I 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.540
 Talk a little about the rich ones, come on. 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.760
 start here with defensive is the defensive 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.890
 The same name was already said ready for him 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.009
 lose and play more defensive not 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.409
 is very cool chador defensive advantages 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.170
 vest that if the armor reduce by 10% 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.359
 the damage received on the trunk showed that 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.280
 would be here in the part of the feat and this 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.590
 specter guys do it's do it 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.740
 difference compared to wear shots 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.689
 so I had to snipe for the feat and you 're 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.359
 with defensive aspect you will not 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.299
 die if you have any other team not 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:28.909
 have a vest you will die with a 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.069
 A chest shot is for a sniper there. 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.509
 Also depending on the distance then 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.969
 advantage of this 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.950
 main advantage is this first pec 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.590
 that makes you not die to the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.899
 cards with chest shot at level 2 and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.450
 that have cover is the cover reduces the 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.419
 Amazing what you take on level 3 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.909
 flex which reduces explosive damage and 

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:52.219
 rapid regeneration that reduces the 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.560
 time for you to start healing 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.619
 So what does his name say is defensive? 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.020
 defensive specializations for you 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.549
 none that will influence your power 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.189
 of fire at the time you attack the 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.569
 enemies all aspects that 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.390
 influence when you defend yourself 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.009
 it's offensive guys with the name already 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.160
 says it's a species for those who like 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.570
 advance more for those who like to be more 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.080
 puller on level 1 that we have a 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.960
 weird 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.420
 the race at level 2 ammunition increases its 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.340
 maximum punishment number 3 here they had 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.700
 grenades increases by a maximum number of 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.380
 grenades so if you are with 13 and 42 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.740
 aesthetic elements take four 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.100
 hold on with a at 67 flex goes to 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.750
 two and so any grenade is of the game 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.390
 4 want to reduce 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.450
 result of colon which increases the height of 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.060
 which you can fall without suffering damage 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.340
 they then the one that is offensive speck is 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.980
 a very good species I'm using 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.140
 I think I use it the least when the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.570
 game is in infantry servers this 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.130
 I can do it but it's going to cost a lot 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.350
 of the person's game style as well 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.170
 aquino shadow guys that the spectrum 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.360
 I usually talk about the ideal pec for whom 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.770
 likes funk ars now yes that guy 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.290
 Are you always walking around? 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.920
 edges of the map is the ideal for steck 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.660
 you 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.400
 level what do we have in the will 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.030
 the time you have 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.220
 played on map level 2 sprint the final 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.230
 for you think you that traverses 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.920
 great distances then who sprint 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.880
 here is very useful and 3 reduces 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.980
 reduced 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.690
 I now also told the son that the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.239
 attacking midfielder and last fifth 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.370
 Futility you will not be is 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.590
 detected with motion sensors 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.410
 unless you're running then 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.600
 if you have, for example, walk more 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.550
 walking slowly without using the future 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.769
 say so is not thought 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.140
 shift is walking normally you 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.510
 will not be exported if you have crouched 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.040
 will not be played lying down either 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.350
 only if you have even run 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.630
 let's say the tube using the 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.070
 maximum speed of your character that 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.480
 you will be supported then it is a 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.360
 very good species for those who like 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.489
 funk up those shadow pecs that are now going 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.030
 for the two specials here of class d 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.700
 Rio Grande has special operations 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.560
 Everyone, I think so. 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.959
 ideal would be if you are a sniper more 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.519
 the aggressive icon because 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.890
 you can be a rich aggressive playing 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.380
 with a shot gun or how it would end too 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.169
 so if you are a grateful rich 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.880
 I advise you to use special operations 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.590
 if you already did he stayed a little longer 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.139
 stopped a little more field and mainly 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.569
 for the long range player 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.249
 I like to say where the angel is. 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.259
 this type of audience at the time here is the 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:36.210
 ideal but let's go there special operations 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.240
 because it's good for the ones who play the most 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.219
 near the goal is more ro chador 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.939
 but always asks for a complete examination of the 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.349
 hose 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:46.319
 obviously they are arresting the 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.389
 summer breath 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.979
 We had the opportunity we were in 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.110
 natural that have continuity here in 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.849
 first that is the same that we had 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.159
 the shadow will give you if you will not be 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.590
 detected by motion sensors 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.180
 and unless you're running it's in 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.129
 level 2 and 4 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.539
 You will spend six and four on the level. 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.849
 So much for who plays 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.800
 I said next goal will be very 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.599
 useful here not only to destroy is 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.150
 vehicles but sometimes to kill 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.400
 infantry also in the third 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.430
 motion sensor increases to five 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.279
 number of sensors and at 40% of the 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.379
 reach of texas and the sea then you 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:24.000
 that showbol hand you play for 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.819
 export you if I'm not mistaken 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.039
 start with three and when you release 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:32.669
 this species here you go up and 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:36.000
 ohio disputed tanks that the stm and 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.520
 mavi increase by 40% if you do not know 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.409
 the accessories still galley the showbol the 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.240
 somavila tank I've done a video 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.250
 we also talk about all the accessories 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.439
 of a rich then takes a look there that the 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.210
 video also completes his understanding has 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.629
 dreams and here in the last will 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.740
 fast way that cuts down on the time you 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.509
 exhausted on the map then as I said 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.689
 here's special operations 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:00.210
 nearest civic water goal or 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:02.849
 whether or not to end up with PMr as 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.770
 own bolt action anyway and that was the 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.050
 snip that I told you is for the staff 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.149
 who plays Henrique more than 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.009
 stay a little more stopped by the map 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:13.620
 here in the first half neither of breathing 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.750
 which increases stability time by 100% 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.520
 samira is not always that you press for 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.009
 hold your breath net friends 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.080
 also needs to know if this advantage 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.300
 that in the first blade film 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.029
 in the second that the coverage the covenant 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.979
 suppression you take the suipes 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:31.229
 enemies grandson really if you have 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.120
 using this spec you will be a sniper 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.399
 from londrina are you going to take 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.419
 enough of other suit so went here 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:38.250
 it's also very good 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:40.769
 fast growth 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.260
 reduced in two seconds as you 

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:42.670
 stay 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
 crowded and this is also very good for 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.280
 who plays the night long range until 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:50.290
 because sometimes you do not even see the 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.270
 enemy sniper you try to kill him 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.860
 even just by the spot 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.690
 so the fact that you 're not very 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.880
 timeout also helps 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.740
 and here at the last sighting he does not know 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.920
 which is the opposite it increases the time 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.510
 that you are is at the same time as you 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.360
 enemies at the same time as the 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.250
 enemies was fought with you this is 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.840
 the right word right this phrase 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.630
 at the same time that the enemies are 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.430
 amazed at you as I said it is at 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.270
 times for who plays and of course the 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.790
 sport is essential to catching 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.680
 so this is it galera reviews there 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.500
 now with the revision of the 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.600
 children of the king of the vehicle is already done several 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.560
 is a victim in this series of victories and 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.810
 partners 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.420
 if you do not know the accessories yet 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.550
 whether to access the support engineer or 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.500
 Rich gives a pass on the playlist I go 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.490
 leave it down here, I hope that 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.290
 have enjoyed 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.290
 It's good and until the next
