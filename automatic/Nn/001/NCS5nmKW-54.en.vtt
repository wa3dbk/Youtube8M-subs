00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
old box so I guess we're gonna have a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.870 
old box so I guess we're gonna have a
different<00:01:16.170> box<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.800> one<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.729> new

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
out then you were a release of the Zoom

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.380 
out then you were a release of the Zoom
air<00:04:37.340> in<00:04:38.450> there<00:04:39.450> instead<00:04:40.230> of<00:04:40.440> Nike<00:04:41.280> SB<00:04:41.580> like<00:04:42.270> the

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
air in there instead of Nike SB like the

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:49.730 
air in there instead of Nike SB like the
older<00:04:42.690> release<00:04:46.760> so<00:04:48.110> they<00:04:49.110> change<00:04:49.410> to<00:04:49.620> that

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
older release so they change to that

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.370 
older release so they change to that
logo<00:04:50.310> since<00:04:51.240> I<00:04:51.390> guess<00:04:52.400> Stephan<00:04:53.400> Janowski<00:04:54.380> are

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
logo since I guess Stephan Janowski are

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.570 
logo since I guess Stephan Janowski are
going<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.340> be<00:04:56.520> their<00:04:56.850> own<00:04:58.130> it<00:04:59.130> won't<00:04:59.340> be<00:04:59.460> under

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
going to be their own it won't be under

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.450 
going to be their own it won't be under
than<00:04:59.940> I<00:05:00.060> guess<00:05:00.300> be<00:05:00.510> anymore

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
than I guess be anymore

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
than I guess be anymore
so<00:05:02.460> that's<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.270> difference<00:05:03.660> there<00:05:05.030> we<00:05:06.030> go<00:05:06.300> you

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
so that's a difference there we go you

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.840 
so that's a difference there we go you
guys

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.440 

I<00:05:12.880> wish<00:05:13.510> it<00:05:13.660> was<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.810> same<00:05:14.140> same<00:05:14.980> box<00:05:15.420> but<00:05:16.420> I

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
I wish it was the same same box but I

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
I wish it was the same same box but I
guess<00:05:16.950> they<00:05:17.950> were<00:05:18.010> sold<00:05:18.370> out<00:05:18.490> with<00:05:18.730> a<00:05:19.470> bigger

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
guess they were sold out with a bigger

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.680 
guess they were sold out with a bigger
release<00:05:20.770> or<00:05:21.220> you<00:05:21.610> know<00:05:22.260> bigger<00:05:23.260> size<00:05:24.630> this<00:05:25.630> is

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
release or you know bigger size this is

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.520 
release or you know bigger size this is
a<00:05:26.160> old<00:05:27.160> version<00:05:27.700> and<00:05:28.540> then<00:05:29.200> they<00:05:29.380> were

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
a old version and then they were

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.360 
a old version and then they were
released<00:05:30.520> or<00:05:30.760> read<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.090> reissued<00:05:35.130> well<00:05:36.130> I

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
released or read it reissued well I

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.270 
released or read it reissued well I
think<00:05:36.850> that's<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.480> only<00:05:37.840> difference<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:39.190> see

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
think that's the only difference I see

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:50.300 
think that's the only difference I see
comparing<00:05:42.280> this<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:46.980> just<00:05:47.980> that<00:05:48.190> install

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
comparing this to just that install

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.500 
comparing this to just that install
where<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.460> older<00:05:51.820> had<00:05:52.420> them<00:05:52.720> like<00:05:53.140> SP<00:05:53.940> and<00:05:54.940> the

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
where the older had them like SP and the

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.600 
where the older had them like SP and the
newer<00:05:55.750> one<00:05:56.110> has<00:05:56.320> a<00:05:58.410> zoom<00:05:59.410> Aaron<00:05:59.830> that's<00:06:00.010> washed

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
newer one has a zoom Aaron that's washed

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:22.360 
newer one has a zoom Aaron that's washed
over<00:06:01.060> there<00:06:03.900> that's<00:06:04.900> pretty<00:06:05.110> much<00:06:05.320> it

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.430 

you
