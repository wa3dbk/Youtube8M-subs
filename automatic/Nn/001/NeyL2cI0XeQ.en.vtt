 take the call and reject the call and back 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.140
 everything is standard like this in general 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.940
 Basically, this phone is more convenient to manage 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.550
 using stylus 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.600
 here this yes he is bundled of course 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.790
 why that's why it's inside 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.430
 installed operating system from 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.509
 windows is 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.400
 windows 6 and 5 mobile here for those who 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.409
 used to this system then the phone will be 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.810
 very successful 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.900
 what else can you tell what 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.560
 especially this is probably very long 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:31.390
 long working time up to 20 hours in mode 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.380
 talk and up to 1800 hours in mode 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.240
 expectations 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.450
 that is, the battery here at 2100 mah very 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.090
 long running this mobile phone in 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.070
 in general, it is easy for a week to work 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:51.250
 even in the most serious mode 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.240
 here so what else there are features already 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.670

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 you can leave any micro sd cards yes 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.930
 siege 16 gigabytes there instructions this 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.869
 Do not believe the site says what else 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.180
 tell about the operating system 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.870
 you can have everything in principle, like 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.940
 usual for this twitter system and 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.050
 google facebook current for communication in 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.720
 social networks 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.100
 backing up data to copy to 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.550
 all cards have an album blacklist 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.420
 flashlight such and very strong voice recorder 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.350
 radio 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.490
 games the most common defense is there protection 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.410
 phone activation password everything else 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.960
 I will clearly give a stopwatch electronic 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.620
 books you can read books you can 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.390
 upload a map on the ride 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.480
 calculator calendar to chat converter 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.390
 world time 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.440
 Here, in fact, everything can still be noted 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.330
 player he here we can fully 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.980
 expand 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.380
 here we have all the songs 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.190
 playlist singer and last with 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.540
 produced by 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:11.290
 so it is clear to us about the mobile 10 1 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.500
 Schuster runs a good browser application 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.580
 here about the city about the city need 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.910
 say separately 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.850
 This application is designed for those who 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.430
 drives a lot around the city as if 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.590
 who cares where there are traffic jams 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.250
 calculate the route like this for these 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.420
 people, it is very suitable that you can 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.430
 say about the technical characteristics 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:39.100
 here you see there is wi-fi 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:42.550
 You can change the screen brightness to increase or 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.760
 lower and and it will accordingly 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.400
 either waste your battery more or 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.180
 will and save there is a mode in the plane 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.170
 it is clear that there is bluetooth in general 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.290
 there is also a 3g principle 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.290
 absolutely full phone on their 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.290
 functions 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.570
 what else can you tell about him 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.780
 This phone needs to be specifically pro 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.959
 cameras now we will open with you 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:19.950
 already said at 5 megapixel 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:24.419
 takes both photo and video in general 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.419
 can shoot well enough 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:35.020
 Well, so the principle is clear so I also 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.500
 did not say about the fact that it is dvuhsimochny 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.500
 mobile phone that is for those people 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.490
 who needs to weigh the phone then he 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.850
 suitable in general is quite a business 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.100
 focused on the phone ie if you 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.200
 don't like charging the phone too 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.270
 often 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.910
 if you need full functional 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.080

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.690
 system 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.990
