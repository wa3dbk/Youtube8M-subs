apply it to your skin now I bought this
one<00:01:27.229> is<00:01:27.380> kind<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.619> like<00:01:27.800> not<00:01:27.979> in<00:01:28.159> my<00:01:28.250> colors<00:01:28.549> so

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
one is kind of like not in my colors so

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.109 
one is kind of like not in my colors so
I<00:01:28.850> don't<00:01:29.030> use<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.319> but<00:01:30.319> it's<00:01:31.069> very<00:01:31.190> stiff<00:01:31.850> to

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
I don't use it but it's very stiff to

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.930 
I don't use it but it's very stiff to
apply<00:01:32.390> it's<00:01:32.780> very<00:01:33.049> hard<00:01:33.350> it's<00:01:34.250> very<00:01:34.340> hard<00:01:34.580> to

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
apply it's very hard it's very hard to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.440 
apply it's very hard it's very hard to
blend<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:36.830> it<00:01:37.280> just<00:01:37.490> looks<00:01:37.729> really<00:01:37.909> weird<00:01:38.209> and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
blend so it just looks really weird and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.570 
blend so it just looks really weird and
look<00:01:38.630> at<00:01:38.750> that<00:01:38.990> something<00:01:39.380> like<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.740> which

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
look at that something like that which

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.550 
look at that something like that which
is<00:01:40.759> from<00:01:41.209> the<00:01:41.330> top<00:01:41.569> layer<00:01:41.929> and<00:01:44.170> this<00:01:45.170> this

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
is from the top layer and this this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.499 
is from the top layer and this this
makeup<00:01:45.950> isn't<00:01:46.130> really<00:01:46.459> easy<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.970> work<00:01:47.149> with

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
makeup isn't really easy to work with

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.630 
makeup isn't really easy to work with
I<00:01:47.690> think<00:01:47.989> it's<00:01:48.170> oil<00:01:48.440> free<00:01:48.920> which<00:01:49.160> is<00:01:49.340> probably

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
I think it's oil free which is probably

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.180 
I think it's oil free which is probably
a<00:01:49.849> factor<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.629> why<00:01:51.020> because<00:01:51.410> it<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.649> made<00:01:51.860> kind

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
a factor of why because it it made kind

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.920 
a factor of why because it it made kind
of<00:01:52.450> sensitive<00:01:53.450> skin<00:01:54.729> that's<00:01:55.729> it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.050 

this<00:01:59.290> isn't<00:01:59.590> caramel<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.280> everything<00:02:00.850> it<00:02:00.940> goes

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
this isn't caramel to everything it goes

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.469 
this isn't caramel to everything it goes
up<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.360> four<00:02:02.670> so

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.839 

this<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.440> one<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.069> just<00:02:09.099> I<00:02:09.520> wouldn't

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
this is one that I just I wouldn't

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.759 
this is one that I just I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:10.239> it's<00:02:10.660> very<00:02:11.020> terrible<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.650> it

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
recommend it's very terrible and it

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.199 
recommend it's very terrible and it
really<00:02:12.069> smells<00:02:12.400> bad<00:02:12.519> as<00:02:13.239> well<00:02:13.629> so<00:02:14.610> let's<00:02:15.610> avoid

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
really smells bad as well so let's avoid

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.880 
really smells bad as well so let's avoid
this<00:02:17.080> shall<00:02:17.709> we

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
this shall we

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.140 
this shall we
no<00:02:18.340> buying<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.849> okay<00:02:20.819> but<00:02:21.819> when<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.030> do

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
no buying this okay but when I do
