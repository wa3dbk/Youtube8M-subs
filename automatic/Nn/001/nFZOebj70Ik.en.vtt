00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
the Premier's and everything that's just

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.749 
the Premier's and everything that's just
you<00:01:25.810> know<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.049> icing<00:01:26.350> on<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:26.560> cake<00:01:26.740> too<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:27.670> be

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
you know the icing on the cake too to be

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.840 
you know the icing on the cake too to be
able<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:28.000> go<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.149> those<00:01:28.329> events<00:01:28.509> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
able to go to those events and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.940 
able to go to those events and
but<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.510> guess<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.080> most<00:01:31.229> exciting<00:01:31.650> thing<00:01:31.799> is

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
but I guess the most exciting thing is

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.240 
but I guess the most exciting thing is
how<00:01:32.759> much<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.299> learn<00:01:33.570> sort<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.439> being<00:01:35.130> out<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
how much you learn sort of being out of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
how much you learn sort of being out of
work<00:01:35.340> every<00:01:35.670> day<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:36.180> something<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.200> home

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
work every day on something like home

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.490 
work every day on something like home
anyways<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:38.030> how<00:01:39.030> much<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.570> grow<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
anyways just how much you can grow and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.070 
anyways just how much you can grow and
test<00:01:41.310> yourself<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:42.119> such<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> short<00:01:42.750> space<00:01:42.869> of

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
test yourself in such a short space of

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.070 
test yourself in such a short space of
time<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> mean<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.610> did<00:01:45.180> acting<00:01:45.630> classes<00:01:45.840> for

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
time so I mean I did acting classes for

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.289 
time so I mean I did acting classes for
about<00:01:46.229> four<00:01:46.409> years<00:01:46.619> before<00:01:47.000> home<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.180> way

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
about four years before home in a way

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.090 
about four years before home in a way

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
but it's like almost that all went out

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.760 
but it's like almost that all went out
the<00:01:50.220> window<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.610> starting<00:01:50.970> again<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
the window and starting again and now it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.249 
the window and starting again and now it
takes<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.009> while<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.720> know<00:01:54.810> coming<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.170> a
