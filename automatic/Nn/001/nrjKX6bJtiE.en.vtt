in<00:00:39.000> my<00:00:39.030> opinion<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.290> player<00:00:40.500> goes

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
in my opinion now this player goes

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.760 
in my opinion now this player goes
between<00:00:41.040> 65<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.610> 70<00:00:42.270> K<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> ps3<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.379> that

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
between 65 to 70 K on the ps3 and that

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.410 
between 65 to 70 K on the ps3 and that
is<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.129> cheap<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.700> what<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.030> guy<00:00:45.180> could

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
is really cheap so what this guy could

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.910 
is really cheap so what this guy could
bring<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> pitch<00:00:46.649> he<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
bring to you on to the pitch he is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.340 
bring to you on to the pitch he is
really<00:00:47.460> really<00:00:48.000> dangerous<00:00:48.239> near<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> penalty

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
really really dangerous near the penalty

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.709 
really really dangerous near the penalty
area<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:50.190> defenders<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:51.210> not<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.570> able

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
area because defenders will not be able

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.660 
area because defenders will not be able
to<00:00:52.050> stop<00:00:52.289> him<00:00:52.469> he<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.250> those<00:00:53.340> guys<00:00:53.610> that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
to stop him he is one of those guys that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.310 
to stop him he is one of those guys that
you<00:00:54.000> don't<00:00:54.210> even<00:00:54.329> need<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.719> dribble<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.110> him

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
you don't even need to dribble with him

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.290 
you don't even need to dribble with him
even<00:00:55.710> though<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.100> can't<00:00:56.550> remove<00:00:56.879> him<00:00:57.090> his

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
even though you can't remove him his

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.209 
even though you can't remove him his
dribbling<00:00:57.660> isn't<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.260> stiff<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.890> thought<00:00:59.070> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
dribbling isn't as stiff as I thought it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.069 
dribbling isn't as stiff as I thought it
would<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> six<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.120> one<00:01:00.149> player<00:01:00.600> you

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
would be for a six for one player you

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.689 
would be for a six for one player you
can<00:01:01.289> still<00:01:01.530> hit<00:01:01.620> dribble<00:01:02.010> past<00:01:02.250> defenders

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
can still hit dribble past defenders

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.729 
can still hit dribble past defenders
because<00:01:03.000> he<00:01:03.120> has<00:01:03.270> 93<00:01:03.930> strength<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.500> he

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
because he has 93 strength and he

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
because he has 93 strength and he
actually<00:01:04.920> actually<00:01:05.460> feels<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
actually actually feels like that

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.170 
actually actually feels like that
because<00:01:06.960> bone<00:01:07.530> yesterday<00:01:08.010> had<00:01:08.189> 99<00:01:08.729> didn't

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
because bone yesterday had 99 didn't

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.090 
because bone yesterday had 99 didn't
feel<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:09.750> all<00:01:10.110> about<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.470> guy<00:01:10.680> he

feel like that at all about this guy he

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.399 
feel like that at all about this guy he
feels<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.939> much<00:01:12.180> more<00:01:12.510> stronger<00:01:13.020> than<00:01:13.170> Bernie

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
feels so much more stronger than Bernie

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.859 
feels so much more stronger than Bernie
and<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.979> guy<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.549> really<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.659> powerful

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.260 
and this guy is really really powerful
when<00:01:16.320> he's<00:01:16.439> near<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.830> penalty<00:01:17.220> area<00:01:17.270> outside

guy's<00:01:34.409> finished<00:01:34.770> shots<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:36.060> I

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
guy's finished shots are really really I

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.179 
guy's finished shots are really really I
don't<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:37.020> they<00:01:37.229> had<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> really

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
don't know they had to have a really

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.969 
don't know they had to have a really
good<00:01:38.310> curve<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.820> them<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.659> 100%<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
good curve on them and is 100% of the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.679 
good curve on them and is 100% of the
time<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> took<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.490> finesse<00:01:41.820> show<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.299> pretty

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
time I took a finesse show it pretty

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.469 
time I took a finesse show it pretty
much<00:01:42.840> went<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.950> maybe<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.880> missed<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.450> or

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
much went in so maybe I missed one or

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.690 
much went in so maybe I missed one or
two<00:01:45.780> I'm<00:01:45.930> not<00:01:46.110> sure<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.829> most<00:01:47.280> likely

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
two I'm not sure but it's most likely

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.550 
two I'm not sure but it's most likely
you<00:01:47.820> every<00:01:48.659> time<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> financial

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
you every time you take a financial

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.530 
you every time you take a financial
independency<00:01:50.070> area<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.579> will<00:01:50.939> go<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.329> with

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
independency area it will go in with

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.240 
independency area it will go in with
this<00:01:51.840> player<00:01:52.140> because<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:53.189> know

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
this player because I don't know

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.889 
this player because I don't know
something<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.390> finished<00:01:54.600> shows<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
something I think it's finished shows a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.450 
something I think it's finished shows a
glitch<00:01:55.200> or<00:01:55.320> something<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.799> maybe<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
glitch or something or maybe because it

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.190 
glitch or something or maybe because it
has<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:56.820> high<00:01:57.000> finishing<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.719> makes<00:01:58.079> this

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
has really high finishing it makes this

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.499 
has really high finishing it makes this
finished<00:01:58.530> shot<00:01:58.710> seems<00:01:58.920> seem<00:01:59.520> amazing<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.240> if

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
finished shot seems seem amazing and if

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.120 
finished shot seems seem amazing and if
you<00:02:00.630> love<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.960> cross<00:02:01.229> sometimes<00:02:01.710> he's<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
you love to cross sometimes he's in the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.980 
you love to cross sometimes he's in the
penalty<00:02:02.369> area<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.790> sometimes<00:02:03.299> he<00:02:03.479> isn't<00:02:03.840> so

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
penalty area and sometimes he isn't so

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.929 
penalty area and sometimes he isn't so
this<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.320> purely<00:02:04.590> based<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.159> lock<00:02:05.430> if<00:02:05.640> you're

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
this is purely based on lock if you're

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.219 
this is purely based on lock if you're
gonna<00:02:06.060> find<00:02:06.270> him<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.540> penalty<00:02:06.780> area<00:02:06.990> this

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
gonna find him in the penalty area this

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.199 
gonna find him in the penalty area this
is<00:02:07.290> duties<00:02:07.740> work<00:02:08.009> rates<00:02:08.340> he<00:02:08.610> has<00:02:08.789> medium

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
is duties work rates he has medium

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.360 
is duties work rates he has medium
attacking<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.780> medium<00:02:10.170> defending<00:02:10.739> which<00:02:11.160> is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
attacking a medium defending which is

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.130 
attacking a medium defending which is
probably<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> worst<00:02:12.120> work<00:02:12.420> rate<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.840> for

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
probably the worst work rate to have for

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.430 
probably the worst work rate to have for
us

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
us

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.340 
us
other<00:02:13.830> than<00:02:14.010> hide<00:02:14.250> offensive<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:16.200> is

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
other than hide offensive but this is

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.840 
other than hide offensive but this is
something<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.740> have<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.890> keep<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:17.820> mind

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
something you have to keep in mind

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.640 
something you have to keep in mind
because<00:02:18.210> if<00:02:18.720> you're<00:02:18.930> going<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.200> buy<00:02:19.320> in<00:02:19.440> purely

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
because if you're going to buy in purely

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.410 
because if you're going to buy in purely
for<00:02:19.920> crossing<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.090> think<00:02:21.300> again

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
for crossing you have to think again

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.060 
for crossing you have to think again
because<00:02:21.870> his<00:02:22.050> work<00:02:22.230> rates<00:02:22.470> aren't<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.890> great

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
because his work rates aren't that great

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.220 
because his work rates aren't that great
for<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.670> know<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:24.030> target<00:02:24.510> man<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.900> penalty

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
for you know a target man in the penalty

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.750 
for you know a target man in the penalty
area<00:02:25.260> even<00:02:26.040> though<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.190> found<00:02:26.520> their

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
area even though I found their

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.700 
area even though I found their
imposition<00:02:27.390> most<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.990> time<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.380> keep<00:02:28.560> that

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
imposition most of the time so keep that

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.110 
imposition most of the time so keep that
in<00:02:28.770> mind<00:02:28.860> when<00:02:29.520> you're<00:02:29.670> trying<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.940> purchase

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
in mind when you're trying to purchase

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.240 
in mind when you're trying to purchase
this<00:02:30.420> player<00:02:30.630> he<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.260> very<00:02:31.530> cheap<00:02:31.890> as<00:02:32.070> well

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
this player he is very cheap as well

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.360 
this player he is very cheap as well
like<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.490> said<00:02:32.550> he<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:32.910> only<00:02:33.720> going<00:02:34.050> for<00:02:34.200> 65<00:02:34.800> K<00:02:35.100> so

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
like I said he is only going for 65 K so

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.010 
like I said he is only going for 65 K so
he<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.610> really<00:02:35.940> good<00:02:36.090> value<00:02:36.420> for<00:02:36.450> money<00:02:36.660> now

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
he is really good value for money now

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.390 
he is really good value for money now
his<00:02:37.200> long<00:02:37.380> shots<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.800> be<00:02:37.830> inconsistent

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
his long shots can be inconsistent

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.980 
his long shots can be inconsistent
sometimes<00:02:39.030> they<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.270> extremely<00:02:39.750> powerful

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
sometimes they are extremely powerful

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.020 
sometimes they are extremely powerful
and<00:02:40.350> sometimes<00:02:40.530> they<00:02:40.860> are<00:02:40.950> very<00:02:40.980> weak<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.610> don't

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
and sometimes they are very weak I don't

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.370 
and sometimes they are very weak I don't
know<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.270> was<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.570> hit<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.870> miss<00:02:43.020> with<00:02:43.230> him

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
know it was just hit and miss with him

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.050 
know it was just hit and miss with him
when<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.680> comes<00:02:43.830> down<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.040> long<00:02:44.310> shots<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:45.030> is

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
when it comes down to long shots that is

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.850 
when it comes down to long shots that is
where<00:02:45.300> Boni<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.870> better<00:02:46.170> than<00:02:46.320> him<00:02:46.440> at<00:02:46.590> long

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
where Boni is better than him at long

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.700 
where Boni is better than him at long
shots<00:02:47.100> Boni<00:02:47.520> takes<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.060> win<00:02:48.210> but<00:02:48.810> he<00:02:49.590> has

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
shots Boni takes the win but he has

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.650 
shots Boni takes the win but he has
really<00:02:50.100> powerful<00:02:50.520> shot<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:50.940> if<00:02:51.180> you're<00:02:51.360> within

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
really powerful shot so if you're within

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.900 
really powerful shot so if you're within
the<00:02:51.810> penalty<00:02:52.170> area<00:02:52.290> or<00:02:52.890> just<00:02:53.190> outside<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.640> it

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
the penalty area or just outside of it

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.420 
the penalty area or just outside of it
is<00:02:54.630> pretty<00:02:54.960> much<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.260> go<00:02:55.620> because<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:56.130> guy<00:02:56.280> has

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
is pretty much a go because this guy has

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.400 
is pretty much a go because this guy has
really<00:02:56.460> really<00:02:57.270> powerful<00:02:57.450> shots<00:02:57.960> but<00:02:58.290> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
really really powerful shots but the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.660 
really really powerful shots but the
main<00:02:58.560> highlight<00:02:58.890> for<00:02:59.070> this<00:02:59.190> play<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.550> this

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
main highlight for this play is this

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.370 
main highlight for this play is this
drug<00:02:59.940> he<00:03:00.120> has<00:03:00.270> really<00:03:00.660> high<00:03:00.810> strength<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
drug he has really high strength and

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.110 
drug he has really high strength and
aggression<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.190> he<00:03:02.340> can<00:03:02.520> hold<00:03:02.730> off<00:03:02.910> pretty

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
aggression so he can hold off pretty

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.030 
aggression so he can hold off pretty
much<00:03:03.270> most<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.140> defenders<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.620> come<00:03:04.920> at

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
much most of the defenders that come at

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.740 
much most of the defenders that come at
him<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.400> he<00:03:05.850> doesn't<00:03:06.030> get<00:03:06.210> bullied<00:03:06.540> on<00:03:06.660> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
actually foster than drug boy and he

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.960 
actually foster than drug boy and he
didn't<00:03:22.530> he<00:03:22.800> didn't<00:03:23.070> live<00:03:23.280> up<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.459> his<00:03:23.670> pace

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.020 
didn't he didn't live up to his pace
stats<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.200> think<00:03:25.290> he<00:03:25.590> felt<00:03:25.860> more<00:03:26.070> like<00:03:26.190> 85<00:03:26.850> to

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
stats so I think he felt more like 85 to

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.440 
stats so I think he felt more like 85 to
86<00:03:27.480> pace<00:03:27.690> not<00:03:28.230> really<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:29.010> 89<00:03:29.490> region<00:03:29.970> but

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
86 pace not really in that 89 region but

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.300 
86 pace not really in that 89 region but
he<00:03:30.570> still<00:03:30.840> felt<00:03:31.020> really<00:03:31.380> fast<00:03:31.740> so<00:03:31.920> if<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.130> want
