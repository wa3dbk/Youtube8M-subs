00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.430
 peggy 18 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.750
 with grand thef auto 5 rock star has 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.800
 tried to reinvent different 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.810
 ways the open world game 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.070
 The game world is wonderful 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.070
 gigantic and varied 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.620
 a satirical and immense version of 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.949
 modern south california 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.309
 with seas and mountains luxury shops and 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.860
 shopping centers urban decadence and 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.329
 virgin nature beaches and areas 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.140
 isolated the sublime and the ridiculous 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.140
 greed and hypocrisy 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.199
 liverpool and explain you why not be one 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.790
 for the first time the game does not have 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.619
 a single aspiring hero but with 3 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.570
 maikel in his day a successful robber of 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.720
 banks and today a not so successful father of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.720
 family 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.410
 franklin a street hustler 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.410
 convinced to be surrounded by imbeciles 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.420
 and then this truce 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.420
 The less we say of him, the better 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.590
 thanks to the three protagonists 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.020
 they remodel both the narration in a 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.620
 interlaced history as the structure 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.480
 of individual missions 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.450
 players can alternate between 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.530
 perspectives and move on from an instant 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.530
 dizzying to another 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.080
 I already knew 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.970
 and this allows missions 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.450
 acquire new levels of diversity and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.450
 intensity 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.790
 outside of a mission the use of three 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.720
 protagonists also allows adding a 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.000
 touch of voyeurism since you can 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.100
 find out when you want in 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.100
 that your new friends have been involved 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.450
 yes 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.330
 the world is not only huge but it is 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.190
 full of things to see and do 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:01.880
 customize cars piloting aircraft 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.770
 buy clothes do sport go in search 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.740
 of nirvana 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.100
 dive in the ocean observe animals 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.520
 hunt and be hunted out weird guys that 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.600
 watch or know tomorrow 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.710
 to collect rewards and much more goes to 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.710
 be very good 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.710
 bolden 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.220
 There has also been a lot of emphasis on 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.080
 game mechanics so that all your 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.800
 aspects are so fun and fluid 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.800
 as broad 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.480
 everything either drive and shoot 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.100
 or tennis and riding a bike results 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.350
 fun and interactive 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.540
 however in addition to engaging in leisure 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.730
 people should also address their 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.010
 business for all your pretensions 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.010
 These men are dangerous thieves 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.930
 and to survive they have to plan 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.740
 and perform a series of blows each 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.740
 more audacious times 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.030
 the players plan for themselves 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.810
 and then decide how and with whom 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.810
 execute them 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.900
 I 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:36.590
 and distribute the loot you decide in what 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.169
 spend the money from investments 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.169
 sensible like tattoos and fast cars 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.100
 to risky projects like actions and 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.640
 properties in the saints 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.630
 and there 's also grand thef auto online 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.630
