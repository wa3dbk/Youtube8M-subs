00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.340
 how is the youtube protester 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.260
 well after disappearing me 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.870
 hundreds and thousands of years at last 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.830
 I bring the following review of percy 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:21.369
 jackson or the son of neptune and the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.330
 truth is that I have so many feelings 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.980
 with this saga 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.500
 what's going ok in contrast to the hero 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.750
 lost in the son of Neptune no longer 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.470
 we talk about Jason now we come back with 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.720
 percy in this book we realize 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.270
 where the hell was he? 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.950
 the great discovery that there is another 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.570
 camp that is the camp 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.280
 jupiter and is with ge and good as well as what 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.840
 they suspected persisted in the camp 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.960
 jupiter good you'll realize that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.790
 lupa slept him for a while so I do not know why 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.700
 What did he do that left him in a coma? 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.240
 if nothing good here in the camp 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.340
 jupiter the Roman camp is a 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.080
 kind of curse that there is a son of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.660
 Neptune normally things do not happen 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.470
 good when there is a son of Neptune who 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.170
 I mean persie or poseidon be in the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.660
 camp so well it's not very well 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.660
 received if the attempt is made 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.620
 have it there and that's how percy meets 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.690
 frank and geyser 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.880
 the truth takes these characters a lot 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.700
 I really like the fragment character 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.900
 tide of frank frank is a son of ares 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.940
 of Mars if this and good heysel is the 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.160
 that ultimately ends up taking care of 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.630
 these two little boys in the whole book 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.240
 I like them very much because they are 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.430
 quite united and I do not know if they are going to 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.600
 end up together frank hey salt because to 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.090
 end of accounts 6 he is from Jason and if not 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.590
 I do not know how this is going to end 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.860
 it has to be this quick review because 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.710
 and I want to start the brand had 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.410
 another event that frigged me a lot 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.260
 in this book is that we have nico nico 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.890
 you're a damn or you know of partridge 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.170
 because he does not return his memory, give him his 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.250
 damn memory there are already many adventures 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.350
 in this book especially this 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.360
 what 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.200
 and he does not want to spoil them you do not want them 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.940
 fight but well the point is that this 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.170
 you can not read at the end of the book it 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.560
 is about what to see if he wants 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.990
 the jupiter camp or they love the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.930
 Romans accept the mestizo camp 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:49.110
 because he has this this telepathy with 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:53.740
 tyson where you both telepathy if 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.600
 this and they communicate and it turns out that they come 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.670
 well out is the mestizo camp to 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.030
 come the one of jupiter but persie knows that 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.800
 if they come unprepared these I do not know if 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.810
 know but the Romans are a little 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.110
 aggressive 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.900
 a little extreme 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.850
 Well, but if you know what is going to happen 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.700
 bad so he tries to convince the 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.850
 octavian that is a crazy bato that makes 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.940
 guru shredding stuffed animals 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.850
 this 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.710
 and all the advice of the Romans for 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.420
 that they are not so hooks with the 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.750
 mestizos because this is where you give 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.410
 realize that they need to join forces 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.350
 both camps to save the world and 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.760
 well in this book we recruit two more 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.990
 of the coming heroes of Olympus 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.350
 being frank and geyser 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.500
 I have to ask them to pass a 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.510
 little if you already read the house of 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.010
 hades that possibly like all the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.590
 world already did this 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.430
 they have to read an argument that was 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.700
 here in boots and I liked it a lot because it's 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.590
 about homosexuals I do not know if they want 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.500
 plunder or not actually this 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.720
 it's been about just being gay 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.330
 of accounts is not spoiler what were they going to 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.090
 discover sooner or later if you do not 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.979
 they suspected they suspected good and that 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.109
 I need you to go see it and I left 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:25.010
 a comment because they remember uncle of 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.570
 true on earth you are a teacher and if 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.949
 leave a comment in this discussion the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.620
 I truly believe that the world is changing 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:35.350
 and it's very good that there are authors like 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.240
 rich that support it is a very nice 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.200
 if this is all I have to 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.790
 tell them about and see you in the 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.020
 next video thank you for letting me 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.250
 manifest in you 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.250
