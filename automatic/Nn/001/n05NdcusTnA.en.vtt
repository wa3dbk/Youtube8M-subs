00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.400 

so<00:00:14.750> this<00:00:15.080> is<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.379> brand-new<00:00:15.799> our<00:00:16.700> cylinder

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
so this is the brand-new our cylinder

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.620 
so this is the brand-new our cylinder
braking<00:00:18.410> system<00:00:18.860> for<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:19.840> f16<00:00:20.840> I<00:00:22.000> worked<00:00:23.000> some

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
braking system for the f16 I worked some

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.810 
braking system for the f16 I worked some
weeks<00:00:23.900> to<00:00:24.529> make<00:00:25.360> the<00:00:26.360> braking<00:00:26.779> system<00:00:26.990> work<00:00:27.820> it

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
weeks to make the braking system work it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.369 
weeks to make the braking system work it
was<00:00:29.029> not<00:00:29.330> installed<00:00:30.430> good<00:00:31.430> at<00:00:31.640> factory

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.040 

so<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> had<00:00:35.699> to<00:00:36.050> change<00:00:37.050> some<00:00:37.739> parts<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:39.050> yes

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
so I had to change some parts and yes

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:56.569 
so I had to change some parts and yes
but<00:00:40.559> now<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.550> seems<00:00:41.789> to<00:00:41.910> work<00:00:42.149> very<00:00:42.449> good<00:00:55.579> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
but now it seems to work very good the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.109 
but now it seems to work very good the
braking<00:00:57.299> system<00:00:57.479> is<00:00:57.960> mixed<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:59.119> down

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:00.119 
braking system is mixed with down

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:05.060 
braking system is mixed with down
elevator<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.719> push<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.019> elevator<00:01:04.470> stick

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
elevator so if I push the elevator stick

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:19.020 
elevator so if I push the elevator stick
forward<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.259> here

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.150 

then<00:01:19.600> focus<00:01:23.100> focusing<00:01:24.100> problem<00:01:25.950> now

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
then focus focusing problem now

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:43.070 
then focus focusing problem now
you<00:01:28.030> can<00:01:28.210> see<00:01:28.360> here<00:01:28.540> now<00:01:34.860> works<00:01:35.860> good

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.690 

so<00:01:43.650> this<00:01:43.980> is<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:47.570> gear<00:01:48.570> Bay<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.520> see

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
so this is the the gear Bay you can see

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.560 
so this is the the gear Bay you can see
the<00:01:51.680> braking<00:01:52.680> cables<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:55.170> are<00:01:56.420> working<00:01:57.420> with

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the braking cables that are working with

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.630 
the braking cables that are working with
a<00:01:57.600> servo<00:01:59.600> so<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:01.680> installation<00:02:02.010> is<00:02:02.400> a<00:02:02.460> bit

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
a servo so the installation is a bit

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.380 
a servo so the installation is a bit
complicated<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:04.070> once<00:02:05.070> done<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:06.060> works

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
complicated but once done it works

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.660 
complicated but once done it works
really<00:02:06.690> good

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
really good

00:02:07.670 --> 00:03:42.119 
really good
so<00:02:08.780> do<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.960> test

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.370 

very<00:03:43.129> good
