Katrina's leg on just to give her some

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.539 
Katrina's leg on just to give her some
space<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.210> also<00:01:03.989> there<00:01:04.920> should<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> nice

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
space and also there should be a nice

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.340 
space and also there should be a nice
little<00:01:06.060> bit<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.360> space<00:01:06.510> between<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.049> back<00:01:07.200> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
little bit of space between the back of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.410 
little bit of space between the back of
the<00:01:07.409> knees<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> chair<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.640> two<00:01:09.119> or<00:01:09.240> three

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the knees and the chair but two or three

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.990 
the knees and the chair but two or three
fingers<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.229> sufficient<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.790> see

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
fingers is is sufficient now when we see

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.030 
fingers is is sufficient now when we see
between<00:01:12.180> us<00:01:12.479> sitting<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.750> now<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.650> angles

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
between us sitting here now the angles

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.859 
between us sitting here now the angles
are<00:01:14.280> where<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.549> want<00:01:14.790> them<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.180> however

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
are where we want them to be however

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.840 
are where we want them to be however
she's<00:01:16.860> probably<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.430> more<00:01:17.670> than

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
she's probably going to be more than

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.789 
she's probably going to be more than
likely<00:01:17.880> too<00:01:18.390> low<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.990> workstation<00:01:19.619> so

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
likely too low for the workstation so

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.700 
likely too low for the workstation so
she<00:01:19.860> wheels<00:01:20.189> herself<00:01:20.580> into<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> workstation

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
she wheels herself into the workstation

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.530 
she wheels herself into the workstation
and<00:01:22.710> he's<00:01:23.100> seated<00:01:23.310> at<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> workstation<00:01:24.330> now

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and he's seated at the workstation now

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
and he's seated at the workstation now
we<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.680> clearly<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.250> she's<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.820> little

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
we can clearly see that she's a little

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.840 
we can clearly see that she's a little
bit<00:01:27.330> too<00:01:27.960> low<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.560> therefore<00:01:29.310> she<00:01:29.490> would<00:01:29.640> need

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
bit too low and therefore she would need

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.560 
bit too low and therefore she would need
to<00:01:30.000> come<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.110> her<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.590> come<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
to come up now for her to come up and

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.359 
to come up now for her to come up and
get<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.750> right<00:01:33.900> angles<00:01:34.409> will<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.979> use<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
get the right angles will have to use a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.280 
get the right angles will have to use a
foot<00:01:35.579> dress<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.450> Katrina<00:01:36.689> will<00:01:36.960> grab<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
foot dress so Katrina will grab the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.960 
foot dress so Katrina will grab the
footrest<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.979> raise<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.430> chair<00:01:38.670> slightly

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
footrest and raise the chair slightly

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.999 
footrest and raise the chair slightly
which<00:01:39.390> she's<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.840> done<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.680> she's<00:01:40.829> brought

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
which she's just done so she's brought

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.090 
which she's just done so she's brought
the<00:01:41.189> chair<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.590> she's<00:01:43.590> come<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> little

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the chair up and she's come up a little

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.639 
the chair up and she's come up a little
bit<00:01:44.310> higher<00:01:44.659> again<00:01:45.659> because<00:01:46.079> she's<00:01:46.350> got<00:01:46.500> the
