00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.320
 Hello everyone, that guy is you 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.300
 constantly sits in a cap and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.380
 today I will tell you a little about 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.730
 tattooed 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.779
 I am already a carrier of 2 tattoos 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.580
 the carrier is probably somehow strange 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.890
 sounded shorter i already have two 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.539
 tattoos i think i'm basically already 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.390
 something I can do about it 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.550
 tell on this now i will click 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.650
 fingers and we move straight 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.500
 a studio called family 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.239
 tattoo and master named Andrei do not 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.239
 tattoo went 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.770
 The process begins with the development of a sketch 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.960
 if you already have a sketch like in my 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.300
 In this case, it only remains to print it. 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.910
 on special paper and transfer to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.950
 I wanted to apply my tattoo on 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.140
 biceps on the inside 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.510
 but when I told this to the master he 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.730
 I was dissuaded for what a huge 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.560
 thank you the fact is that moving hand 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.660
 the place you want to make 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.970
 tattooed can deform and 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.060
 be distorted if you don't want to 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.530
 distorted your tattoo 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.869
 pre-ask the master's advice 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.940
 although good from the master himself tells you 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.580
 get a tattoo where it will be 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.860
 look not like we planned 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.900
 we will beat the joker and so that the proportions 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.700
 the faces didn't get spoiled needed like 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.340
 should think everything over was decided 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.619
 move the tattoo a little lower closer to 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.290
 triceps where the skin is not so mobile 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.900
 the sketch transfer process reminds 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.450
 childish translations only gum paper with 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.270
 sketch drench if not mistaken in soapy 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.130
 water and transferred to the body sketch is ready 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.320
 now you need to choose paint 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.110
 the master consults with you and you together 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.460
 Pick up the necessary colors Well 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.980
 let's get clogged tattoo applied 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.260
 on the body with the help of such a machine with 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.360
 a small needle with a huge 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.180
 speed will pierce your skin and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.580
 paint under it sounds scary 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.310
 but in reality everything is different there are several 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.830
 species of single needle tips 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.810
 and with a few single needle clogged 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.450
 contour a few tattooed 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.790
 Painted by pain all 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.680
 this process is like an electric shock though 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.690
 difficult to say because pain 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.970
 everyone's threshold is different someone can 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.209
 experience incredible pain and someone and 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.980
 does sleep during the procedure 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.200
 when the tattoo is ready master 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.420
 wraps her up with film and also tells 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.850
 how to care for drawing care 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.890
 tattooing is equally important 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.350
 even if you make the perfect 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.870
 tattoo and you will be bad for her 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.900
 take care that result can be 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.930
 or is it even possible to reduce 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.410
 tattoo completely no tattoo 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.330
 reduced to 80 percent at most 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.580
 so after the procedure you can 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.290
 stay gray spot in place tattoo 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.690

 if you live in Donetsk, take a look at 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.350
 family tattoo where I made myself this
