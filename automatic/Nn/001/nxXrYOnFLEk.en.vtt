00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
the water this quarter for starters I

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.660 
the water this quarter for starters I
just<00:02:45.640> killed<00:02:45.879> a<00:02:46.030> shark<00:02:46.480> okay<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.829> I<00:02:48.430> saw

something<00:02:49.030> swimming<00:02:49.150> down<00:02:49.480> there<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:49.989> how<00:02:50.319> can

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
something swimming down there so how can

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.949 
something swimming down there so how can
that<00:02:50.680> be<00:02:50.890> good<00:02:51.069> knocks<00:02:51.940> what<00:02:52.299> do<00:02:52.359> you<00:02:52.480> think<00:02:52.720> ah

that be good knocks what do you think ah

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.380 
that be good knocks what do you think ah
see<00:02:53.799> I<00:02:53.829> thought<00:02:54.129> of<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.370> too<00:02:54.640> but<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:55.180> big

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
see I thought of that too but the big

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.780 
see I thought of that too but the big
gaping<00:02:55.569> hole<00:02:56.019> strategy<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.769> flawed<00:02:57.310> due<00:02:57.760> to

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
gaping hole strategy is flawed due to

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.640 
gaping hole strategy is flawed due to
the<00:02:58.030> ragged<00:02:58.239> chunks<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.900> metal<00:02:59.049> surrounding

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
the ragged chunks of metal surrounding

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.319 
the ragged chunks of metal surrounding
it<00:02:59.769> no<00:03:00.129> gentlemen<00:03:00.579> I<00:03:00.700> think<00:03:00.760> there's<00:03:01.090> only<00:03:01.209> one

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
it no gentlemen I think there's only one

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.240 
it no gentlemen I think there's only one
