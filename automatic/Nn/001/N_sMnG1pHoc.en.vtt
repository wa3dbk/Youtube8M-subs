00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello everyone in this video I will tell you 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.670
 how do i do such a thing like this 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:14.250
 house for a hamster it is very easy to do 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:18.720
 that's how we need scissors 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:25.230
 so which of these glue and box what 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:29.480
 reach something as well as 24 nov and then 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:35.420
 I'll take you a box 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:41.760
 Speaking about what will I take 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:01:06.619
 a little bit like this house and cut 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:01:06.619
 him to the end straight to the end of this country and 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.549
 less often 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:32.850
 here and there here and so also here 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:38.310
 Now, just about this house I still 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:47.060
 Once again, I took the cardboard and cut 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:55.910
 it is more authentic here and this 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:02:01.830
 length and width then cut the entrance here and 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.880
 Here we do it now we take 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.270
 A4 paper 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.360
 To be precise, I will need a little 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.610
 pieces basically this is a long one 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:25.820
 use a piece of mine here 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:25.820
 for two here and so this half now 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.880
 we still glue sticking 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:59.690
 and so hence the son Titova pecifications 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:03:04.580
 just running and so here it is 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:10.780
 most do on both sides here is such a 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:14.380
 the house turns out here from one box at 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.880
 I got two houses at once 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.680
 Of course you can call him Prague 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.280
 and do something 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.280
