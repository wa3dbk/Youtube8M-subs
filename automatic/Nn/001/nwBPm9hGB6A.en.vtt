about fire the fire is such an amazing
and<00:00:36.870> important<00:00:37.320> thing<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> human<00:00:38.430> psyche

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and important thing for the human psyche

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.240 
and important thing for the human psyche
fire<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.420> known<00:00:39.600> as<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> chemical<00:00:40.320> reaction<00:00:40.620> but

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
fire is known as a chemical reaction but

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.830 
fire is known as a chemical reaction but
it<00:00:41.340> does<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.760> many<00:00:41.879> more<00:00:42.120> things<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.600> us<00:00:42.690> it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
it does so many more things for us it

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.299 
it does so many more things for us it
helps<00:00:43.080> us<00:00:43.140> cook<00:00:43.350> our<00:00:43.500> food<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:44.100> helps

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
helps us cook our food it helps

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.580 
helps us cook our food it helps
sterilize<00:00:44.730> our<00:00:44.910> water<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.080> survival

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
sterilize our water and in a survival

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.799 
sterilize our water and in a survival
situation<00:00:46.710> having<00:00:47.400> a<00:00:47.580> fire<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.540> mean<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
situation having a fire can mean the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.229 
situation having a fire can mean the
difference<00:00:48.930> between<00:00:49.470> surviving<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.190> not

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
difference between surviving and not

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.490 
difference between surviving and not
surviving<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.540> just<00:00:51.809> because<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.080> its<00:00:52.290> warm

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
surviving not just because of its warm

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.380 
surviving not just because of its warm
but<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.280> its<00:00:53.400> psychological<00:00:53.850> thing

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
but because of its psychological thing

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.240 
but because of its psychological thing
that<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.660> warms<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.589> it's<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.070> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that it warms you up and it's like I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670 
that it warms you up and it's like I
have<00:00:56.460> fire<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.089> might<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.809> able<00:00:58.019> to<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.470> through

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
have fire I might be able to get through

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.830 
have fire I might be able to get through
this<00:00:58.860> so<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.520> very<00:00:59.700> very<00:01:00.000> important<00:01:00.450> so

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
this so it's very very important so

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.869 
this so it's very very important so
we're<00:01:00.930> gonna<00:01:01.050> talk<00:01:01.260> today<00:01:01.440> about<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.520> now

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
we're gonna talk today about this now

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.850 
we're gonna talk today about this now
this<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.350> Coghlan<00:01:06.259> magnesium<00:01:07.259> rod<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.830> a

furrow seeum striker prozium known as

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.320 
furrow seeum striker prozium known as
fire<00:01:10.289> steel<00:01:10.649> it's<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.759> little<00:01:11.910> piece<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
fire steel it's just a little piece of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.249 
fire steel it's just a little piece of
manmade

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
manmade

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.060 
manmade
element<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.640> once<00:01:15.300> striked<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.440> with<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
element that once striked with with the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
element that once striked with with the
hard<00:01:17.250> object<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.270> use<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> knife<00:01:18.690> or<00:01:18.720> you

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
hard object you can use a knife or you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.540 
hard object you can use a knife or you
can<00:01:19.200> use<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.410> you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.710> use<00:01:19.830> anything<00:01:20.430> really

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
can use that you can use anything really

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.749 
can use that you can use anything really
that's<00:01:20.850> good<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.149> hard<00:01:21.740> will<00:01:22.740> make<00:01:22.920> lots<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
that's good and hard will make lots and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.380 
that's good and hard will make lots and
lots<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.240> sparks<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.789> two<00:01:27.360> different

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
lots of sparks so this has two different

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.930 
lots of sparks so this has two different
parts<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:29.009> got<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.340> striker<00:01:29.670> that

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
parts to it it's got the striker that

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.330 
parts to it it's got the striker that
will<00:01:30.360> give<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.660> your<00:01:30.780> spark<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
will give you your spark and it has the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.609 
will give you your spark and it has the
magnesium<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.150> very<00:01:33.299> misunderstood<00:01:34.080> so

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
magnesium and it's very misunderstood so

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.320 
magnesium and it's very misunderstood so
we're<00:01:34.890> gonna<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.220> closer<00:01:35.520> look<00:01:35.729> right<00:01:36.150> now

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
we're gonna take a closer look right now

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.289 
we're gonna take a closer look right now
at<00:01:36.689> how<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.710> actually<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.850> magnesium

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
at how you actually get this magnesium

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.660 
at how you actually get this magnesium
off<00:01:39.780> here<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.290> how<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.920> works<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.460> it's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
off here and how it works now it's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.830 
off here and how it works now it's
important<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> know<00:01:42.329> one<00:01:42.600> thing<00:01:42.630> about

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
important to know one thing about

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.620 
important to know one thing about
magnesium<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.640> form<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
magnesium is that in this form in the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.960 
magnesium is that in this form in the
brick<00:01:45.869> form<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.650> just<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.340> brick<00:01:47.640> form

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
brick form it's just that a brick form

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.450 
brick form it's just that a brick form
it<00:01:48.570> doesn't<00:01:48.900> really<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.350> anything<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:50.040> a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
it doesn't really do anything it's a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.340 
it doesn't really do anything it's a
kind<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.880> metal<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.110> bub

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
kind of a metal so it's not going to bub

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.289 
kind of a metal so it's not going to bub
it's<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:52.920> gonna<00:01:53.009> break<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:53.549> wreck<00:01:53.790> crack<00:01:54.090> or

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it's not gonna break or wreck crack or

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.289 
it's not gonna break or wreck crack or
rupture<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.020> very<00:01:55.259> stable<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:56.310> once<00:01:57.060> we

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
rupture so it's very stable but once we

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.149 
rupture so it's very stable but once we
take<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.600> apart<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.200> once<00:01:58.470> we<00:01:58.649> get<00:01:58.829> smaller

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
take it apart and once we get smaller

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.429 
take it apart and once we get smaller
pieces<00:01:59.490> out<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.479> will<00:02:00.600> find<00:02:00.930> that

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
pieces out of this you will find that

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.530 
pieces out of this you will find that
it's<00:02:01.649> going<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:02.009> an<00:02:02.100> amazing<00:02:02.460> product<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
it's going to be an amazing product to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.749 
it's going to be an amazing product to
use<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.530> gonna<00:02:04.770> hand<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> over<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.579> 80

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
use so I'm gonna hand it over to 80

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
little tender pile here now it's always

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.800 
little tender pile here now it's always
recommended<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.799> use<00:02:28.970> something<00:02:29.970> sharp

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
recommended that you use something sharp

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.050 
recommended that you use something sharp
but<00:02:31.230> specifically<00:02:31.769> serrated<00:02:32.370> which<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.760> very

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
but specifically serrated which is very

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.300 
but specifically serrated which is very
good<00:02:33.329> for<00:02:33.600> getting<00:02:33.720> off<00:02:33.959> then<00:02:34.799> they<00:02:34.889> ease<00:02:35.130> him

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
good for getting off then they ease him

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.449 
good for getting off then they ease him
that<00:02:35.579> you<00:02:35.699> need

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
that you need

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.069 
that you need
so<00:02:36.970> you're<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.209> gonna<00:02:37.329> place<00:02:37.659> it<00:02:37.689> here

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
so you're just gonna place it here

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.039 
so you're just gonna place it here
amongst<00:02:38.920> your<00:02:39.159> dinner<00:02:39.540> use<00:02:40.540> your<00:02:40.750> serrated

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
amongst your dinner use your serrated

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.500 
amongst your dinner use your serrated
edge<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.720> start<00:02:44.079> to<00:02:44.260> slice<00:02:45.129> off<00:02:45.510> little

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510

the sharpness then we're gonna see now
how<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.760> spurts<00:03:21.060> Wow<00:03:22.060> take<00:03:22.329> a<00:03:22.389> look<00:03:22.629> at<00:03:22.689> that

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.780 

and<00:03:27.569> with<00:03:28.569> minimal<00:03:28.989> effort<00:03:29.409> our<00:03:29.980> entire

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
and with minimal effort our entire

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.129 
and with minimal effort our entire
little<00:03:31.090> fire<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:31.750> starting<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:34.900> makes<00:03:35.049> a

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
little fire is starting so that makes a

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.599 
little fire is starting so that makes a
pretty<00:03:35.409> great<00:03:35.650> little<00:03:36.010> fire<00:03:36.220> now<00:03:36.250> it's

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
pretty great little fire now it's

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.089 
pretty great little fire now it's
important<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.120> understand<00:03:37.569> that<00:03:38.099> magnesium

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
important to understand that magnesium

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.610 
important to understand that magnesium
is<00:03:39.189> used<00:03:39.489> in<00:03:39.670> underwater<00:03:40.060> welding<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:41.109> if<00:03:41.470> this

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
is used in underwater welding so if this

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.860 
is used in underwater welding so if this
thing<00:03:41.680> gets<00:03:41.980> soaking<00:03:42.549> wet<00:03:42.699> or<00:03:43.000> full<00:03:43.239> of<00:03:43.389> mud<00:03:43.629> or

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
thing gets soaking wet or full of mud or

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.659 
thing gets soaking wet or full of mud or
dirt<00:03:43.900> all<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.739> basically<00:03:45.099> have<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.400> do<00:03:45.519> is

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
dirt all you basically have to do is

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.699 
dirt all you basically have to do is
draw<00:03:45.940> is<00:03:46.090> wipe<00:03:46.299> it<00:03:46.449> off<00:03:46.599> and<00:03:46.959> it's<00:03:47.410> still<00:03:47.620> going

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
draw is wipe it off and it's still going

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.830 
draw is wipe it off and it's still going
to<00:03:47.769> work<00:03:47.859> now<00:03:48.489> there<00:03:48.699> was<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.849> miserable<00:03:49.359> rainy

a miserable rainy awful day in situation

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.420 
a miserable rainy awful day in situation
this<00:04:01.419> will<00:04:01.720> burn<00:04:01.959> wet<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:02.799> if<00:04:02.919> you<00:04:03.040> scrape<00:04:03.280> it

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
this will burn wet so if you scrape it

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.920 
this will burn wet so if you scrape it
off<00:04:03.579> and<00:04:03.609> scrape<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.180> off<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.329> scrape<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:04.810> off

off and scrape it off and scrape it off
you<00:04:05.530> know<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.680> would<00:04:05.859> use<00:04:05.979> a<00:04:06.010> good<00:04:06.669> portion<00:04:07.060> of
