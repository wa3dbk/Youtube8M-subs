00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.960
 Hello 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.510
 Today's video is a sweet door that I 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.529
 I made use of pans for sweets already 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.689
 bought ready is and cork is a door 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.470
 sweet but very simple 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.750
 do 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.289
 so come on then I 'm using 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.290
 these cups for candy is that it comes 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.300
 cut in flower shape are these 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.140
 packets usually cost around 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.160
 of 1 real in these stores of 1 99 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.950
 so that's what I'm going to do I 've put together 13 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.989
 here and I will make a well in the middle well 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.570
 I'm small, I'm wearing a needle. 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.270
 but can even stick with a toothpick 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.820
 barbecue the toothpick 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.510
 then it is simple held in each 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.510
 petal to evaluate with the same scissors 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.510
 in two we will do just that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.630
 the more you pull with the scissors but 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:21.299
 'bubble' dinho will stay the same in the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 another and bears sweet pretty well as well 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.560
 different 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.950
 and in this one the same thing only 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:35.549
 then I'll give another one a twist 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:41.090
 in her it will roll like this with the same hand 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.270
 just there giving one more chance on her 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.100
 ready 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.250
 What are we going to do with glue? 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.250
 white 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.659
 This one is more involved 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.070
 here goes over so only white glue 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.070
 that a little bit just in the center leaving 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.460
 the interleaved petals will become more 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.320
 cute and I'm going down here too 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.000
 pass glue to put the other 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.330
 I like the cola too and I'll go 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.490
 put inverted 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.810
 to stay like this and I'm going to use a 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.810
 toothpick 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.520
 It's just passing through the hole that you 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.640
 just done fighting with glue was a 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.610
 difficult to get a 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.980
 Then I'll stick it in the cork there. 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.640
 can for a mission of the black 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.700
 a miss angola is transparent and jealous 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.940
 bleeding can be black 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.250
 It depends on the color you find the most. 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:03:00.030
 cool to match the color of your 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:02.280
 party and stick the toothpick in the cork ready 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.530
 is that you can do the finishing as 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.690
 You can take a ride with a 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.570
 satin very fine, and make a 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.590
 Can you buy it so ready? 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:17.040
 that comes from these little package here used 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.140
 a little glue of hot glue and put 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.390
 here in the cork also another color 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.540
 who is also very cute can by 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.300
 a pebble of rhinestones and here in the case 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.250
 I'm using only honey bread. 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.300
 put the candy here that will already sting 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.950
 On your own it's toothpick and you stay 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.310
 with a 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.950
 it's a door if a door well bonbon 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.950
 different and very handsome 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.140

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.620
