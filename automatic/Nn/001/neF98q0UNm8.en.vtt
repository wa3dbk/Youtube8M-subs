 short all these products today we get 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.519
 found for a little video of a 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.429
 presentation of the end mode of the server to 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.530
 sanaa then to cynthia it's a server 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.420
 minecraft is the server pvp faction 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.150
 I think it's the best 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.500
 finally the best French waiter because 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.850
 that I was told in any case and it is this 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.930
 which is marked when we connect on 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.660
 know it so here in sedan tonight 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.279
 there then there is a server pvp faction 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.309
 so you see you can you there 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.500
 connect by clicking on the tactics and 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.860
 point fr here 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.660
 after we have a minecraft server that's where 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.649
 where most people finally play in 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.710
 those who do not like the pdp 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.050
 faction a little bit drive them that a 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.600
 little bit with games for example der 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.820
 geer games kraft shoots disinfect 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.150
 dead zombie mode and all that wrong 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.970
 dhabi free bild it's 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.350
 like fashion Christians did that without 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.390
 world here you can a little 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.630
 build whatever you want after 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.610
 you have the mode single player mode 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.990
 ie to play solo wants 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.820
 to say that this is a launcher so here 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.860
 you have a little bit of everything you 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.750
 have on a normal launcher with 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.140
 some additions to the by 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.690
 example the sails at the address of the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.390
 sncf server then you too 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.200
 multiplayer here you can also on 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.910
 according to manage that is good to see what 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.950
 that it is to say that finally you go 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.780
 on the vaulted site I'll have a skin is in 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.850
 do you can import it outright 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.290
 on your mac kraft but the problem 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.700
 it is that those who will have 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.479
 sloan on like for we'll see what he 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.770
 is that those who 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.930
 will use another loetscher they do not 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.450
 will not see and it's going that which is annoying 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.540
 but good for a loan for what it takes 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.360
 this server is not problematic 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.310
 since it sees you as finally the skin 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.479
 cousins ​​friends that's ready you have a 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.770
 address speak speak

 here you can on your password 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.920
 and all that and that 's so 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.120
 blow to the wii is also to say that this 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.880
 that's okay also versions 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.750
 cracked it's really not bad 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.310
 there are not only premium versions 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.490
 above after syrian queues 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.239
 but here we are one or two minutes because 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.670
 that there are really a lot of people 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.130
 on it we get to connect to play 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.150
 ben at rush hour after morning 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.890
 and in the evening very late so how are you 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:27.270
 go on saône kraft 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:29.690
 here is the guide not suddenly tired voice 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.300
 to check the security of the password 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.030
 I started teleporting suddenly 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.730
 I arrive there are already many people 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.310
 so in fact I beg you a little 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.470
 all the options fia then there there 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.880
 the clock at the beginning this is for 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.080
 scoring games to Hide 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.120
 players that will not hurt if you 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.980
 had it for example shot tour 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.090
 really have done a more fps and 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.380
 salads words then after 20 for for 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.130
 disable this function you click 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.390
 still on the on the clock with the click 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.260
 then learned to genk rapetous and a fashion 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.570
 I have never tried 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.620
 Is that vary it a bit like 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.660
 call of 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.640
 it's fighting me with weapons in my hand 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.730
 or not that I 'll be later I'll tell you 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.920
 say no more because I have not yet 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.340
 again and that's when after there was 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.290
 a jar languorous games and finally it's 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.519
 in fact it's quite similar to the hinglé 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.830
 riggins which has in very versions 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.799
 well what he wants we can badly I you 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.480
 just showed here is garlic and a gay 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.250
 games and on flights the boltz mice 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.650
 and games rules actually can not 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.329
 not break two blocks clearly with 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.209
 chests and all that with a kit at 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.269
 early archers kits all that dalger 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.010
 games after we can break blocks 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.329
 after there is a world are well in mode 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.579
 affected or I made you a little 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.940
 video above that I will dive finally I 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.959
 want to do a little bit of videos on 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.459
 all the modes that here I am 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.130
 will dive but for now I have 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.470
 does that the twins of zombies that's where 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.750
 there is a zombie you have to resist a little 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.140
 to insects and when you are eating 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.890
 for example gives you affected more 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.870
 powerful with his eating then that's 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.950
 hard to survive after a show 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.470
 kraft i want to make a video too 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.660
 soon on it then schukraft 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.700
 this is a bit of a mode that it offers 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.950
 it's you know a handmade stick 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.720
 and with a left click where I am more 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.450
 a wooden cube actually swaying you 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.660
 fireworks with alive your stick 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.710
 and suddenly you have to kill the most 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.030
 players possible to have the best 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.910
 ratio to kielce finally a dead kilo after 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.610
 peace live the box be there it's a bit of a 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.650
 world where everyone is pvp with here 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.720
 cyber shit destinies and all in 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.250
 diamond with golden apples that's good 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.510
 can play without or with mother but 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.210
 personally I advise you to 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.830
 to play without a golden apple because with this 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.450
 a little bit that's a bit boring 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.789
 it's a little long 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.400
 here and where I go free bultza I 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.560
 not tried yet but finally on behalf 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.090
 this is surely a small mode 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.599
 creative here we can do what we 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.150
 wants so here are a few more things 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.669
 to say about that here it is I think 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.110
 that they end up there so see there 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.590
 it's a bit of everything I 'm going 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.419
 present it's a bit the the server 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.400
 so to reconnect it's super simple 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.590
 you download the launcher on the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.639
 ci.net scene finally play point nex-3 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.770
 that's it and here you are 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.060
 little easily connect you for 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.599
 choose your who does not admit can 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.999
 come play it's not very difficult not 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.050
 very complicated to connect 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:27.310
 so that's pretty much the only 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.810
 things that were going to say on that aulas 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.240
 I hope you would have liked a 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.069
 little bit the video is true that you 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.680
 will come a little bit on server you 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:38.999
 burst we hope to see a little bit 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.999
 come on hi everyone
