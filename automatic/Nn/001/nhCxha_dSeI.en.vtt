forest he'll be off to the races here

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.199 
forest he'll be off to the races here
but<00:03:24.800> even<00:03:25.220> then<00:03:25.400> he<00:03:25.490> won't<00:03:25.640> be<00:03:25.760> able<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.000> cast

his<00:03:26.390> woodbourne<00:03:26.810> behemoth<00:03:27.260> which<00:03:27.500> i<00:03:27.820> don't

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
his woodbourne behemoth which i don't

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.520 
his woodbourne behemoth which i don't
know<00:03:29.060> if<00:03:29.150> i<00:03:29.240> want<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.420> take<00:03:29.600> that<00:03:29.840> or<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.260> stone

horn<00:03:30.800> chanter<00:03:33.850> he's<00:03:34.850> way<00:03:35.180> off<00:03:35.209> from<00:03:35.390> either<00:03:35.780> of

horn chanter he's way off from either of
them<00:03:36.170> I<00:03:36.320> guess<00:03:36.470> I'll<00:03:36.620> take<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:36.890> stone<00:03:37.100> horn

them I guess I'll take the stone horn

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.100 
them I guess I'll take the stone horn
chanter<00:03:37.670> just<00:03:37.850> because<00:03:38.000> it's<00:03:38.150> easier<00:03:38.810> for<00:03:38.840> him

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
chanter just because it's easier for him

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.920 
chanter just because it's easier for him
to<00:03:39.170> cast<00:03:39.500> ultimately<00:03:43.540> we<00:03:44.540> look<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.780> be<00:03:44.900> in

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
to cast ultimately we look to be in

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:53.470 
to cast ultimately we look to be in
really<00:03:45.200> good<00:03:45.320> spot<00:03:45.709> here<00:03:45.770> though<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:52.480> he's

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
really good spot here though and he's

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.170 
really good spot here though and he's
missing<00:03:53.870> land<00:03:54.080> drops<00:03:54.320> 2<00:03:54.650> g's<00:03:57.760> take<00:03:58.760> five<00:03:59.150> I

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
missing land drops 2 g's take five I

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.580 
missing land drops 2 g's take five I
guess

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.220 

I<00:04:07.010> mean<00:04:08.300> all<00:04:09.300> we've<00:04:09.510> done<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.750> just<00:04:09.900> play

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
I mean all we've done is just play

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.880 
I mean all we've done is just play
spells<00:04:10.590> like<00:04:11.280> most<00:04:11.970> turns<00:04:12.440> against<00:04:13.440> him<00:04:13.530> and

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
spells like most turns against him and

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.280 
spells like most turns against him and
we've<00:04:14.239> been<00:04:15.239> in<00:04:15.360> a<00:04:15.420> good<00:04:15.599> spot<00:04:15.900> because<00:04:15.959> he's

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
we've been in a good spot because he's

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.259 
we've been in a good spot because he's
color<00:04:16.829> screwed<00:04:17.250> but<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.579> looks<00:04:17.970> like<00:04:18.060> he's

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
color screwed but it looks like he's

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.879 
color screwed but it looks like he's
running<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.600> old<00:04:18.810> Devils<00:04:19.169> man<00:04:19.380> debase<00:04:19.680> the

you can see you know the best thing

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.830 
you can see you know the best thing
about<00:05:31.950> it<00:05:32.099> was<00:05:32.789> just<00:05:32.970> that<00:05:33.060> it<00:05:33.180> was<00:05:33.240> consistent

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
about it was just that it was consistent

spells<00:05:35.729> that<00:05:35.880> were<00:05:36.000> relevant<00:05:36.180> for<00:05:37.080> for<00:05:37.380> the

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
spells that were relevant for for the

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.320 
spells that were relevant for for the
most<00:05:37.620> part<00:05:37.830> I<00:05:38.099> mean<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:38.880> did<00:05:39.030> have<00:05:39.180> some
