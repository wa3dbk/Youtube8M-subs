00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.340 
hundred dollars so my only main problem
I<00:04:05.880> have<00:04:06.090> with<00:04:06.120> these<00:04:06.420> headphones<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:07.079> the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
I have with these headphones is the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.210 
I have with these headphones is the
price<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.829> value<00:04:08.209> if<00:04:09.209> these<00:04:09.540> were<00:04:09.720> under<00:04:10.220> 150

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
price and value if these were under 150

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.449 
price and value if these were under 150
dollars<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:12.030> will<00:04:12.570> definitely<00:04:12.989> recommend<00:04:13.950> them

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
dollars I will definitely recommend them

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.390 
dollars I will definitely recommend them
but<00:04:14.730> there<00:04:14.880> are<00:04:14.970> still<00:04:15.120> some<00:04:15.420> competition<00:04:16.400> so

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
but there are still some competition so

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.729 
but there are still some competition so
the<00:04:17.549> truth<00:04:17.729> is<00:04:18.030> is<00:04:18.299> that<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:19.049> can<00:04:19.260> get<00:04:19.470> some

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
the truth is is that you can get some

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.039 
the truth is is that you can get some
really<00:04:20.130> really<00:04:20.970> nice<00:04:21.330> headphones<00:04:21.660> with<00:04:22.019> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
really really nice headphones with the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.670 
really really nice headphones with the
same<00:04:22.349> price<00:04:22.849> they<00:04:23.849> won't<00:04:24.060> be<00:04:24.240> as<00:04:24.390> attractive

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
same price they won't be as attractive

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.760 
same price they won't be as attractive
they<00:04:25.889> will<00:04:26.009> definitely<00:04:26.669> sound<00:04:27.210> much<00:04:28.080> much

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
they will definitely sound much much

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.730 
they will definitely sound much much
better<00:04:29.060> so<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.180> question<00:04:30.570> becomes<00:04:30.930> how<00:04:31.500> much

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
better so the question becomes how much

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.499 
better so the question becomes how much
are<00:04:31.949> you<00:04:32.009> willing<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:32.490> pay<00:04:32.669> for<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.940> brand<00:04:33.270> and
