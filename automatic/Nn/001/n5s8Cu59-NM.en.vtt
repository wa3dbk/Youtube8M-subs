00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.460
 Hi everyone, joey here again and welcome back. 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.520
 So today, I'm going to show you how to build an aquarium chiller. 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.849
 Some hobbyists live in areas where it can get very hot in certain months 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.720
 . Cooling their aquarium water on a constant basis is something they need to consider 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.720
 . 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.680
 In today's video, I'm going to show you how to get a cooling machine that you can do at home 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.529
 who will not only work well to build, but look good, are functional 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.529
 and cost-effective. 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.679
 I wanted to keep this project under $ 100 and be universal for every aquarium. As 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.830
 With all my videos, I also needed a project that many people could actually do 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.930
 to make . So simplicity is always important. 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.000
 Smaller chillers start around $ 500 for a cooling machine rated for Aaround 50 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.980
 liters. This project only costs around $ 100 for 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.080
 same size tank, and use less power. 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.320
 Even more, this project will serve to inspire you with a simple idea. 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.560
 So let's get started. 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.330
 I started buying a second-hand mini fridge. 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.710
 I built the cooling machine from one of these as they are generally available, inexpensive 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.720
 , and easy to work with and looks good. 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.640
 Since I used mine, I only paid $ 30 for it. 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.140
 Also new, this only $ 100. You will be able to list many mini fridges 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.620
 rocks, Kijiji or other similar sites for about the same price or even less 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.620
 to find. 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.820
 I started removing everything from the fridge. I removed the schedule 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.660
 , and all the small doors inside. 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.850
 Most mini fridges will have a small "freezer" inside. Disassembly of the door from 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.270
 it will ensure more circulation of the cold air. NOT Freezing tray like this 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.660
 is what actually produces the cold air. 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.050
 With the fridge emptied now, I have some garden hose. 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.830
 I used garden hose if it is stiff and cheap. It also has excellent insulating 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.190
 properties compared to other types of snakes. You can use what you find is 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.810
 the cheapest . But you will need a lot of it. When using garden hose, runs 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.590
 some water through it for a few minutes will ensure there is no dust or anything else in it 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.340
 use the hose making it more safe. I have two 50 foot snakes for $ 15 in it 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.043
 total. I picked the cheapest I could find and they were for sale. 

00:02:10.043 --> 00:02:13.569
 You will want to test fit the hose in the refrigerator first, to ensure that it fits. 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.970
 Again, the more snake you have, the better. I would start with at least 100 meters ... At 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.200
 Use of garden hose, don't bother unraveling it. 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.310
 It is better just to nod alone and not be guided. Plus, it's already nicely rolled up 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.310
 for you . 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.540
 Now prepare the snake. Start by cutting one end of each hose. Cut opposite 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.540
 connectors. 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.080
 We still need to be able to connect the snakes in the middle. If you only 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.330
 a long hose, you can just cut off both ends. 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.629
 Then close the two hoses in the middle 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:46.629
 . 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.190
 Using your spade drill, drill the holes where you put the hose in and out. Location 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.920
 is not as long as you do not go through the back or the top of the fridge 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.920
 from. 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.140
 This will generally be harder to work around and more likely to hitting something you don't want 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.770
 ! The spade must be slightly small than the diameter of the hose, as this is a tight fit 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.370
 will insure and allow the hose to form a seal with the refrigerator. 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.280
 Slide the hose through the holes. If you find it a loose fit, complete 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.850
 you free to make them silicone instead. You can even use a number 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.680
 expanding foam to help isolate that area. Although not necessary, and drives 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.110
 All costs to its benefits are slightly better than silicone. 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.569
 Note the thermostat is still intact and the "freezer" is still complete 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.460
 functional. It is only now being ventilated and the colder air can flow freely throughout 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.460
 refrigerator . 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.940
 Turn the fridge on, and leave it on its own for at least 24 hours with setting 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.950
 the coolest temperature temperature ... This will make the fridge ready for use. 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.970
 Now before we talk about connecting your aquarium, let's first talk about how 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.970
 this works. 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.880
 Water is pumped through the hose in the refrigerator and returned to the tank. 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.950
 Water is cooled by spending time in the fridge. The more hose must be in the 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.240
 refrigerator, the longer the water stays in contact with the cool hose and the cooler outlet 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.560
 of the water. 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.090
 To control the temperature, changes must be followed over time, until you find the right one 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.680
 temperature in the tank. 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.930
 By simply turning the flow of the pump, you cool the water. Turn it on, 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.900
 heats the water. It may also be possible to play with the thermostat 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.139
 useful too. This style cooler is good for tanks up to 50 liters. However, that will also depend 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:35.219
 of how cool you have to be your water. This could work on larger setups 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:36.219
 . 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.720
 So how can you do this with your aquarium? 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.069
 Well this is where you get creative. 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.819
 Every aquarium is unique. You would not want a pump in your aquarium, so you decide 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.559
 To pump the "inline" directly outside the tank and just a few PVC intake and output 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.439
 for the cooling machine. Maybe you don't mind an extra 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:01.499
 pump in the tank and you only have one pump up to the cooling machine and the drain hose 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:03.659
 back to the tank. 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:10.129
 Ultimately this is the easiest and cheapest if you are working on a carter. In this way 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.180
 you only need to use a cheap and low power head or small pump. 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.479
 What I also like to do is on the drain hose, I close a ball valve, so I can power it 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.650
 a little easier to check. This is actually a must able temperature 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.900
 arrange more accurately. The thermostat in the fridge will help with that too. 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.779
 Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this project and it gave you a few ideas 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:34.779
 to use on your own. 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.199
 I also want to thank you for watching and see you next time.
