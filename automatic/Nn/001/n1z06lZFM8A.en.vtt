00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
battery and we suggest taking a test

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.870 
battery and we suggest taking a test
like<00:01:13.319> putting<00:01:13.709> your<00:01:13.799> coupling<00:01:14.219> back<00:01:14.399> on<00:01:14.639> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
like putting your coupling back on and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.459 
like putting your coupling back on and
then<00:01:15.149> putting<00:01:15.359> a<00:01:15.479> tough<00:01:15.719> plate<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.139> to<00:01:16.349> at

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
then putting a tough plate on to at

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:19.160 
then putting a tough plate on to at
ensure<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.659> we've<00:01:18.810> hooked<00:01:18.990> up

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
ensure that you have so we've hooked up

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.190 
ensure that you have so we've hooked up
our<00:01:19.349> battery<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:21.090> we're<00:01:21.329> back<00:01:21.479> over<00:01:21.899> here<00:01:22.079> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
our battery and we're back over here and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.760 
our battery and we're back over here and
we<00:01:22.529> up<00:01:22.709> our<00:01:22.920> coupling<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.590> other

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
we up our coupling the other

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.109 
we up our coupling the other
thing<00:01:26.069> you're<00:01:26.189> gonna<00:01:26.340> want<00:01:26.579> to<00:01:26.670> do<00:01:26.819> well<00:01:26.999> now

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
thing you're gonna want to do well now

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
when you have we have our test flight

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.870 
when you have we have our test flight
hooked<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.099> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.399> we<00:01:29.700> have

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
hooked up and as you can see we have

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.909 
hooked up and as you can see we have
power<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.389> it<00:01:30.539> make<00:01:31.169> sure<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.409> turn<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.619> key

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:31.919 
power to it make sure you turn the key

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:34.339 
power to it make sure you turn the key
on<00:01:32.090> sounds<00:01:33.090> kinda<00:01:33.419> corny<00:01:33.599> but<00:01:33.929> if<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.169> don't

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:34.349 
on sounds kinda corny but if you don't

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:35.809 
on sounds kinda corny but if you don't
turn<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.679> key<00:01:34.859> on<00:01:34.889> you're<00:01:35.340> not<00:01:35.490> gonna<00:01:35.609> get

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
turn the key on you're not gonna get

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.690 
turn the key on you're not gonna get
power<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> sensor<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.340> as<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.549> just

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
power to the sensor and as you're just

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.219 
power to the sensor and as you're just
gonna<00:01:38.880> spare<00:01:39.179> yourself<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.599> whole<00:01:39.749> lot<00:01:39.929> of<00:01:39.959> time

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
gonna spare yourself a whole lot of time

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.800 
gonna spare yourself a whole lot of time
and<00:01:40.409> expense<00:01:40.469> so<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.969> on<00:01:42.179> this<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.569> very

and expense so and so on this is very
easy<00:01:43.020> takes<00:01:43.709> about<00:01:43.859> three<00:01:44.310> minutes<00:01:44.489> to<00:01:44.729> do

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
easy takes about three minutes to do

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.209 
easy takes about three minutes to do
start<00:01:45.209> to<00:01:45.299> finish<00:01:45.569> and<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.709> a<00:01:46.799> great<00:01:46.979> way<00:01:47.189> to
