00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
of it that's pretty little a little bit

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.980 
of it that's pretty little a little bit
disappointing<00:02:15.920> there<00:02:16.100> but<00:02:17.000> let's<00:02:17.240> keep<00:02:17.390> going

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
disappointing there but let's keep going

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.290 
disappointing there but let's keep going
I'll<00:02:18.560> spit<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:18.860> around<00:02:19.070> now<00:02:19.280> we'll<00:02:19.910> start<00:02:20.090> here

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
I'll spit it around now we'll start here

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.280 
I'll spit it around now we'll start here
with<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.570> foot<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.959> front<00:02:21.170> compartment

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
with the foot of the front compartment

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.070 
with the foot of the front compartment
this<00:02:22.070> door<00:02:22.340> folds<00:02:22.700> down<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.209> this<00:02:23.840> little

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080

this door folds down and this little
flap<00:02:24.260> folds<00:02:24.620> up<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.780> shows<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.959> inside

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
flap folds up and that shows you inside

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
and that's on both sides so you can see

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.610 
and that's on both sides so you can see
if<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.820> get<00:02:31.940> light<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.420> there<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.530> can

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
if you get light in there and that can

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.520 
if you get light in there and that can
holes<00:02:33.860> up<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.280> four<00:02:34.820> clone<00:02:35.300> troopers<00:02:35.750> I'll<00:02:36.290> see

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
holes up to four clone troopers I'll see

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.880 
holes up to four clone troopers I'll see
if<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.739> can<00:02:36.950> zoom<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:39.410> can<00:02:39.620> have<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.739> bit

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
if I can zoom in so you can have a bit

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.060 
if I can zoom in so you can have a bit
of<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.010> look<00:02:40.070> at<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:42.260> there's<00:02:42.440> our<00:02:42.590> four

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
of a look at that so there's our four

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.550 
of a look at that so there's our four
clone<00:02:43.340> troopers<00:02:43.760> in<00:02:44.239> there<00:02:44.900> they'd<00:02:45.500> be

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
clone troopers in there they'd be

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.530 
clone troopers in there they'd be
sitting<00:02:45.830> there<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.220> city<00:02:46.430> position<00:02:46.850> again

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
sitting there in a city position again

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.300 
sitting there in a city position again
there's<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:48.020> little<00:02:48.440> bit<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.560> detail<00:02:48.980> in<00:02:49.190> there

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
there's a little bit of detail in there

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.030 
there's a little bit of detail in there
sticker<00:02:49.790> or<00:02:49.970> two<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:50.450> nothing<00:02:51.230> really<00:02:51.380> flash

sticker or two but nothing really flash
to<00:02:52.310> look<00:02:52.459> at<00:02:52.640> because<00:02:53.209> most<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.690> action<00:02:53.989> is

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
to look at because most of the action is

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.330 
to look at because most of the action is
in<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.350> back<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.670> vehicle<00:02:56.770> so<00:02:57.770> before<00:02:58.310> I

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
that up you can see these buttons here

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.290 
that up you can see these buttons here

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
and that's the one that fires our cannon

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.250 
and that's the one that fires our cannon
I'll<00:03:40.970> spin<00:03:41.239> this<00:03:41.360> guy<00:03:41.570> back<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.079> can<00:03:42.200> see

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
and you can see screen lights up but now

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.410 
and you can see screen lights up but now
for<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.549> action<00:03:49.820> of<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.000> most<00:03:50.090> exciting

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
for the action of the most exciting

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.319 
for the action of the most exciting
button<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:50.900> that's<00:03:51.019> this<00:03:51.140> big<00:03:51.350> button<00:03:51.650> here

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
button and that's this big button here

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.819 
button and that's this big button here
spin<00:03:53.329> him<00:03:53.480> around<00:03:53.570> so<00:03:53.930> we<00:03:54.049> can<00:03:54.170> get<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.680> good

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
spin him around so we can get a good

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.500 
spin him around so we can get a good
look<00:03:54.890> at<00:03:55.130> it<00:03:55.160> so<00:03:55.730> this<00:03:55.850> is<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.090> rear<00:03:56.239> of<00:03:56.420> the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
look at it so this is the rear of the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:08.600 
look at it so this is the rear of the
vehicle<00:03:57.100> so<00:03:58.100> if<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.549> push<00:03:58.850> this<00:03:59.239> top<00:03:59.510> button

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.300 

which<00:04:09.420> reveals<00:04:09.900> our<00:04:10.260> inner<00:04:10.739> workings<00:04:11.099> of<00:04:11.190> the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
which reveals our inner workings of the

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.570 
which reveals our inner workings of the
ATT<00:04:11.879> and<00:04:12.180> our<00:04:12.900> clones<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.890> I'll<00:04:14.069> spin<00:04:14.459> that

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
ATT and our clones so I'll spin that

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.580 
ATT and our clones so I'll spin that
around<00:04:14.640> too<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.120> can<00:04:15.269> see<00:04:15.390> there<00:04:15.629> I<00:04:15.840> placed<00:04:16.470> a

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
around too you can see there I placed a

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.400 
around too you can see there I placed a
few<00:04:16.739> clones<00:04:17.040> in<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:18.019> vehicle<00:04:19.019> it<00:04:19.200> can

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
few clones in the vehicle it can

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.770 
few clones in the vehicle it can
actually<00:04:19.620> has<00:04:19.919> up<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.160> 20<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:20.910> if<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.510> do<00:04:21.630> have

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
actually has up to 20 so if you do have

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.960 
actually has up to 20 so if you do have
a<00:04:21.810> few<00:04:22.049> clones<00:04:22.380> in<00:04:22.560> your<00:04:22.680> collection<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.220> can

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
a few clones in your collection you can

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
gutting physicians for the turrets on

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.550 
gutting physicians for the turrets on
the<00:04:29.790> side<00:04:30.000> here<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:30.419> this<00:04:30.960> one<00:04:31.169> here<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.500> this

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
the side here so this one here and this

the side here so this one here and this
one<00:04:31.620> here<00:04:31.889> again<00:04:31.919> they<00:04:32.310> don't<00:04:32.490> fire<00:04:32.790> but<00:04:33.600> the

one here again they don't fire but the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.600 
one here again they don't fire but the
actual<00:04:34.110> turrets<00:04:34.650> themselves<00:04:35.100> do<00:04:35.220> fire<00:04:35.430> they

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
actual turrets themselves do fire they

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.129 
actual turrets themselves do fire they
have<00:04:35.700> a<00:04:35.729> little<00:04:35.880> button<00:04:36.030> on<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.330> top<00:04:36.510> so<00:04:37.080> you

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
have a little button on the top so you

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.550 
have a little button on the top so you
can<00:04:37.350> push<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:39.120> launch<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.930> missile<00:04:40.290> the

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
can push that to launch the missile the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.980 
can push that to launch the missile the
same<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.400> with<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.760> turrets<00:04:42.300> on<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:42.570> front

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.469 

these<00:04:45.990> ones<00:04:46.260> here<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.130> can<00:04:47.250> see<00:04:47.490> the

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
these ones here that you can see the

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.909 
these ones here that you can see the
swivel<00:04:49.139> around<00:04:49.950> they<00:04:50.850> move<00:04:51.540> in<00:04:51.810> unison<00:04:52.169> so<00:04:52.650> if

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
swivel around they move in unison so if

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.560 
swivel around they move in unison so if
you<00:04:53.010> move<00:04:53.190> one<00:04:53.220> they<00:04:53.669> move<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:53.970> other<00:04:54.030> there's

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
you move one they move the other there's

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.719 
you move one they move the other there's
two<00:04:54.750> on<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.960> top<00:04:55.139> and<00:04:55.290> two<00:04:55.350> underneath<00:04:55.729> so

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
two on the top and two underneath so

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:04.180 
two on the top and two underneath so
I'll<00:04:56.850> zoom<00:04:57.060> out<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.660> hopefully<00:04:58.050> show<00:04:58.650> you<00:04:58.710> that

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.800 

yes<00:05:05.190> I've<00:05:05.370> moved<00:05:05.550> back<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:05.729> little<00:05:05.940> bit<00:05:06.060> so<00:05:06.330> as

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
you can see there there's the guns there

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.469 
you can see there there's the guns there
again<00:05:08.250> they<00:05:08.370> do<00:05:08.430> fire<00:05:08.729> just<00:05:08.970> by<00:05:09.060> pushing<00:05:09.270> a

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479

button<00:05:09.510> so<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:10.530> can<00:05:10.800> launch<00:05:11.280> into<00:05:11.580> attack

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
button so you can launch into attack

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.500 
button so you can launch into attack
mode

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
mode

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.680

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
and if you can pick them up cheap highly

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.610 
and if you can pick them up cheap highly
recommend<00:05:18.210> them<00:05:18.330> they<00:05:18.750> ask<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.320> require<00:05:19.590> a

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
recommend them they ask you to require a

recommend them they ask you to require a
bit<00:05:19.800> of<00:05:19.889> space<00:05:20.130> in<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.580> collection<00:05:20.970> so<00:05:21.930> make

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
bit of space in the collection so make

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.779 
bit of space in the collection so make
sure<00:05:22.289> you<00:05:22.500> can<00:05:22.590> fit<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:23.520> other<00:05:23.639> thing

one this one I think must have been a
rare<00:05:27.090> release<00:05:27.360> because<00:05:27.539> a<00:05:27.600> lot<00:05:27.780> of<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:27.900> videos

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
rare release because a lot of the videos
