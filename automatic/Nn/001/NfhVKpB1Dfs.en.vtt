first setting is for finer hair which is

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.060 
first setting is for finer hair which is
and<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:57.519> rotating<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.390> a<00:00:58.420> bit<00:00:58.749> slower<00:00:59.199> so<00:00:59.589> the

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
and the rotating is a bit slower so the

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.660 
and the rotating is a bit slower so the
sort<00:01:00.309> of<00:01:00.399> sizes<00:01:00.730> and<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.280> second

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
sort of sizes and then the second

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.670 
sort of sizes and then the second
setting<00:01:03.999> is<00:01:04.150> for<00:01:04.390> more<00:01:04.600> coarser<00:01:05.110> hair<00:01:05.140> which

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
lot faster than the first so you can

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.380 
lot faster than the first so you can
hear<00:01:10.480> the<00:01:10.659> two<00:01:10.810> differences<00:01:11.440> um<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:13.180> thing

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.670 
it up enough to use strips and there's
only<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:32.420> many<00:02:32.510> strips<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.020> they<00:02:33.230> give<00:02:33.500> you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
only so many strips that they give you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.020 
only so many strips that they give you
so<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.280> do<00:02:34.550> reuse<00:02:35.480> them<00:02:35.780> again<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.520> clean<00:02:37.880> them

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
so I do reuse them again so I clean them

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.570 
so I do reuse them again so I clean them
in<00:02:38.240> them<00:02:38.420> I'm<00:02:38.810> just<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.500> hate<00:02:39.980> doing<00:02:40.250> that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
in them I'm just I hate doing that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.920 
in them I'm just I hate doing that
tweezing<00:02:41.480> takes<00:02:42.020> way<00:02:42.410> too<00:02:42.440> long<00:02:43.010> week<00:02:43.550> I

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
tweezing takes way too long week I

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.380 
tweezing takes way too long week I
remember<00:02:44.930> when<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.650> was<00:02:45.770> younger<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:46.490> plucked

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
remember when I was younger I so plucked

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.650 
remember when I was younger I so plucked
every<00:02:47.750> single<00:02:48.290> hair<00:02:48.500> off<00:02:48.710> my<00:02:48.920> leg<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.400> it

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
every single hair off my leg and it

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.000 
every single hair off my leg and it
doesn't<00:02:50.660> do<00:02:50.780> anything<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:52.870> threading<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:54.110> can

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
tired is my alternative I've been

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.270 
tired is my alternative I've been
wanting<00:03:02.570> this<00:03:02.600> for<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:03.020> long<00:03:03.200> time<00:03:03.260> just<00:03:03.890> didn't

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
wanting this for a long time just didn't

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.340 
wanting this for a long time just didn't
know<00:03:04.370> where<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.550> get<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.820> it's<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:06.020> lot<00:03:06.320> cheaper

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
know where to get it it's a lot cheaper

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.280 
know where to get it it's a lot cheaper
than<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:08.180> know<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.540> other<00:03:08.690> ones<00:03:08.960> that<00:03:09.170> I've

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
than you know the other ones that I've

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.270 
than you know the other ones that I've
seen<00:03:10.210> its<00:03:11.210> cost<00:03:11.570> efficient<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:12.710> say<00:03:13.250> for

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
seen its cost efficient so say for

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.910 
seen its cost efficient so say for
example<00:03:13.520> this<00:03:14.300> is<00:03:14.360> seventy<00:03:14.870> dollars<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.620> say

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
example this is seventy dollars so say

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.370 
example this is seventy dollars so say
and<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.850> course<00:03:17.150> of<00:03:17.270> seven<00:03:17.600> years<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:18.140> have

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
and the course of seven years you have

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.010 
and the course of seven years you have
this<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:19.040> keep<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.370> in<00:03:19.490> good<00:03:19.520> condition<00:03:20.020> it

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
this to keep it in good condition it

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.240 
this to keep it in good condition it
will<00:03:21.140> only<00:03:21.350> cost<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.830> ten<00:03:22.100> dollars<00:03:22.130> per<00:03:22.820> year

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
will only cost you ten dollars per year

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.300 
will only cost you ten dollars per year
which<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.310> pretty<00:03:25.700> good<00:03:26.080> seeing<00:03:27.080> as<00:03:27.350> some

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
which is pretty good seeing as some

often<00:05:29.150> should<00:05:29.449> you<00:05:29.690> use<00:05:30.050> this<00:05:31.030> depends<00:05:32.030> on<00:05:32.150> the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
often should you use this depends on the

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.110 
often should you use this depends on the
person<00:05:32.780> if<00:05:33.050> you<00:05:33.289> have<00:05:33.860> really<00:05:34.610> quick<00:05:34.849> hair

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
invest in it up the later because it's a

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.499

go over the area's a bit you know a
couple<00:06:05.900> times<00:06:06.259> but<00:06:06.469> eventually<00:06:06.860> it<00:06:07.370> will<00:06:07.669> get

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
couple times but eventually it will get

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.589 
couple times but eventually it will get
it<00:06:08.090> out<00:06:08.210> and<00:06:09.520> you<00:06:10.520> know<00:06:10.639> it<00:06:10.880> gets<00:06:10.969> the<00:06:11.210> shorter

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599

hair as it gets the long hairs and yeah
the<00:06:15.710> only<00:06:15.800> downside<00:06:16.340> is<00:06:16.370> it<00:06:16.789> may<00:06:16.969> take<00:06:17.210> a<00:06:17.240> bit

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
the only downside is it may take a bit

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.550 
the only downside is it may take a bit
of<00:06:17.539> time<00:06:17.630> to<00:06:18.469> get<00:06:18.650> used<00:06:18.889> to<00:06:19.099> but<00:06:20.169> you<00:06:21.169> know<00:06:21.259> it's
