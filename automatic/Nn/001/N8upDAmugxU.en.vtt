 hi girls again with you today 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.230
 we come to teach how to make this cute 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.020
 project a flower that we have been asked in 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.549
 several opportunities and we've loved it 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.940
 elaborate so that you can 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.030
 do 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.340
 I thank you for all the messages that 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.080
 they sent us those girls who 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.940
 they already have their own businesses we are 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.250
 very happy that our videos 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.070
 have served and we hope to continue 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.739
 With your support and recommend 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.630
 our channel to your friends share 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.489
 our videos so that other girls 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.850
 may have the opportunity to generate 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.379
 your own companies your own business 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.650
 well let's teach how to make this 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:51.260
 flower and very easy to do for that 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:54.019
 We have cut strips of tape fails 2.5 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.360
 centimeters wide for which the flower 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.739
 base we have cut a strip of 12 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.110
 centimeters for the smallest flower of 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:07.130
 2.5 to the same width and 10 centimeters of 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.610
 long 12 and 10 centimeters long here 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.440
 we are going to teach you a different model 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.270
 so that you can combine the two 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.840
 the two measures of 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.509
 of the tape how important this is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.310
 learn to make the petal there 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.460
 you can make your own 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.000
 designs do not forget that the ribbons 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.740
 they must be sealed with the candle or the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.319
 match so you do not go to 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.209
 damage here we are going to bend the tape of 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.909
 this way and here we are going to make a 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:41.490
 small crease 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.740
 to be able to enter it within 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.469
 our needle and that you have a way 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.869
 very beautiful in the center the flower and 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.460
 having the fold you 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.360
 introduce 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.369
 your needle with the tape of another tone 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.010
 then we do the same thing we fold it 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.979
 here we make a small crease is like 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.420
 if you knew with your fingers the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.869
 tape 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.840
 there they have the figurine simply 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:15.830
 fold and introduce it inside 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.830
 of the needle 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.440
 already after entering all 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.010
 all tapes then we are going to close 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.010
 the flower 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.380
 ready here we have already closed our 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.380
 flower 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.750
 we have placed 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.450
 five red and five white strips for 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.100
 we have left a very nice design will 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.370
 We are going to show how the 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.370
 the petals you are going to double with 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.170
 watch the tape to mark each one 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.030
 of those of the half petals 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.940
 now in carefully 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.790
 Apply hot silicone so that 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.290
 do not take them off 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.400
 halfway and they're going to fold it for 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.799
 paste it 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.049
 they have it conveniently pressed so that 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.480
 silicone dry and already have what 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.000
 are the petals are going to do all the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.540
 equal procedure in each of the 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.170
 petals mark half and apply 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.170
 silicone 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.570
 Everything is ready here over the 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.920
 only thing that you should do is 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.920
 organize the petals 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.310
 and ready and here is organized what 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.650
 is the flower for the center we have 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.549
 produced a flower combined with the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:20.900
 tones of the ribbons we apply silicone 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.850
 and we paste our little flower 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.759
 This is a design that you can 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.729
 elaborate the other with the measures that already 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:31.900
 I had given them 10 to 12 centimeters 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:36.550
 they can be made individually 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.550
 they are simply going to stick them with silicone 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.590
 The little one is given a brooch 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.910
 button what you want these are 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.320
 snaps that come already come like this 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.080
 made with pearls to give 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.820
