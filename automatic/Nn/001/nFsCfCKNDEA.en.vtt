here
the<00:01:44.240> SOS<00:01:45.020> package<00:01:45.500> has<00:01:45.770> six<00:01:46.070> larger<00:01:46.759> bars<00:01:47.829> but

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
the SOS package has six larger bars but

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.730 
the SOS package has six larger bars but
it's<00:01:48.979> basically<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.490> same<00:01:49.549> thing<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.960> the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
it's basically the same thing is the the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.730 
it's basically the same thing is the the
day<00:01:52.250> tracks<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:53.509> mean<00:01:53.780> it's<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.409> horse<00:01:54.590> of

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
day tracks so I mean it's a horse of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.380 
day tracks so I mean it's a horse of
fees<00:01:54.860> basically<00:01:55.430> whatever<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:56.090> can<00:01:56.240> get<00:01:56.360> a

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
fees basically whatever you can get a

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.990 
fees basically whatever you can get a
better<00:01:56.509> deal<00:01:56.810> on<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.320> what<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.680> my<00:01:58.159> opinion<00:01:58.759> if

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
better deal on is what I my opinion if

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.910 
better deal on is what I my opinion if
you<00:01:59.119> can<00:01:59.390> or<00:01:59.570> if<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.080> really<00:02:00.259> like<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.680> flavor

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
you can or if you really like the flavor

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.160 
you can or if you really like the flavor
more<00:02:01.820> than<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.600> other<00:02:02.720> but<00:02:02.929> they're<00:02:03.080> very

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
more than the other but they're very

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.529 
more than the other but they're very
close<00:02:03.320> in<00:02:03.770> flavor<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.670> I<00:02:04.700> really<00:02:05.330> wouldn't

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
close in flavor so I really wouldn't

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.469 
close in flavor so I really wouldn't
worry<00:02:05.689> too<00:02:05.810> much<00:02:05.960> about<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.679> and<00:02:07.479> it's

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
worry too much about that and it's

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.449 
worry too much about that and it's
whatever<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.899> can<00:02:09.050> get<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.229> bulk<00:02:09.769> price<00:02:10.069> on<00:02:10.310> if

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
whatever you can get a bulk price on if

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.580 
whatever you can get a bulk price on if
you're<00:02:10.610> planning<00:02:11.000> on<00:02:11.180> stocking<00:02:11.569> up<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:12.319> large

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
you're planning on stocking up a large

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.820
