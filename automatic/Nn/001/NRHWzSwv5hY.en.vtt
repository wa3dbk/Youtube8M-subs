landscape all that you can change that's

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.310 
landscape all that you can change that's
a<00:01:11.400> portrait<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.970> don't<00:01:12.150> flip<00:01:12.750> everything<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
a portrait I don't flip everything so I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.160 
a portrait I don't flip everything so I
do<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> need<00:01:15.600> are<00:01:16.049> these

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
do that but what you need are these

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.380 
do that but what you need are these
dimensions<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.430> they're<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.180> same

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
dimensions and if they're the same

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.429 
dimensions and if they're the same
screens<00:01:19.049> then<00:01:20.119> well<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.229> say

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
screens then well there you go but say

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.090 
screens then well there you go but say
this<00:01:22.650> one<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.780> 1440<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.650> one<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
this one is 1440 and then this one is a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.170 
this one is 1440 and then this one is a
1560<00:01:29.930> that's<00:01:30.930> use<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.280> compensate<00:01:32.729> for

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
1560 that's use have to compensate for

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.630 
1560 that's use have to compensate for
that<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.540> pretty<00:01:33.930> simple<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:35.310> bring<00:01:35.490> up

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that it's pretty simple so just bring up

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
that it's pretty simple so just bring up
calculator<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.990> use<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.380> default<00:01:37.799> one

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
calculator and I use the default one

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.260 
calculator and I use the default one

add this number together so I'm just

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.300 
add this number together so I'm just
going<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.530> leave<00:01:58.680> mine<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.159> because

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
going to leave mine like that because

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.700 
going to leave mine like that because

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
it's how I like it but so then you would

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.060 
it's how I like it but so then you would
just<00:02:01.740> go<00:02:02.040> 1440<00:02:02.909> x<00:02:03.090> 2<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.840> i<00:02:03.869> already<00:02:04.020> know<00:02:04.740> what

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
just go 1440 x 2 but i already know what

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.570 
just go 1440 x 2 but i already know what
that<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:06.450> let<00:02:06.990> me<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.350> go<00:02:08.009> down<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.550> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
that is so let me just go down here and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.660 
that is so let me just go down here and
click<00:02:09.300> new<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.840> photoshop<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:11.250> name<00:02:11.520> it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
click new in photoshop you can name it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.600 
click new in photoshop you can name it
whatever

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
whatever

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.030 
whatever
custom<00:02:12.820> preset<00:02:13.240> make<00:02:13.810> sure<00:02:14.020> you're<00:02:14.230> on<00:02:14.320> pixels

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
custom preset make sure you're on pixels

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.650 
custom preset make sure you're on pixels
so<00:02:15.820> as<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.120> saw<00:02:16.570> my<00:02:17.410> height<00:02:17.710> was<00:02:17.980> 900<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.850> it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
so as you saw my height was 900 and it

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.340 
so as you saw my height was 900 and it
was<00:02:19.870> x<00:02:20.190> 1440<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:22.030> I'm<00:02:22.120> doing<00:02:22.390> two<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.690> them<00:02:22.930> so

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
was x 1440 but I'm doing two of them so

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.760 
was x 1440 but I'm doing two of them so
I<00:02:23.380> increased<00:02:23.980> these<00:02:25.020> nice<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:28.770> don't

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
I increased these nice but I don't

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.450 
I increased these nice but I don't
increase<00:02:30.490> this<00:02:30.730> one<00:02:31.000> because<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:33.250> would<00:02:33.430> be

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
increase this one because that would be

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.970 
increase this one because that would be
making<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:34.060> go<00:02:34.180> up<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.420> down<00:02:34.540> now<00:02:35.230> if<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.740> did

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
making it go up and down now if you did

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.800 
making it go up and down now if you did
have<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.340> going<00:02:36.580> up<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.850> down<00:02:36.940> then<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.690> would

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
have it going up and down then you would

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.890 
have it going up and down then you would
double<00:02:38.440> this<00:02:38.590> one<00:02:38.920> not<00:02:39.100> this<00:02:39.160> one<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
double this one not this one so the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.230 
double this one not this one so the
resolution<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.740> like<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.010> keep<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.310> 500<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.090> can

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
resolution I like to keep it 500 you can

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.090 
resolution I like to keep it 500 you can
do<00:02:43.360> what<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.510> want<00:02:43.630> if<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.530> find<00:02:44.740> you're<00:02:44.890> just

left and this is screen too with the one
on<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.380> right<00:03:23.430> now<00:03:24.430> if<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.420> had<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:26.489> up<00:03:27.489> and

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
on the right now if you had a up and

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.720 
on the right now if you had a up and
down<00:03:27.880> dual<00:03:28.150> screen<00:03:28.450> then<00:03:28.660> use<00:03:28.959> drag<00:03:29.470> this<00:03:30.010> and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
down dual screen then use drag this and

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
then it'll still snap and then it works

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.140 
then it'll still snap and then it works
like<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.160> figure<00:03:36.400> out<00:03:36.459> there<00:03:36.850> now

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
like that so the figure out there now

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.030 
like that so the figure out there now
you<00:03:37.209> have<00:03:37.420> half<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.840> half<00:03:37.989> now<00:03:38.500> what<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.860> want

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
you have half and half now what you want

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.880 
you have half and half now what you want
to<00:03:39.070> do<00:03:39.250> is<00:03:39.489> create<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.720> don't<00:03:40.959> know<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.440> let's

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
to do is create I don't know so let's

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.789 
to do is create I don't know so let's
just<00:03:42.070> say<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:43.420> get<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:44.850> tool<00:03:45.850> and<00:03:46.420> then<00:03:46.769> drag<00:03:47.769> it

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
just say you get a tool and then drag it

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.160 
just say you get a tool and then drag it
across<00:03:47.950> like<00:03:48.340> that<00:03:48.370> now<00:03:49.150> if<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.480> put<00:03:49.720> this<00:03:49.750> as<00:03:50.019> my

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
across like that now if I put this as my

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.680 
across like that now if I put this as my
background<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:51.820> would<00:03:52.330> have<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.989> line<00:03:54.120> like<00:03:55.120> this

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
background I would have a line like this

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.630 
background I would have a line like this
is<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.080> middle<00:03:56.320> of<00:03:56.410> my<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.560> screen<00:03:56.920> so<00:03:57.160> it

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
is the middle of my to screen so it

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.210 
is the middle of my to screen so it
would<00:03:57.820> be<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:57.970> fluid<00:03:58.420> motion<00:03:58.870> if<00:03:59.080> your<00:03:59.890> screens

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
would be a fluid motion if your screens

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.479 
would be a fluid motion if your screens
are<00:04:00.400> side<00:04:00.640> by<00:04:00.670> side<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:02.010> yeah<00:04:03.010> I'm<00:04:03.310> not

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489
