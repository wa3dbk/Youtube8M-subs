00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.550
 last night 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.040
 maka 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.650
 teyton contest takes the first hello 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.990
 my chicken we meet today 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.940
 for a video a little special what he 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.590
 is about celebrating our thousand good subscribers to 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.090
 this time I know there are relou 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.530
 who will go to the homepage of 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.930
 the chain and who will realize 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.220
 in fact we only have 900 so I 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.320
 risk of having comments of the kind 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.850
 no and it's completely stupid I 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.350
 mean it's all but logical that a 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.270
 site is not a thousand subscribers you do not make a 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.640
 special video thousand subscribers what and ben 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.000

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.980
 how 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.600
 in fact it's stupid and I think 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.820
 no one will complain about it tighten 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.380
