and it's turned out really well I'm

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.210 
and it's turned out really well I'm
really<00:04:47.050> thrilled<00:04:47.289> with<00:04:47.500> how<00:04:47.650> this<00:04:47.860> book<00:04:48.070> has

really thrilled with how this book has

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.730 
really thrilled with how this book has
turned<00:04:48.520> out<00:04:48.700> I<00:04:48.940> don't<00:04:49.690> know<00:04:50.050> if<00:04:50.229> I'd<00:04:50.410> order

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.659 
turned out I don't know if I'd order
many<00:04:51.100> more<00:04:52.830> from<00:04:53.830> a<00:04:54.010> dorama

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
many more from a dorama

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.570 
many more from a dorama
simply<00:04:55.210> because<00:04:55.390> of<00:04:55.539> the<00:04:55.750> price<00:04:56.550> they<00:04:57.550> are

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
simply because of the price they are

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.980 
simply because of the price they are
very<00:04:57.970> beautiful<00:04:58.539> though

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
very beautiful though

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.560 
very beautiful though
and<00:05:01.050> this<00:05:02.050> 14<00:05:02.860> page<00:05:03.220> photo<00:05:03.640> book<00:05:03.910> is<00:05:04.120> probably

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
and this 14 page photo book is probably

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.650 
and this 14 page photo book is probably
about<00:05:05.110> as<00:05:05.560> bleak<00:05:05.950> as<00:05:06.960> my<00:05:07.960> way<00:05:08.260> December<00:05:09.220> daily

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
about as bleak as my way December daily

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.810 
about as bleak as my way December daily
2010<00:05:10.660> which<00:05:10.930> had<00:05:11.169> like<00:05:11.440> 30-something<00:05:12.220> pages

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
2010 which had like 30-something pages

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.760 
2010 which had like 30-something pages
so<00:05:13.390> the<00:05:13.479> page<00:05:13.750> is<00:05:13.960> about

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
so the page is about

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.610 
so the page is about
double<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.400> thickness<00:05:16.030> of<00:05:16.539> your<00:05:16.630> standard

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
photo books but you can certainly see

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.970 
photo books but you can certainly see
the<00:05:24.520> difference<00:05:24.940> in<00:05:25.240> their<00:05:25.450> quality<00:05:25.930> of<00:05:26.169> the

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.220 

the<00:05:30.980> prince<00:05:31.310> and<00:05:31.669> their<00:05:31.820> colors<00:05:32.180> there<00:05:35.230> I'm

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.300 
the prince and their colors there I'm
really<00:05:37.010> impressed<00:05:37.720> at<00:05:38.720> how<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.440> font<00:05:39.860> is<00:05:40.070> come

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
really impressed at how the font is come

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.659 
really impressed at how the font is come
out<00:05:40.630> it's<00:05:41.630> not<00:05:41.750> quite<00:05:42.080> as<00:05:42.290> clear<00:05:42.620> as<00:05:42.950> some

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
out it's not quite as clear as some

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.140 
out it's not quite as clear as some
other<00:05:45.100> printing<00:05:46.100> methods<00:05:46.130> but<00:05:46.639> it's<00:05:46.820> still

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
other printing methods but it's still

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.390 
other printing methods but it's still
really<00:05:47.720> good

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.420 

so<00:05:52.400> what<00:05:52.790> do<00:05:52.880> you<00:05:53.030> think<00:05:53.330> about<00:05:53.600> adoramapix
