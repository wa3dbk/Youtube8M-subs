00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
good so first of all I'm running pretty

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.500 
good so first of all I'm running pretty
much<00:00:25.619> full<00:00:26.039> rabbits<00:00:26.460> that's<00:00:26.670> precision

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
much full rabbits that's precision

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.630 
much full rabbits that's precision
toughness<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> Condy<00:00:28.500> damage<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.279> really

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
toughness and Condy damage it's really

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.089 
toughness and Condy damage it's really
good<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.150> need<00:00:30.300> some<00:00:30.599> precision<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.349> have

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
good you need some precision to have

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.860 
good you need some precision to have
higher<00:00:32.309> christian<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.210> proc<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
higher christian so you can proc and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.389 
higher christian so you can proc and
send<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.559> powder<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.070> i'm<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.309> to

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
send you a powder but i'm going to

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.690 
send you a powder but i'm going to
explain<00:00:35.670> more<00:00:35.910> about<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.180> later

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
explain more about that later

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.889 
explain more about that later
well<00:00:38.700> condition<00:00:39.090> damage<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.750> main

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
well condition damage is just the main

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.420 
well condition damage is just the main
damage<00:00:40.079> your<00:00:40.320> scale<00:00:40.530> worth<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.980> toughness

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
damage your scale worth and toughness

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.220 
damage your scale worth and toughness
overall<00:00:41.879> i<00:00:42.149> think<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.840> better<00:00:43.020> than

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
overall i think is just better than

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.529 
overall i think is just better than
fatality<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.040> good<00:00:44.340> mix<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.670> both<00:00:44.879> also<00:00:45.329> works

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
fatality a good mix of both also works

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.209 
fatality a good mix of both also works
so<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.809> could<00:00:45.960> mix<00:00:46.200> your<00:00:46.379> gear<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:46.829> bit

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
so it could mix your gear a little bit

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.639 
so it could mix your gear a little bit
to<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.700> little<00:00:47.789> bit<00:00:47.940> more<00:00:48.149> HP<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.809> think

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
to get it a little bit more HP I think

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.290 
to get it a little bit more HP I think
toughness<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.640> better<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.149> longer

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
toughness is just better and longer

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.240 
toughness is just better and longer
fights<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.050> try<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.320> go<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:52.949> long

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
fights and I try to go for really long

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.799 
fights and I try to go for really long
fight<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.969> world<00:00:54.149> most<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> time

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
fight and what we world most of the time

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
fight and what we world most of the time
anyway<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.070> think<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.850> good<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.270> like

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
anyway so I think this is good I like

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.000 
anyway so I think this is good I like
this<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.660> lot<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.699> I<00:01:00.020> have<00:01:01.020> full<00:01:01.260> exotic<00:01:01.770> gear

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
healing power just like what toughness

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.929 
healing power just like what toughness
skates<00:01:13.380> really<00:01:13.710> well<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.010> longer<00:01:14.280> fights<00:01:14.520> you

have a lot of regeneration in this build
and<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.180> helps<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> lot<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> stay<00:01:18.960> alive

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
peeling gem in this as well but yeah I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.190 
peeling gem in this as well but yeah I
think<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.390> good<00:01:42.570> mix<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.049> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
think this is a really good mix this is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.350 
think this is a really good mix this is
pretty<00:01:43.470> much<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.829> best<00:01:44.040> mix<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.430> wolfie<00:01:45.210> was

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
pretty much the best mix of wolfie was

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.590 
pretty much the best mix of wolfie was
that<00:01:45.600> said<00:01:45.810> I've<00:01:45.930> found<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.439> far<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:47.329> as<00:01:48.329> for

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
that said I've found so far and as for

use<00:03:36.000> sigil<00:03:36.359> of<00:03:36.419> corruption<00:03:36.959> which<00:03:37.349> might<00:03:37.650> also

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
use sigil of corruption which might also

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.189 
use sigil of corruption which might also
not<00:03:38.129> be<00:03:38.189> the<00:03:38.430> best<00:03:38.639> choice<00:03:38.879> because<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.629> don't

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
not be the best choice because I don't

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.249 
not be the best choice because I don't
get<00:03:40.409> to<00:03:40.530> stack<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.919> that<00:03:41.099> often<00:03:41.519> anymore<00:03:41.669> but

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:42.259 
get to stack it that often anymore but

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.649 
get to stack it that often anymore but
well<00:03:43.259> you<00:03:43.829> could<00:03:43.979> get<00:03:44.129> that<00:03:44.819> one<00:03:45.060> satchel

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
well you could get that one satchel

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.869 
well you could get that one satchel
which<00:03:45.780> gets<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.109> 6%<00:03:46.680> extra<00:03:46.979> condition<00:03:47.430> damage<00:03:47.609> I

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
which gets a 6% extra condition damage I

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.689 
which gets a 6% extra condition damage I
think<00:03:47.909> I'm<00:03:48.269> not<00:03:48.419> sure<00:03:48.479> but<00:03:49.409> yeah<00:03:50.069> that<00:03:50.519> also

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
think I'm not sure but yeah that also

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:58.759 
think I'm not sure but yeah that also
works<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:52.879> for<00:03:53.879> traits<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.359> run<00:03:55.400> 3000<00:03:56.400> 30<00:03:57.769> 1013

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
works and for traits I run 3000 30 1013

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.920 
works and for traits I run 3000 30 1013
explosives<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.549> must-have<00:03:59.970> definitely<00:04:00.900> I

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
explosives is a must-have definitely I

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.780 
explosives is a must-have definitely I
mean<00:04:01.109> you<00:04:01.379> get<00:04:01.500> larger<00:04:02.159> pump<00:04:02.370> radius

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
mean you get larger pump radius

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.699 
mean you get larger pump radius
it's<00:04:02.909> absolutely<00:04:03.479> needed<00:04:03.959> for<00:04:04.139> bombs<00:04:04.349> don't

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
it's absolutely needed for bombs don't

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.249 
it's absolutely needed for bombs don't
ever<00:04:04.949> run<00:04:05.189> it<00:04:05.340> without<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:06.259> incendiary

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:07.259 
ever run it without that incendiary

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.920

powder<00:04:07.909> absolutely<00:04:08.909> amazing<00:04:09.419> it's<00:04:09.569> needed

powder absolutely amazing it's needed
for<00:04:10.079> every<00:04:10.169> condition<00:04:10.590> build<00:04:10.889> in<00:04:11.009> my<00:04:11.159> opinion

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
for every condition build in my opinion

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.469 
for every condition build in my opinion
it's<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.659> keeps<00:04:12.900> off<00:04:13.049> so<00:04:13.259> much<00:04:13.379> damage<00:04:13.650> it

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
it's it keeps off so much damage it

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:19.670 
it's it keeps off so much damage it
compensates<00:04:15.479> a<00:04:15.780> little<00:04:16.109> bit<00:04:16.320> of<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.979> lack<00:04:17.880> of

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
compensates a little bit of the lack of

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.620 
compensates a little bit of the lack of
well<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.639> she<00:04:20.759> has<00:04:20.850> have<00:04:21.000> trouble<00:04:21.419> hitting

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
enemies consistently like you and she

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.730 
enemies consistently like you and she
damage<00:04:24.449> can<00:04:24.630> be<00:04:24.660> avoided<00:04:25.110> relatively<00:04:25.590> easily

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
damage can be avoided relatively easily

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.439 
damage can be avoided relatively easily
because<00:04:26.220> you<00:04:26.340> can't<00:04:26.520> kite<00:04:26.759> out<00:04:26.790> of<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.180> bombs

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
because you can't kite out of the bombs

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.560 
because you can't kite out of the bombs

birth<00:05:26.060> but<00:05:27.060> you<00:05:27.300> could<00:05:27.449> also<00:05:27.599> try<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:27.930> with<00:05:28.199> ten

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
birth but you could also try it with ten

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.010 
birth but you could also try it with ten
firearms<00:05:29.010> that's<00:05:29.220> I<00:05:29.610> mean<00:05:30.030> I<00:05:30.210> I<00:05:30.240> had<00:05:30.750> most

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
firearms that's I mean I I had most

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.200 
firearms that's I mean I I had most
success<00:05:31.110> with<00:05:31.650> this<00:05:31.830> so<00:05:32.070> far<00:05:32.099> but<00:05:32.970> ten

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
success with this so far but ten

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.760 
success with this so far but ten
firearms<00:05:33.690> gives<00:05:33.900> you<00:05:33.990> a<00:05:34.050> lot<00:05:34.199> more<00:05:34.349> damage<00:05:34.650> as

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
firearms gives you a lot more damage as

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.730 
firearms gives you a lot more damage as
well<00:05:34.889> because<00:05:35.190> it<00:05:35.340> has<00:05:35.370> this<00:05:36.440> passive<00:05:37.440> trait

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
well because it has this passive trait

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.129 
well because it has this passive trait
which<00:05:38.250> gives<00:05:38.520> you<00:05:38.729> extra<00:05:39.240> bleeding<00:05:39.659> damage<00:05:39.960> on

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
which gives you extra bleeding damage on

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.950 
which gives you extra bleeding damage on
crits<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:40.729> well<00:05:41.729> the<00:05:41.909> pistol<00:05:42.330> coolant<00:05:42.810> rate

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
crits and well the pistol coolant rate

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.430 
crits and well the pistol coolant rate
is<00:05:43.080> just<00:05:43.380> really<00:05:44.099> strong<00:05:44.550> and<00:05:44.970> yeah<00:05:45.870> obviously

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
is just really strong and yeah obviously

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.260 
is just really strong and yeah obviously
I<00:05:46.740> also<00:05:47.099> have<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:47.340> bigger<00:05:47.520> trade<00:05:47.880> and<00:05:48.120> ten

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
points and tools for the swiftness to

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.310 
points and tools for the swiftness to
just<00:05:50.310> keep<00:05:50.699> up<00:05:50.849> the<00:05:50.880> mobility<00:05:51.690> and<00:05:51.900> access

availability<00:05:53.130> was<00:05:53.520> bigger<00:05:53.789> so<00:05:54.240> every<00:05:54.449> time

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
availability was bigger so every time

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.909 
availability was bigger so every time
when<00:05:54.690> I<00:05:54.750> swap<00:05:54.960> through<00:05:55.139> a<00:05:55.169> kid<00:05:55.409> I<00:05:55.650> get

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
when I swap through a kid I get

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.770 
when I swap through a kid I get
swiftness<00:05:56.340> and<00:05:56.490> vigor<00:05:56.789> and<00:05:57.210> I<00:05:57.389> can<00:05:57.570> dodge<00:05:57.750> a

swiftness and vigor and I can dodge a

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.450 
swiftness and vigor and I can dodge a
lot<00:05:58.110> with<00:05:58.320> that<00:05:58.349> and<00:05:58.740> just<00:05:58.770> move<00:05:59.130> a<00:05:59.280> lot

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
lot with that and just move a lot

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.850 
lot with that and just move a lot
quicker<00:05:59.789> like<00:06:00.300> that<00:06:00.979> and<00:06:03.229> yeah<00:06:04.229> that's<00:06:04.560> pretty

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
quicker like that and yeah that's pretty

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.370 
quicker like that and yeah that's pretty
much<00:06:05.010> about<00:06:05.340> it<00:06:05.610> and<00:06:06.180> running<00:06:06.479> to<00:06:06.840> kid<00:06:07.050> bombs

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
much about it and running to kid bombs

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.450 
much about it and running to kid bombs
and<00:06:07.620> rocket<00:06:07.889> boots<00:06:08.070> but<00:06:08.940> you<00:06:09.120> could<00:06:09.270> also<00:06:09.510> run

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
and rocket boots but you could also run

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.600 
and rocket boots but you could also run

flamethrower

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.719

instead of toolkit I run two kids
usually<00:06:14.940> though<00:06:15.539> because<00:06:15.810> it<00:06:16.169> gives<00:06:16.380> you<00:06:16.650> that

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
usually though because it gives you that

just get a better idea of it but

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.090 
just get a better idea of it but
definitely<00:06:50.110> both<00:06:50.320> kids<00:06:50.590> work<00:06:50.770> pretty<00:06:50.980> well

kids and flamethrower together instead

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.660 
kids and flamethrower together instead

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
of rocket boots but I think rocket boots
