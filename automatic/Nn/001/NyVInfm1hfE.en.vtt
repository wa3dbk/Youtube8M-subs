00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.890
 a lot here the president I went 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.010
 an error gold analysts surgery 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.920
 thank you, Mr. President 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.640
 what impact for you that having the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.460
 crisis have broken through to neighboring countries 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.500
 Chad 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.250
 the subscript is your country has an impact 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.030
 considerable because when you 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.460
 see the point of view of geography 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.220
 of the Central African Republic a little 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:59.100
 in the center of these countries and peoples 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:05.300
 are the same we belong to the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:10.910
 same economic and monetary zones 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:15.890
 so a disaster here at rca will have 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:23.429
 necessarily a considerable impact 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:29.190
 on cameroon chad the republic 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:31.490
 democratic congo the congo and even 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.490
 beyond 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.450
 inner denner increases that all to 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.479
 obvious fact there are various solutions 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.009
 which are being proposed right now for the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:50.990
 crisis here in rcr between them that would be 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:53.659
 more more involvement more more than 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.970
 presence of the UN here that they can 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.300
 can be controlled 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.580
 the military here the justice even the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.220
 police this is one of the solutions that is 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.620
 proposed is what you think the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.899
 presence of water and is here and 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.030
 urgently important or do you 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.740
 think the presence of the union 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.860
 African rather is the best 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.860
 solution 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:24.850
 good I think of all the 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:29.360
 institutions must complement each other 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:33.070
 we first know that when the crisis 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:38.420
 broke out here and even until today 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.190
 and these are the countries of the region the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.970
 Central African Economic Community 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:50.810
 these are the countries that went to 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:54.770
 before the crisis that we mastered in 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:00.950
 part from the first days and have 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:03.019
 allowed free-will agreements and even 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.090
 after when the essential city of 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:11.390
 keep these are the countries of the region that 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.980
 have strengthened the device here 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:20.459
 opponents and bring 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:24.720
 multiple supports even before 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:28.209
 does intervene African line is 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.739
 today the united nations through 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.440
 the resolution 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:38.400
 m 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:43.290
 21 21 today when bp of 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:48.650
 the money decides to reinforce and the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.650
 device here and they get 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:59.630
 the support of the African Union that wants 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:03.060
 turn micopax into mid caps and with 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:07.680
 the support of the united nations through the 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:11.040
 resolution 21 21 the poison that until then 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:16.230
 is all those institutions that 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.350
 Complete but above and beyond to 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.640
 go to the final phase 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.060
 we will definitely need a 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:32.550
 greater involvement of nations 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:40.620
 united because it will have to go towards 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:44.240
 the ddr towards the integration of ex 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:48.470
 fighters to the east towards the organization 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.810
 queens elections together 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.060
 of activities of normal operation of 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.980
 the state 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:01.320
 we think that at this stage we will have 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.690
 need for greater involvement of 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.350
 united nations but at first you see 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:10.710
 although it all started with the region 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.410
 and then the African Union is just a 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.340
 united exchange and everyone has to g 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:21.630
 are saas fashion to get the 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:24.830
 stability safety and walking 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.830
 normal country
