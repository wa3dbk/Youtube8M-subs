00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.620
 in the next post it goes back to 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.839
 trial 24 at 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.300
 the internet platform of porsche inter 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.519
 austria during this test drive 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.849
 we picked a vw amarok 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.430
 kenya and we test this 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.840
 vehicle and see us also if the 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.410
 car sellers on allrad informed 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.449
 knowledge 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.390
 he was today by porsche inter auto 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.090
 an amarok in the canyon version 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.099
 what is the very first thing you get 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.480
 do if you go to the terrain 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.619
 most important is once an instructor 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.450
 to take along because they say it is 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.680
 rough terrain and there are so many 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.649
 types waiting for you 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.610
 in the car they are traveling with 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.530
 you do not need the medium 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.500
 differential locks the first 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.120
 Medium differential equipped all 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.680
 other models thereby returns then times 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.360
 the middle differential sensed that one 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.969
 also can go to the impassable terrain 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.079
 because the terrain will be totally incompetent 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.520
 what can you do 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.350
 in the car they are traveling with 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.109
 there is no reduction gear because 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.270
 this car of the automatic amarok and there 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.219
 the first is a real terrain course 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.899
 this is not the case with the others 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.180
 before that was at the automatics they have 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.460
 there are also situations where one 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.170
 Half of the wheels on dry ground 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.770
 stand and the other half of the wheels 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.920
 are on mud or in impassable 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.080
 terrain 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.150
 what can you do with this car then 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.890
 do that is of course the most beautiful 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.750
 Driving experience for the terrain and here 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.790
 the wheat is also turning over 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.710
 because here we know that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.810
 Volkswagen also makes a good picture and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.850
 the pleasant at the amarok we can 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 here the differential lock to 100 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.400
 percent and propulsion hunter here 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.170
 guarantee 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.670
 it is during a test ride in the railing 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.670
 also important once steeply downhill 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.049
 ask what are you doing with the amarok? 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.729
 Amarok is the pleasant one too 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.220
 such dangerous situations at the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.320
 sacrifice the amarok brakes ever after 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.549
 underground individual that is the one 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.060
 driver does not need anything more 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.700
 To take care of 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.920
 the car brakes itself so the car 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.840
 it does not matter where you are at 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.250
 Underground does that the vehicle 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.619
 automatically or do you have one there 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.659
 press switch the car is with 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.600
 equipped with an additional switch 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.740
 activating the downhill assistant 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.930
 if a short pressure 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.429
 I give the car the command that he 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.959
 now please work freely and can 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.420
 you do not have to worry about anything anymore 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.280
 the climbing ability of the ethnic but 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.170
 also practical with this vehicle 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.930
 the 100 percent that's an angle of 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.040
 45 degrees how to drive such a steep slope 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.360
 right 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.069
 the most important thing about this 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.610
 Challenge is the direct way to 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.470
 search 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.690
 although this car here with one 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.580
 Roll bar would be equipped would be it 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.390
 not advisable left or right of the way 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.550
 come off 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.709
 Otherwise the danger of one by one 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.160
 crash or accident very big 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.959
 would 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.780
 Does that mean that you are rather the steep way 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.580
 uphill and downhill takes on all cases 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.370
 So obliquely avoid trips 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.200
 he challenges the vehicle even more 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.069
 and with a bit more gas upwards 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.110
 to fight 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.560
 And how do you get a test drive? 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.940
 for example with this amarok canyon 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.620
 a test drive in the terrain so here 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.780
 with the amarok is not commonplace though 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.660
 here is a remedy on the internet 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.890
 on www test 24 points you can 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.799
 through europe quite simple mouse clicks 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.690
 reserve your wagon for one 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.670
 test drive at the request dealer then goes 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.380
 the registration form out and within 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.760
 In no time we can do one here 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.410
 trial run for you 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.090
 when driving on the road, there is one 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.700
 magic formula you know and apply 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.200
 also for the vw amarok which applies to all 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.380
 cars also for volkswagen 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.780
 as slowly as possible and as fast as 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.489
 you are still void in one 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.709
 drive diagonally and the vehicle begins 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.930
 unstable what do you recommend 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.209
 then take a deep breath 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.890
 keep your nerves and just in the side 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.840
 where the vehicle thinks you click away 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.590
 easy to turn and back to 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.880
 to drive down 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.980
 now we are looking at the 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.870
 test drive 24 years after you us 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.120
 have benefited from terrain tips whether 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.870
 the vehicle what a real utility vehicle 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.420
 can use 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.940
 what advantage does the vehicle have at that time 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.040
 had crises great advantage that he 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.139
 At the moment it is very beautiful too 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.970
 although it is and has a utility vehicle 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.459
 on the loading space for one 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.230
 europalette we now have our pro 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.569
 drive first information on the 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.359
 internet platform test drive 24 at 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.639
 has won at Amarok 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.590
 terrain test and we are very special 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:14.420
 proud that the vw sales over the 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.420
 Driving terrain is so well informed
