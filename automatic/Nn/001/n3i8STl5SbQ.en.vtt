00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.049
 welcome to another episode of this 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.400
 boring series of which nobody comments 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.170
 this time I will analyze two episodes 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.740
 and next week to analyze three 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.240
 episodes 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.710
 to be up to date when the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.210
 episode 100 of the series is released 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.400
 going back to the main theme of this 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.909
 video I will analyze the episodes castle am 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.650
 castle and blue man bloom and starting with 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.179
 castle i was castor of the episode starts to 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.919
 control and float 6 cleaning everyone 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.329
 the animals and at the same time makes it clear that 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.899
 which ones do not want to return to their toy 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.899
 created by hasbro 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.920
 river talk case and the community does not the 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.150
 can you blame I do not know I personally 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.100
 I have nothing against the new 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.020
 castle I understand perfectly because 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.030
 the community does not like it looks outside the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.070
 place is not as charismatic as the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.780
 bookstore and in part that's the goal 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.190
 of this episode convince people of 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.780
 that the castle is not as bad as 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.550
 it seems and that you can win cellular in the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.040
 series being which one represents the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.269
 community and talking about her her friends 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.620
 when he realizes that she is not 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.970
 taste with the castle and that is giving 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.920
 evasive not to be in the same 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.570
 They decide to make Spike take it to 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.460
 relax a whole day while they 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.870
 work on remodeling the castle to 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.540
 make her feel more comfortable 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.030
 By the way, you support me, you offer me that 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.500
 sacrilege applejack you're a heretic by 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.510
 that you were treated badly in the first did 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.299
 a season you should see 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.560
 do not 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.900
 right now I do not want furious hordes 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.940
 right now no no no 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.170
 so spikes takes current to the spa and 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.080
 the others begin to remodel the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.940
 castle with a song obviously but 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.880
 maybe everything is interracial galván 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.479
 of decorations does not work very well 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.340
 Meanwhile it is interesting hairstyle 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.619
 meanwhile it is for try to get 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.280
 more time asking for a massage let's say 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.060
 plus 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.060
 is strong 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.710
 it has been cameo while in the castle of 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.660
 the animals cause problems and all the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.130
 decoration goes to hell so the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.780
 five and give another plan use what 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.580
 is left of the library to turn it into 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.930
 a candelabra which in some way 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.480
 contains the memories of episodes 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.860
 previous magic I guess 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.750
 maybe fill the castle with books 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.940
 It would have sufficed but it is a nice 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.350
 detail which current he likes 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.970
 quite and in the end they all embrace 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.690
 building the episode the most 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.430
 tours and what you can think of but 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.990
 this episode was simple quiet with 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.760
 an interesting song and tender ending 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.380
 which I'm not sure if it will be 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.690
 enough for the community to stop 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.910
 complain about the castle myself personally 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.320
 I have no problem with him but if he looks 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.510
 something out of place in the middle of everything 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.100
 point by level jumping there going on 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.530
 now the next episode called brum 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.180
 and blue or as it is pronounced is the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.010
 first episode of the last to 36 in 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.400
 this season but more than anything 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.960
 support for 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.640
 the episode starts with the latest 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.930
 crossed focusing that bashir has 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.600
 got up and marked which is 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.820
 scissors I come many things to the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.170
 mind and this event worried about 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.570
 Bloomberg gets you one last that 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.980
 have nothing to do with apples nothing 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.690
 more because he has not seen the heresy that 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.700
 he committed to rely on the previous episode 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:06.569
 the next day album wakes up there 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.340
 or magas expect that like when where 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.150
 the site to the town got me its 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.099
 last good that explains an old man 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.639
 the last one is about pest control in 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.639
 this case 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.939
 that but after being shot you want 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.219
 to be without sea tutti and a 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.599
 strange shadow fulfills his wish but for 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.380
 his great luck turns out that a great 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.810
 horde of 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.810
 that attacks vile pony and destroys his house 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.970
 but everything was a dream and let's say that 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.190
 this is where it becomes more predictable 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.720
 the story the population wakes up but this 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.340
 once you have your last holdings of 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.780
 potions because I do not know do not ask me 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.460
 poble one decide to show it off with your 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.080
 friends in the tree house but now 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.550
 that she has her tweet and marc level and 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.260
 It's fucking lülle I disagreed it can not be 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.460
 part of the group making the run from 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.460
 your own house of the sea 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.910
 that does not make much sense 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.910
 as put times 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.550
 so again he asks for the shadow 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.290
 mysterious that you remove your kit and mark 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.940
 after that it turns out that this is what 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.380
 did the level already have subscribed marks 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.900
 which do not want to show them 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.120
 because it's a race or something like that 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.590
 no longer a village a reawakens to 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.300
 this point the intention of the episode is 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.800
 quite clear show the possible 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.280
 situations and apart ruin thousands of 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.660
 basic fix fans because it does not have that as 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.490
 cute and marc and is expelled from the house 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.740
 for not having a last one related to 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.720
 apples and wake up again 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.350
 finally bores a confronta the shadow 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.450
 and magas an overrated pony appears 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.730
 you can listen to the moon fanboys 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.290
 sending me in the shit and a calm 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.970
 Polum shows that her friends also 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.530
 are having mental problems about 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.540
 have your tutti marks plus because 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.190
 appears octavia right-handed lex so the 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.960
 estimated in three venues learn that with or 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.030
 without youtube marc will not change who 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.860
 they are and how they can be friends and also 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.970
 that there have been many pancakes these 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.170
 last episodes 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.400
 this episode plays with the 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.930
 possibilities and it shows us a 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.580
 common concern among the three there 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.140
 there's which moon had already tried 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.730
 in other seasons and in a certain way 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.410
 prepares us for when really 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.580
 last traders get substitute and 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.900
 mars and do not think so much drama or young and 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.280
 so build this boring analysis 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.110
 comment what you think about these 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.450
 episodes and how they developed their themes 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.590
 each one I have to give you more of what 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.510
 speak if nothing else they will ask 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.870
 regards 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.870
 see you next 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.700
 i 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.810
 ah 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.200
 and I say 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.580
 as a singer 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.660
 so the last three series learn that 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.660
 with 5-5
