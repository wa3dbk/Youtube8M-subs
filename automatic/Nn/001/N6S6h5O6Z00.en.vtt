00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:09.360
 and the tree for a few days in my writings 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.630
 from youtube to come to the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.099
 update 9.05 this will be a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.750
 super brief update where 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.130
 we'll talk about the community of Martians 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.560
 and as always some other 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.300
 Latest information about the jets 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.289
 and even I've done to us 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.550
 after then come back good I'm going to 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.949
 many of you know and are taking 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.380
 decisions on facebook today we have launched 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.110
 a document in which we have the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.059
 rules rules and conditions in the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.120
 community the document what is it about 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.129
 essentially it's a document where 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.510
 we explain how we should do things 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.570
 in the community the reason for these 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.489
 moments is to be more efficiently 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.230
 as I told you this document what 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.030
 speaks is in ways of how we should 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.430
 do things like for example if 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.500
 we want to ask a question on the wall 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.539
 facebook on any of our 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.579
 videos the most advisable thing is that 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.590
 look for the video in which we have the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.809
 doubt today that we are having the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.040
 problem and we paste it on the wall and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.200
 let say 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.760
 or not to be specific also in the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.250
 phone that we have my phone the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.740
 iphone 3gs and be as short as possible 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.780
 because we want to be efficient while 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.270
 says a question remember that a 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.580
 difference of being efficient and effective 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.070
 and what we want to be efficient 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.720
 so we need to be like that too 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.490
 when we ask a question and when 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.530
 we look for information also in the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.150
 text we talk about the way to be 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 part of the community if they want to be 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.800
 friends of us on facebook that is 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.020
 where is the community and are the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.430
 Martians of the nucleus there we tell you that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.619
 should do remember they should 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.850
 subscribe I'll give you a link and in 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.880
 the description of this video of 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.800
 subscribe and send me a message on 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.119
 facebook telling me your username 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.130
 in Youtube 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.780
 the document needs to be approved by 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.150
 all of us then what I did 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.280
 was that I did a Facebook survey of 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.660
 approve or not approve the document for 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.369
 that all read so they 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.080
 I recommend that they go and vote and I am going to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.479
 leave the links here below if you already 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.190
 is a member you can vote or say 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.400
 any change and if you did not like something 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.470
 of the new policies you can 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.050
 and we will see how we change it 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.330
 we have until June 30 to do 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.730
 the voting and the first of July if 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.830
 the document is approved is when 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.020
 will come into force again 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.700
 I urge you to go and read the document 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.500
 I'm going to leave them down here too and 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.140
 remember that in conclusion this 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.090
 it's just to help them all 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.000
 you in a more efficient and 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.320
 I always want to remind you that that's what 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.300
 only I have for marciano phone 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.400
 I'm also preparing a few 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.510
 videos for example you know that 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.709
 came out ios 6.0 I'm preparing a 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.050
 comparison of the year of 6.0 and the ios 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.270
 5.1.1 that you know that 6.0 does not 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.850
 is finished but at least we can 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.070
 see what's coming and many of the 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.209
 changes I show you in this video it 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.800
 I'll leave it in the description of this 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.630
 same video once the drum is 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.130
 finished now let's talk about the 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.900
 yer 'breaks' I do not have much information 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.440
 to tell you we know we have the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.959
 jailbreak for 5.1.1 ont été in the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.880
 iphone 4 on iphone 3gs on the iphone 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.820
 4s on the iPad 2 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.290
 and 3 and in the factor for generation I 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.000
 I have the videos I'm going to leave here 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.980
 down also if they need help some 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.150
 of those videos you know that already 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.580
 came out 6.0 6.0 and they did a jailbreak 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.170
 for that version I showed them how I 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.000
 I did not show them how I did it 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.640
 problems 3 that I had the jerry 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.320
 available I did as a type of survey 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.570
 in the same video and I was asking 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.180
 if you come to know the way that I 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.010
 I did it is your break and not many people 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.300
 seen that many people want but 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.690
 there is also a group that does not want 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.550
 then it's not like the percent that I 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.870
 I was waiting to make the video 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.820
 I'm going to leave the video here below the 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.560
 demonstration and if you want to 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.930
 true that I do the video of how 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.970
 I did follow me commenting right there in 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.100
 that video and asking me what he depends 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.080
 the people who ask me against the 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.390
 people who tell me not to do it is that 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.010
 I'm going to make that video that already after 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.600
 to have talked about the ions let's do 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.120
 during the Anglos that here if we have 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.310
 a few new information we're going 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.710
 to talk first about the iphone 3gs that 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.310
 you know this week that we passed 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.420
 with him he launched a method of how to get down to 6 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.850
 five points go 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.250
 this is for people who have the 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.490
 unlocking on the iphone 3gs in the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.610
 baseband 6.15 the development a form of 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.860
 how to go down to 5.13 so as not to lose 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.690
 gps signal that many people have 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.510
 problem with that then the idea is 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.670
 go down to 5.13 and do the unlocking by 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.770
 3 not many users are you 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.020
 running that method I made a video 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.230
 of the first method then I made another 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.470
 another video was not another method but 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.210
 it was a way to go down to 4.1 to be able 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.980
 see if that works for them, not many people 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.830
 is giving me good answers about 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.990
 that other method this morning I think it was 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.540
 like around 6 in the morning he 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.240
 He said he already found the reason why 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.880
 which in many iphone 3gs is not 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.860
 working he said that on Thursday, 28 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.810
 June we will have a new method and 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.330
 is working on that and on Thursday we are going 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.040
 to have the results stay 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.870
 signed as soon users will 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.810
 I will say how to do it aside 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.460
 iphone4 everyone knows right now 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.290
 how can we do when you want 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.060
 calling the tooth and it does not matter the 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.160
 baseband that you have that video 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.530
 is super good and many people are 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.270
 working in addition I'm preparing a 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.280
 part 2 so they see why a lot of people 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.510
 says that since if it's not working and 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.430
 they keep asking me follow me 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.920
 asking then I decided to do in 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.170
 a part 2 calling me again 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.720
 calling Haiti and showing that 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.670
 still the method works the video 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.320
 comes soon but the video of how 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.090
 I did in the first time will be here 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.650
 below to see it and finally 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.010
 talking about the two locks too 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.840
 we have the iphone 4s in cdm which is a 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.030
 different method many people follow me 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.590
 asking, I'll leave the video 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.630
 here of going to do a lot of people not what 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.730
 find me keeps asking is for 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.560
 Verizon cell phones and sprint for 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.020
 unlock it to be able to use continuous 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.600
 with any other company that uses the 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.560
 technology 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.300
 the video will give you more details of everything 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.490
 because for this video I just wanted 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.500
 inform them of the document they are going and what 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.690
 read and vote on whether they agree or not 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.400
 think like it's something to improve the 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.020
 same community that is doing very 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.570
 well on facebook helping many 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.970
 users and we have many plans for the 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.730
 community so read the document 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.830
 accept it and how can we start 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.240
 work that way this has been all 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.759
 for today Martian fonsi in the section 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.039
 and if we think of compelling to attend 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:43.419
 united or bayern with mirrors saying 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.419
 States and since approval
