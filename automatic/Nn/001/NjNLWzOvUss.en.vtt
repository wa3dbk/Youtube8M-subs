00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
but first let me explain how I got to

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.089 
but first let me explain how I got to
this<00:00:11.550> point<00:00:11.790> for<00:00:11.940> those<00:00:12.150> who<00:00:12.389> don't<00:00:12.660> know

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
this point for those who don't know

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.410 
this point for those who don't know
every<00:00:14.099> day<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.429> hard<00:00:14.670> mode<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.240> break

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
every day in the hard mode and you break

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.390 
every day in the hard mode and you break
the<00:00:15.630> altars<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:15.990> get<00:00:16.230> some<00:00:16.440> new<00:00:16.470> or<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:17.279> have

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the altars to get some new or you have

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.640 
the altars to get some new or you have
to<00:00:17.520> go<00:00:17.609> out<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.789> mind<00:00:18.150> them<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.539> went<00:00:19.230> straight

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
to go out and mind them I went straight

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.790 
to go out and mind them I went straight
for<00:00:19.890> top-tier<00:00:20.460> without<00:00:20.820> even<00:00:21.060> stopping<00:00:21.390> to

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
for top-tier without even stopping to

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.950 
for top-tier without even stopping to
make<00:00:22.800> anything<00:00:23.010> too<00:00:23.279> complex<00:00:23.730> went<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.840> got

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
make anything too complex went and got

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.620 
make anything too complex went and got
cobalt<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.220> my<00:00:26.430> first<00:00:26.699> task<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
cobalt so my first task was to get a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.320 
cobalt so my first task was to get a
molten<00:00:27.930> pic<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.320> get<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> cobalt<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.330> from

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
molten pic to get the cobalt and from

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.229 
molten pic to get the cobalt and from
there<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:31.019> made<00:00:31.230> our<00:00:31.439> cobalt<00:00:31.949> drill<00:00:32.309> then

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
there we made our cobalt drill then

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.440 
there we made our cobalt drill then
since<00:00:34.170> my<00:00:34.380> world<00:00:34.649> spawned<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.579> rich<00:00:35.910> seal<00:00:36.180> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
since my world spawned a rich seal I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.319 
since my world spawned a rich seal I
think<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.780> picaud<00:00:37.140> or<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> rich<00:00:37.829> IAM<00:00:38.100> i<00:00:38.340> went

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
think it's picaud or a rich IAM i went

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.530 
think it's picaud or a rich IAM i went
and<00:00:39.450> got<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.140> made<00:00:40.649> an<00:00:40.860> original<00:00:41.540> anvil

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and got that and made an original anvil

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.990 
and got that and made an original anvil
and<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.079> course<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> original<00:00:43.620> drill<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
and of course in the original drill the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.869 
and of course in the original drill the
thing<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.989> takes<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.860> place<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.160> mithril

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
thing is it takes the place of mithril

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.549 
thing is it takes the place of mithril
you<00:00:48.030> either<00:00:48.149> gonna<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> other<00:00:49.020> so

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
you either gonna get one or the other so

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.979 
you either gonna get one or the other so
of<00:00:49.829> course<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.309> got<00:00:50.489> their<00:00:50.940> original<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.780> think

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
of course I got their original I think

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.290 
of course I got their original I think
I'm<00:00:52.110> saying<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.559> right<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.489> apologies<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
all but I went and got the drill for

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.630 
all but I went and got the drill for
that<00:00:56.610> then<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.030> course<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.480> went<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.020> got<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
that then I of course I went and got the

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.720 
that then I of course I went and got the
adamantine<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.820> Adam<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.690> tight<00:01:01.730> look

adamantine and Adam and tight look

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.750 
adamantine and Adam and tight look
that's<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.390> mouthful<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.559> got<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.280> from

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
there we just went got all the armor

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.140 
there we just went got all the armor
that's<00:01:07.590> basically<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> armor<00:01:08.760> i'm<00:01:08.850> using

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
that's basically the armor i'm using

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.649 
that's basically the armor i'm using
right<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.689> adamantite<00:01:10.260> which<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.659> not

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
right now is the adamantite which is not

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.649 
right now is the adamantite which is not
n<00:01:12.900> gain<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.799> close<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.729> makes<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
n gain but it's close to it it makes a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.899 
n gain but it's close to it it makes a
big<00:01:15.869> difference<00:01:15.930> for<00:01:16.710> fighting<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.490> hardware

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
big difference for fighting the hardware

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.969 
big difference for fighting the hardware
bosses<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.689> pretty<00:01:19.020> much<00:01:19.110> need<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.710> thing

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
bosses you pretty much need this thing

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.399 
bosses you pretty much need this thing
of<00:01:20.520> course<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.509> battle<00:01:21.780> itself<00:01:22.140> right

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
of course for this battle itself right

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.789 
of course for this battle itself right
here<00:01:22.710> I'm<00:01:22.890> doing<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> very<00:01:24.360> good<00:01:24.540> job<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.200> was

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
here I'm doing not a very good job I was

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.039 
here I'm doing not a very good job I was
trying<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.100> different<00:01:26.250> tactic<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:28.020> course

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
trying a different tactic and of course

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.710 
trying a different tactic and of course
it<00:01:28.680> leads<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.189> failure<00:01:29.460> as<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.479> see<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it leads to failure as you can see it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.179 
it leads to failure as you can see it
wasn't<00:01:30.960> even<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.170> good<00:01:31.320> start<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.680> begin<00:01:31.799> with

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
wasn't even a good start to begin with

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.120 
wasn't even a good start to begin with
the<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.360> thing<00:01:33.540> about<00:01:33.600> 1.2<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.770> find

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the one thing about 1.2 that I find

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.770 
the one thing about 1.2 that I find
really<00:01:35.189> interesting<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.119> these<00:01:36.479> bosses

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
really interesting is that these bosses

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.620 
really interesting is that these bosses
can<00:01:37.079> spawn<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.530> their<00:01:37.680> own<00:01:38.000> now<00:01:39.000> granted<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.509> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
can spawn on their own now granted as I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.580 
can spawn on their own now granted as I
was<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:39.930> through<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.259> getting<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> lot<00:01:40.560> of

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
was going through and getting a lot of

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.639 
was going through and getting a lot of
these<00:01:40.710> ores<00:01:41.299> they're<00:01:42.299> summoning<00:01:43.079> items<00:01:43.470> were

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
these ores they're summoning items were

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.010 
these ores they're summoning items were
dropping<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.460> at<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.119> same<00:01:45.329> time<00:01:45.540> now<00:01:45.840> with

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
dropping but at the same time now with

I have an accessory that allows me to
take<00:02:35.819> damage<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.510> stay<00:02:37.050> invincible<00:02:37.620> for<00:02:37.830> a

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
take damage and stay invincible for a

take damage and stay invincible for a
longer<00:02:38.069> period<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.459> time<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:39.390> while<00:02:39.690> taking

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
longer period of time so while taking

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.979 
longer period of time so while taking
damage<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> bad<00:02:41.069> thing<00:02:41.599> being<00:02:42.599> invisible

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
damage is a bad thing being invisible

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.100 
damage is a bad thing being invisible
while<00:02:43.500> longer<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.250> really<00:02:45.090> good<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.690> cuts<00:02:45.930> back

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
while longer is really good it cuts back

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.160 
while longer is really good it cuts back
on<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.410> DPS<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.160> suffer<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:48.630> as<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.870> take

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
on the DPS you suffer so as I take

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.680 
on the DPS you suffer so as I take
damage<00:02:49.440> from<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.860> worm<00:02:50.180> I'm<00:02:51.180> not<00:02:51.360> taking

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
damage from this worm I'm not taking

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.780 
damage from this worm I'm not taking
damage<00:02:51.840> from<00:02:52.049> anything<00:02:52.319> else<00:02:52.650> go<00:02:53.370> figure

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
damage from anything else go figure

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.229 
damage from anything else go figure
right<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.380> end<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:56.250> really<00:02:56.670> pays<00:02:56.940> off

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
right so in the end that really pays off

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.910 
right so in the end that really pays off
now<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:57.989> course<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.319> had<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> stack<00:02:58.890> of

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
now of course I had to have a stack of

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.160 
now of course I had to have a stack of
posters<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.489> be<00:02:59.580> prepared<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.180> killing<00:03:01.080> those

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170
