00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:05.730
 I am surprised by the excess of his reaction to the opponent even though he is a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.610
 Sao Paulo 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.629
 The point is that I'm gaucho 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.549
 that football takes many turns but business a long time 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.349
 they have to understand the blue stain and the Cruzeirense that understand that after that 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.720
 I leave here, nothing more. 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.369
 This is the great truth 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.349
 So I mean, I could make a damn fool of myself with making fun of me. 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:24.119
 have to win 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.669
 Only on the side of here. 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.489
 not crowded the tip is you not the hard opponent to him that I said there 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.880
 at a private party 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.540
 sooner a corporate model should quickly do things well 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.429
 according to g1 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:37.469
 but no doubt time will tell 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.690
 I said 'what will your heart say today psdb has blood 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.829
 I'm a testicle professional. It was wonderful what I had there today. 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.170
 According to the chivas the cock against him then 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.399
 on this first day of the championships 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.059
 even making fun of the south to legalize championship is the last step 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.190
 here but the operators was for the cover to win 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.200
 it was okay 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.579
 the athletic-go 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.150
 at certain times 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
 lost everyone feel special 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.940
 it would be missing 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.640
 confidence of the players anxiety how to explain yourself to the rudder 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.250
 if you go to all games and reach the 3 to 0 would be competence 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.020
 did not continue 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.440
 if you win you will get competent 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.380
 They are not here in minas gerais. 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.200
 this was the biggest weekly loss with no money for a possible new jersey 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.200
 and competent 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.580
 the singe commented a bit and the variations of the athletic one had a good 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.860
 offensive power ended up not resisting 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.799
 inspired by international themes 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.140
 because the picture with the searches somewhere 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.930
 arrived at the end 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.210
 this behavior should not be if you pick up the pm the game analyzes the game where it is 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.680
 that the carini had some moments of didi 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.619
 of them denominated midfield where they are very strong in the midfield the court 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.740
 we get the backlash they did not have 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.090
 counterattacks where you saw the affection and having one is an effective participation 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.100
 so I think the team's behavior the boy still 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.780
 It is worrying to see so much markup renata chein was sign that the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.710
 boy and 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.219
 the best of everything was 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:14.780
 to share 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.740
 of the fans with your team is what we have to create 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.560
 a tune of percent of its players 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.590
 there is a fuller team 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.189
 on the most dangerous team 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.900
 no team to face any opponents as they arrived today 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.219
 there will see what will happen the results this can not happen 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.109
 mask a result where to go 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.619
 It's more or less and they would not have to stay here talking about it. 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.619
 I had dinner and I lost a lot of weight 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:47.299
 We need a lot of positive things from your team. 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.299
 Cáceres and Jairo Fields as their double-backed holder 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:55.279
 Today's opponent's vehicles were thrown did not give chance to 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:55.850
 nobody 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.519
 I would like you to do as an evaluation 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.259
 a mistake in a classic today 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.049
 I'm fine as the team played well. 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.829
 Fernando responsible for club route 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.829
 né details in of games the attacker of 20 years 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.169
 he boo 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.279
 in ramadi cacetadas itapuã 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.660
 is with us creating and playing well then he has to know how he 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.399
 It's going to be a great player before the machine has to change. 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:22.379
 in case he is released to play after the defeat has passed marvelous today 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.869
 in the case of an experienced player who came to play he will learn with 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:29.079
 them and will become a great defender of the future athletic I have no doubt 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.069
 none 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.979
 please 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.740
 even losing was the best match of the athletic in 2010 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.639
 if you add the importance of it 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.789
 the turkey selection 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.629
 and yes today's games 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.679
 is a screen that side is why you do not want to miss a classic 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.689
 and also in the ratchets 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:48.529
 sad 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.329
 but if you saw a team 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.139
 a team that wants something that knows what it wants 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.419
 and that leaves us satisfied then 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.479
 are local to the location 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:02.399
 the team is booming production, what really really starts today 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:03.879
 but 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.430
 with six points in the sixth-place Minas Gerais 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.079
 fall 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.899
 two more positions 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:13.349
 for the complement of the debut round in the Copa do Brasil midweek 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:19.079
 to reduce on the world market 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.659
 I used to scare me 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.430
 these questions every year in two weeks 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.169
 we are taking is going out 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.729
 I remember that in Corinthians the main characteristic of the Paulista championship 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.860
 defeat zachary singer in são paulo and we were champions the name scares us 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.130
 we have what they're talking about 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.010
 enjoy 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.090
 team growth 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.740
 cassiano gradual 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.210
 and worked you may not want you to exchange six seven players team at 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.069
 every night one day a football team leaves 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.499
 so taking advantage of an evolution team 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.390
 it's a totally heterogeneous team 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.669
 We're working here. 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:52.940
 the trend 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.889
 it's good to sleep 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.610
 the Minas Gerais championship snake that I want to win 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.740
 but the athletic is not to think only in the first platter of Brazil and 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.620
 Brazilian championship I already talked to you here this money is spent 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.580
 mountain 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.960
 It's Brazilian Championship Remedy 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.010
 experienced players is 20 players September 22, 4 donors 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.059
 henrique brave 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.749
 so we're on the right track 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.270
 I'm not sure we're on the right track.
