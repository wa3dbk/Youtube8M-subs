musicians who are on the road I want to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.880 
musicians who are on the road I want to
get<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.760> little<00:00:20.910> bit<00:00:21.090> more<00:00:21.240> practice<00:00:21.660> time

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
get a little bit more practice time

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.380 
get a little bit more practice time
let's<00:00:22.890> take<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> look<00:00:23.279> first<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.060> all<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
let's take a look first of all it's a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.089 
let's take a look first of all it's a
very<00:00:24.420> lightweight<00:00:24.990> guitar<00:00:25.500> weighs<00:00:25.890> just

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
very lightweight guitar weighs just

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.290 
very lightweight guitar weighs just
about<00:00:26.220> 3<00:00:26.640> pounds<00:00:26.820> end<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:28.019> end<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.789> 26<00:00:29.789> inches

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
about 3 pounds end to end it's 26 inches

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.120 
about 3 pounds end to end it's 26 inches
so<00:00:30.720> quite<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> bit<00:00:31.349> smaller<00:00:31.560> than<00:00:31.859> your<00:00:31.980> average

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
so quite a bit smaller than your average

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.280 
so quite a bit smaller than your average
electric<00:00:32.730> guitar<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.270> comes<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.079> very

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
electric guitar and comes with a very

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020 
electric guitar and comes with a very
nice<00:00:34.410> padded<00:00:34.860> case<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.340> carry<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.880> on

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
nice padded case so you can carry it on

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.380 
nice padded case so you can carry it on
and<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.170> worry<00:00:37.350> about<00:00:37.440> your<00:00:37.800> guitar

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
and not have to worry about your guitar

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.970 
and not have to worry about your guitar
the<00:00:39.390> way<00:00:39.629> they<00:00:39.809> achieve<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.350> smaller<00:00:40.649> size

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
the way they achieve this smaller size

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.209 
the way they achieve this smaller size
is<00:00:41.399> using<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.450> smaller<00:00:42.719> scale<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.860> probably

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
is using a smaller scale so you probably

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.610 
is using a smaller scale so you probably
know<00:00:44.370> Fender<00:00:44.850> Strat<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.420> example<00:00:45.809> has<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> 25

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
know Fender Strat for example has a 25

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.670 
know Fender Strat for example has a 25
inch<00:00:46.920> 20<00:00:47.550> 5.5<00:00:48.120> inch<00:00:48.329> scale<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.500> fret

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680

board<00:00:49.879> Gibson<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> little<00:00:51.149> bit<00:00:51.270> shorter<00:00:51.629> at

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
board Gibson a little bit shorter at

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.049 
board Gibson a little bit shorter at
24.5<00:00:52.800> inches<00:00:52.829> others<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> little

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
24.5 inches others have a little

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.939 
24.5 inches others have a little
variation<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:56.120> 20.2<00:00:57.120> inches<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
variation this one is 20.2 inches on the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.099 
variation this one is 20.2 inches on the
fretboard<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.180> smaller<00:01:00.539> scale<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
fretboard so it's a smaller scale a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.590 
fretboard so it's a smaller scale a
little<00:01:01.230> bit<00:01:01.440> more<00:01:01.590> compact<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.030> kind

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
little bit more compact and it's a kind

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
little bit more compact and it's a kind
of<00:01:03.690> equivalent<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.619> had<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> strat<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
of equivalent to if you had a strat and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.460 
of equivalent to if you had a strat and
you<00:01:06.119> put<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> capo<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.869> fourth<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.439> fifth

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you put a capo on the fourth or fifth

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.080 
you put a capo on the fourth or fifth
fret<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.430> lopped<00:01:08.729> off<00:01:08.939> those<00:01:09.270> top<00:01:09.659> frets<00:01:10.049> so

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
fret just lopped off those top frets so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.340 
fret just lopped off those top frets so
works<00:01:12.090> pretty<00:01:12.299> well<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> does<00:01:13.080> take<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
works pretty well but it does take a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.440 
works pretty well but it does take a
couple<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.770> hours<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.340> used<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.700> I'll<00:01:15.270> give

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
couple of hours to get used to I'll give

out<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.820> this<00:02:40.940> guitar<00:02:41.150> I've<00:02:42.140> been<00:02:42.620> using<00:02:42.799> this

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
out of this guitar I've been using this

out of this guitar I've been using this
for<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.220> couple<00:02:43.370> months<00:02:43.640> it's<00:02:44.060> become<00:02:44.450> probably

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
for a couple months it's become probably

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.410 
for a couple months it's become probably

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
the version 2.1 guitar which has this

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.069 
the version 2.1 guitar which has this
arm<00:02:52.400> which<00:02:53.120> gives<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.540> little<00:02:53.720> bit<00:02:53.900> more

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
arm which gives you a little bit more

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.630 
arm which gives you a little bit more
balance<00:02:54.590> when<00:02:54.769> you're<00:02:54.860> playing<00:02:55.100> standing<00:02:55.519> up

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
balance when you're playing standing up

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.210 
balance when you're playing standing up

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
there's also an optional leg rest that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.530 
there's also an optional leg rest that
