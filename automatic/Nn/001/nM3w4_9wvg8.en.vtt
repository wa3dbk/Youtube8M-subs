like that and fold this down on him so

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.099 
like that and fold this down on him so
transform<00:04:20.160> him<00:04:20.280> just<00:04:20.459> like<00:04:20.579> that<00:04:21.109> transform

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
transform him just like that transform

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.800 
transform him just like that transform
him<00:04:22.320> just<00:04:22.620> back<00:04:22.800> into<00:04:23.070> his<00:04:23.220> regular<00:04:23.810> weapon

then<00:04:29.099> transform<00:04:29.760> this<00:04:30.449> guy<00:04:31.070> take<00:04:32.070> these<00:04:32.250> flip

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
then transform this guy take these flip

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.860 
then transform this guy take these flip
them<00:04:32.639> out<00:04:32.699> to<00:04:32.789> the<00:04:32.880> side<00:04:33.060> flip<00:04:33.449> them<00:04:33.570> all<00:04:33.750> the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
them out to the side flip them all the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.540 
them out to the side flip them all the
way<00:04:33.990> up<00:04:34.020> together<00:04:34.320> they<00:04:34.919> peg<00:04:35.160> together<00:04:35.430> up

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
way up together they peg together up

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.189 
way up together they peg together up
here<00:04:35.580> at<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.849> top<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.720> then<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:36.870> take<00:04:37.050> this

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
here at the top and then you take this

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.950 
here at the top and then you take this
piece<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:38.090> flip<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.300> up<00:04:39.389> under<00:04:39.630> there<00:04:39.810> and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
piece and flip it up under there and

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.860 
piece and flip it up under there and
then<00:04:40.919> you<00:04:41.039> can<00:04:41.160> plug<00:04:41.460> this<00:04:41.789> end<00:04:42.450> you<00:04:42.630> can<00:04:42.719> see

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
then you can plug this end you can see

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.810 
then you can plug this end you can see
that<00:04:43.050> this<00:04:43.530> longer<00:04:43.890> tab<00:04:44.370> here<00:04:44.669> there's

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
that this longer tab here there's

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.969 
that this longer tab here there's
actually<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.150> there's<00:04:46.050> one<00:04:46.200> peg<00:04:46.409> here<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.860> one

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
actually a there's one peg here and one

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:47.360 
actually a there's one peg here and one
peg

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
peg

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.280 
peg
here<00:04:47.550> so<00:04:47.760> this<00:04:47.880> one<00:04:48.030> actually<00:04:48.150> sits<00:04:48.510> up<00:04:49.139> in

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
here so this one actually sits up in

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.500 
here so this one actually sits up in
there<00:04:49.440> like<00:04:49.560> that<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.070> then<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:51.060> take<00:04:51.270> this

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
there like that and then you take this

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.659 
there like that and then you take this
and<00:04:51.830> plug<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:52.949> in<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.220> handle<00:04:53.400> like<00:04:53.699> that<00:04:54.350> and

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
and plug it in to handle like that and

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.300 
and plug it in to handle like that and

because then those stickers are kind of
facing<00:05:15.690> out<00:05:15.840> for<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.710> right<00:05:16.860> hand<00:05:17.010> again
