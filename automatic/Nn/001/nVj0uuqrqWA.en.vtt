 by the complete sports percent so far 10 remained hidden that in the 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.119
 last ten years

 I go Go I got the kennels thanks to good overview mass protest 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:36.310
 resolutely the bitter PID today something is a piece of history place 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.490
 and it was certainly the motivation villages bring the symbol Bonn GrÃ¼bel 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.960
 because is finished and still no go 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.550
 Literature tilts 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.600
 Frost and the history of flowing rock climbing together 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.150
 Of course, that's great for my mom's time to get her on track 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.310
 They really left me out 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.510
 Percent is also such May is carried outward and that will do that 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.449
 Main throws 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.729
 Be the first to know about something like a gift 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.530
 directly last on the way been Pakistan reason in percent or Tomas 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.320
 what Sartre made the Impakt Langenau piece 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.080
 Lauber you have a very difficult climb oldest over 6000 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.470
 How did you come up with the idea and again that? 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.690
 Experience climbing in parks then 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.350
 Seniors on the way around 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.290
 Mendes Tower who is behind Timo Glock went right through the inner martial arts 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.030
 so 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.780
 the pixelated Minden several Pakistan 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.340
 countered so because there cords there Vettel 12 b the way stands meanwhile 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.340
 to announce that they are in the lead 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.280
 Exactly 20 years the legendary German Shell managed in the ehf-cup Wittenburg 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.840
 Floodlights open their hat and this one next to which carries the name like 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.080
 can be eleven lengths 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.130
 and spree it was 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.719
 definitely Thomas a milestone 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.940
 moving story quite simply build world times twelfth kitchen crepe waiting 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.450
 Ank first time 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.480
 Fried with the dance consistently 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.819
 transferred to climbing without a big bear 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.989
 Rinteln the painters and Karl Kollmann have transferred it 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.939
 and 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:19.839
 Isis was quite something like in England and could be too 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:20.809
 to attempt 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.129
 For it was not possible at the time of the first ascent 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.009
 take time 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.749
 4 is left to climb a drink 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:33.159
 and the four winch and patient will be the organ a lot over the 20 years 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.610
 The Eclipse reigns there called 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.999
 at least I have 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:41.029
 no one has succeeded so far why we managed to know a lot 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:44.449
 Luck has been there as well that can bring along 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.309
 and you have to absolutely want it all fitted together and that's why 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:49.699
 we had this luck 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.549
 This Aitana nimble Wulften Khalifa and control the first straits to climb 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.609
 this one should not be the right one for your expedition now 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.989
 where Liesten against an alien last and Antarctic on the way from 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.829
 sometimes you have the feeling when you are traveling 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.559
 Dense in the fierce find around the weather is bad 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:13.159
 why are you still doing the word or and always happy doing so too 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.559
 expedition 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:18.879
 It is very clear when you are traveling on an expedition that you keep coming back 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.549
 Moments then nothing went really super the EM is 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.840
 You just have to suffer from crows but I think it is 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:26.799
 lots 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:27.879
 percent 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.319
 really demanding goal is too 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.039
 how to create 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:35.060
 Wiki must bring full commitment 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.990
 now to more use one brings but and comes to me while back out here 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.239
 in the series on comedy having something to do with is interesting 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.590
 Broken Imedi is the difficult one to worry about 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.470
 Donna Minden has to work hard for that, but Donna Minden is just as nice 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.789
 to bring good results behind Hansa 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.319
 you once said the gate to no 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.549
 Occupation and a free time so third mountain sports well separated from each other 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:05.859
 in fact, if you call it, you would continue to do so 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.479
 a lectures at mines that are sometimes a bit of Anna's are reported 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:14.749
 the fascination that you are still climbing for the later Austermann 50 lectures 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.469
 had to do about the same topic 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:20.909
 It must be honest that there were times that was very difficult for me 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:24.189
 Concert so pressing York life and then the Places me 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:27.430
 in order to accomplish that 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.840
 is can bring and today is very clear 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.680
 there is for me end wants UFO Panthers Zeitz 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.160
 my passion 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.689
 Lot of free time 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.399
 which I spend with passion and like Xing Connichi McLaren CAD 

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.580
 bring for me 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.759
 Menke stupid is simply what I transport to the outside of the 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.759
 Populated the zones of the offender a few teeth 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.740
 and is it still today so that lot of passion for me leisure 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.979
 is when I'm in the mountains I'm there though 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:00.400
 Let's call it a tax office technically 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.960
 Percent off work but from my feeling and that's it 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.819
 decisive 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.419
 I'm in my spare time on the road, my passion is me 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.430
 TuS lives 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.039
 Jütte loses among tenants Aschermann eye collector your new 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.030
 what are the expectations of the valves in South Tyrol? 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:20.610
 Dahlem appearance live here 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.539
 of the possibilities that the event gives you 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.229
 a principle today is like that for me 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.649
 Percent that the funny expectations are something like that of many others 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.300
 Percent the wings - so beautiful says too 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.849
 and I think that Otto Haas follows from it 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:38.810
 Zheng come 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.780
 that you are too much climber collapse because I have to be completely honest 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.039
 say 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.599
 come here just an hour ago 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.590
 already a bunch of climbers and today the kon-tiki met again it is he 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.879
 nevertheless not so easy that one always creates the possibilities 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.150
 to get together and that's for sure an excellent baptism opportunity 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.580
 Ansgar always starts talking Fischbach
