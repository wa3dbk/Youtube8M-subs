you<00:00:18.580> say<00:00:18.820> this<00:00:18.940> is<00:00:19.090> better<00:00:19.450> than<00:00:19.720> a<00:00:19.840> bike<00:00:20.050> why

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
you say this is better than a bike why

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.359 
you say this is better than a bike why
is<00:00:20.920> that<00:00:21.870> because<00:00:22.980> bikes<00:00:24.270> have<00:00:25.270> some<00:00:26.369> problems

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
engineering aspect you've got to

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.430 
engineering aspect you've got to
convince<00:00:45.520> car<00:00:46.180> drivers<00:00:46.720> that<00:00:47.020> it<00:00:47.110> isn't<00:00:47.350> going

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
to fall over and you've got to convince

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.509 
to fall over and you've got to convince
motorbike<00:00:49.720> riders<00:00:50.170> that<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.100> isn't<00:00:51.339> going<00:00:51.460> to

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
motorbike riders that it isn't going to

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.960 
motorbike riders that it isn't going to
fall<00:00:51.730> over<00:00:51.760> so<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:53.230> ahead<00:00:53.729> basically<00:00:54.729> the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
fall over so go ahead basically the

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.869 
fall over so go ahead basically the
concept<00:00:55.180> is<00:00:56.339> motorcycle<00:00:57.339> that<00:00:57.430> an<00:00:57.519> enclosed

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
concept is motorcycle that an enclosed

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.329 
concept is motorcycle that an enclosed
cabin<00:00:58.239> if<00:00:59.110> you<00:00:59.290> have<00:00:59.440> an<00:00:59.559> enclosed<00:00:59.920> cabin<00:01:00.190> you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
cabin if you have an enclosed cabin you

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.110 
cabin if you have an enclosed cabin you
cannot<00:01:00.640> put<00:01:00.820> your<00:01:00.970> feet<00:01:01.239> out<00:01:01.870> of<00:01:02.440> it<00:01:02.559> so<00:01:03.250> we

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
cannot put your feet out of it so we

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.140 
cannot put your feet out of it so we
have<00:01:04.300> this<00:01:04.540> outbreak<00:01:05.379> of<00:01:05.620> stabilizing<00:01:06.310> wheel

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
have this outbreak of stabilizing wheel

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.300 
have this outbreak of stabilizing wheel
system<00:01:07.479> well<00:01:08.140> if<00:01:08.260> you<00:01:08.380> forget<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:09.010> put<00:01:09.280> your

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
system well if you forget to put your

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:17.860 
system well if you forget to put your
wheels<00:01:09.580> down<00:01:09.909> you<00:01:10.720> won't<00:01:10.930> forget<00:01:11.080> it

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.320 

right<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:19.050> stabilizers<00:01:19.740> are<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:21.180> we're

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
right the stabilizers are up so we're

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.460 
right the stabilizers are up so we're
now<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.600> bike<00:01:21.870> mode

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.060 

well<00:01:25.040> I<00:01:25.070> was<00:01:25.310> expecting<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:25.940> be<00:01:26.060> terrifying

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
well I was expecting it to be terrifying

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.230 
well I was expecting it to be terrifying
it's<00:01:28.070> kind<00:01:28.340> of<00:01:28.460> like<00:01:28.640> sitting<00:01:29.090> in<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:29.240> car<00:01:31.240> you

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
it's kind of like sitting in a car you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.760 
it's kind of like sitting in a car you
forget<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:32.780> there's<00:01:33.020> only<00:01:33.110> two<00:01:33.470> wheels

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
forget that there's only two wheels

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.760 
forget that there's only two wheels
propping<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.580> up

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
propping you up

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.850 

oh<00:01:36.829> no<00:01:37.609> someone's<00:01:38.060> nicked<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.509> wings<00:01:40.060> right<00:01:43.810> I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
oh no someone's nicked the wings right I

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:53.130 
oh no someone's nicked the wings right I
can't<00:01:45.860> think<00:01:45.950> of<00:01:46.070> anything<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.369> say

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.539 

remarkably<00:01:54.140> low<00:01:54.380> speeds<00:01:54.799> without<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.310> falling

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
remarkably low speeds without it falling

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.840 
remarkably low speeds without it falling
over

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.730 

the<00:02:01.850> latest<00:02:02.210> project<00:02:02.690> is<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.990> build<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.290> turbo

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
the latest project is to build a turbo

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.120 
the latest project is to build a turbo
version<00:02:04.010> which<00:02:04.369> will<00:02:04.580> do<00:02:05.320> 197<00:02:06.320> miles<00:02:06.710> an<00:02:07.010> hour

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
version which will do 197 miles an hour

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.609 
version which will do 197 miles an hour
but<00:02:08.030> this<00:02:08.240> was<00:02:08.420> fast<00:02:08.660> enough<00:02:08.959> for<00:02:09.140> me<00:02:09.289> even

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
but this was fast enough for me even

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.370 
but this was fast enough for me even
though<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:10.039> had<00:02:10.310> an<00:02:10.399> expert<00:02:10.910> pilot<00:02:11.380> mr.
