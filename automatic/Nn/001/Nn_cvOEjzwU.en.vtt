00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.279
 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.320
 iphoneitalia hot news episode as of 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.180
 we usually go to see them immediately 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.529
 most important news related to the world 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.150
 apple this week 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.980
 the first news today concerns i 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.720
 related apple financial results 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.400
 at the second quarter of 2014 were 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.590
 Then 43.7 million iPhones sold 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.390
 a figure once again uphill 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.510
 especially shortly in a moment 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.339
 which apple has not made new announcements 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.449
 iphone this really is a given 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.159
 considerable 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.620
 same goes for ipads 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.330
 they reach 16.3 million copies 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.080
 sold also in this case we are in 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.970
 climb while the macs go down a little 4.1 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.040
 millions of copies sold in this 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.890
 quarter total turnover is 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.170
 state of $ 45 6 billion while 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.409
 quarterly net income extracts status 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.299
 of 10.2 billion dollars therefore data 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.799
 absolutely positive for apple that 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.229
 once again despite the 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.210
 expectations were already in this case 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.020
 good in other words , he has them 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.659
 surpassed and indeed by signals indeed 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.579
 positive for a 2014 that promises to be 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.409
 really really interesting and that already 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.170
 started in a very interesting way 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.159
 precisely with regard to apple itself 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.780
 today's second news concerns ios 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.890
 7.1.1 this update of which I have 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.719
 already spoken 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.820
 seemed to introduce improvements 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.979
 on the battery now after a few 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.319
 test day I can confirm that the 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.939
 battery really gets better afterwards 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.740
 have updated to this version of ios 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.200
 so if you haven't done it yet e 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.229
 you want to have an extra battery boost 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.939
 updated immediately from 7.1.1 clearly 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.039
 if you want to keep the jailbreak instead 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.799
 avoid it for the reasons I have 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.889
 described in the previous video, however, is me 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.229
 I can confirm that you have done at least 

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:01.880
 one hour and a half more in use with 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.729
 my iphone after updating to 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.869
 this version of the operating system 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.030
 an hour and a half more in use not 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.130
 it's little guys means practically 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.250
 a battery life than level 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.290
 overall can last up to 2 3 hours 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.390
 more regarding the use instead 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.730
 an hour an hour and a half are anyway 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.700
 so many many so if you are 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.870
 interested updated immediately by e 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.540
 7.1.1 you can do it directly from 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.130
 your iphone ipod ipod touch 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.350
 software update settings 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.209
 the weight is 16 May therefore 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.550
 the update is really fast and 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.270
 you can do it without going through 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.250
 itunes 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.380
 the fourth is today's news concerns a 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.420
 new program launched by apple for the 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.820
 replacement of the power button 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.530
 iphone 5 is a program that already has it 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.810
 party in the united states now arrives 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.180
 precisely even in Italy and is one 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.610
 totally free repair 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.160
 iphone 5 devices with this button 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.989
 power damaged as apple has 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.959
 acknowledged the existence of a problem 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.150
 of a production defect will be able to 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.310
 be repaired or replaced 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.950
 free even if they are out of the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.130
 warranty period therefore over the two 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.440
 years from the sale of the device is a 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.769
 design a program much better 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.910
 interesting apple that already has it 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.829
 in the past, some were structured 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.030
 programs of this type 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:26.250
 we remember for example the replacement 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:28.320
 of the very first ipod nano of 2006 2004 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.200
 sorry I don't remember a year though of the 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.390
 very first ipod nano which was replaced 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.400
 practically with the ipod touch with the ipod 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.989
 nano touch of sixth generation after 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.329
 almost ten years from his 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.470
 marketing then apple is not 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.170
 new to these programs 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.160
 if you have an iphone 5 with the power button 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.100
 damaged 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.570
 contact an apple store immediately or 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.209
 contact apple on the phone or in a 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.350
 Apple center authorized to receive 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.600
 a replacement a repair 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.640
 free of charge device in fact 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.980
 last and most interesting question 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.200
 Today's news is needless to say 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.359
 iphone 6 iphone that continues to do 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.359
 talk a lot says this 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:09.329
 it will probably really be the year 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:11.630
 of the iphone because iphone 6 will be I think and 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.210
 I hope really innovative and 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.220
 a small revolution iphone 6 that is 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.620
 was shown for the first time in a 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.580
 3d model 3d model probably 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.980
 it is not known whether based on the 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.880
 cases we've already seen on ipad 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.960
 italia.com 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.630
 I made to make the cases 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.700
 therefore surely the two positions 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.200
 two theories go in contrast is only one 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.730
 could give us 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.770
 we could say something more 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.900
 on the actual design of this iphone 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.120
 if this model was made for 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.430
 the creators of enclosures to carry out 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.650
 those caretakers we have already seen 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.590
 then this really adds so much to the 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.840
 in short, design already shown 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.280
 in short, the iPhone 6 would mean 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.040
 that this design could really 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.020
 be what we will see in September 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.560
 in any case you are looking at how to 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.750
 usually images and this iphone sense 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.760
 but we see that it is more subtle we see that 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.800
 to these rounded edges in ipad style 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.990
 mini ipad and ipod touch 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.820
 the unconvincing thing is the flash 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.500
 because it is not the fruit a flash of 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.450
 iphone 5 if it goes back to being a flash 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.120
 in short, it is not clear whether 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.610
 Apple will make this move or not 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.320
 camera also seems to stick out 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.760
 slightly like on ipod touch 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.010
 this is another rumor that seems 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.870
 be confirmed by this model e 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.940
 then we have the screen that appears to be 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.830
 from 4.7 inches so it's not the model 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.840
 from 5.5 inches what you are 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.470
 looking at the new volume keys 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.090
 now thinner and more ipad style e 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.580
 then even if you don't see it but you sense it 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.860
 the power button no longer positioned in 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.820
 high on the device but on the side like 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.500
 precisely seen in the last images 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.690
 clearly the device in hand yes 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.790
 sees that the greater I do not know the hands of 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.110
 person who keeps it in the picture how much 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.810
 whether they are big, it actually looks 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.220
 a bigger device and maybe 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.230
 one-handed use may not 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.150
 be so simple anyway 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.710
 guys as usual I remind you from 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.140
 these are grandfather leaks 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.820
 leaks so we can't 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.380
 check we can't tell you if they are 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.270
 true or not therefore as usual 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.380
 take this information with 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.630
 due caution 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.820
 on the phones and design front of the new 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.860
 iphone you advance that soon there 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.440
 it will be a very interesting video but more 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.330
 I tell you nothing good about this guys 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.740
 so even for today it's all I am 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.570
 andrea cervone thank you for having 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.250
