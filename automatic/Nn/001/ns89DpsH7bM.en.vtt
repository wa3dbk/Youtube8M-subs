00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.710 
the game so it was really tough to play
but<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.100> got<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.520> would<00:01:20.729> my<00:01:21.119> goal<00:01:21.330> was<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> be

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
but I got I would my goal was to be

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080 
but I got I would my goal was to be
super<00:01:21.990> aggressive<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.650> wanted<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.520> try

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
super aggressive because I wanted to try

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.120 
super aggressive because I wanted to try
to<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.509> many<00:01:24.570> kills<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.020> could<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
to get as many kills as I could in the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.100 
to get as many kills as I could in the
lot<00:01:26.670> amount<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.970> time<00:01:27.119> because<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.960> can

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
lot amount of time because as you can

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.480 
lot amount of time because as you can
see<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> bottom<00:01:28.530> left<00:01:28.890> hand<00:01:28.979> corner<00:01:29.130> I'm

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
see in the bottom left hand corner I'm

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.980 
see in the bottom left hand corner I'm
now<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.729> second<00:01:30.090> place<00:01:30.240> because<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.869> on

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
now in second place because I'm just on

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.050 
now in second place because I'm just on
tier<00:01:31.290> 1<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.159> everybody<00:01:32.460> else<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.759> think<00:01:32.820> there's

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
tier 1 so everybody else I think there's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
tier 1 so everybody else I think there's
five<00:01:33.329> people<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> game<00:01:33.900> are<00:01:34.590> struggling

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
five people in the game are struggling

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.200 
five people in the game are struggling
to<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.250> their<00:01:35.310> guns<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.850> chase<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.119> guy

to get their guns and I chase this guy

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
to get their guns and I chase this guy

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
couple times because I'm trying to learn

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.089 
couple times because I'm trying to learn
as<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.149> go<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.709> i<00:02:10.800> don't<00:02:10.950> know<00:02:11.039> if

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
as I go but I do have it i don't know if

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.920 
as I go but I do have it i don't know if
it's<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.610> particular<00:02:12.150> video<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.720> next

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
it's this particular video or the next

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.860 
it's this particular video or the next
video<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.470> go<00:02:13.560> on

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
video I kind of go on

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.869 
video I kind of go on
here<00:02:13.989> with<00:02:14.980> all<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.220> different<00:02:15.459> guns<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.730> get

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
here with all the different guns I get

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.850 
here with all the different guns I get
and<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.450> think<00:02:16.659> how<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:17.110> particular<00:02:17.440> game

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
and I think how this particular game

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.680 
and I think how this particular game
type<00:02:18.069> works<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.549> that<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:19.150> guns<00:02:19.330> in<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> very

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
type works is that the guns in the very

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.720 
type works is that the guns in the very
beginning<00:02:19.840> are<00:02:20.260> difficult<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.799> use<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.549> guns

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
beginning are difficult to use the guns

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.979 
beginning are difficult to use the guns
in<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:21.940> middle<00:02:22.180> are<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.330> little<00:02:22.540> bit<00:02:22.780> more

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
in the middle are a little bit more

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.360 
in the middle are a little bit more
manageable<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.620> then<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.799> guns<00:02:23.980> at<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.190> end

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
manageable and then the guns at the end

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.039 
manageable and then the guns at the end
of<00:02:24.549> the<00:02:24.670> match<00:02:24.849> our<00:02:25.360> kind<00:02:25.599> of<00:02:25.690> tough<00:02:25.870> like

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
of the match our kind of tough like

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.500 
of the match our kind of tough like
crossbows<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.830> ballistic<00:02:27.220> knives<00:02:27.400> but<00:02:28.360> now<00:02:28.480> i

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
crossbows and ballistic knives but now i

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.240 
crossbows and ballistic knives but now i
got<00:02:28.690> an<00:02:28.750> mp5<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.500> i'm<00:02:29.560> feeling<00:02:29.890> pretty<00:02:29.920> good

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
got an mp5 and i'm feeling pretty good

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.059 
got an mp5 and i'm feeling pretty good
about<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:31.480> think<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.110> it's<00:02:32.829> interesting

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
about this I think that it's interesting

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.649 
about this I think that it's interesting
when<00:02:33.310> I'm<00:02:33.670> playing<00:02:33.790> this<00:02:34.000> game<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.390> during

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
when I'm playing this game and during

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.410 
when I'm playing this game and during
the<00:02:34.810> event<00:02:35.079> my<00:02:35.379> brain<00:02:35.980> was<00:02:36.010> just<00:02:36.400> so<00:02:36.909> just<00:02:37.269> like

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
the event my brain was just so just like

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.149 
the event my brain was just so just like
hyperactive<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.230> was<00:02:38.349> just<00:02:38.440> like<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.739> it<00:02:39.040> was

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
hyperactive I was just like you it was

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.140 
hyperactive I was just like you it was

but it's it was it's very difficult for
me<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.549> figure<00:02:52.090> out<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.810> know<00:02:52.840> if<00:02:53.049> this<00:02:53.170> is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
me to figure out you know if this is

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.349 
me to figure out you know if this is
going<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.470> be<00:02:53.620> something<00:02:53.890> that's<00:02:53.980> going<00:02:54.220> to

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
going to be something that's going to

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.900 
going to be something that's going to
one-up<00:02:55.359> 1042<00:02:55.959> only<00:02:56.680> time<00:02:56.829> will<00:02:56.890> tell<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.459> think

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
one-up 1042 only time will tell I think

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.610 
one-up 1042 only time will tell I think
that<00:02:58.030> if<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.209> was<00:02:58.420> able<00:02:58.599> to<00:02:58.930> actually<00:02:59.079> sit<00:02:59.409> down

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
that if I was able to actually sit down

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.800 
that if I was able to actually sit down
in<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.829> quiet<00:03:00.069> room<00:03:00.159> and<00:03:00.640> spend<00:03:01.390> some<00:03:01.510> time<00:03:01.690> with

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
in a quiet room and spend some time with

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.569 
in a quiet room and spend some time with
this<00:03:01.870> game<00:03:02.079> I'd<00:03:02.290> be<00:03:02.560> able<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.859> get<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> feel<00:03:03.340> for

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579
