00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
so one of the common mistakes that I see

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.560 
so one of the common mistakes that I see
a<00:00:19.470> lot<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.740> times<00:00:20.100> with<00:00:20.279> shadows<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.850> people

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
a lot of times with shadows is people

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.689 
a lot of times with shadows is people
with<00:00:22.109> shadow<00:00:22.289> boxing<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.740> people<00:00:23.039> not<00:00:23.279> going

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
with shadow boxing is people not going

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.910 
with shadow boxing is people not going
over<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.510> technical<00:00:24.990> side<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.230> striking<00:00:25.590> so

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
over the technical side of striking so

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.769 
over the technical side of striking so
arms<00:00:26.279> flared<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.849> they're<00:00:27.359> moving<00:00:27.689> around

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
arms flared out they're moving around

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.769 
arms flared out they're moving around
not<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> sight<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.340> good<00:00:29.400> stance<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.630> we

perfect<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.110> possible<00:00:37.170> we're<00:00:37.980> moving<00:00:38.489> around

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
perfect as possible we're moving around

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.430

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
in front of us another common mistakes

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.119 
in front of us another common mistakes
that<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.789> see<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.270> people<00:00:48.559> looking<00:00:49.559> down<00:00:49.829> as

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that I see is people looking down as

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.180 
that I see is people looking down as
their<00:00:50.460> shadow<00:00:50.760> boxing<00:00:51.739> what<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.039> going

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
their shadow boxing what this is going

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.799 
their shadow boxing what this is going
to<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> give<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.059> bad<00:00:54.270> habits

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
to do is going to give you bad habits

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.080 
to do is going to give you bad habits
you<00:00:55.020> never<00:00:55.530> look<00:00:55.770> down<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.190> fight<00:00:56.430> why<00:00:56.879> would

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you never look down in a fight why would

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
you never look down in a fight why would
you<00:00:57.210> look<00:00:57.390> down<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.440> shadow<00:00:58.649> boxing<00:00:59.129> so

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you look down as your shadow boxing so

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.430 
you look down as your shadow boxing so
we<00:00:59.670> want<00:00:59.820> things<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.149> translate<00:01:00.750> into<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
we want things to translate into the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.070 
we want things to translate into the
real-life<00:01:01.890> situation<00:01:02.550> basically<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.780> fight

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
real-life situation basically a fight

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.390 
real-life situation basically a fight
you're<00:01:04.470> never<00:01:04.650> gonna<00:01:04.769> look<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> fight

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
you're never gonna look down in a fight

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.670 
you're never gonna look down in a fight
so<00:01:05.580> don't<00:01:05.939> look<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:07.229> we're<00:01:07.439> shadow

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
so don't look down as we're shadow

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.649 
so don't look down as we're shadow
boxing<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.549> again<00:01:08.880> we're<00:01:09.090> looking<00:01:09.119> forward

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
our chin stuck and we're working the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.330 
our chin stuck and we're working the
basic<00:01:12.390> combinations<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.530> we're<00:01:13.740> working<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
basic combinations so we're working the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.730 
basic combinations so we're working the
jab<00:01:14.670> making<00:01:15.210> sure<00:01:15.390> everything<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.439> perfect

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
jab making sure everything is as perfect

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.810 
jab making sure everything is as perfect
as<00:01:17.100> possible

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
as possible

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.060 
as possible
remember<00:01:18.240> hands<00:01:18.540> up<00:01:18.900> we're<00:01:19.229> coming<00:01:19.619> forward

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
remember hands up we're coming forward

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.760 
remember hands up we're coming forward
working<00:01:20.810> backwards<00:01:21.810> we're<00:01:22.170> moving<00:01:22.650> around

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
working backwards we're moving around

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.880 
working backwards we're moving around
head<00:01:23.310> movement<00:01:24.140> simulating<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.229> fight<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.650> much

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
head movement simulating a fight as much

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.190 
head movement simulating a fight as much
as<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.600> we're<00:01:27.750> adding<00:01:27.930> those

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
as we can so we're adding those

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.950 
as we can so we're adding those
combinations<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.729> two<00:01:30.119> we're<00:01:30.659> looking

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
combinations now one two we're looking

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.620 
combinations now one two we're looking
forward<00:01:31.970> one<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> things<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
forward one of the things I like to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
forward one of the things I like to
focus<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.259> punching<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:35.009> because<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
focus on is punching up because you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.880 
focus on is punching up because you
don't<00:01:35.850> necessarily<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.840> how<00:01:37.020> tall<00:01:37.650> your

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
don't necessarily know how tall your

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.920 
don't necessarily know how tall your
opponent<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.689> don't

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
opponent is going to be and you don't

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.889 
opponent is going to be and you don't
want<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.560> punch<00:01:40.829> down<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> shorter<00:01:42.479> opponent

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
want to punch down to a shorter opponent

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.050 
want to punch down to a shorter opponent
if<00:01:43.020> we're<00:01:43.200> fighting<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> bigger<00:01:43.770> opponent<00:01:44.100> in

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
if we're fighting a bigger opponent in

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.850 
if we're fighting a bigger opponent in
fact<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.420> want<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.689> punch<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> build

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
fact we want to punch up just to build

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.800
