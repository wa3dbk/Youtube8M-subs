okay<00:00:02.399> trouble<00:00:02.970> with<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.300> lathe<00:00:05.480> before<00:00:06.480> you

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
okay trouble with the lathe before you

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:17.420 
okay trouble with the lathe before you
can<00:00:06.870> see<00:00:07.170> that<00:00:09.530> just<00:00:10.530> run<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.730> down<00:00:16.430> notice

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
can see that just run that down notice

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.870 
can see that just run that down notice
that<00:00:17.580> as<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.880> crank<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.420> wheel<00:00:18.570> up<00:00:19.430> and<00:00:20.430> pull<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that as I crank the wheel up and pull it

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.759 
that as I crank the wheel up and pull it
back<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.210> other<00:00:21.510> way<00:00:21.660> I'm<00:00:21.930> getting<00:00:22.140> two<00:00:22.740> or

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
back the other way I'm getting two or

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.120 
back the other way I'm getting two or
three<00:00:23.630> ten<00:00:24.630> thousandths<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.470> movement<00:00:25.980> just

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
three ten thousandths of movement just

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:46.279 
three ten thousandths of movement just
doing<00:00:26.490> that

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.799 

they're<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.989> they're<00:00:48.989> basically<00:00:50.809> hopefully

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
they're so they're basically hopefully

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:03.049 
they're so they're basically hopefully
you<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:52.050> see<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:54.109> zero<00:00:59.300> listen<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:02.059> going

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you can see that zero listen here going

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:13.160 
you can see that zero listen here going
on<00:01:03.269> here<00:01:07.280> this<00:01:08.280> style<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:09.210> fun<00:01:11.780> this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.840> only

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
on here this style for fun this is only

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.649 
on here this style for fun this is only
reading<00:01:13.649> in<00:01:13.770> thousands<00:01:14.399> so<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.759> not<00:01:14.970> all

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
reading in thousands so it's not all

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:37.760 
reading in thousands so it's not all
that<00:01:15.899> helpful

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.149 

there<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.759> go<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.170> again<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.649> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.920> see

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
there you go and again as you can see

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.130 
there you go and again as you can see
that<00:01:41.369> one<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.520> about<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.149> 10,000<00:01:42.899> soft

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that one is about for 10,000 soft

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.060 
that one is about for 10,000 soft
doesn't<00:01:43.409> look<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.860> bad<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:45.020> as<00:01:46.020> you'll<00:01:46.680> notice

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
doesn't look so bad and as you'll notice

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.730 
doesn't look so bad and as you'll notice
I<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> mark<00:01:47.790> right<00:01:48.060> here

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
I have a mark right here

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.440 
I have a mark right here
and<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.729> mark<00:01:51.030> represents<00:01:53.000> somehow<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.270> is

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and that mark represents somehow this is

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.109 
and that mark represents somehow this is
almost<00:01:54.930> straight<00:01:55.350> across<00:01:55.740> or<00:01:56.520> parallel<00:01:57.060> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
almost straight across or parallel to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.730 
almost straight across or parallel to
the<00:01:57.390> ways<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:59.159> let's<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.740> as

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the ways here but let's do this as

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.370 
the ways here but let's do this as
you'll<00:02:02.009> notice<00:02:05.509> I'm<00:02:06.509> gonna<00:02:06.659> rotate<00:02:06.929> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
you'll notice I'm gonna rotate that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.889 
you'll notice I'm gonna rotate that
clear<00:02:07.830> across<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.399> 90<00:02:09.360> degrees<00:02:09.660> away

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
clear across so that 90 degrees away

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.550 
clear across so that 90 degrees away
from<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.259> other<00:02:10.470> one<00:02:11.780> as<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.110> see<00:02:13.350> that

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
from that other one as you can see that

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:26.030 
from that other one as you can see that
one<00:02:13.769> now<00:02:17.660> now<00:02:22.280> check<00:02:23.280> out<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:25.040> we're

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
one now now check out that we're

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.100 
one now now check out that we're
somewhere<00:02:27.000> near<00:02:27.299> seven<00:02:28.110> thousands<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:33.870> not

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
somewhere near seven thousands it's not

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.630 
somewhere near seven thousands it's not
as<00:02:34.260> well<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.680> worse<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.280> not<00:02:35.430> even

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
as well it's worse it's not even

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:54.520 
as well it's worse it's not even
contacting<00:02:37.519> so<00:02:38.519> I'll<00:02:39.330> run<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.930> back<00:02:40.140> here

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
sorry about that we're already off the

chart let's go back to zero here I'll

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.040 
chart let's go back to zero here I'll
run<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.120> back<00:03:39.300> this<00:03:39.569> way<00:03:41.060> see<00:03:42.060> how<00:03:42.090> far<00:03:42.569> off<00:03:42.630> we

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
run it back this way see how far off we

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:53.020 
run it back this way see how far off we
are

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.380 

several<00:03:53.840> thousands<00:03:54.470> as<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.740> can<00:03:54.920> see<00:03:55.330> how<00:03:56.330> can

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
several thousands as you can see how can

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.650 
several thousands as you can see how can
one<00:03:56.840> side<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.380> that<00:03:57.530> be<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.220> far<00:03:58.640> off<00:04:01.660> that

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
one side of that be so far off that

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.040 
one side of that be so far off that
makes<00:04:02.870> absolutely<00:04:03.080> no<00:04:03.740> sense<00:04:03.920> just<00:04:04.990> so<00:04:05.990> you

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
makes absolutely no sense just so you

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.110 
makes absolutely no sense just so you
know<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.620> test<00:04:06.920> bar<00:04:07.250> which<00:04:07.550> is<00:04:07.580> precision

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
know the test bar which is precision

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.770 
know the test bar which is precision

yeah six point seven thousands off and

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:45.070 
yeah six point seven thousands off and
that's<00:04:30.680> just<00:04:30.950> crazy<00:04:33.670> at<00:04:34.670> that<00:04:34.940> top<00:04:35.240> down

somewhere<00:05:02.940> around<00:05:05.750> eight<00:05:06.750> point<00:05:07.199> five

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
somewhere around eight point five

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:16.490 
somewhere around eight point five
thousandths<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.970> any<00:05:15.180> rate<00:05:15.479> I've<00:05:16.020> already

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
thousandths and any rate I've already

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:28.040 
thousandths and any rate I've already
turned<00:05:16.889> a<00:05:17.449> test<00:05:18.449> bar<00:05:20.960> right<00:05:21.960> here<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:27.050> that

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
turned a test bar right here and that

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.860 
turned a test bar right here and that
shows<00:05:28.410> that<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:28.889> am<00:05:28.949> four<00:05:29.400> point<00:05:30.120> six<00:05:30.389> thousands

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
shows that I am four point six thousands

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.830 
shows that I am four point six thousands
I've<00:05:30.990> got<00:05:31.110> pictures<00:05:31.560> of<00:05:31.740> that<00:05:32.449> four<00:05:33.449> point<00:05:33.660> six
