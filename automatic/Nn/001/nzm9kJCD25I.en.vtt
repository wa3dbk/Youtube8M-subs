00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.660
 It has moved with Suwa Finally this day is doing 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.920
 came 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.129
 1004 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.959
 General affairs department logic mhf Yoshio 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.469
 Even a person who is not a total Sony Handycam camera blog 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.689
 It is for 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.929
 It looks like a cell phone 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.199
 Speaking of Sony is a memory stick 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.229
 You can also use sd cards and have a 360 degree panorama in the middle of the evening 

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:29.279
 Seek to the body 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.350
 Copy and charge of data is around usb terminal video 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.210
 Can lithium ion battery 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.040
 I'm from now but still 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.710
 I have trouble on either side 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.130
 Please take care of the direction this blog post sang up 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.090
 The reason for this is 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.090
 It was an opening ceremony lens 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.770
 Ideal for yourself 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.449
 Have a fun trip with the high loggy 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.250
 It is the first time to enjoy using the exhaust machine 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.570
 Well, the biggest topic is 360 there 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.320
 It should not have been for a long time, and I added this lens here 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.590
 Interesting though 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.120
 According to the collaboration, according to the cooperation, it will be developed on the PC at the bottom 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.120
 is not it 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.370
 Give 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.160
 The panorama section taken with is a problem on the 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.920
 Is provided by Sony, so 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.320
 Convert 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.320
 Slender that exceeds the video across the Sawabe River 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.890
 It's really a panoramic video, but 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.039
 This is essentially a 360 video player 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.750
 Select 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.229
 I should be able to make a brigri 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.540
 this 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.170
 It did not work well even in the virtual environment of macbook 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.390
 Sonin of the previous card wants to pack former Kokugojima, but also 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.530
 By all means around that software 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.130
 I hate to want to get old and there is almost no since October 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.080
 Aren't you a user? 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.719
 I really like it 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.119
 So it's also easy to make yourself alone 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:17.969
 I just want a wide-angle lens 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.640
 This is for the development of 8 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.170
 There is a microphone here and if you become yourself Ura Tsutomu Yoon 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.209
 That's right, Mike 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.209
 So only the lens will turn black 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.399
 I really watched while talking while taking a picture 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.799
 It's probably light and more compact than i guess. 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:35.729
 Even compare 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.490
 Than 7 days iphone 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.339
 Private houses in this pocket were spreading 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.609
 It's another match of mylohas 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:44.680
 British 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.680
 Just because you have put out high gasoline too 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.699
 I wonder if it's a bit different in the world 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:54.399
 I have a feeling that Sony is 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:55.389
 Brazil was
