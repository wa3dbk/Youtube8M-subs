00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.980
 so viable you mean financially 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.330
 I do not know anything about it at least 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.420
 operations 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.899
 it's extraordinary 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.030
 we always said that a bath beechcraft 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.650
 Baron it was a rolls it's really 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.750
 a rolls then with avionics 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.369
 it's easy enough to handle more than before 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.250
 because it's still an airplane 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.619
 so it means that with the help 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.229
 systems are we are painters we see 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.090
 what happens we can anticipate the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.460
 descents because otherwise we are quickly in 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.229
 overspeed there is no hero will do so 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.430
 that's why you all 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.780
 approaches we did them as soon as we got 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.479
 started going down we really reduced 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.920
 print admission to 18 inches 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.450
 it reduces a bit the speed we can 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.039
 attack a descent at a speed 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.860
 reasonable or who is still in 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.229
 find a lode and we still have not 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:48.500
 far from 200 of what so it's a plane 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:51.319
 who are riding reminds the destination and 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.289
 in addition to anticipating a long time 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:57.319
 at the advanced descent allows to 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.700
 to avoid thermal shock for me 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.740
 the twin engine still has security 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.840
 that is, we are above Paris 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.659
 in the clouds there we had a plane 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 totally defrost two motors ago 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.369
 kill kill kill very relaxed while 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.590
 it's true that I do a lot of 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.290
 single-engine defrost I can not 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.540
 stop me from thinking when I fly over 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.159
 a bright pale 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.500
 it's crappy what while there 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.930
 feels good we feel very safe what 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.769
 I did beach I did a lot of 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.599
 baron at one time I never found 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.340
 that it was a very very complicated plane 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.170
 but maybe at the time I was 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.540
 younger 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.720
 so much brilliance of course all these 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.040
 systems the g1000 mostly made that I 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.510
 felt it was very easy 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.370
 but I'll tell you all this good 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.689
 there in the street is not worried there 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.180
 will have all look 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:52.040
 I took so many notes a guard 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.909
 I played this is nothing the bowl 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.909
 so here I have to tell
