00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
expect I will give it a five right in

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.470 
expect I will give it a five right in
the<00:04:55.860> middle<00:04:56.040> with<00:04:56.340> one<00:04:56.370> being<00:04:56.880> very<00:04:57.210> mellow

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
the middle with one being very mellow

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.110 
the middle with one being very mellow
and<00:04:57.870> 10<00:04:58.140> being<00:04:58.320> very<00:04:58.470> bright<00:04:58.980> five<00:04:59.730> is<00:04:59.880> right

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
and 10 being very bright five is right

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.240 
and 10 being very bright five is right
in<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.270> middle<00:05:00.480> it's<00:05:01.200> not<00:05:01.350> too<00:05:01.680> bright<00:05:01.950> or<00:05:02.220> too

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
in the middle it's not too bright or too

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.670 
in the middle it's not too bright or too
mellow<00:05:02.700> it's<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.300> clear<00:05:03.630> sound<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.200> think<00:05:04.470> but

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
mellow it's a clear sound I think but

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.850 
mellow it's a clear sound I think but
it's<00:05:04.800> still<00:05:05.070> very<00:05:05.280> warm<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.820> woody<00:05:06.150> sound<00:05:06.860> so

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
it's still very warm and woody sound so

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.060 
it's still very warm and woody sound so
it<00:05:08.010> was<00:05:08.160> known<00:05:08.340> for<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:10.350> touch<00:05:10.530> I<00:05:10.770> didn't

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
it was known for the touch I didn't

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.880 
it was known for the touch I didn't
really<00:05:11.190> notice<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.730> touch<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.780> weather<00:05:13.650> the

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
really notice to touch the weather the

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.100 
really notice to touch the weather the
keys<00:05:14.340> had<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.610> lot<00:05:14.850> of<00:05:14.880> resistance<00:05:15.390> or<00:05:15.750> not<00:05:15.900> much

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
keys had a lot of resistance or not much

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.370 
keys had a lot of resistance or not much
resistance<00:05:16.470> I<00:05:17.419> would<00:05:18.419> give<00:05:18.540> it<00:05:18.660> a<00:05:18.720> five<00:05:18.960> then

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
resistance I would give it a five then

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.150 
resistance I would give it a five then
mainly<00:05:21.110> because<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.380> didn't<00:05:22.620> notice<00:05:22.740> if<00:05:22.980> five

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
mainly because I didn't notice if five
