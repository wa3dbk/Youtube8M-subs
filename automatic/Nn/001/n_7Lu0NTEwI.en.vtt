 in the place they were wounded they had been stolen 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.660
 in the M 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.660
 the the new vial 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.960

 rebellion in libya 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.870
 remember 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
 but nevertheless 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.329
 of the serna 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.849
 warning 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:35.679
 win 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:39.529
 the nerve arose 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.779
 besides the young 9 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.429
 the newspaper the universal 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.139
 from quilÃ­n 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.139
 none has picked the sword key 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.119
 I have to know 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:06.119
 can not betray the organization 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.759
 that organization of 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.759
 it's not good, good or bad 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.529
 greeting with your last five years of content 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.650
 for this purpose 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.050
 bush all these names 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.050
 what 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:40.779
 the inti 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.779
 st 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:44.629
 I believe that 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:47.629
 is asking the question you really want to ask 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.590
 what will happen now 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.809
 tell me at least that 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:57.180
 everything else no longer matters 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.180
 everyone 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.539
 yes 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.309
 I mean the power to change by style 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:12.749
 although I did not change it 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:14.349
 if they know 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.409
 I have the right to know 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.409
 one incorporated the right foot to know 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.080
 he does not even have rights 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.080
 but I think it's unique and for that reason 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:28.849
 the 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.849
 but let's be honest 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:38.069
 the neighbors we go home safe and sound 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.259
 They discovered it 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.120
 winter activists 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.080
 beautiful 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.180
 missing 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.620
 allowed it and the tone outputs 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.510

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.610
 4 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.520
 what more harm 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.249
 the chain survey 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:06.210
 then you have that attack was 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.999
 with all these pieces 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:10.169
 one can see the agents 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.169
 the real economy
