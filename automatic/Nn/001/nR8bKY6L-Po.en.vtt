00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hello, I'm Professor Jorge Borges and today. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.529
 I would like to talk to you about the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.450
 process of initiating training 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.230
 nervous system known as neuro 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.269
 lation 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.230
 this process occurs not only the embryo 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:21.930
 do train here we have team model 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:26.010
 symbiam is demonstrating we have the court here 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.740
 the region of the year that has been 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.439
 internal cover is the biotic empire 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.710
 indicated in blue but the outer blanket 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.550
 It is with fear that this millionaire leaflet 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.460
 which is indicated in February 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.190
 we have here the embryonic disc that is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.410
 now in the preliminary phase in which we can 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.500
 see your upper region 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.140
 this upper region is formed by the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.170
 eton derma of the coating indicated in 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.730
 white and black is that the term is the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.550
 neural indicated in gray that my hector 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.280
 it is a differentiation of the ectoderm of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.930
 coating due to the activity 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.080
 and Dr. cola note 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.760
 Let's now watch what I 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.650
 I just told you guys have a 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.409
 a little more complete model 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.500
 in this model the same information 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.110
 that you said before or that is presence 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.880
 of the same theme and remember leonardo hoja 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.360
 that is indicated to lose 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.700
 every embryo reverted to its expansion in 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.189
 application form the request 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.689
 technician here in the caudal region of 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.850
 embryo to the reinvestment of the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.970
 technological quality indicated in blue 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.579
 using my blasts the presence of the disk 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.490
 embryonic here in the foreground in 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.250
 your trio shape dominate here we can 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.549
 see the blank presence of the ectoderm of 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.250
 fabric covering from the top of the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.969
 lion at this time we can still see the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.479
 presence here of the primitive line having the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:07.079
 the primitive juice and the presence of the noble 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.850
 nal'll get it you're allowed 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.910
 cavity 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.819
 I can always see here too 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.780
 the note reminds the support shaft 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.239
 of the airplane and one with a stick that have a 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.760
 reason for having been deep 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.190
 importance with an induction 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.110
 changes and other structures 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.310
 one of the cultures that is induced by 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.250
 presence is to give notes either a god is 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.720
 also indicated in gray still in the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.130
 plate shape europe 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.090
 just to remind you of your retirement this 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.470
 region 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.130
 I can see the presence of it here 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.540
 between the billionaire indicated in 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.680
 red and below it the presence of 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.480
 eternal here is indicated in blue 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.900
 replace the old and population that 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.569
 Do you know that I reflected 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.290
 previously the quality of the bag 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:13.700
 to imagine that they were now 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.970
 removing a slice at a level to this 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.810
 embryonic exchange rate for the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:25.040
 observe the process of transformation of 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.739
 ectoderm in my der is going to remove 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.829
 and observe this 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.390
 from this slice that in this model the 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.670
 whereas initially 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.730
 initially we have with the enbrel to train 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.560
 mine being formed by ipn the plastic 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.500
 which will then be replaced by 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.380
 then flashlight among millionaires 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.980
 indicated in yellow and red we have 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:53.780
 the same of her enter the area and blank 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.760
 we have the Eton it in the middle of the month 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.450
 land among the millionaire we have this 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.450
 cloth stick that is our word 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.350
 as you can see here right? 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.190
 what we observed we observed that 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:15.739
 due to the action of the forest, wake up 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:21.010
 occurs in the process of transformation 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:24.220
 the eton derma is going to differentiate 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.450
 in higher cells indicated herein 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.780
 in gray 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.720
 these higher cells go to the people 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.880
 called my ectoderm or ectoderm 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.810
 neural beginning of system formation 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.940
 nervousness with them are higher in the 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.490
 formation of the nervous system and 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.000
 we say that it is in the form of plaque 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.240
 neural and to differentiate the 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.150
 remainder of the ectoderm that is problem 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.670
 the remainder to be called ectoderma 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.670
 coating is what will give rise to 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:01.950
 for example the epidermis of our foot 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:08.380
 some time later we began to observe 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:11.650
 an invade in these cells in these 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.290
 cells of my her grandson 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.970
 they start charging that the 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:22.360
 People call it super legal arise part 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.120
 and a doctorate from the advancement of these 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.360
 euro cells could toward the 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.950
 of the new law present in some 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.410
 publications you will see that these or 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.170
 when it becomes very deep it is 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.190
 called by the authors of the 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.860
 neural 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:46.000
 but it's the same thing all right the south 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.890
 deep or pull it out and demonstrate to 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.010
 You do what happens after some 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:57.010
 time after some time the one that 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:01.150
 imagination will progress to form screen 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:04.060
 a tube that is the famous tube known 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.720
 neural this tunnel occurred because of 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:10.650
 implementation of the neural plaque that formed 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.070
 the cool punch and now in the form of tube 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.440
 fully placed within it 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.560
 the derma between branagh 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:24.280
 so what we have at the moment 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.530
 we have below in the theme and in 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.430
 her popularity entered the area and 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.690
 population 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:35.100
 here in the middle of the drama between branagh 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:39.340
 being pierced by 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:42.100
 by the note here snake above we will have 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.230
 gray region tube 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:50.950
 neural and above it 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:54.669
 the poet of her personal right coating 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:57.700
 after this description I hope that you 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.010
 to be able to clearly describe the 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:04.210
 processes that lead to initial training 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:06.430
 the nervous system as it welinton 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:10.870
 is transformed into an ectoderm of 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:13.840
 how is this problem? 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.000
 coat will form my grandson's 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.820
 as a neuroprotective derma 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.970
 transform and neural plaque later on 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.860
 natural juice and after neural tube has 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:28.470
 that it is also clear to you the 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.470
 importance of the chord note in this process
