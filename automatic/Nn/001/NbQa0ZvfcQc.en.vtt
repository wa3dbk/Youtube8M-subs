00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.959 

so<00:00:09.469> you<00:00:09.590> have<00:00:09.860> one<00:00:10.040> of<00:00:10.130> these<00:00:10.250> a<00:00:10.580> sandwich

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
so you have one of these a sandwich

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.240 
so you have one of these a sandwich
toaster<00:00:11.629> do<00:00:12.080> you<00:00:12.170> hate<00:00:12.440> using<00:00:12.799> it<00:00:13.070> so

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
toaster do you hate using it so

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.100 
toaster do you hate using it so
therefore<00:00:13.670> after<00:00:13.850> a<00:00:14.000> few<00:00:14.240> weeks<00:00:14.420> stop<00:00:14.809> using

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
therefore after a few weeks stop using

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.570 
therefore after a few weeks stop using
it<00:00:15.849> then<00:00:16.849> maybe<00:00:17.060> this<00:00:17.330> idea<00:00:17.779> will<00:00:18.230> work<00:00:18.520> do<00:00:19.520> you

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
it then maybe this idea will work do you

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.249 
it then maybe this idea will work do you
