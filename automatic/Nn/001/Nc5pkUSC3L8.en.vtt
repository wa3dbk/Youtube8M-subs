Jason pierre-paul 3-star my opinion this
really<00:00:22.350> isn't<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.740> good<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.100> card<00:00:23.340> 94

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
really isn't that good of a card 94

really isn't that good of a card 94

pass-rushing<00:00:31.230> abilities<00:00:31.920> are<00:00:32.099> really<00:00:32.430> good

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
pass-rushing abilities are really good

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.750 
pass-rushing abilities are really good
but<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.540> speed<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.590> great<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.100> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
but the speed is not that great and I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.549 
but the speed is not that great and I
mean<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:36.270> boost<00:00:36.540> he'll<00:00:37.079> probably<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.440> really

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
mean with boost he'll probably be really

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.650 
mean with boost he'll probably be really
good<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.760> still<00:00:38.940> got<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> other<00:00:39.270> cards

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
good but you still got the other cards

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.290 
good but you still got the other cards
that<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.440> usually<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.460> Freeney

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that you usually have like the Freeney

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.049 
that you usually have like the Freeney
the<00:00:42.960> Deacon<00:00:43.530> Jones<00:00:43.739> things<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.910> that

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the Deacon Jones things like that that

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.790 
the Deacon Jones things like that that
are<00:00:45.120> way<00:00:45.239> better<00:00:45.390> than<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.750> card<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.289> he

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
are way better than this card so he

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.979 
are way better than this card so he
probably<00:00:47.309> will<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> lot<00:00:48.300> just

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
probably will be going for a lot just

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.830 
probably will be going for a lot just
because<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.500> actual<00:00:50.510> cards<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.750> in
