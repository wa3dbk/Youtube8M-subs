00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.959
 Hello I am through my injury and stress 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.849
 and now I want to talk about the ban 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.880
 how many people wrote to me 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.529
 no problem 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.679
 and Tuna a against also super what should I do or at the bunch Cellzome neighbors 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.300
 What can I do there? 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.869
 among cats 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.890
 is actually quite easy to solve if you ban the commander that 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.640
 means this is not a command 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.060
 Can you enjoy that dog Harnik knows that that leaves otherwise 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.640
 had many things 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 this ban you can also divide so many areas you can, of course 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.280
 for these areas also use different commands for 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.260
 Example how to make 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.270
 says Machnig 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.200
 No, but drove 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.080
 should someday jump in should I no 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.930
 while under 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.459
 and when the colorful is on the bed 

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:04.700
 and when I said a soldier Kraus instead of no 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.720
 and at all here they actually tend to be pretty if 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.770
 bad command 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.530
 for this prohibition command because one actually sounds 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.670
 with us 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.880
 At the time, from the point of view of the federal government, it was funny 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 and for the good it is difficult to recognize 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.960
 that that is not flattening 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.430
 and should be a strict commander and that's something that has already been formulated 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.130
 NBA Lyon 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.640
 and where is that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.159
 or you use the same class dar 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.310
 that I was there 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.750
 what the Politk End of the founders 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.570
 certainly a reason, too 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.750
 Sunday exactly the same thing is Heather 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.920
 or there is one 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.430
 this command 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.110
 teaching such a covenant master the pattern if he masters it 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170
 then you would appeal to him 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.740
 because she is for the 7th 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.430
 Djokic go out to see Cribari 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.070
 Evotec has misplaced leads from Bad Banks 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.020
 she betrayed her and another tip for the ISE not her first 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.670
 at the cat already in the earth 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.769
 that's how Kazan Kurth can do it again 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.169
 then you can ban their request 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.870
 that proves Arndt the cat should let over รถ 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.259
 otherwise there is at the cash register 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.060
 how the whole works exactly 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.030
 Standard is still unclear ddp and education and stress point 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.780
 the lease
