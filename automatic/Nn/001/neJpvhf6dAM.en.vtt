00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.859
 May 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.859
 I laugh flat stories 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.400
 today 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.189
 Nuclear power plants 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.839
 King height 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:25.800
 that was 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 Wolfgang Gillmann table 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.750
 the goal is there Wolfgang 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.700
 the on former times Zuber Minister in the spd government the the exit from 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.410
 of nuclear energy 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.400
 then he got a great job with an energy company 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.790
 and they explained to him that nuclear power plants are very proud 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.000
 and so here too all the tables 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.670
 the wolf can then have explained that in the paper and warned against it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.470
 Hesse to vote for the SPD 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.000
 but the SPD still has not understood this to be true at the city entrance 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.810
 wanted the IIHF 4 there 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.810
 and that's why we will do it again 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.909
 Nuclear power is not only co2-free but also occupied 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.950
 and that has a simple reason 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.950
 All other power wanted to be insured 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.920
 when, for example, a start-up takes place in a hydroelectric power plant 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.730
 then the insurance has to pay the damage 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.530
 Nuclear power people are much more practical 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.530
 you can not guarantee that 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.940
 sounds weird but that's the way it is 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.970
 An insurance would be so expensive that the nuclear power three times an hour 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.750
 and that would be toth to decide how to do it in Chernobyl 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.940
 you do not pay any insurance anyway 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.260
 Of course, this has also been seen by the legislature and that is why 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.290
 Nuclear power plants the only force people you did not have what you had 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.030
 So the energy companies save a lot of money because of the program the year 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.460
 to pay for the clouds 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.390
 Ulrich electricity bills and Artur not cheaper 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.450
 but you can still save, for example, by car 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.470
 Just suffer Hatto per track and 8 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.840
 but only every ten years the print alternately 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.019
 and the car insurance Save you too 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.680
 because if you can not happen the car so Brockmanns not so
