camera<00:01:09.479> issue<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.140> means<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
camera issue what that means is the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.639

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the only way you could fix that would be

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.139 
the only way you could fix that would be
