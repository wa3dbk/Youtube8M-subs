00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.420
 lose weight later came across scientific 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.579
 studies on the alleged adverse effects 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.860
 meat products per person now 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.600
 fragrant cutlets and steaks and not at all

 prefers to eat more nuts and 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.559
 legumes animals then they grow and 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.809
 adds all kinds of growth hormone 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.600
 tranquilizers 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.309
 also hormones and naturally these substances 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.610
 do not decompose during heat treatment 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.680
 and they come to us as well as when 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.010
 hormones are killed by animals 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.860
 adrenaline cortisol and they also come 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.770
 to our body for this frequent stress 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.720
 hormonal failure such a healthy step 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.340
 way of life seems incomprehensible sophia 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.970
 Bulatova and for pupils marina

 for seven years the girl is confident 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.670
 lose weight give up meat completely and 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.159
 means losing muscle tone to line up 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.670
 beautiful and relief body without proteins and 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.170
 amino acids meat is almost impossible 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.659
 athletes need to consume a certain 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.780
 amount of protein and it depends first 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.630
 queue on how much he does 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.270
 what is his weight and what results does he have 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.909
 wants to achieve because protein is first 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.720
 queue helps to develop 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.280
 structured muscle fibers 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.259
 which our body builds is beautiful more 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.180
 proteins from carbohydrates and a minimum of fat 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.369
 athlete shares a slim recipe 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.930
 pieces of meat are advised to choose lean 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.879
 beef and fat birds 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.430
 that balanced nutrition is 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.319
 all but meat, they agree and nutritionists 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.569
 replace animal protein grow 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.340
 we think they can not amino acids from 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.719
 meat and not at all replace the consequences 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.780
 vegetarian diet 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.489
 especially dangerous for children are probably these 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.280
 people who treat their children like that 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.379
 believe that the child is a mini version 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.209
 grown man so treat in 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.430
 children can not lead it to the risk of development 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.639
 diseases such as anemia to development 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.739
 growth retardation in the development of body weight 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.930
 even immune precisely deficient 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.340
 states and mobility of the child to 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.620
 infectious diseases 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.389
 so the parents take on very 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.900
 greater responsibility limiting 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.099
 baby is such a protein product 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.049
 most recently scientists from harvard 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.629
 proved failure to use animals 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.849
 products can extend life up to 20 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.620
 years with such studies do not agree 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.840
 domestic scientists considering rejecting 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.090
 meat is only a fashionable vein of strict 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.340
 vegetarians or vegans are becoming 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.620
 more youth violation 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.829
 Reproductive function consider nutritionists 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.480
 one of the main disadvantages of such power 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.500
