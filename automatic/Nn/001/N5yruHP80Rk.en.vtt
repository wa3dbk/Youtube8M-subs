Sarah<00:01:46.710> waters<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.220> fairly<00:01:47.430> prolific<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
Sarah waters is fairly prolific and I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.539 
Sarah waters is fairly prolific and I
think<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.689> they<00:01:48.810> had<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.500> her<00:01:50.130> books<00:01:50.310> but

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
think that they had all of her books but

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.010 
think that they had all of her books but
I<00:01:50.610> ended<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.119> with<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.869> because

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
I ended up going with this one because

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.289 
I ended up going with this one because
this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.430> people<00:01:53.610> usually<00:01:53.880> pick

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
this is the one that people usually pick
