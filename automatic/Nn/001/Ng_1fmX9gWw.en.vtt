monitors and now what I mean by that is
a<00:00:17.810> lot<00:00:17.960> of<00:00:18.080> times<00:00:18.230> people<00:00:18.410> call<00:00:18.710> up<00:00:18.890> and<00:00:19.070> they

why<00:00:33.559> you<00:00:33.620> need<00:00:33.920> a<00:00:33.950> reference<00:00:34.250> monitor<00:00:34.940> our

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
why you need a reference monitor our

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.540 
why you need a reference monitor our
true<00:00:35.360> reference<00:00:35.809> monitor<00:00:36.050> is<00:00:36.440> if<00:00:37.399> you're

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
true reference monitor is if you're

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.549 
true reference monitor is if you're
going<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:37.730> be<00:00:37.820> recording<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:39.019> doing<00:00:39.410> a

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
going to be recording and doing a

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.770 
going to be recording and doing a
beginning<00:00:40.100> CD<00:00:40.579> or<00:00:40.670> something<00:00:40.730> like<00:00:41.120> that<00:00:41.329> you

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
beginning CD or something like that you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.709 
beginning CD or something like that you
really<00:00:41.809> want<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.670> get<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.850> full<00:00:44.120> spectrum<00:00:44.300> of

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
really want to get the full spectrum of

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:45.970 
really want to get the full spectrum of
sound<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.289> you<00:00:45.350> want<00:00:45.499> everything<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.829> be

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
sound and you want everything to be

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.069 
sound and you want everything to be
really<00:00:46.160> true<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.120> mix<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.719> what<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:47.899> mean

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
really true to the mix and what I mean

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.479 
really true to the mix and what I mean
by<00:00:48.140> that<00:00:48.289> is<00:00:48.649> if<00:00:48.800> you're<00:00:49.219> putting<00:00:49.460> a

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
by that is if you're putting a

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.160 
by that is if you're putting a
microphone<00:00:49.670> in<00:00:50.120> front<00:00:50.149> of<00:00:50.420> a<00:00:50.480> guitar<00:00:50.780> in<00:00:50.989> for

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
microphone in front of a guitar in for

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.899 
microphone in front of a guitar in for
instance<00:00:51.499> and<00:00:51.920> you're<00:00:52.010> making<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.579> guitar

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
instance and you're making that guitar

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.299 
instance and you're making that guitar
you<00:00:53.329> want<00:00:53.539> to<00:00:53.629> represent<00:00:53.870> that<00:00:54.409> sound<00:00:54.949> of<00:00:55.159> that

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
you want to represent that sound of that

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.849 
you want to represent that sound of that
guitar<00:00:55.460> amp<00:00:55.909> is<00:00:56.120> exactly<00:00:56.600> as<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:56.839> can<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.350> if

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
guitar amp is exactly as you can and if

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.619 
guitar amp is exactly as you can and if
you're<00:00:58.010> putting<00:00:58.609> your<00:00:58.699> mic<00:00:58.879> on<00:00:59.059> there<00:00:59.300> you<00:00:59.480> run

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
you're putting your mic on there you run

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.930 
you're putting your mic on there you run
it<00:00:59.749> through<00:00:59.780> your<00:00:59.989> mixer<00:01:00.409> you<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:01.280> know<00:01:01.370> EQ<00:01:01.850> it

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
it through your mixer you you know EQ it

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.489 
it through your mixer you you know EQ it
a<00:01:01.999> little<00:01:02.149> bit<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.539> do<00:01:02.629> some<00:01:02.659> things<00:01:03.050> you're

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:03.499 
a little bit and do some things you're

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.460 
a little bit and do some things you're
altering<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.070> sound<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.640> little<00:01:04.879> bit<00:01:05.180> but<00:01:05.810> if

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
altering the sound a little bit but if

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.560 
altering the sound a little bit but if
you<00:01:06.740> have<00:01:07.010> a<00:01:07.040> speaker<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:08.030> can<00:01:08.270> really

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
you have a speaker that can really

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.140 
you have a speaker that can really
reproduce<00:01:09.200> all<00:01:09.710> those<00:01:09.890> frequencies<00:01:10.580> clearly

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
reproduce all those frequencies clearly

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
reproduce all those frequencies clearly
and<00:01:11.680> very<00:01:12.680> precisely<00:01:13.520> then<00:01:14.330> you're<00:01:14.990> going<00:01:15.080> to

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
and very precisely then you're going to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.350 
and very precisely then you're going to
get<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.440> truest<00:01:16.120> representation<00:01:17.120> of<00:01:17.240> that

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
get the truest representation of that

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.450 
get the truest representation of that
original<00:01:17.600> sound<00:01:18.110> source<00:01:18.440> on<00:01:18.740> your<00:01:18.800> recording

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
original sound source on your recording

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.700 
original sound source on your recording
whereas<00:01:20.300> if<00:01:20.570> you're<00:01:20.720> using<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:21.110> smaller<00:01:21.410> pair

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
whereas if you're using a smaller pair

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.070 
whereas if you're using a smaller pair
of<00:01:21.740> speakers<00:01:22.040> or<00:01:22.550> inexpensive<00:01:23.180> speakers<00:01:23.840> are

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
of speakers or inexpensive speakers are

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.530 
of speakers or inexpensive speakers are
like<00:01:24.200> regular<00:01:24.410> little<00:01:25.120> monitor<00:01:26.120> speakers

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
like regular little monitor speakers

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.260 
like regular little monitor speakers
that<00:01:26.720> he<00:01:26.810> would<00:01:26.960> use<00:01:27.140> for<00:01:27.470> a<00:01:27.700> computer<00:01:28.700> you're

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
that he would use for a computer you're

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.490 
that he would use for a computer you're
not<00:01:29.450> really<00:01:29.660> going<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:29.990> get<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.290> full

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
not really going to get the full

engineered<00:01:32.360> made<00:01:32.690> it<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.870> way<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.050> really

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
engineered made it a way to really

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.800 
engineered made it a way to really
reproduce<00:01:33.920> all<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.550> frequencies<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.630> once

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
reproduce all the frequencies and once

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.110 
reproduce all the frequencies and once
you<00:01:35.930> start<00:01:36.230> to<00:01:36.440> stack<00:01:37.040> certain<00:01:37.490> things<00:01:37.730> on<00:01:37.880> top

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
you start to stack certain things on top

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.400 
you start to stack certain things on top
of<00:01:38.180> each<00:01:38.330> other<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:38.600> have<00:01:38.720> multiple<00:01:39.230> layers

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
of each other you have multiple layers

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.410 
of each other you have multiple layers
of<00:01:39.530> guitars<00:01:40.010> layers<00:01:40.400> of<00:01:40.670> vocals<00:01:41.120> you<00:01:41.210> have

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
of guitars layers of vocals you have

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.110 
of guitars layers of vocals you have
drums<00:01:41.780> yeah<00:01:42.530> in<00:01:42.740> some<00:01:42.860> keyboards<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:43.790> put<00:01:44.000> in

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
drums yeah in some keyboards you put in

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
function functions and features we'll

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.570

talk<00:02:19.500> over<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.799> little<00:02:19.980> bit

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
talk over a little bit

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.940 
talk over a little bit
these<00:02:21.150> are<00:02:21.450> magnetically<00:02:22.260> shielded<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.860> you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
these are magnetically shielded so you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.830 
these are magnetically shielded so you
can<00:02:23.129> put<00:02:23.310> them<00:02:23.400> next<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.730> your<00:02:23.940> computer<00:02:24.090> and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
can put them next to your computer and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.390 
can put them next to your computer and

next to your computer monitor and not

next to your computer monitor and not
worry<00:02:26.610> about<00:02:26.879> messing<00:02:27.090> up<00:02:27.299> your<00:02:27.420> monitor<00:02:27.799> some

worry about messing up your monitor some
other<00:02:29.280> speakers<00:02:29.760> like<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:29.970> mentioned<00:02:30.420> when<00:02:30.540> you

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
other speakers like I mentioned when you

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.940 
other speakers like I mentioned when you
put<00:02:30.780> them<00:02:30.870> next<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> monetary<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.799> get

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
put them next to a monetary to get

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.740 
put them next to a monetary to get
little<00:02:32.190> crazy<00:02:32.430> waves<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.060> your<00:02:33.180> monitor<00:02:33.510> and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
little crazy waves and your monitor and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.270 
little crazy waves and your monitor and
things<00:02:33.870> like<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.049> because<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.620> magnet<00:02:35.069> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
things like that because the magnet and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.490 
things like that because the magnet and
the<00:02:35.400> speaker<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.299> interfering<00:02:37.290> with<00:02:37.410> your

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the speaker is interfering with your

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.229 
the speaker is interfering with your
monitor<00:02:38.040> these<00:02:38.370> are<00:02:38.549> magnetically<00:02:39.209> shielded

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
monitor these are magnetically shielded

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.030 
monitor these are magnetically shielded
so<00:02:39.780> they<00:02:39.870> don't<00:02:40.079> do<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.739> can<00:02:40.890> put

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
so they don't do that so you can put

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.229 
so they don't do that so you can put
them<00:02:41.130> right<00:02:41.220> next<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.549> your<00:02:41.700> monitor<00:02:42.030> you're

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
them right next to your monitor you're

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.620 
them right next to your monitor you're
not<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.630> any<00:02:42.870> issues<00:02:43.099> also<00:02:44.099> these<00:02:44.549> you<00:02:45.540> know

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
not have any issues also these you know

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.059 
not have any issues also these you know
have<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> couple<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.260> different<00:02:46.560> features<00:02:46.709> and

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
have a couple of different features and

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.650 
have a couple of different features and
functions<00:02:47.459> they've<00:02:47.579> got<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> low-pass<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.599> a

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
functions they've got a low-pass and a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.370 
functions they've got a low-pass and a
high-pass<00:02:50.420> switch<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.690> backbone<00:02:52.079> so<00:02:52.290> you

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
high-pass switch on the backbone so you

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.589 
high-pass switch on the backbone so you
can<00:02:52.500> kind<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.890> set<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.400> high-pass<00:02:54.060> filtering

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
can kind of set the high-pass filtering

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.270 
can kind of set the high-pass filtering
the<00:02:54.840> low-pass<00:02:55.170> filtering<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.920> couple<00:02:56.220> of

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the low-pass filtering to a couple of

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.640 
the low-pass filtering to a couple of
different<00:02:56.610> settings<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.120> I've<00:02:58.110> got<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.410> couple

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
different settings and I've got a couple

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.259 
different settings and I've got a couple
of<00:02:58.799> different<00:02:59.099> inputs<00:02:59.519> on<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.819> back<00:03:00.000> you're

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
of different inputs on the back you're

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.869

don't generally like to do audio live on
a<00:03:20.190> video<00:03:20.459> because<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.030> really<00:03:21.269> can't<00:03:21.510> tell

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
a video because you really can't tell

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.390 
a video because you really can't tell
with<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.049> little<00:03:22.290> camcorder<00:03:22.500> mic<00:03:23.069> that<00:03:23.250> we're

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
with the little camcorder mic that we're

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.099 
with the little camcorder mic that we're
using<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.790> we're<00:03:24.000> use<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.269> small<00:03:24.510> camcorder<00:03:25.079> or

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
using and we're use a small camcorder or

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.259 
using and we're use a small camcorder or
the<00:03:25.260> tiny<00:03:25.620> little<00:03:25.889> microphone<00:03:26.400> on<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:27.150> it

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
the tiny little microphone on it and it

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.150 
the tiny little microphone on it and it
really<00:03:27.299> can't<00:03:27.840> pick<00:03:28.109> up<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.410> sound<00:03:28.650> quality

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
really can't pick up the sound quality

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.490 
really can't pick up the sound quality
quite<00:03:29.370> like<00:03:29.639> like<00:03:30.569> I'd<00:03:30.750> like<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.260> but<00:03:31.440> I

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
quite like like I'd like it to but I

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.629 
quite like like I'd like it to but I
think<00:03:31.829> you're<00:03:31.950> going<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.130> get<00:03:32.220> enough<00:03:32.430> clarity

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
think you're going to get enough clarity

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.879 
think you're going to get enough clarity
on<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.090> video<00:03:33.389> with<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.049> speaker<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.650> really

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
on the video with the speaker to really

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.979 
on the video with the speaker to really
kind<00:03:35.099> of<00:03:35.130> get<00:03:35.250> an<00:03:35.370> idea<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:36.030> what<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.329> does<00:03:36.510> but

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
kind of get an idea of what it does but

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.819 
kind of get an idea of what it does but
very<00:03:37.290> clear<00:03:37.650> very<00:03:38.220> precise<00:03:38.780> audio

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
very clear very precise audio

00:03:39.829 --> 00:04:07.339 
very clear very precise audio
representation<00:03:40.829> here

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.690

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
you can really hear the clarity of the

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.370 
you can really hear the clarity of the
banks<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.209> drawings<00:04:10.690> there<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.140> think

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
banks the drawings there so I think

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.490 
banks the drawings there so I think
especially<00:04:11.739> going<00:04:12.370> on<00:04:12.489> in<00:04:12.640> their<00:04:12.790> bio<00:04:13.120> and

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
bottom now the porting really helps with

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.860 
bottom now the porting really helps with
projection<00:05:16.220> sound<00:05:16.520> projection<00:05:16.730> and<00:05:17.450> a<00:05:17.630> little

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
bit extra low end projection that type

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.200 
bit extra low end projection that type
of<00:05:19.760> thing

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
of thing

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.820

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
ventilated to keep these cool for the

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.650 
ventilated to keep these cool for the
hamp<00:05:27.560> inside<00:05:27.920> it<00:05:28.520> doesn't<00:05:28.880> overheat<00:05:29.210> on<00:05:29.480> you

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
you've got the RCA unbalanced input here

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.890 
you've got the RCA unbalanced input here
you<00:05:35.000> got<00:05:35.150> a<00:05:35.180> bounce

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
you got a bounce

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.980 
you got a bounce
TRS<00:05:36.440> quarter<00:05:37.340> inch<00:05:37.520> input<00:05:37.820> and<00:05:38.270> then<00:05:38.690> you<00:05:38.810> have

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
TRS quarter inch input and then you have

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.770 
TRS quarter inch input and then you have
a<00:05:39.020> balanced<00:05:39.680> XLR<00:05:40.100> input<00:05:40.760> as<00:05:40.880> well<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.660> then

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
a balanced XLR input as well and then

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.390 
a balanced XLR input as well and then
again<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.200> have<00:05:42.230> these<00:05:42.590> high<00:05:42.830> frequency

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
again you have these high frequency

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.090 
again you have these high frequency
filter<00:05:43.850> switches<00:05:44.780> here<00:05:45.050> and<00:05:45.290> they'll<00:05:45.500> see<00:05:45.860> the

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
filter switches here and they'll see the

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.500 
filter switches here and they'll see the
high<00:05:46.220> frequency<00:05:46.700> and<00:05:46.790> the<00:05:46.880> low<00:05:46.910> frequency

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
high frequency and the low frequency

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.810 
high frequency and the low frequency
filters<00:05:47.930> which<00:05:48.140> and<00:05:48.410> this<00:05:48.980> is<00:05:49.160> basically<00:05:49.550> so

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
filters which and this is basically so

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.310 
filters which and this is basically so
you<00:05:49.850> can<00:05:50.090> just<00:05:50.240> add<00:05:50.450> a<00:05:50.480> couple<00:05:50.780> of<00:05:50.990> different

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
you can just add a couple of different

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.440 
you can just add a couple of different
DBS<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:52.360> up<00:05:53.360> or<00:05:53.570> down<00:05:54.670> you<00:05:55.670> know<00:05:55.790> hi<00:05:56.000> fil<00:05:56.300> to

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
DBS of up or down you know hi fil to

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.690 
DBS of up or down you know hi fil to
frequencies<00:05:57.050> high<00:05:57.470> frequency<00:05:57.950> filtering<00:05:58.370> or

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
frequencies high frequency filtering or

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.850 
frequencies high frequency filtering or
low-pass<00:05:59.150> filtering<00:05:59.690> so<00:06:00.200> that's<00:06:00.560> kind<00:06:00.830> of

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
low-pass filtering so that's kind of

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.170 
low-pass filtering so that's kind of
what<00:06:00.980> that's<00:06:01.190> all<00:06:01.400> about<00:06:01.430> and<00:06:01.670> then<00:06:01.970> you<00:06:02.060> have

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
what that's all about and then you have

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.910 
what that's all about and then you have
your<00:06:02.330> input<00:06:02.510> level<00:06:03.050> here<00:06:03.290> so<00:06:03.620> you<00:06:03.680> have<00:06:03.770> a

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
your input level here so you have a

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.040 
your input level here so you have a
volume<00:06:04.250> control<00:06:04.430> for<00:06:05.030> how<00:06:05.270> much<00:06:05.480> level<00:06:05.900> is

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
volume control for how much level is

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.130 
volume control for how much level is
actually<00:06:06.410> being<00:06:06.820> inputted<00:06:07.820> to<00:06:08.570> the<00:06:08.750> speaker

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
actually being inputted to the speaker

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.430 
actually being inputted to the speaker
and<00:06:09.410> then<00:06:09.950> you<00:06:10.070> have<00:06:10.280> your<00:06:10.820> power<00:06:11.420> plug<00:06:12.200> that

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
and then you have your power plug that

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.410 
and then you have your power plug that
you<00:06:12.560> plug<00:06:12.770> right<00:06:12.950> into<00:06:13.160> your<00:06:13.310> power<00:06:13.790> cable<00:06:14.060> and

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
you plug right into your power cable and

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.630 
you plug right into your power cable and
then<00:06:14.540> your<00:06:14.690> on/off<00:06:14.930> switch<00:06:15.410> so<00:06:15.860> very<00:06:16.160> basic

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
then your on/off switch so very basic

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.550 
then your on/off switch so very basic
very<00:06:16.820> simple<00:06:17.330> you<00:06:17.900> just<00:06:18.110> come<00:06:18.260> out<00:06:18.290> of<00:06:18.410> your
