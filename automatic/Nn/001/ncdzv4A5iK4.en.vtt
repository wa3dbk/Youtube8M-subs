incredibly interesting is that the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280 
coverage and I think that just might be
a<00:01:38.520> little<00:01:38.670> bit<00:01:38.820> too<00:01:38.970> much<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.180> san<00:01:39.930> fran<00:01:40.200> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
a little bit too much for san fran to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
at two main keys for for me will

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.969 
at two main keys for for me will
determine<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.689> winner<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.229> game<00:01:58.290> one<00:01:58.860> at

being the home field advantage and two

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.999 
being the home field advantage and two
will<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.899> offensive<00:02:03.899> success<00:02:04.140> without<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
will be the offensive success without a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.920 
will be the offensive success without a
running<00:02:05.610> game<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.329> we'll<00:02:06.479> start<00:02:06.689> with<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
running game so we'll start with the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.930 
running game so we'll start with the
first<00:02:07.110> point<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.680> Ravens<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.220> won<00:02:08.429> all<00:02:08.670> five

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
of their home games this year by a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
of their home games this year by a
14-point<00:02:12.330> margin<00:02:12.810> 14

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
14-point margin 14

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.140 
14-point margin 14
point<00:02:13.560> zero<00:02:13.620> points<00:02:14.190> per<00:02:14.670> game<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
point zero points per game is the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.170 
point zero points per game is the
average<00:02:15.330> win<00:02:15.870> by<00:02:16.440> them<00:02:16.680> at<00:02:16.860> home<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.850> look<00:02:18.030> at

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
average win by them at home you look at

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.390 
average win by them at home you look at
the<00:02:18.300> San<00:02:18.600> Francisco<00:02:18.780> 49ers<00:02:19.140> their<00:02:19.920> average

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
the San Francisco 49ers their average

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.820 
the San Francisco 49ers their average
wins<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.090> road<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.900> five<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.800> half

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
wins on the road is five and a half

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.740 
wins on the road is five and a half
points<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:24.060> know<00:02:24.150> they've<00:02:24.330> really<00:02:24.600> had

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
points so you know they've really had

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.580 
points so you know they've really had
some<00:02:24.960> tough<00:02:25.640> hard<00:02:26.640> gritty<00:02:27.630> road<00:02:28.020> games<00:02:28.350> they

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
some tough hard gritty road games they

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.930 
some tough hard gritty road games they
haven't<00:02:28.890> played<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.460> haven't<00:02:29.700> been<00:02:29.760> as

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
haven't played and haven't been as

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.880 
haven't played and haven't been as
dominant<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.530> home-field

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
dominant so I see the home-field

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.330 
dominant so I see the home-field
advantage<00:02:32.370> being<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.700> key<00:02:32.990> secondly<00:02:34.100> this<00:02:35.100> is

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
advantage being a key secondly this is

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.640 
advantage being a key secondly this is
this<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.880> matchup<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.450> two<00:02:36.620> defenses<00:02:37.620> that

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
this is a matchup of two defenses that

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.400 
this is a matchup of two defenses that
are<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.010> top<00:02:38.220> five<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:39.140> rushing<00:02:40.140> rush

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
are in the top five of rushing rush

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.290 
are in the top five of rushing rush
defense<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.160> really<00:02:41.490> think<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.090> key

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
defense so I really think that the key

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.210 
defense so I really think that the key
to<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.600> game<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:43.140> going<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.380> be<00:02:43.440> who<00:02:44.010> can

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
to this game is going to be who can

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.940 
to this game is going to be who can
succeed<00:02:44.760> offensively<00:02:45.570> without<00:02:46.560> their

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
succeed offensively without their

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.280 
succeed offensively without their
running<00:02:47.250> game<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.670> Baltimore's<00:02:48.540> ground<00:02:48.990> game

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
running game and Baltimore's ground game

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.590 
running game and Baltimore's ground game
has<00:02:49.590> not<00:02:49.800> been<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.070> major<00:02:50.280> factor<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:51.120> season

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
has not been a major factor this season

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.300 
has not been a major factor this season
there's<00:02:52.020> somewhere<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.500> low<00:02:52.620> 20<00:02:53.040> San

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
there's somewhere in the low 20 San

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.610 
there's somewhere in the low 20 San
Francisco<00:02:53.880> they<00:02:54.090> need<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.810> ground<00:02:55.170> game<00:02:55.440> to

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
Francisco they need that ground game to

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.650 
Francisco they need that ground game to
succeed<00:02:56.040> their<00:02:56.340> number<00:02:56.640> five<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.210> NFL<00:02:57.540> in

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
succeed their number five in the NFL in

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.930 
succeed their number five in the NFL in
rushing<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.140> i<00:02:58.200> think<00:02:58.410> baltimore<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.520> san

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
rushing so i think baltimore and san

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.550 
rushing so i think baltimore and san
fran<00:03:00.270> won't<00:03:00.510> be<00:03:00.630> able<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.870> run<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.050> ball<00:03:01.170> but

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
fran won't be able to run the ball but

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.620 
fran won't be able to run the ball but
Baltimore<00:03:01.830> will<00:03:02.370> be<00:03:02.550> able<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.910> pass<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.420> ball

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
Baltimore will be able to pass the ball

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.930 
Baltimore will be able to pass the ball
and<00:03:03.930> that'll<00:03:04.290> be<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.410> difference<00:03:04.950> yeah<00:03:05.700> I'm

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
and that'll be the difference yeah I'm

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.340 
and that'll be the difference yeah I'm
thinking<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.300> might<00:03:06.450> be<00:03:06.630> my<00:03:06.750> favorite<00:03:06.930> play

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
thinking this might be my favorite play

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.790 
thinking this might be my favorite play
of<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.580> day
