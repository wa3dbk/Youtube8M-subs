kinds<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.750> batteries<00:00:47.149> funny<00:00:48.149> enough<00:00:48.390> three<00:00:48.690> of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
kinds of batteries funny enough three of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.400 
kinds of batteries funny enough three of
them<00:00:48.960> are<00:00:49.110> Sony<00:00:49.350> huh<00:00:50.690> but<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.750> most<00:00:51.899> important

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
defect or 32k color temperature and the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.350 
defect or 32k color temperature and the
reason<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.810> picked<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.290> was<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:11.240> few<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.299> you

in you know it's just a bunch of little

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.590 
in you know it's just a bunch of little
LED<00:02:14.100> Bowl<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.460> nothing<00:02:14.760> nothing<00:02:15.000> super

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
LED Bowl it's nothing nothing super

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.400 
LED Bowl it's nothing nothing super
crazy<00:02:15.840> here<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:16.980> should<00:02:17.160> be<00:02:17.220> enough<00:02:18.410> to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
crazy here but it should be enough to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.050 
crazy here but it should be enough to
get<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.220> there's<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.520> off<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.510> on<00:02:21.660> and

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
get so there's the off and the on and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.510 
get so there's the off and the on and
then<00:02:24.060> there's<00:02:24.630> where<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.980> adapter<00:02:26.490> goes

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
then there's where the adapter goes

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.980 
then there's where the adapter goes
depending<00:02:27.150> on<00:02:27.240> what<00:02:27.420> you're<00:02:27.540> going<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.720> put<00:02:27.870> in

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
depending on what you're going to put in

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
depending on what you're going to put in
there<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:30.110> I'm<00:02:31.110> not<00:02:31.320> going<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.560> open<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
there and I'm not going to open that and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.540 
there and I'm not going to open that and
break<00:02:32.190> it

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
break it

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.090 
break it
this<00:02:33.510> whole<00:02:33.720> back<00:02:33.900> plate<00:02:34.230> comes<00:02:34.500> off<00:02:34.680> however

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
this whole back plate comes off however

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.790 
this whole back plate comes off however
so<00:02:35.459> there<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.570> test<00:02:37.110> here<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.470> show<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.650> how

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
so there is a test here to show you how

much battery life you have and it's got
a<00:02:42.300> quick<00:02:42.540> shew<00:02:42.750> map<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:44.330> it's<00:02:45.330> adjustable<00:02:45.780> in

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
a quick shew map and it's adjustable in

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.400 
a quick shew map and it's adjustable in
only<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.190> direction<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.840> just<00:02:49.020> forward<00:02:49.290> and

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
only one direction so just forward and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.340 
only one direction so just forward and
backwards<00:02:50.150> or<00:02:51.150> up<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.570> down<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.750> guess<00:02:52.080> if<00:02:52.200> it's
