who basically invented the rhythmic

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.830 
who basically invented the rhythmic
phrasing<00:04:46.130> which<00:04:46.340> jazz<00:04:47.090> musicians<00:04:47.630> can't

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
phrasing which jazz musicians can't

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.550 
phrasing which jazz musicians can't
groove<00:04:48.080> is<00:04:49.449> something<00:04:50.449> phenomenal<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:51.139> we

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
groove is something phenomenal and we

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:10.490 
groove is something phenomenal and we
really<00:04:52.190> are<00:04:52.310> creating<00:04:52.729> an<00:04:52.820> absolute<00:04:53.240> sound

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.080 

the<00:05:11.500> way<00:05:11.650> that<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:11.979> absolute<00:05:12.100> ensemble

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
the way that the absolute ensemble

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.200 
the way that the absolute ensemble
interpret<00:05:13.630> Bach<00:05:13.930> is<00:05:14.259> a<00:05:14.710> fresh<00:05:15.220> approach<00:05:15.699> and

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
interpret Bach is a fresh approach and

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.330 
interpret Bach is a fresh approach and
to<00:05:16.360> kind<00:05:16.539> of<00:05:16.690> come<00:05:17.259> to<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.590> music<00:05:18.009> as<00:05:18.190> if

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
to kind of come to the music as if

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.159 
to kind of come to the music as if
you've<00:05:18.490> never<00:05:18.669> seen<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.090> before<00:05:19.300> as<00:05:19.840> if<00:05:19.990> you're

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
you've never seen it before as if you're

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.279 
you've never seen it before as if you're
discovering<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.830> for<00:05:21.009> the<00:05:21.069> first<00:05:21.340> time<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:22.289> I

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
discovering it for the first time and I

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.339 
discovering it for the first time and I
think<00:05:24.130> you<00:05:24.220> bring<00:05:24.550> all<00:05:24.789> of<00:05:24.819> your<00:05:25.030> knowledge<00:05:25.349> to

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
think you bring all of your knowledge to

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.920 
think you bring all of your knowledge to
that<00:05:26.650> but<00:05:27.220> also<00:05:27.370> at<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.090> same<00:05:28.120> time<00:05:28.569> it's

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
that but also at the same time it's

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.089 
that but also at the same time it's
almost<00:05:29.139> like<00:05:29.349> you're<00:05:29.470> forgetting<00:05:29.979> everything

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
almost like you're forgetting everything

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.300 
almost like you're forgetting everything
that<00:05:30.550> you<00:05:30.669> learned<00:05:30.940> and<00:05:31.300> you're<00:05:32.229> just<00:05:32.500> living

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
that you learned and you're just living

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:49.570 
that you learned and you're just living
the<00:05:34.000> music<00:05:34.419> in<00:05:34.569> that<00:05:34.599> moment

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:06:11.279 

Oh

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.349
