00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.710
 usually swindells actually i want 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.960

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.780
 today 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.510
 for age 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.980
 at the bandwidth limit that the 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.390
 trees windows podium this manipulation 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.029
 that I'm going to make you do it works 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.559
 only 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:38.090
 it works only for the 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.949
 pc windows professional ultimate month 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.649
 in this case I am on a draw that 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.989
 helps me 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.500
 so here's the ultimate 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.110
 understands that including and who who includes 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.140
 all versions windows 7 so 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:59.140
 professionals who are family and that 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 so 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:12.650
 so there it is not complicated that it wait 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:14.860
 I put myself in occupy so 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.110
 here 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.040
 to do that we will do we will support 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.510
 on the windows + r key at the same time 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.110
 so here we go if you do that we can 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.890
 directly to the elysee and mark gp said 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:42.560
 is populated click here attention for 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:48.619
 mark gpj skms and that's ok 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:51.670
 no here it's not very complicated 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:56.270
 go from an admin template 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.310
 network packet planners you 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.659
 click on it 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:07.579
 no I repeat figuration the computer 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:10.190
 right network administration model 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:14.840
 in network we go in planners of 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.290
 hockey q os and then there we see limited 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.299
 before two bookable passers-by are 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.120
 by default it is not configuring any 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.510
 as a burial so I double click 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.209
 above 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.370
 yes yes you doubleclick and fuel 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.680
 mark is activated and so the share of 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.870
 time there's marked 20 so his reserve as to 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.590
 in the center of the bandwidth and so 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:45.310
 I put you 02 just ok here 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.310
 you restart your computer 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.590
 here 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.540
 so he knows how to score here one if you 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.200
 disable this setting also you 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.400
 do not configure the default value here 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.320
 important of the connection is used 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.360
 so that's why I do not know why 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.340
 the reserve but I think it's 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.370
 really useless that's why you 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.020
 can disable it I think that 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.180
 pretty well and poems so here you 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.700
 can not do it 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:28.240
 you can not do it on sordo twin 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:32.080
 2 1 apart from the professional and therefore the 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.540
 remake so I will make a video for you 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:42.600
 show how we do for others 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:42.600
 windows 7 windows xp and four good 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.590

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.050
