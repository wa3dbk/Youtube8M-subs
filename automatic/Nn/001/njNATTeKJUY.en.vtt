00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
to clone your drive now this will work

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.289 
to clone your drive now this will work
for<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> hard<00:00:14.340> drive<00:00:14.519> or<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.089> particular

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
for a hard drive or in this particular

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.930 
for a hard drive or in this particular
place<00:00:15.929> we're<00:00:16.770> going<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.070> use<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> solid-state

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
place we're going to use a solid-state

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.849 
place we're going to use a solid-state
drive<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.449> Plextor<00:00:18.840> was<00:00:19.050> nice<00:00:19.230> enough<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> send

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
drive so Plextor was nice enough to send

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.090 
drive so Plextor was nice enough to send
this<00:00:20.010> drive<00:00:20.340> along<00:00:20.699> very<00:00:21.449> fast<00:00:21.810> drive<00:00:22.109> m6<00:00:22.859> s

this drive along very fast drive m6 s

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.769 
this drive along very fast drive m6 s
we'll<00:00:23.430> be<00:00:23.519> testing<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.090> some<00:00:24.269> other<00:00:24.420> videos

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
we'll be testing it in some other videos

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.890 
we'll be testing it in some other videos
but<00:00:25.439> what<00:00:25.590> you'll<00:00:25.769> need<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.490> order<00:00:26.760> to

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
but what you'll need to do in order to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.900 
but what you'll need to do in order to
cleanly<00:00:27.900> replace<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:28.500> drive<00:00:28.769> from<00:00:29.039> your<00:00:29.070> Mac

cleanly replace your drive from your Mac

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.450 
cleanly replace your drive from your Mac
to<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.840> new<00:00:31.080> drive<00:00:31.380> without<00:00:31.980> losing<00:00:32.340> any

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
to this new drive without losing any

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.250 
to this new drive without losing any
information<00:00:33.149> or<00:00:33.300> having<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> reload<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
information or having to reload the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.720 
information or having to reload the
whole<00:00:34.410> operating<00:00:34.829> system<00:00:35.309> you'll<00:00:35.520> need<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
whole operating system you'll need to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.389 
whole operating system you'll need to
clone<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.600> drive<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.559> what<00:00:37.710> I'll<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.010> I'll

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
clone the drive so what I'll do is I'll

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.459 
clone the drive so what I'll do is I'll
take<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.390> what<00:00:39.930> I'll<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.350> I'm

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
take this out and what I'll do is I'm

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.380 
take this out and what I'll do is I'm
going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.800> place<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.280> into<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:42.030> little

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
going to place it into this little

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.900 
going to place it into this little
carrier<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.129> gives<00:00:44.520> us<00:00:44.700> an

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
carrier I have here and this gives us an

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.400 
carrier I have here and this gives us an
external<00:00:45.420> hard<00:00:45.629> drive<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.079> may<00:00:46.200> want<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
external hard drive and you may want to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.840 
external hard drive and you may want to
pick<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.860> these<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.280> think<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.730> got

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
pick one of these up I think I just got

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.250 
pick one of these up I think I just got
it<00:00:48.000> at<00:00:48.090> Newegg<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.660> one<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> those<00:00:48.989> places

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
it at Newegg or one of those places

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.740 
it at Newegg or one of those places
Amazon<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.820> lets<00:00:50.910> me<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.420> connect

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
Amazon and what it lets me do is connect

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.639 
Amazon and what it lets me do is connect
via<00:00:52.020> micro<00:00:52.590> USB<00:00:52.620> or<00:00:53.190> mini<00:00:53.370> USB<00:00:53.660> to<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.960> Mac<00:00:55.350> via

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
via micro USB or mini USB to a Mac via

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.799 
via micro USB or mini USB to a Mac via
USB<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:56.789> there<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.030> different<00:00:57.390> interfaces

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
USB now there are different interfaces

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.660 
USB now there are different interfaces
it's<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.100> choose<00:00:59.370> but

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
it's up to what you what you choose but

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.400 
it's up to what you what you choose but
basically<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.539> SATA<00:01:00.899> interface

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
basically we just have a SATA interface

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.959 
basically we just have a SATA interface
here<00:01:01.770> we're<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.609> place<00:01:02.820> our

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
here we're going to place our

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.450 
here we're going to place our
solid-state<00:01:03.719> drive<00:01:03.989> into<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:05.309> we're

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
solid-state drive into it and then we're

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.160 
solid-state drive into it and then we're
going<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.820> able<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.060> plug<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.570> into<00:01:06.689> our<00:01:06.869> Mac

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
going to be able to plug it into our Mac

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
going to be able to plug it into our Mac
so<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.799> clone<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.610> here's<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
so that we can clone it so here's the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.840 
so that we can clone it so here's the
drive<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.770> sealed<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.310> in

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
drive you can see it's sealed and in

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.499 
drive you can see it's sealed and in
this<00:01:12.000> case<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.720> take<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.140> this

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
this case we just take it like this

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.640 
this case we just take it like this
slide<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.049> so

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
slide it in like so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.999 
slide it in like so
push<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.310> down<00:01:17.840> no<00:01:18.840> screws<00:01:19.200> required<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.890> this

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
push it down no screws required in this

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.050 
push it down no screws required in this
particular<00:01:20.580> drive<00:01:20.939> carrier<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.790> that's<00:01:23.790> it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
particular drive carrier and that's it

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
particular drive carrier and that's it
so<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.450> I'll<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.810> I'll<00:01:24.900> take<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:28.100> plug

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
so what I'll do is I'll take this plug

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.670 
so what I'll do is I'll take this plug
it<00:01:29.250> into<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.880> macbook<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.600> we'll<00:01:31.470> take<00:01:31.619> a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
it into the macbook and we'll take a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.260 
it into the macbook and we'll take a
look<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.009> what<00:01:32.159> software<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.820> need<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> use

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
look at what software we need to use

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.380 
look at what software we need to use
next<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.960> order<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.259> clone<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.119> here<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
next in order to clone it here is the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.149 
next in order to clone it here is the
computer<00:01:36.900> I'm<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.500> replacing<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
computer I'm going to be replacing the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.999 
computer I'm going to be replacing the
drive<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:38.970> what<00:01:39.180> I'll<00:01:39.329> do<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.710> take<00:01:40.710> my

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
drive in so what I'll do is take my

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.580 
drive in so what I'll do is take my
drive<00:01:41.369> plug<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.180> now<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> first

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
drive plug it in now this is the first

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.899 
drive plug it in now this is the first
time<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:43.979> ever<00:01:44.100> been<00:01:44.369> plugged<00:01:44.640> into<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
time it's ever been plugged into a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.639

moment<00:03:47.379> here<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:47.909> I<00:03:48.909> don't<00:03:48.970> believe<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:50.290> went

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
moment here and I don't believe it went

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.849 
moment here and I don't believe it went
where<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.709> wanted<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.129> to<00:03:52.019> now<00:03:53.019> there<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.349> is<00:03:53.440> you

where I wanted it to now there it is you

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.020 
where I wanted it to now there it is you
can<00:03:54.040> see<00:03:54.250> it's<00:03:54.370> right<00:03:54.549> here

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
can see it's right here

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.559 
can see it's right here

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.839 
rid of it and what we want to do is
clone<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.709> drive<00:04:02.950> so<00:04:03.190> we<00:04:03.310> want<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.519> open<00:04:03.579> up

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849

SuperDuper we've finished here with

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.630 
SuperDuper we've finished here with
partitioning<00:04:07.420> so<00:04:07.599> we'll<00:04:07.810> just<00:04:08.079> command<00:04:08.709> Q<00:04:09.340> to

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
partitioning so we'll just command Q to

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.869 
partitioning so we'll just command Q to
quit<00:04:09.849> that<00:04:10.180> or<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:10.540> can<00:04:10.690> go<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:10.870> file<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.379> quit

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
we're going to open up SuperDuper so in

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.439 
we're going to open up SuperDuper so in
case<00:04:17.949> you<00:04:18.100> missed<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.430> we<00:04:18.729> just<00:04:18.910> partition

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
case you missed that we just partition

we're<00:04:23.350> going<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.620> do<00:04:23.919> is<00:04:24.190> open<00:04:24.580> up<00:04:24.820> SuperDuper

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
we're going to do is open up SuperDuper

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.500 
we're going to do is open up SuperDuper
now<00:04:26.260> super<00:04:26.620> duper<00:04:26.919> is<00:04:27.070> very<00:04:27.580> simple<00:04:28.060> we<00:04:28.450> can

storage<00:04:43.000> space<00:04:43.120> since<00:04:43.570> I'm<00:04:43.750> going<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:43.990> a

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
storage space since I'm going to a

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.719 
storage space since I'm going to a
slightly<00:04:44.470> smaller<00:04:44.830> drive<00:04:45.190> because<00:04:45.400> it's<00:04:45.669> a

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
slightly smaller drive because it's a

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.640 
slightly smaller drive because it's a
solid-state<00:04:46.300> drive<00:04:46.330> we<00:04:47.200> might<00:04:47.440> not<00:04:47.590> have

solid-state drive we might not have
enough<00:04:48.190> storage<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:48.820> let's<00:04:49.120> take<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.360> look<00:04:49.599> and

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
enough storage so let's take a look and

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.890 
enough storage so let's take a look and
in<00:04:51.490> this<00:04:51.610> case<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:52.060> have<00:04:52.210> two<00:04:52.389> hundred<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.750> ten

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
in this case I have two hundred and ten

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.520 
in this case I have two hundred and ten
gigabytes<00:04:53.320> available<00:04:53.919> and<00:04:54.130> we<00:04:54.729> have<00:04:55.320> 320<00:04:56.320> on

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
gigabytes available and we have 320 on

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.300 
gigabytes available and we have 320 on
the<00:04:57.460> original<00:04:58.210> drive<00:04:58.479> now<00:04:58.990> since<00:04:59.260> I<00:04:59.380> have<00:04:59.410> 210

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
the original drive now since I have 210

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.870 
the original drive now since I have 210
available<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.479> 319<00:05:02.229> we've<00:05:02.560> got<00:05:02.880> 109
