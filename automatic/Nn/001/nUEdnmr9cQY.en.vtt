reason why i went there and it was

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.569 
reason why i went there and it was
really<00:02:20.660> in<00:02:20.840> an<00:02:20.930> awkward<00:02:21.079> place<00:02:21.500> actually<00:02:22.430> it

professional chairs that were leaned

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.509 
professional chairs that were leaned
back<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.959> everything<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.650> know<00:02:33.880> but<00:02:36.519> you

back and everything you know but you

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.370 
back and everything you know but you
know<00:02:37.639> a<00:02:37.940> little<00:02:38.359> awkward<00:02:38.750> getting<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:39.019> center

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
know a little awkward getting a center

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.900 
know a little awkward getting a center
getting<00:02:39.560> your<00:02:39.680> eyes<00:02:39.769> for<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.220> front<00:02:40.819> of

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
getting your eyes for in front of

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.140 
getting your eyes for in front of
hundreds<00:02:41.329> of<00:02:41.389> people<00:02:41.480> walking<00:02:41.750> by<00:02:42.250> but<00:02:43.250> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
hundreds of people walking by but the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.059 
hundreds of people walking by but the
reason<00:02:44.299> why<00:02:44.540> i<00:02:44.720> chose<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:45.319> place<00:02:45.560> was

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
reason why i chose that place was

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.509 
reason why i chose that place was
because<00:02:46.310> they<00:02:46.880> had<00:02:46.910> charts<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:48.519> different

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
because they had charts of different

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.349 
because they had charts of different
shapes<00:02:49.910> of<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.329> eyebrows<00:02:51.139> and<00:02:51.500> i<00:02:51.799> had<00:02:52.160> i<00:02:52.549> have

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
shapes of the eyebrows and i had i have

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.990 
shapes of the eyebrows and i had i have
difficulty<00:02:54.019> explaining<00:02:54.500> what<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.609> i<00:02:55.760> want

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
difficulty explaining what it is i want

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.990 
difficulty explaining what it is i want
in<00:02:56.269> those<00:02:56.540> types<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:57.019> things<00:02:57.079> and<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:58.790> thought

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
in those types of things and I thought

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.250 
in those types of things and I thought
it<00:02:59.090> would<00:02:59.150> just<00:02:59.269> be<00:02:59.450> easier<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.780> be<00:02:59.959> able<00:03:00.109> to<00:03:00.170> go

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
it would just be easier to be able to go

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.809 
it would just be easier to be able to go
in<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.470> pick<00:03:00.739> out<00:03:00.859> a<00:03:00.920> couple<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.459> asked<00:03:01.609> them

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
in and pick out a couple and asked them

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.250 
in and pick out a couple and asked them
what<00:03:02.060> they<00:03:02.090> thought<00:03:02.239> was<00:03:02.599> best<00:03:02.840> for<00:03:02.989> my<00:03:03.230> eye

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
what they thought was best for my eye

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.430 
what they thought was best for my eye
shape<00:03:03.739> which<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:04.579> did<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.079> she<00:03:06.079> picked<00:03:06.290> out<00:03:06.380> a

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
shape which I did and she picked out a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.930 
shape which I did and she picked out a
good<00:03:06.620> shape<00:03:06.889> it<00:03:07.040> was<00:03:07.130> pretty<00:03:07.310> much<00:03:07.489> my<00:03:07.549> first

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
good shape it was pretty much my first

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.800 
good shape it was pretty much my first
choice<00:03:08.239> out<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.690> two<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:08.989> i<00:03:09.079> picked<00:03:09.579> as

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
choice out of the two that i picked as

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:22.570 
choice out of the two that i picked as

just<00:03:30.120> briefly<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.930> would<00:03:31.680> say<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.550> was<00:03:32.580> on<00:03:32.700> a

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
just briefly I would say if it was on a

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.410 
just briefly I would say if it was on a
maintenance<00:03:33.600> basis<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.700> would<00:03:36.000> not<00:03:36.210> be

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
maintenance basis that it would not be

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.220 
maintenance basis that it would not be
painful<00:03:36.960> I<00:03:37.170> will<00:03:38.100> go<00:03:38.310> back<00:03:38.520> and<00:03:38.760> do<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:38.940> again

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
when she first did it I kind of thought

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.210 
when she first did it I kind of thought
that<00:04:06.210> this<00:04:06.870> one<00:04:07.080> was<00:04:07.200> arched<00:04:07.560> more<00:04:07.860> than<00:04:08.070> this

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
that this one was arched more than this

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.350 
that this one was arched more than this
one<00:04:08.550> and<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:10.040> was<00:04:11.040> really<00:04:11.280> being<00:04:11.430> OCD<00:04:11.640> about<00:04:12.150> it

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
one and I was really being OCD about it

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.500 
one and I was really being OCD about it
to<00:04:12.480> be<00:04:12.570> honest<00:04:12.870> with<00:04:13.080> you<00:04:13.260> but<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:14.760> don't<00:04:15.270> feel

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
to be honest with you but I don't feel

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.530 
to be honest with you but I don't feel
that<00:04:15.690> in<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.350> way<00:04:16.709> as<00:04:17.130> much<00:04:17.519> now<00:04:17.940> i<00:04:18.209> think

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
that in that way as much now i think

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.870 
that in that way as much now i think
what<00:04:18.750> found<00:04:19.049> what<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.590> was<00:04:19.769> was<00:04:19.799> this<00:04:20.430> side<00:04:20.670> was

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
what found what it was was this side was

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.610 
what found what it was was this side was
thinner<00:04:21.209> at<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.540> end<00:04:21.720> than<00:04:21.959> this<00:04:22.140> one<00:04:22.440> and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
thinner at the end than this one and

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.540 
thinner at the end than this one and
I've<00:04:23.340> been<00:04:23.490> able<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.850> correct<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.480> with<00:04:25.020> a

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
I've been able to correct that with a

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.490 
I've been able to correct that with a
what<00:04:26.550> brings<00:04:26.820> me<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.450> my<00:04:27.930> question<00:04:27.960> for<00:04:28.440> you

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
what brings me to my question for you

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.990 
what brings me to my question for you
today<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:30.050> ran<00:04:31.050> out<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.290> my<00:04:31.980> maybelline<00:04:32.669> define

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
today I ran out of my maybelline define

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.670 
today I ran out of my maybelline define
a<00:04:33.030> brow<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:34.100> kind<00:04:35.100> of<00:04:35.280> like<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:36.150> way<00:04:36.600> that<00:04:37.020> using

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
a brow I kind of like the way that using

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.400 
a brow I kind of like the way that using
an<00:04:37.800> eyeshadow<00:04:38.070> or<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.730> powder<00:04:39.180> defines<00:04:40.140> your

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
an eyeshadow or a powder defines your

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.610 
an eyeshadow or a powder defines your
brows<00:04:40.710> better<00:04:41.280> than<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:41.850> pencil<00:04:42.210> because<00:04:43.050> even

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
brows better than a pencil because even

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.550 
brows better than a pencil because even
with<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.890> dupatta<00:04:44.190> brow<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:44.730> would<00:04:44.940> find<00:04:45.320> if<00:04:46.320> I

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
with the dupatta brow I would find if I

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.190 
with the dupatta brow I would find if I
had<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.770> spot<00:04:47.220> where<00:04:47.910> my<00:04:48.150> hair<00:04:48.390> wasn't<00:04:48.630> is<00:04:48.870> thick

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
had a spot where my hair wasn't is thick

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.130 
had a spot where my hair wasn't is thick
then<00:04:49.890> that<00:04:50.280> area<00:04:50.700> kind<00:04:51.060> of<00:04:51.150> seemed<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:51.750> be<00:04:51.870> less

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
then that area kind of seemed to be less

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.010 
then that area kind of seemed to be less
defined<00:04:52.710> if<00:04:53.100> that<00:04:53.880> makes<00:04:54.090> any<00:04:54.240> sense<00:04:54.540> a<00:04:54.750> little

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
defined if that makes any sense a little

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.970 
defined if that makes any sense a little
hard<00:04:55.169> to<00:04:55.320> explain<00:04:55.620> but<00:04:56.400> with<00:04:56.580> powder<00:04:56.940> it's

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
hard to explain but with powder it's

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.760 
hard to explain but with powder it's
even<00:04:58.980> it<00:04:59.250> just<00:04:59.669> it<00:05:00.050> looks<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.169> lot<00:05:01.290> better<00:05:01.470> to<00:05:01.740> me

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
even it just it looks a lot better to me

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.430 
even it just it looks a lot better to me
so<00:05:02.730> I<00:05:03.030> am<00:05:03.570> wanting<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.669> try<00:05:05.669> either<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.690> powder

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440
