cartoon Beach or so first up what we do
is<00:00:14.210> we<00:00:15.210> draw<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.750> circle<00:00:18.589> and<00:00:19.730> then<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.150> an

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
is we draw a circle and then just on an

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.310 
is we draw a circle and then just on an
angle<00:00:21.660> up<00:00:21.749> here<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:22.109> draw<00:00:22.320> an<00:00:22.529> oval<00:00:24.169> just<00:00:25.169> like

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
angle up here we draw an oval just like

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.029 
angle up here we draw an oval just like
that<00:00:25.759> and<00:00:26.759> then<00:00:26.909> we<00:00:26.970> put<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.179> line<00:00:27.480> down<00:00:28.039> that

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that and then we put a line down that

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.990 
that and then we put a line down that
way<00:00:29.159> for<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.669> guide<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:30.599> one<00:00:30.810> across<00:00:32.000> like

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
way for a guide and then one across like

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
way for a guide and then one across like
that<00:00:33.240> for<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> guide<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.230> another<00:00:34.590> one

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
that for a guide and then another one

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.530 
that for a guide and then another one
there<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.110> another<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.500> yeah<00:00:38.400> so<00:00:39.360> we're

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
there and another one yeah so we're

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.670 
there and another one yeah so we're
these<00:00:39.990> little<00:00:40.350> lines<00:00:40.590> touch<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.880> sides<00:00:42.120> of

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
these little lines touch the sides of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.080 
these little lines touch the sides of
the<00:00:43.680> oval<00:00:44.100> that's<00:00:44.550> where<00:00:44.730> we're<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.000> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the oval that's where we're going to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.320 
the oval that's where we're going to
take<00:00:45.650> some<00:00:46.650> more<00:00:46.860> lines<00:00:47.070> from<00:00:47.400> to<00:00:47.730> show<00:00:48.060> some

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
take some more lines from to show some

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.450 
take some more lines from to show some
stripes<00:00:48.720> on<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> beach<00:00:49.170> ball<00:00:49.470> so<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:50.250> take

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
stripes on the beach ball so we take

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.130 
stripes on the beach ball so we take
that<00:00:50.490> line<00:00:50.790> out<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.450> a<00:00:51.570> little<00:00:51.660> bit<00:00:51.840> further

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that line out just a little bit further

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.530 
that line out just a little bit further
the<00:00:52.380> end<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:53.460> touch<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> edge<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.240> the<00:00:54.390> big

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
the end to touch the edge of the big

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.370 
the end to touch the edge of the big
circle<00:00:55.040> and<00:00:56.040> then<00:00:56.190> from<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.400> point<00:00:56.580> we<00:00:56.880> just

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
circle and then from that point we just

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.590 
circle and then from that point we just
slightly<00:00:58.380> curved<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.830> line<00:00:59.010> out<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
slightly curved a line out like that and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.950 
slightly curved a line out like that and
then<00:01:00.930> another<00:01:01.650> one<00:01:01.890> there<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:03.720> again

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
then another one there and then again

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.370 
then another one there and then again
from<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.289> point<00:01:04.640> we<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:06.140> slightly<00:01:07.140> curved

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
from that point we just slightly curved

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.330 
from that point we just slightly curved
a<00:01:07.560> line<00:01:07.740> out<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.549> around<00:01:09.590> just<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.829> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
a line out and around just like that and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.620 
a line out and around just like that and
then<00:01:11.789> again<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:15.420> side

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.390 

and<00:01:21.140> then<00:01:21.290> from<00:01:21.500> here<00:01:21.530> again<00:01:24.070> just<00:01:25.070> give<00:01:25.280> a

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
and then from here again just give a

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.440 
and then from here again just give a
line<00:01:25.580> out<00:01:26.110> like<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.850> then<00:01:29.030> another<00:01:29.210> one

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
line out like that and then another one

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.480 
line out like that and then another one
dear<00:01:29.960> I<00:01:30.490> mean<00:01:31.869> one<00:01:32.869> pretty<00:01:33.740> much<00:01:33.920> just<00:01:34.190> strike

through

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.910 

like<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:43.080> say<00:01:44.080> what<00:01:44.230> we<00:01:44.290> do<00:01:44.410> is<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:44.590> just<00:01:44.770> grab

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.500 

then<00:02:18.490> we<00:02:18.550> just<00:02:18.670> go<00:02:18.790> back<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.210> double<00:02:19.450> at

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
then we just go back in the double at

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.060 
then we just go back in the double at
the<00:02:19.540> thickness<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.230> main<00:02:20.470> parts<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
the thickness of the main parts of the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.440 
the thickness of the main parts of the
illustration<00:02:21.670> just<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.970> make<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.240> look<00:02:22.330> even

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
illustration just to make it look even

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:53.240 
illustration just to make it look even
more<00:02:22.780> cartoony

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.050 

then<00:02:54.250> we<00:02:54.310> just<00:02:54.459> wait<00:02:54.579> for<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.819> ink<00:02:54.909> to<00:02:54.939> dry

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.069 

let<00:02:58.060> me<00:02:58.120> just<00:02:58.239> go<00:02:58.329> back<00:02:58.359> in<00:02:58.629> and<00:02:58.689> rub<00:02:58.840> out<00:02:58.959> the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
let me just go back in and rub out the

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:14.430 
let me just go back in and rub out the
pencil<00:02:59.230> lines

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.660 

so<00:03:15.440> there<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.620> have<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:16.099> cartoon<00:03:16.310> beach

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
so there you have it a cartoon beach

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.920 
so there you have it a cartoon beach
ball<00:03:16.940> with<00:03:16.970> stripes<00:03:17.739> happy<00:03:18.739> drawing
