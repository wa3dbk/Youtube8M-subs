of course you got early abilities that

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.000 
of course you got early abilities that
you're<00:00:20.430> using<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:21.000> generate<00:00:21.390> other<00:00:22.010> synergies

you're using to generate other synergies

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.650 
you're using to generate other synergies
and<00:00:23.279> things<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.670> go<00:00:24.060> ahead<00:00:24.090> use<00:00:24.390> them

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and things like that go ahead use them

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.650 
and things like that go ahead use them
but<00:00:24.980> focusing<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.760> seems<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.390> best

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
but focusing on one seems to be the best
