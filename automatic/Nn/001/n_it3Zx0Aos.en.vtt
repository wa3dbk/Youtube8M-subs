00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.919
 good afternoon today tell you how 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:11.010
 take off after exercise 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:14.519
 glue that is on the ear 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:20.250
 As a rule, we have it so sticky that it is not 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:23.000
 allows glass to drop after a throw 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.460
 the series creaks and you can just break 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.310
 that with pieces of toning still left as 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.199
 we see if we want to take from such 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.390
 window 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.170
 clean and transparent and that opens 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.989
 without any problems there either 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.760
 accordingly close without 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.010
 material strong priming us 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.950
 need such a sponge 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:51.329
 wetted water is simple at first we 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.160
 just wet the glue itself which is the flow 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.449
 who stood up let's say some 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.000
 the gap is already wet 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.519
 waited five minutes and that's it 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:15.240
 movements we erase as you see 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:16.770
 now here's a piece here we take it just 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.549
 even without any problems here 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.680
 glue is erased and remains here 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.009
 the most important thing after the stereo workout 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.990
 wait two hours for it to dry 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.500
 the glue itself has acquired just such a mass 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.400
 which can be done with plain water not 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.150
 do not throw alcohol and solvents 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.630
 gasoline just it is erased when a little 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.799
 dry out 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:48.500
 after that wipe dry 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.689
 rag and you can already say 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.460
 free to open the windows 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:58.920
 to remove these surpluses 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.360
 here it is necessary to remove the dam because 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.579
 that they usually remain here 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.420
 the panel will shoot and get 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.900
 clean the entire country accordingly 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.090
 Now in all this will clean for 15 minutes 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.290
 I will show what we will have for the result 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.430
 let's see what we did after 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.070
 of how we rubbed 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:24.180
 i'm cleaning up a rag 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:28.400
 no longer took everything was completely 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:32.520
 only pieces are stuck here 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.970
 black prayers no crypt which customer 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.970
 watered 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.340
 make that was not left 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.420
 Generally completely shooting gallery certainly not watching 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.420
 this opens the window 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:22.650
 but still let some one wipe here 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:26.700
 On the whole, I am satisfied, I only needed 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.920
 rag water and two days to glass 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.760
 dried up after we with them in 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.940
 black workout glue dries out 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.950
 wet it with water we wipe everything 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.959
 stays on the sponge 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.360
 perfect cheats option advise everyone 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.690
 just comfortable half an hour spent 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.730
 time for all 20 thanks to all 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.730
