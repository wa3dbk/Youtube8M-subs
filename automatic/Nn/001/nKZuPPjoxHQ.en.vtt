from<00:00:37.110> another<00:00:37.380> famous<00:00:37.710> spray<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.370> product

from another famous spray can product

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.360 
from another famous spray can product
basically<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.809> was<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:40.440> friend's<00:00:40.860> wedding<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
basically I was at friend's wedding and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.600 
basically I was at friend's wedding and
she<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:42.059> over<00:00:42.329> spray<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.040> sea

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
she was all over spray with the sea

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.910 
she was all over spray with the sea
listing<00:00:45.059> material<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.079> thought<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.890> could

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
listing material and I thought one could

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.240 
listing material and I thought one could
not<00:00:47.309> create<00:00:48.079> using<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> technology<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
not create using the technology of a

an instant nonwoven fabric and

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
an instant nonwoven fabric and
everything<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.660> started<00:00:58.020> from<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> head<00:00:58.500> he

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
everything is started from the head he

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220 
everything is started from the head he
took<00:00:59.460> those<00:00:59.609> principles<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.270> created<00:01:00.719> fabric

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
took those principles and created fabric

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290 
took those principles and created fabric

firm fabric when it gets in contact with
the<00:01:15.119> air<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.930> solidifies<00:01:16.740> into<00:01:17.220> this

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the air it solidifies into this

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.810 
the air it solidifies into this
instant-on<00:01:18.630> woven<00:01:19.080> material<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.310> starts<00:01:20.700> as

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
instant-on woven material it starts as

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.640 
instant-on woven material it starts as
pure<00:01:21.060> chemistry<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.170> hands<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
pure chemistry but in the hands of a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:31.180 
pure chemistry but in the hands of a
designer<00:01:23.119> transforms<00:01:24.119> into<00:01:24.420> art

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.940 

it<00:01:32.190> feels<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:33.140> Capri<00:01:34.140> Singh<00:01:34.409> morning<00:01:34.799> air

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
it feels like Capri Singh morning air

it feels like Capri Singh morning air
hey<00:01:35.760> fun

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
hey fun

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.510 
hey fun
it<00:01:37.050> takes<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.470> suppose<00:01:37.830> like<00:01:38.070> that's<00:01:38.369> the

good way to control the spillage so that

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.800 
good way to control the spillage so that
you<00:03:25.130> know<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.310> have<00:03:25.760> this<00:03:25.970> fabric<00:03:26.270> that<00:03:26.630> this

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
you know you have this fabric that this

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.830 
you know you have this fabric that this
floating<00:03:27.230> is<00:03:27.860> absorbing<00:03:28.610> as<00:03:28.730> we<00:03:28.880> can<00:03:29.090> see<00:03:29.390> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
floating is absorbing as we can see the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.600 
floating is absorbing as we can see the
oils<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:31.090> also<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.270> will<00:03:32.480> be<00:03:32.660> very<00:03:32.690> easy<00:03:33.680> to
