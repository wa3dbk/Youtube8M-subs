00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.230
 sound card with the music that is also there 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.649
 I stuck to the door with the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.649
 hinge side 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.540
 this is a piece of cardboard 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.190
 the strip attached to the euro 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.080
 right side of the frame and that ensures 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:26.480
 sure the card 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:28.949
 they open fire in the event of burglary or if 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.410
 energy saving that door leaves open to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.410
 that what makes a noise 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.680

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.700
 sound goes to 50 seconds again 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.909
 automatic 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.909

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.010

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.370

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.000
 make for burglary 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.770
 can also be used for the cold 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.890
 winter months as energy saving as 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.540
