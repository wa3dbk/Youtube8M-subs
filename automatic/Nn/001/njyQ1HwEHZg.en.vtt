00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.299 
it was like a - I don't even know
furniture<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.809> something<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
furniture or something like that but it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.709 
furniture or something like that but it
was<00:00:59.430> pretty<00:00:59.550> funny<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.910> Drew<00:01:00.180> Carey<00:01:00.420> played

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
was pretty funny and Drew Carey played

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.209 
was pretty funny and Drew Carey played
it<00:01:00.840> off<00:01:00.960> very<00:01:01.170> well<00:01:01.410> he<00:01:01.590> almost<00:01:01.739> turned<00:01:02.039> it

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
it off very well he almost turned it

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.100 
it off very well he almost turned it
into<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.399> sexual<00:01:02.789> innuendo<00:01:03.000> he<00:01:03.359> got<00:01:03.480> very<00:01:03.660> close

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
into a sexual innuendo he got very close

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.660 
into a sexual innuendo he got very close
and<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:04.710> he<00:01:04.830> reworded<00:01:05.339> himself

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and then I think he reworded himself

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.910 
and then I think he reworded himself
last<00:01:06.030> second<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.510> his<00:01:06.630> brain<00:01:06.869> before<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.770> came

guys<00:03:30.690> 21<00:03:31.200> me<00:03:31.380> -<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.590> believe<00:03:31.859> might<00:03:32.370> be<00:03:32.489> 23<00:03:32.940> and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
guys 21 me - I believe might be 23 and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.650 
guys 21 me - I believe might be 23 and
then<00:03:33.720> we<00:03:33.840> have<00:03:34.079> bass<00:03:34.920> vocalist<00:03:35.579> is<00:03:35.700> like<00:03:35.880> 29<00:03:36.269> 30

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
then we have bass vocalist is like 29 30

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.059 
then we have bass vocalist is like 29 30
and<00:03:36.840> I'm<00:03:36.930> probably<00:03:37.350> under<00:03:37.620> shooting<00:03:37.950> it

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
and I'm probably under shooting it

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.440 
and I'm probably under shooting it
because<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.280> don't<00:03:38.430> want<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.609> make<00:03:38.730> him<00:03:38.910> mad<00:03:39.150> and

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
because I don't want to make him mad and

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.539 
because I don't want to make him mad and
then<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:40.500> then<00:03:40.650> our<00:03:40.769> if<00:03:40.980> he<00:03:41.100> listens<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.430> my

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
from the way he looks at it but the way

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.089 
from the way he looks at it but the way
I<00:06:10.449> look<00:06:10.659> at<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:10.840> is<00:06:11.080> he<00:06:11.259> doesn't<00:06:11.590> trust<00:06:11.770> one<00:06:12.069> of

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
I look at it is he doesn't trust one of

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.800 
I look at it is he doesn't trust one of
us<00:06:12.340> or<00:06:12.550> he<00:06:12.610> doesn't<00:06:12.759> trust<00:06:13.000> all<00:06:13.270> of<00:06:13.300> us<00:06:13.539> or<00:06:13.719> you

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
us or he doesn't trust all of us or you

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.570 
us or he doesn't trust all of us or you
know<00:06:13.930> any<00:06:14.080> combination<00:06:14.680> of<00:06:14.800> that<00:06:14.919> two<00:06:15.340> of<00:06:15.370> us

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
know any combination of that two of us

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.189 
know any combination of that two of us
whatever<00:06:16.000> there's<00:06:16.569> someone<00:06:16.810> he<00:06:16.930> doesn't

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
whatever there's someone he doesn't

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.469 
whatever there's someone he doesn't
trust<00:06:17.349> and<00:06:17.800> for<00:06:18.520> that<00:06:18.610> reason<00:06:18.969> he<00:06:19.029> puts<00:06:19.240> a<00:06:19.300> lock

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479
