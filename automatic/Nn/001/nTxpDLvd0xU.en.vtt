00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
been working on a new ship

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.970 
been working on a new ship
another<00:00:14.610> small<00:00:14.910> ship<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.809> light<00:00:16.230> recon

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
another small ship this is a light recon

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.400 
another small ship this is a light recon
cruiser<00:00:17.340> now<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.029> idea<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.660> ship<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
cruiser now the idea of this ship is to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.050 
cruiser now the idea of this ship is to
have<00:00:19.590> better<00:00:19.980> range<00:00:20.279> than<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.670> standard

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
have better range than a standard

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.120 
have better range than a standard
reconnaissance<00:00:21.810> satellite<00:00:22.320> err<00:00:22.350> but<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
reconnaissance satellite err but at the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.700 
reconnaissance satellite err but at the
same<00:00:23.369> time<00:00:23.670> being<00:00:24.029> able<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.600> maintain<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.260> crew

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
same time being able to maintain a crew

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.640 
same time being able to maintain a crew
for<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> number<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.730> weeks<00:00:27.000> or<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> long<00:00:27.990> sort<00:00:28.560> of

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
for a number of weeks or a long sort of

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.740 
for a number of weeks or a long sort of
travel<00:00:28.980> period<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.550> no<00:00:29.910> super<00:00:30.269> armored<00:00:30.570> but

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
travel period is no super armored but

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.389 
travel period is no super armored but
we'll<00:00:30.869> have<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.019> look<00:00:31.170> around<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.560> thing<00:00:31.800> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
we'll have a look around the thing so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.340 
we'll have a look around the thing so
first<00:00:32.640> off<00:00:32.910> you'll<00:00:33.210> notice<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.170> it's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
first off you'll notice that there it's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.080 
first off you'll notice that there it's
an<00:00:34.500> outer<00:00:34.680> shell<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.280> thought<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> long

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
an outer shell I thought for a long

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.270 
an outer shell I thought for a long
sight<00:00:36.360> distance<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.989> long-range<00:00:37.469> fighter<00:00:37.800> if

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
sight distance and long-range fighter if

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.340 
sight distance and long-range fighter if
it<00:00:38.550> takes<00:00:38.820> damage<00:00:39.090> it's<00:00:39.510> nothing<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.079> too

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it takes damage it's nothing to be too

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.990 
it takes damage it's nothing to be too
good<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.829> we've<00:00:40.980> got<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.250> outer<00:00:41.489> shell<00:00:41.700> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
good so we've got this outer shell you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.360 
good so we've got this outer shell you
can<00:00:42.030> see<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.809> actually<00:00:43.160> surrounds<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
can see that actually surrounds the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.119 
can see that actually surrounds the
interior<00:00:45.090> hull<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.960> ship<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.950> see

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
interior hull of the ship and you see

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.770 
interior hull of the ship and you see
the<00:00:47.280> cockpit<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.789> middle<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.270> recessed

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the cockpit in the middle is recessed

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.119 
the cockpit in the middle is recessed
into<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.530> add<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> little<00:00:49.890> bit<00:00:50.010> more

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
into it to add a little bit more

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.950 
into it to add a little bit more
protection<00:00:50.670> well<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.449> go<00:00:51.570> number<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
protection well as we go number of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.420 
protection well as we go number of
different<00:00:52.230> Gatling<00:00:52.559> guns<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> sides<00:00:53.219> at

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
different Gatling guns on the sides at

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.490 
different Gatling guns on the sides at
the<00:00:53.460> bottom<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.059> at<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> top<00:00:55.170> here

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the bottom and at the top here

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.840 
the bottom and at the top here
you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.739> see<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> locate<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:56.730> bit

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
you can see the locate a little bit

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.549 
you can see the locate a little bit
indented<00:00:57.360> within<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> hole<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.050> easy<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
indented within the hole and easy to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.319 
indented within the hole and easy to
control<00:00:58.949> from<00:00:59.309> inside<00:00:59.640> from<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> multiple

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
control from inside from the multiple

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.000 
control from inside from the multiple
gunning<00:01:00.629> stations<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
gunning stations and there is the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.860 
gunning stations and there is the
rear-facing<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.480> look<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.750> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
rear-facing one so if we look at this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.450 
rear-facing one so if we look at this
angle<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.379> we've<00:01:04.949> got<00:01:04.979> our<00:01:05.159> saw<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
angle you can see we've got our saw a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.030 
angle you can see we've got our saw a
wedge<00:01:05.820> shape<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.510> protect<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.200> engines<00:01:07.619> from

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
wedge shape to protect the engines from

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
wedge shape to protect the engines from
incoming<00:01:08.460> sort<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.939> asteroids<00:01:09.510> or<00:01:09.689> anything

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
that could possibly go straight into the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.429 
that could possibly go straight into the
side<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.150> destroy<00:01:12.600> them<00:01:12.780> rock<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> little

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
here we have one of the main cargo

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.130 
here we have one of the main cargo
storages<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.909> ship<00:02:00.149> nicely<00:02:00.840> tucked<00:02:00.960> away

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
storages of the ship nicely tucked away

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.289 
storages of the ship nicely tucked away
behind<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.829> shutter<00:02:02.159> there's<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> little<00:02:03.090> cool

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
behind the shutter there's a little cool

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.270 
behind the shutter there's a little cool
idea<00:02:03.689> you've<00:02:04.110> got<00:02:04.229> these<00:02:04.320> windows<00:02:04.770> into<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
idea you've got these windows into the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.889 
idea you've got these windows into the
main<00:02:05.460> airlock<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:06.149> well<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:06.719> see

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
main airlock as well so you can see

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.600 
main airlock as well so you can see
who's<00:02:07.049> coming<00:02:07.320> aboard<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.799> ship<00:02:07.979> as<00:02:08.190> you're

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
who's coming aboard your ship as you're

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.669 
who's coming aboard your ship as you're
working<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> various<00:02:09.479> stations<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.470> let's

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
working on the various stations so let's

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.950 
working on the various stations so let's
seal<00:02:10.920> these<00:02:11.190> compartments<00:02:11.550> up<00:02:11.910> quickly<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
seal these compartments up quickly and

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.890 
seal these compartments up quickly and
head<00:02:13.140> upstairs<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.640> upstairs<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.540> second

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
head upstairs so upstairs the second

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.030 
head upstairs so upstairs the second
level<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.230> ship<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> little<00:02:16.920> bit

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
level of the ship is a little bit

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.560 
level of the ship is a little bit
misleading<00:02:17.220> because<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.150> imagine<00:02:18.480> that

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
misleading because you can imagine that

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.820 
misleading because you can imagine that
this<00:02:18.720> ship's<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.020> lot<00:02:19.200> smaller<00:02:19.560> than<00:02:19.740> it

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
this ship's a lot smaller than it

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.500 
this ship's a lot smaller than it
actually<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.280> we've<00:02:20.880> actually<00:02:21.060> managed<00:02:21.480> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
actually is we've actually managed to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.570 
actually is we've actually managed to
wiggle<00:02:21.930> two<00:02:22.440> levels<00:02:22.890> out<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.280> and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
wiggle two levels out of this and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.400 
wiggle two levels out of this and
towards<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> rear<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.630> have<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.140> main

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
towards the rear we have the main

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500 
towards the rear we have the main
reactor<00:02:26.010> room<00:02:26.190> got<00:02:26.550> three<00:02:26.850> reactors<00:02:27.120> in

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
reactor room got three reactors in

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.420 
reactor room got three reactors in
tandem<00:02:28.020> we've<00:02:28.530> got<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> little<00:02:28.860> power<00:02:29.130> voltage

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
tandem we've got a little power voltage

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.970 
tandem we've got a little power voltage
on<00:02:29.850> both<00:02:30.090> sides<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:30.600> well<00:02:30.750> as<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> program<00:02:31.410> run

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
on both sides as well as a program run

on both sides as well as a program run
in<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.340> number<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.760> different<00:02:33.090> systems<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.810> save

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
in a number of different systems to save

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.770 
in a number of different systems to save
a<00:02:34.230> maximum<00:02:34.860> amount<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.430> power<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.300> if<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:36.570> cut

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
a maximum amount of power so if we cut

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.850 
a maximum amount of power so if we cut
back<00:02:36.960> into<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.260> room<00:02:37.470> we<00:02:37.590> have<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.830> living

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
back into this room we have the living

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.190 
back into this room we have the living
quarters<00:02:38.490> as<00:02:38.640> well<00:02:38.700> as<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.360> gunnery<00:02:39.720> control

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.820 
monitors I probably need to set up a few
more<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.840> these<00:02:45.900> monitors<00:02:46.290> with<00:02:46.470> different

sorts of screens and things but I was
just<00:02:48.240> not<00:02:48.360> too<00:02:48.510> sure<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.080> wanted<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.590> add<00:02:49.710> herbs

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
just not too sure I wanted to add herbs

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.020 
ideally set two to three men ship and we
have<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.080> fourth<00:03:04.380> bed<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.220> case<00:03:05.430> anyone<00:03:06.000> is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
have a fourth bed just in case anyone is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.760 
have a fourth bed just in case anyone is
taken<00:03:06.720> prisoner<00:03:07.140> or<00:03:07.290> you've<00:03:07.440> got<00:03:07.560> someone

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
taken prisoner or you've got someone

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.800 
taken prisoner or you've got someone
aboard<00:03:08.010> your<00:03:08.220> ship<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.610> in<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.180> room<00:03:09.450> we

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
aboard your ship and in this room we

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.350 
aboard your ship and in this room we
have<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.320> toilet<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:10.920> behind<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.370> shutter<00:03:11.640> we

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
have the toilet so behind the shutter we

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.390 
have the toilet so behind the shutter we
have<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.690> privacy<00:03:12.990> of<00:03:13.320> this<00:03:13.710> small<00:03:14.010> toilet

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
have the privacy of this small toilet

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.070 
have the privacy of this small toilet
room<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.180> can<00:03:15.270> see<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.450> shutter<00:03:15.660> goes<00:03:15.870> up

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
room so you can see the shutter goes up

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.110 
room so you can see the shutter goes up
we've<00:03:16.260> got<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.410> cargo<00:03:16.650> storage<00:03:16.950> there<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.820> this

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
we've got a cargo storage there so this

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.180 
we've got a cargo storage there so this
is<00:03:18.270> actually<00:03:18.660> into<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.380> cocktail<00:03:19.650> show<00:03:20.010> that

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
is actually into the cocktail show that

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.220 
is actually into the cocktail show that
in<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.370> second<00:03:20.730> we've<00:03:21.210> got<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.390> toilet<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:22.020> we've

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
in a second we've got a toilet and we've

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.900 
in a second we've got a toilet and we've
got<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.410> sink<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:22.860> if<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.250> hop<00:03:23.370> by<00:03:23.460> downstairs

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
got a sink so if you hop by downstairs

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.810 
got a sink so if you hop by downstairs
and<00:03:24.330> we<00:03:24.690> go<00:03:24.810> into<00:03:24.960> the<00:03:25.170> cockpit<00:03:25.520> say<00:03:26.520> someone's

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
and we go into the cockpit say someone's

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.580 
and we go into the cockpit say someone's
upstairs<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.450> they<00:03:27.630> need<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.870> component<00:03:28.350> to

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
upstairs and they need a component to

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.380 
upstairs and they need a component to
fix<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.980> ship<00:03:29.160> below<00:03:29.460> they<00:03:29.790> can<00:03:29.970> receive<00:03:30.210> it

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
fix the ship below they can receive it

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.030 
fix the ship below they can receive it
through<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.810> little<00:03:30.960> hole<00:03:31.080> there<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:31.770> just<00:03:31.890> a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
through that little hole there so just a

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.890 
through that little hole there so just a
faster<00:03:32.400> way<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.760> pushing<00:03:33.330> components<00:03:33.840> around

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
faster way of pushing components around

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.120 
faster way of pushing components around
the<00:03:34.080> ships<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.380> different<00:03:34.590> crew<00:03:34.770> members<00:03:35.040> so

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
the ships of different crew members so

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.860 
the ships of different crew members so
they<00:03:35.250> can<00:03:35.370> fix<00:03:35.580> areas<00:03:35.970> up<00:03:36.180> if<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.750> becomes

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
they can fix areas up if it becomes

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.190 
they can fix areas up if it becomes
damaged<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.460> is<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.970> light<00:03:39.240> recon<00:03:39.870> ship

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
damaged so that is the light recon ship

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.320 
damaged so that is the light recon ship
so<00:03:40.620> let's<00:03:40.860> have<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.010> go<00:03:41.250> actually<00:03:41.820> pilot<00:03:42.210> in

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
so let's have a go actually pilot in

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.150 
so let's have a go actually pilot in
this<00:03:42.480> ship<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.840> see<00:03:43.020> how<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.410> handles<00:03:43.620> so

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
this ship and see how it handles so

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.400 
this ship and see how it handles so
we'll<00:03:44.310> move<00:03:44.490> up<00:03:44.670> into<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.210> cockpit<00:03:45.600> well<00:03:46.110> gain

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
we'll move up into the cockpit well gain

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.900 
we'll move up into the cockpit well gain
access<00:03:46.650> we<00:03:46.950> want<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.220> shut<00:03:47.460> this<00:03:47.550> door<00:03:47.730> behind

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
access we want to shut this door behind

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.270 
access we want to shut this door behind
us<00:03:48.180> first<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.720> then<00:03:49.470> we've<00:03:49.650> got<00:03:49.830> access<00:03:50.010> so

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
us first and then we've got access so

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.650 
us first and then we've got access so
you<00:03:50.310> can<00:03:50.430> see<00:03:50.670> we've<00:03:50.790> got<00:03:50.820> quite<00:03:51.240> a<00:03:51.300> good<00:03:51.600> bit

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
you can see we've got quite a good bit

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.180 
you can see we've got quite a good bit
of<00:03:51.780> visibility<00:03:51.930> we<00:03:52.410> got<00:03:52.560> visibly<00:03:52.800> chop

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
of visibility we got visibly chop

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.470 
of visibility we got visibly chop
through<00:03:53.340> them<00:03:53.520> windows<00:03:53.850> we've<00:03:54.090> got<00:03:54.210> a<00:03:54.240> nice

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
through them windows we've got a nice

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.840 
through them windows we've got a nice
front<00:03:54.750> area<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.470> left<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.490> right<00:03:56.610> we<00:03:56.730> don't

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
front area and left and right we don't

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.580 
front area and left and right we don't
got<00:03:57.000> much<00:03:57.120> down<00:03:57.360> visibility<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.050> can<00:03:58.380> also

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
got much down visibility you can also

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.590 
got much down visibility you can also
see<00:03:58.980> me<00:03:59.430> sitting<00:03:59.760> here<00:03:59.790> in<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.150> cockpit<00:04:00.510> at

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
see me sitting here in the cockpit at

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.760 
see me sitting here in the cockpit at
the<00:04:00.660> front<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.020> always<00:04:01.290> thought<00:04:01.440> was<00:04:01.590> pretty

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
the front I always thought was pretty

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.770 
the front I always thought was pretty
cool<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.610> we<00:04:02.640> can<00:04:02.850> actually<00:04:02.940> begin<00:04:03.240> to

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
cool and we can actually begin to

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.570 
cool and we can actually begin to
accelerate<00:04:04.080> so<00:04:04.770> we've<00:04:04.890> got<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.130> massive

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
accelerate so we've got that massive

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.030 
accelerate so we've got that massive
large<00:04:06.030> industrial<00:04:06.600> power<00:04:07.140> pack<00:04:07.410> at<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.710> back

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
large industrial power pack at the back

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.500 
large industrial power pack at the back
that<00:04:08.400> still<00:04:08.610> allow<00:04:08.820> us<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.060> increase<00:04:09.390> her

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
that still allow us to increase her

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
that still allow us to increase her
speed<00:04:09.630> where<00:04:09.900> if<00:04:09.990> actually<00:04:10.260> see<00:04:10.410> we're

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
speed where if actually see we're

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.740 
speed where if actually see we're
already<00:04:10.800> over<00:04:10.980> 104<00:04:11.640> meters<00:04:11.880> per<00:04:12.030> second<00:04:12.420> and

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
already over 104 meters per second and

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.320 
already over 104 meters per second and
we<00:04:12.930> can<00:04:12.960> get<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.710> places<00:04:14.040> extremely<00:04:14.940> fast<00:04:15.210> with

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
we can get to places extremely fast with

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.780 
we can get to places extremely fast with
this<00:04:15.510> power<00:04:15.810> pack<00:04:16.080> -<00:04:16.710> the<00:04:17.190> feature<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.670> we

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
this power pack - the feature that we

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.760 
this power pack - the feature that we
don't<00:04:18.030> actually<00:04:18.210> have<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.630> jump<00:04:18.960> drive<00:04:19.140> I<00:04:19.470> could

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
don't actually have a jump drive I could

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.380 
don't actually have a jump drive I could
add<00:04:19.920> a<00:04:20.130> smaller<00:04:20.489> jump<00:04:20.670> drive<00:04:20.940> maybe<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.270> this

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
add a smaller jump drive maybe to this

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.390 
add a smaller jump drive maybe to this
in<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.690> future<00:04:21.840> but<00:04:22.230> we'll<00:04:22.680> have<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.860> see<00:04:23.220> just

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
in the future but we'll have to see just

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.140 
in the future but we'll have to see just
how<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:23.880> goes

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
how it goes

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.090 
how it goes
anyway<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.230> I<00:04:25.320> think<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.620> guys<00:04:25.740> watching

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
anyway and I think you guys watching

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.720 
anyway and I think you guys watching
hopefully

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
hopefully

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.790 
hopefully
