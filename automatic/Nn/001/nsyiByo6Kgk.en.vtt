have<00:01:25.920> another<00:01:26.159> barracks<00:01:26.580> anyway<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:26.939> it's

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
have another barracks anyway so it's

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.160 
have another barracks anyway so it's
probably<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.450> end<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> world<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.080> him

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
probably at the end of the world for him

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.330 
probably at the end of the world for him
and<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.650> actually<00:01:28.710> sending<00:01:29.009> up<00:01:29.130> another

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.679 
and it's actually sending up another
warm<00:01:29.579> will<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.850> maybe<00:01:30.090> skip<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.540> some

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
warm will so maybe skip it up some

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.030 
warm will so maybe skip it up some
towers<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.110> try<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.259> pay<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.619> longer

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

game because if Ted Scouts is attaching

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.330 
game because if Ted Scouts is attaching
that's<00:01:34.680> pretty<00:01:34.860> much<00:01:35.009> over<00:01:36.860> Ted<00:01:37.860> must<00:01:38.070> realize

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that's pretty much over Ted must realize

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.830 
that's pretty much over Ted must realize
by<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.670> grubby<00:01:39.000> has<00:01:39.150> an<00:01:39.240> expansion<00:01:39.509> even

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
if he hasn't scouted it because grubby

than two minutes and see gummies all

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.219 
than two minutes and see gummies all
made<00:01:46.530> was<00:01:46.710> killed<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.329> though

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
made was killed and I think and though

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
made was killed and I think and though
Ted<00:01:49.649> does<00:01:49.799> manage<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.070> scout<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.060> he's

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
Ted does manage to scout it now and he's

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.190 
Ted does manage to scout it now and he's
probably<00:01:51.329> kicking<00:01:51.570> himself<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.020> didn't

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
probably kicking himself it didn't

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.600 
probably kicking himself it didn't
scouted<00:01:52.530> earlier<00:01:54.290> this<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:56.070> grunt<00:01:56.310> just

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
scouted earlier this the grunt just

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.490 
scouted earlier this the grunt just
being<00:01:56.759> forced<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.119> run<00:01:57.450> away<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.689> bit<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
being forced to run away a bit and I

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.230 
being forced to run away a bit and I
think<00:01:58.710> um<00:01:58.860> Ted's<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.640> bringing<00:01:59.850> this<00:01:59.909> entire

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
think um Ted's good bringing this entire

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.209 
think um Ted's good bringing this entire
army<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.049> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> try<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.680> make<00:02:02.070> one

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
army here and going to try and make one

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.999 
army here and going to try and make one
decisive<00:02:02.490> push<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.469> he's<00:02:04.469> probably<00:02:04.680> cast<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
decisive push and he's probably cast a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
decisive push and he's probably cast a
false<00:02:05.219> armor<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.670> couple<00:02:05.880> more<00:02:05.969> units<00:02:06.299> and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
going down it's because I'm a bit of

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.880 
going down it's because I'm a bit of
block<00:02:18.840> there<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.170> that's<00:02:19.290> golf<00:02:19.440> protection

being<00:02:20.069> used<00:02:20.250> by<00:02:20.430> grubby<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.090> looks<00:02:21.209> like

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
being used by grubby and it looks like

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.490 
being used by grubby and it looks like
he's<00:02:21.420> actually<00:02:21.510> go<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:21.989> surround<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.349> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
he's actually go for a surround of the

he's actually go for a surround of the
lit<00:02:22.680> she<00:02:22.830> doesn't<00:02:23.099> quite<00:02:23.250> get<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.519> but<00:02:23.790> it

lit she doesn't quite get it but it

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.759 
lit she doesn't quite get it but it
looks<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:24.780> you'll<00:02:24.989> still<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.260> able<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.440> chase

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
looks like you'll still be able to chase

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.350 
looks like you'll still be able to chase
down<00:02:25.800> with<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.129> blade<00:02:26.310> master<00:02:26.489> maybe<00:02:26.819> well

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
down with the blade master maybe well

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.839 
down with the blade master maybe well
I'm<00:02:27.569> getting<00:02:28.019> ass<00:02:28.290> grunts<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.620> tank<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.489> bit<00:02:29.610> more

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
I'm getting ass grunts a tank a bit more

I'm getting ass grunts a tank a bit more
of<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> damage<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.200> isn't<00:02:31.470> going<00:02:31.590> to

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
of the damage but this isn't going to

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.589

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
the hero level advantage I think Ted's

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.320 
the hero level advantage I think Ted's
has<00:02:41.129> so<00:02:41.280> many<00:02:41.370> units<00:02:41.700> at<00:02:41.849> this<00:02:41.940> point<00:02:42.180> that

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
has so many units at this point that

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.350 
has so many units at this point that
grab<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.080> really<00:02:43.290> going<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.440> need<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:43.799> a

try and take out this litigant it is
frost<00:03:31.980> armor<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:32.370> looks<00:03:32.489> like<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.670> does<00:03:32.790> go

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
frost armor but looks like it does go

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.150 
frost armor but looks like it does go
down<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.450> that's<00:03:34.170> going<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.470> mean<00:03:34.590> level<00:03:34.920> five

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160

one army and i'm i'm surprised i wonder

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.090 
one army and i'm i'm surprised i wonder
if<00:03:42.030> Ted<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:42.569> now<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.260> now<00:03:43.410> so<00:03:43.560> attacking<00:03:43.859> a

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
if Ted is now so is now so attacking a

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.740 
if Ted is now so is now so attacking a
quite<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.549> while<00:03:44.700> ago<00:03:44.910> actually<00:03:45.060> whereas

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
quite a while ago actually whereas

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.250 
quite a while ago actually whereas
grubby<00:03:45.959> has<00:03:46.139> not<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:48.060> um<00:03:48.299> if<00:03:48.660> tech<00:03:49.230> can

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
grubby has not and so um if tech can

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.569 
grubby has not and so um if tech can
hold<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:49.680> out<00:03:49.859> for<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.069> bit<00:03:50.190> longer<00:03:50.310> he<00:03:50.549> can

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
hold this out for a bit longer he can

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.819 
hold this out for a bit longer he can
probably<00:03:50.760> gum<00:03:51.239> just<00:03:52.170> went<00:03:52.319> in<00:03:52.500> terms<00:03:52.709> of

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
probably gum just went in terms of

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.860 
probably gum just went in terms of
attrition<00:03:53.190> or<00:03:53.370> he<00:03:53.489> could<00:03:53.639> even<00:03:53.760> go<00:03:54.720> for

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
attrition or he could even go for

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.809 
attrition or he could even go for
something<00:03:55.049> like<00:03:55.380> um<00:03:55.530> garg's<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.549> go<00:03:56.700> we

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
something like um garg's and go we

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.069 
something like um garg's and go we
wouldn't<00:03:57.060> really<00:03:57.150> have<00:03:57.359> any<00:03:57.569> response<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:57.959> it

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
wouldn't really have any response to it

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.360 
wouldn't really have any response to it
I<00:03:58.170> mean<00:03:58.260> he'd<00:03:58.440> have<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.590> couple<00:03:58.920> headhunters

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
I mean he'd have a couple headhunters

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.849 
I mean he'd have a couple headhunters
but<00:04:00.060> nothing<00:04:00.299> significant<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:03.739> grab<00:04:04.739> he's

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:56.529 
coming up for grabbing now maybe he

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:57.990 
coming up for grabbing now maybe he
doesn't<00:04:56.740> just<00:04:56.919> want<00:04:56.979> to<00:04:57.159> have<00:04:57.370> Gehrig's

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
doesn't just want to have Gehrig's

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.360 
doesn't just want to have Gehrig's
produce<00:04:58.270> because<00:04:58.419> obviously<00:04:58.830> between<00:04:59.830> a

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
produce because obviously between a

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.570 
produce because obviously between a
graveyard<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.539> a<00:05:01.889> krippcat<00:05:02.889> already<00:05:03.340> has<00:05:03.460> all

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
graveyard and a krippcat already has all

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.040 
graveyard and a krippcat already has all
the<00:05:03.699> required<00:05:03.969> technologies<00:05:04.509> and<00:05:04.659> so<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:04.900> be

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
the required technologies and so that be

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.959 
the required technologies and so that be
um<00:05:05.379> you<00:05:05.740> can<00:05:05.860> get<00:05:05.979> out<00:05:06.099> your<00:05:06.340> first<00:05:06.520> guard<00:05:06.729> so

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:06.969 
um you can get out your first guard so

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:09.689 
um you can get out your first guard so
quickly<00:05:07.409> which<00:05:08.409> you<00:05:08.560> see<00:05:08.680> obviously<00:05:09.069> very

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
quickly which you see obviously very

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.999 
quickly which you see obviously very
frequently<00:05:10.060> against<00:05:10.300> self<00:05:10.539> but<00:05:11.349> I<00:05:11.379> guess<00:05:11.889> in

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
frequently against self but I guess in

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:13.980 
frequently against self but I guess in
this<00:05:12.099> case<00:05:12.159> a<00:05:12.340> good<00:05:12.580> work<00:05:12.729> versus<00:05:13.150> go<00:05:13.870> be

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
this case a good work versus go be

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.999 
this case a good work versus go be
considering<00:05:14.379> that<00:05:14.439> grubby<00:05:14.650> doesn't<00:05:14.919> have

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
considering that grubby doesn't have

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.860 
considering that grubby doesn't have
them<00:05:15.219> the<00:05:15.490> required<00:05:15.879> tech<00:05:16.120> for<00:05:16.330> about<00:05:16.479> writers

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
them the required tech for about writers

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.559 
them the required tech for about writers
and<00:05:20.400> meanwhile<00:05:21.400> grunts<00:05:21.969> to<00:05:22.089> sort<00:05:22.270> of<00:05:22.330> running

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
and meanwhile grunts to sort of running

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.059 
and meanwhile grunts to sort of running
around<00:05:22.689> obviously<00:05:23.259> there's<00:05:23.620> no<00:05:23.740> real<00:05:23.889> point

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
around obviously there's no real point

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:26.100 
around obviously there's no real point
to<00:05:24.219> creeping<00:05:24.520> anymore<00:05:24.879> because<00:05:25.389> grubby

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
to creeping anymore because grubby

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.110 
to creeping anymore because grubby
doesn't<00:05:26.439> have<00:05:26.529> a<00:05:26.560> second<00:05:26.919> hero<00:05:27.099> and<00:05:27.339> is<00:05:27.759> the

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
doesn't have a second hero and is the

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.899 
doesn't have a second hero and is the
zero<00:05:28.360> so<00:05:28.539> over<00:05:28.779> level<00:05:29.020> five<00:05:29.229> and<00:05:29.729> grubby<00:05:30.729> just

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
zero so over level five and grubby just

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.089 
zero so over level five and grubby just
taking<00:05:31.180> out<00:05:31.270> these<00:05:31.389> fiends<00:05:32.080> sort<00:05:32.529> of<00:05:32.589> so

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
taking out these fiends sort of so

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.309 
taking out these fiends sort of so
easily<00:05:33.310> and<00:05:33.639> a<00:05:33.789> nice<00:05:34.240> crit<00:05:34.779> therefore<00:05:35.080> gravity

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
easily and a nice crit therefore gravity

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:36.959 
easily and a nice crit therefore gravity
as<00:05:35.409> well<00:05:35.560> are<00:05:36.039> getting<00:05:36.339> them<00:05:36.430> even<00:05:36.639> closer<00:05:36.789> to

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
as well are getting them even closer to

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.860 
as well are getting them even closer to
level<00:05:37.180> six<00:05:37.449> and<00:05:39.000> grab<00:05:40.000> me<00:05:40.089> now<00:05:40.210> taking<00:05:40.569> as<00:05:40.689> well

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
level six and grab me now taking as well

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.339 
level six and grab me now taking as well
so<00:05:41.349> uh<00:05:41.469> I<00:05:42.449> think<00:05:43.449> it<00:05:43.569> would<00:05:43.839> only<00:05:43.960> be<00:05:44.110> a<00:05:44.229> matter

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
so uh I think it would only be a matter

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.170 
so uh I think it would only be a matter
of<00:05:44.469> time<00:05:44.740> now<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:44.979> think<00:05:45.099> Ted<00:05:45.550> surface<00:05:45.909> came

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
of time now I think Ted surface came

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.809 
of time now I think Ted surface came
away<00:05:46.389> in<00:05:46.539> a<00:05:46.629> sense<00:05:46.839> I<00:05:47.589> mean<00:05:47.800> he<00:05:48.189> still<00:05:48.250> has<00:05:48.580> the

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:48.819 
away in a sense I mean he still has the

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:50.159 
away in a sense I mean he still has the
possibility<00:05:49.000> to<00:05:49.330> win<00:05:49.569> but<00:05:49.779> it's<00:05:49.930> gonna<00:05:50.050> be<00:05:50.139> a

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
possibility to win but it's gonna be a

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.200 
possibility to win but it's gonna be a
lot<00:05:50.259> harder<00:05:50.409> for<00:05:50.560> him<00:05:50.830> than<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:51.129> was<00:05:51.279> say<00:05:52.000> I'm

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
lot harder for him than it was say I'm

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.990 
lot harder for him than it was say I'm
10<00:05:52.509> minutes<00:05:52.539> ago<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.169> grubby<00:05:54.099> now<00:05:54.310> salving

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
10 minutes ago and grubby now salving

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.670 
10 minutes ago and grubby now salving
and<00:05:55.149> clara<00:05:55.389> ding<00:05:55.569> up<00:05:55.750> and<00:05:56.050> he<00:05:56.289> is<00:05:56.409> invisible

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
and clara ding up and he is invisible

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.679 
and clara ding up and he is invisible
but<00:05:57.399> i<00:05:57.430> wonder<00:05:57.849> if<00:05:57.969> ted<00:05:58.120> has<00:05:58.270> bought<00:05:58.509> another

00:05:58.679 --> 00:05:58.689 
but i wonder if ted has bought another

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:00.779 
but i wonder if ted has bought another
dust<00:05:58.990> had<00:05:59.289> no<00:05:59.620> he<00:05:59.740> hasn't<00:06:00.069> had<00:06:00.189> generally<00:06:00.639> bus

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
dust had no he hasn't had generally bus

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.119 
dust had no he hasn't had generally bus
a<00:06:00.819> lot<00:06:01.029> of<00:06:01.180> dust<00:06:01.360> but<00:06:01.990> um<00:06:02.139> he<00:06:02.319> hasn't<00:06:02.560> he<00:06:02.889> hasn't

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.129 
a lot of dust but um he hasn't he hasn't

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.050 
a lot of dust but um he hasn't he hasn't
in<00:06:03.189> this<00:06:03.339> game<00:06:03.520> really<00:06:03.639> I<00:06:03.759> guess<00:06:03.909> because

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
in this game really I guess because

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.700 
in this game really I guess because
economies<00:06:04.689> and<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:04.960> stretched<00:06:05.259> by<00:06:05.409> producing

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
economies and so stretched by producing

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.589 
economies and so stretched by producing
off<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:05.949> fiends<00:06:06.310> and<00:06:06.460> had<00:06:06.969> now<00:06:07.120> taking<00:06:07.449> it<00:06:07.539> to

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
off the fiends and had now taking it to

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.899 
off the fiends and had now taking it to
tier<00:06:07.689> 3<00:06:07.960> actually<00:06:08.289> as<00:06:08.379> well<00:06:08.529> so<00:06:09.069> maybe<00:06:09.729> he

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
tier 3 actually as well so maybe he

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.909 
tier 3 actually as well so maybe he
wants<00:06:10.330> an<00:06:10.419> orb<00:06:10.599> which<00:06:10.839> is<00:06:10.990> fairly<00:06:11.259> sensible<00:06:11.680> to

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
wants an orb which is fairly sensible to

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.950 
wants an orb which is fairly sensible to
loose<00:06:12.310> the<00:06:12.550> massive<00:06:12.939> armored<00:06:13.240> blade<00:06:13.779> master

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
loose the massive armored blade master

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.260 
loose the massive armored blade master
was<00:06:14.169> just<00:06:14.319> like<00:06:14.500> 8.2<00:06:15.099> at<00:06:15.279> the<00:06:15.370> moment<00:06:15.669> which<00:06:16.089> is

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
was just like 8.2 at the moment which is

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.089 
was just like 8.2 at the moment which is
just<00:06:16.389> so<00:06:16.539> much<00:06:16.659> damage<00:06:16.930> production<00:06:17.500> it's

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
just so much damage production it's

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:19.589 
just so much damage production it's
unreal<00:06:18.580> and<00:06:18.759> our<00:06:18.879> death<00:06:19.029> knight<00:06:19.210> is<00:06:19.330> coming

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
unreal and our death knight is coming

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.329 
unreal and our death knight is coming
out<00:06:19.689> from<00:06:20.080> tetanus<00:06:20.500> could<00:06:20.800> be<00:06:20.860> out<00:06:20.949> any<00:06:21.099> second

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:21.339 
out from tetanus could be out any second

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.139 
out from tetanus could be out any second
it<00:06:21.399> might<00:06:21.460> actually<00:06:21.550> be<00:06:21.789> able<00:06:21.879> to<00:06:21.969> really

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:22.149 
it might actually be able to really

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:23.879 
it might actually be able to really
enough<00:06:22.270> to<00:06:22.300> save<00:06:22.539> this<00:06:22.689> fiend<00:06:22.960> but<00:06:23.770> grew<00:06:23.860> up

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
enough to save this fiend but grew up

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:25.589 
enough to save this fiend but grew up
yeah<00:06:24.219> and<00:06:24.370> it<00:06:24.490> doesn't<00:06:24.819> but<00:06:25.060> grubby<00:06:25.300> dozen

such<00:06:27.310> a<00:06:27.339> massive<00:06:27.580> tier<00:06:27.909> 1<00:06:28.449> army<00:06:28.750> now<00:06:28.899> that<00:06:29.529> had

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
such a massive tier 1 army now that had

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.860 
such a massive tier 1 army now that had
really<00:06:30.729> going<00:06:30.849> to<00:06:30.909> find<00:06:31.060> it<00:06:31.149> hard<00:06:31.300> to<00:06:31.449> continue

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
really going to find it hard to continue

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.480 
really going to find it hard to continue
fighting<00:06:32.169> in<00:06:32.379> this<00:06:32.469> game<00:06:32.649> I<00:06:32.680> think

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
fighting in this game I think

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.850 
fighting in this game I think
he<00:06:35.490> needs<00:06:35.850> is<00:06:36.210> a<00:06:36.360> slaughterhouse<00:06:36.840> there<00:06:37.200> yeah

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
he needs is a slaughterhouse there yeah

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.430 
he needs is a slaughterhouse there yeah
the<00:06:38.010> slaughterhouse<00:06:38.550> so<00:06:39.360> I'm<00:06:39.570> a<00:06:39.840> couple<00:06:40.230> of

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
the slaughterhouse so I'm a couple of

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.480 
the slaughterhouse so I'm a couple of
statues<00:06:40.860> and<00:06:41.100> then<00:06:41.220> later<00:06:41.820> on<00:06:43.370> Destro's<00:06:44.370> would

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
statues and then later on Destro's would

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.800 
statues and then later on Destro's would
be<00:06:44.580> quite<00:06:44.760> nice<00:06:44.910> in<00:06:45.060> this<00:06:45.150> situation<00:06:47.210> but<00:06:48.210> by

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
be quite nice in this situation but by

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.290 
be quite nice in this situation but by
that<00:06:48.930> for<00:06:49.050> it<00:06:49.230> Graeme<00:06:49.470> might<00:06:49.650> have<00:06:49.800> a<00:06:49.830> bit<00:06:49.980> of<00:06:50.040> a

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
that for it Graeme might have a bit of a

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.700 
that for it Graeme might have a bit of a
0<00:06:51.300> to<00:06:51.450> a<00:06:51.480> matter<00:06:51.870> of<00:06:51.960> a<00:06:52.020> couple<00:06:52.050> Raiders<00:06:52.560> which

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
0 to a matter of a couple Raiders which

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.710 
0 to a matter of a couple Raiders which
would<00:06:52.860> be<00:06:53.010> sort<00:06:53.790> of<00:06:53.880> various<00:06:54.180> camp<00:06:54.360> especially

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
would be sort of various camp especially

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.420 
would be sort of various camp especially
our<00:06:54.870> Raiders<00:06:55.380> and<00:06:55.500> grunts<00:06:55.890> counter<00:06:56.220> are

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
our Raiders and grunts counter are

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.770 
our Raiders and grunts counter are
fiends<00:06:56.850> so<00:06:57.000> well<00:06:57.180> because<00:06:57.270> you<00:06:57.420> can<00:06:57.540> just<00:06:57.570> and

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
fiends so well because you can just and

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.390 
fiends so well because you can just and
stare<00:06:57.960> at<00:06:58.080> them<00:06:58.200> and<00:06:58.320> then<00:06:58.440> the<00:06:58.980> grunts<00:06:59.250> can

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
stare at them and then the grunts can

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.710 
stare at them and then the grunts can
just<00:06:59.520> pound<00:06:59.730> on<00:06:59.880> them<00:07:00.090> endure<00:07:00.330> stuff<00:07:00.480> not

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
just pound on them endure stuff not

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.940 
just pound on them endure stuff not
really<00:07:00.930> much<00:07:01.050> you<00:07:01.200> can<00:07:01.350> do<00:07:01.440> because<00:07:01.650> your<00:07:01.800> or

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
really much you can do because your or

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.670 
really much you can do because your or
urim<00:07:02.760> and<00:07:02.790> hurt<00:07:03.540> leora<00:07:03.810> can't<00:07:04.080> come<00:07:04.500> into

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
urim and hurt leora can't come into

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.180 
urim and hurt leora can't come into
effect<00:07:04.770> and<00:07:05.960> Ted<00:07:06.960> only<00:07:07.230> with<00:07:07.380> three<00:07:07.830> fiends

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
effect and Ted only with three fiends

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.250 
effect and Ted only with three fiends
now<00:07:08.370> he<00:07:08.430> had<00:07:08.700> so<00:07:08.880> many<00:07:09.030> and<00:07:09.300> a<00:07:09.570> bunch<00:07:09.870> of<00:07:09.990> grunts

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
now he had so many and a bunch of grunts

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.250 
now he had so many and a bunch of grunts
as<00:07:10.380> well<00:07:10.530> but<00:07:11.250> um<00:07:11.910> no<00:07:12.420> more<00:07:12.630> it<00:07:12.780> seems<00:07:12.990> and

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:13.260 
as well but um no more it seems and

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.810 
as well but um no more it seems and
their<00:07:13.740> grubby<00:07:13.920> now<00:07:14.070> rebuilding<00:07:14.400> with<00:07:14.550> ulcers

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
their grubby now rebuilding with ulcers

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.270 
their grubby now rebuilding with ulcers
I<00:07:14.940> guess<00:07:15.060> you<00:07:15.180> go<00:07:15.480> for<00:07:15.630> a<00:07:15.660> second<00:07:15.930> hero<00:07:16.080> um<00:07:16.380> I'd

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 
I guess you go for a second hero um I'd

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.800 
I guess you go for a second hero um I'd
say<00:07:17.430> shadow<00:07:17.670> hundred<00:07:17.970> probably<00:07:18.300> the<00:07:18.390> best<00:07:18.570> bet

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
say shadow hundred probably the best bet

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.180 
say shadow hundred probably the best bet
because<00:07:19.260> he's<00:07:19.530> not<00:07:19.620> gonna<00:07:19.770> really<00:07:19.890> have<00:07:20.040> time

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
because he's not gonna really have time

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.160 
because he's not gonna really have time
to<00:07:20.220> creep<00:07:20.670> up<00:07:20.760> with<00:07:20.910> tauren<00:07:21.120> chieftain<00:07:21.170> but

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.170 
to creep up with tauren chieftain but

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.570 
to creep up with tauren chieftain but
tauren<00:07:22.680> chieftain<00:07:22.710> certainly<00:07:23.310> could<00:07:23.490> be

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 
tauren chieftain certainly could be

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.040 
tauren chieftain certainly could be
viable<00:07:23.790> because<00:07:24.000> stomp<00:07:24.360> it's<00:07:24.510> so<00:07:24.630> nice

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.050 
viable because stomp it's so nice

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.840 
viable because stomp it's so nice
against<00:07:25.350> fiends<00:07:25.710> if<00:07:26.010> you<00:07:26.370> can<00:07:26.580> get<00:07:26.760> the

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:26.850 
against fiends if you can get the

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.880 
against fiends if you can get the
positioning<00:07:27.300> which<00:07:27.420> lab<00:07:28.080> probably<00:07:28.620> usually

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:28.890 
positioning which lab probably usually

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.810 
positioning which lab probably usually
can<00:07:29.040> and<00:07:29.780> um<00:07:31.220> obviously<00:07:32.220> I<00:07:32.400> death<00:07:32.670> knight

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:32.820 
can and um obviously I death knight

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.980 
can and um obviously I death knight
being<00:07:33.000> focused<00:07:33.300> on<00:07:33.360> first<00:07:33.630> it's<00:07:33.780> such<00:07:33.870> an

being focused on first it's such an

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.940 
being focused on first it's such an
obvious<00:07:34.080> target<00:07:34.380> because<00:07:34.650> it's<00:07:34.830> the<00:07:34.920> only

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:34.950 
obvious target because it's the only

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.050 
obvious target because it's the only
thing<00:07:35.160> that<00:07:35.310> really<00:07:35.430> can't<00:07:35.670> be<00:07:35.730> healed<00:07:35.970> in

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.060 
thing that really can't be healed in

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.170 
thing that really can't be healed in
this<00:07:36.180> army<00:07:36.450> and<00:07:37.460> without<00:07:38.460> the<00:07:38.640> aura<00:07:38.820> as<00:07:39.000> well

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
this army and without the aura as well

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.060 
this army and without the aura as well
it's<00:07:39.390> so<00:07:39.540> easy<00:07:39.660> to<00:07:39.780> chase<00:07:39.990> down<00:07:40.020> by<00:07:40.500> Lester

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.070 
it's so easy to chase down by Lester

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:45.770 
it's so easy to chase down by Lester
with<00:07:41.190> boots<00:07:41.400> and<00:07:41.700> been<00:07:42.540> a<00:07:42.570> man<00:07:42.780> as<00:07:42.990> well<00:07:43.200> but
