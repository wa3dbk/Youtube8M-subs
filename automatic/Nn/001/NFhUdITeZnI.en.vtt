again sorry I know it was a surprise and
right<00:00:28.410> now<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.859> little<00:00:28.980> physical<00:00:29.640> right

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
right now it's a little physical right

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.350 
right now it's a little physical right
we're<00:00:30.689> doing<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.960> fairly<00:00:31.410> physically<00:00:32.180> with<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
we're doing it fairly physically with it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.880 
we're doing it fairly physically with it
there's<00:00:33.570> some<00:00:33.690> physicality<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.649> but

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
there's some physicality with it but

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.319 
there's some physicality with it but
ideally<00:00:36.590> you<00:00:37.590> don't<00:00:37.710> need<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.090> once<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.210> get

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
ideally you don't need it once you get

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.490 
ideally you don't need it once you get
used<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.809> you'll<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.050> able<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
away they punch you and you do this

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.630 
away they punch you and you do this
they'll<00:00:54.960> break<00:00:55.170> their<00:00:55.440> wrist<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.949> there's<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
they'll break their wrist if there's a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.310 
they'll break their wrist if there's a
little<00:00:57.030> bit<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.180> alignment<00:00:57.570> off<00:00:57.660> it'll<00:00:58.140> break

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
little bit of alignment off it'll break

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.920 
little bit of alignment off it'll break
the<00:00:58.379> wrist<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> contact<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.329> feels

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the wrist on the contact and that feels

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.630 
the wrist on the contact and that feels
really<00:01:04.170> odd<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.409> compared<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.189> normal<00:01:05.519> then

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
really odd that compared to normal then

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.789 
really odd that compared to normal then
because<00:01:06.210> normally<00:01:06.689> normally<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:07.350> doing

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
because normally normally I'm doing

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.620 
because normally normally I'm doing
other<00:01:07.920> things<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.090> he's<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.420> there

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
other things so like he's right there

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.090 
other things so like he's right there
and<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.110> full<00:01:10.350> body<00:01:10.560> breathing<00:01:10.830> at<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and I'm not full body breathing at the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.620 
and I'm not full body breathing at the
second<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> let<00:01:11.610> my<00:01:11.700> breath<00:01:11.909> come<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.420> push

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
second I let my breath come up so push

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:22.310 
second I let my breath come up so push
me<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:13.729> there's<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:16.729> go<00:01:17.729> ahead<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.869> it's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
me now there's that go ahead and it's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.080 
me now there's that go ahead and it's
got<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> real<00:01:22.710> different<00:01:23.159> feel<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.640> come<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
got a real different feel to it come and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.370 
got a real different feel to it come and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
effort into this I'm not trying that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.450 
effort into this I'm not trying that
using<00:01:33.240> strain<00:01:33.600> back<00:01:33.960> against<00:01:34.470> tone<00:01:34.650> okay<00:01:35.400> so

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
using strain back against tone okay so

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.069 
using strain back against tone okay so
before<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> next<00:01:36.420> exercise<00:01:36.600> is

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
turn sideways so they'll be fine a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.340 
turn sideways so they'll be fine a
little<00:01:46.950> bit<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:48.210> whole<00:01:48.570> body<00:01:48.780> breathing<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
little bit the whole body breathing and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.740 
little bit the whole body breathing and
then<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.490> extra<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.180> we're<00:01:51.299> talking<00:01:51.659> about

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
then that extra that we're talking about

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.260 
then that extra that we're talking about
of<00:01:52.049> I'm<00:01:52.259> gonna<00:01:52.320> increase<00:01:52.680> volume<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.579> then

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
of I'm gonna increase volume and then

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.590 
of I'm gonna increase volume and then
I'm<00:01:54.390> gonna<00:01:54.570> focus<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.530> volume<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:59.600> I'm

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
I'm gonna focus that volume and I'm

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.700 
I'm gonna focus that volume and I'm
doing<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.899> slow<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.290> careful<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.680> because

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
doing it slow and careful here because

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.760 
doing it slow and careful here because
obviously<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.219> could<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.570> go<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.380> then

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
obviously I could just and go and then

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.440 
obviously I could just and go and then
have<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.189> volume<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:05.820> I'm<00:02:06.030> being<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.420> little

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
have the volume but I'm being a little

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.749 
have the volume but I'm being a little
safer<00:02:06.960> than<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> little<00:02:07.649> more<00:02:07.920> methodical

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
safer than that a little more methodical

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.900 
safer than that a little more methodical
about<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.090> at<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.479> moment

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.210 

you<00:02:14.910> feel<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.240> this<00:02:16.020> how<00:02:16.980> would<00:02:17.040> you

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
you feel that this how would you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:28.940 
you feel that this how would you
describe<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:18.770> come<00:02:19.770> back<00:02:19.920> again<00:02:27.260> but<00:02:28.260> in
