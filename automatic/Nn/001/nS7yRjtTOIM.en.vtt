00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 do not shut up london 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.970
 in 3 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.250
 yes 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.430
 and me 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.430
 look at me 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.420
 Let's see 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.699
 how are you welcome as you can see 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.340
 today we are on the beach recording and I wanted to 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.530
 take this day that I'm going to spend 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.870
 here to also make a video 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.379
 talking about some of the things 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.110
 that I carry a beach bag is 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.979
 as you can see is my bag is a bag 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.829
 transparent plastic roses here 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.649
 in front of 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.079
 basically the things that would take me 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.720
 in this bag or the beach 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.970
 they fit perfectly in this bust I want 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.520
 show only because sometimes we carry 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.920
 unnecessary things to the beach and maybe 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.220
 what I wear can give them an idea 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.350
 you ballack show off 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.540
 replace some of the ones that I carry 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.490
 with others that you would condemn them more 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.800
 but it 's pretty much a guide for 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.810
 you an idea that maybe some 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.280
 little thing you can take I'm very 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.660
 excited because I know I 'm going to 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.560
 spend very much since the beach 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.649
 Of course I will teach you 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.640
 something cool to see then let's start 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.830
 to teach alone 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.930
 something necessary is a towel for 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.040
 get closer and some economic calipsos 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.040
 to walk on the sand 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.340
 although almost always I wear my suit 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.700
 bathroom under the clothes on this occasion 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.920
 I have two options both aeropostal and 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.160
 12 why choose me tell me in the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.290
 comments which one do you like the most and for 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.090
 protect both my hair and my face 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.090
 I wear this hat with me 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.180
 I do not know about you but I get out of the water with 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.800
 hair made a mess that's why it's 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.750
 good idea to bring a styling cream 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.690
 that smells as rich as honey 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.210
 with the sun dehydrates so I have 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.900
 with me my favorite drink although you can 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.900
 be water too 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.299
 remember the hair made a mess 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.360
 for that I also carry a brush 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.610
 little wands clean you ask 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.230
 but before I eat I like to kill 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.230
 some germs and my hands 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.630
 I also carry something small and easy to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.020
 load you know by the time you get that 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.020
 hungry 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.840
 and also my skin gets dehydrated with 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.470
 the sun has my favorite cream with me 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.239
 because it leaves my skin moisturized soft 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.239
 and smelling good 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.370
 something that we all have to carry is a 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.879
 sunscreen 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.680
 and some shorts for those 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.680
 moments when I get out of the water 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.490
 some dark glasses to protect my 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.920
 eyes of the sun 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.760
 It also has this little bag with 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.120
 some things like lip merchant a 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.540
 deodorant believe me I will not need the 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.370
 mask and a bar with color if I'm going 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.370
 to another place after the beach 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.520
 and talking about going to another place after 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.370
 the beach we will not go with the clothes of 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.130
 That's why I wear this long dress 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.210
 for this occasion another option could be 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.210
 A long skirt 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.709
 and this has been all for today I hope that 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.170
 you really liked what you saw and what 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.120

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.329

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.880
