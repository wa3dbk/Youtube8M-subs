00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
those photos lined up nicely I think

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.910 
those photos lined up nicely I think
you're<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> like<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.320> because<00:00:28.590> now

you're going to like this because now

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.669 
you're going to like this because now

even so 1 tap take a photo that's
probably<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> my<00:00:37.950> favorite<00:00:38.370> features<00:00:38.520> of

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
probably one of my favorite features of

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.549 
probably one of my favorite features of
this<00:00:39.030> app<00:00:39.090> being<00:00:39.570> able<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:39.899> tap<00:00:40.230> anywhere

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
this app being able to just tap anywhere

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.709 
this app being able to just tap anywhere
on<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.920> screen<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.309> take<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> photo<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.570> we

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
on the screen and take a photo but we

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.380 
on the screen and take a photo but we
also<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.230> shake<00:00:43.860> detection<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.940> if<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.210> was

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
also have shake detection so if I was

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.840 
also have shake detection so if I was
holding<00:00:45.660> my<00:00:46.410> phone<00:00:46.440> trying<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.280> take<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> steady

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
holding my phone trying to take a steady

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.110 
holding my phone trying to take a steady
picture<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.340> can't<00:00:50.879> get

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
picture and and it's just I can't get

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.959 
picture and and it's just I can't get
steady<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.079> i'm<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> boat<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.520> car<00:00:53.789> or

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
steady and i'm on a boat or in a car or

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.600 
steady and i'm on a boat or in a car or
something<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:55.320> when<00:00:55.680> i<00:00:55.710> finally

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
something like that now when i finally

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.090 
something like that now when i finally
get<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.000> still<00:00:57.449> motion<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.710> goes<00:00:58.890> ahead

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
get that still motion it just goes ahead

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.459 
get that still motion it just goes ahead
and<00:00:59.340> takes<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.730> photo<00:01:00.120> when<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> shake<00:01:01.230> is

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
and takes that photo when the shake is

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.799 
and takes that photo when the shake is
gone<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.640> grabs<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.149> perfect<00:01:03.600> moment

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
gone so it grabs that perfect moment

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.960 
gone so it grabs that perfect moment
without<00:01:04.439> any<00:01:04.920> shake<00:01:05.309> because<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.820> know

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
without any shake because you know

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.330 
without any shake because you know
camera<00:01:06.360> shake<00:01:06.570> leads<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.020> blur<00:01:07.229> especially<00:01:08.189> in

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
camera shake leads to blur especially in

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219 
camera shake leads to blur especially in
low<00:01:08.549> light<00:01:08.790> situations<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.990> you've<00:01:10.110> ever

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
calibrate our visual horizon and then

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.110 
calibrate our visual horizon and then
there<00:03:47.410> are<00:03:47.440> some<00:03:47.680> tips<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.070> tricks<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:48.519> user

can<00:03:51.700> see<00:03:51.880> we<00:03:52.030> have<00:03:52.060> these<00:03:52.420> buttons<00:03:52.900> here<00:03:53.019> for

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
can see we have these buttons here for

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.860 
can see we have these buttons here for
zooming<00:03:53.830> if<00:03:54.310> we<00:03:54.459> tap<00:03:54.730> on<00:03:54.940> them<00:03:55.180> we<00:03:55.690> get

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
zooming if we tap on them we get

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.800 
zooming if we tap on them we get
incremental<00:03:56.530> zoom<00:03:56.800> we<00:03:57.280> can<00:03:57.430> also<00:03:57.610> slide<00:03:58.239> right

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
incremental zoom we can also slide right

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.620 
incremental zoom we can also slide right
to<00:03:59.019> left<00:03:59.200> across<00:03:59.440> to<00:04:00.280> zoom<00:04:00.489> as<00:04:00.700> well<00:04:00.880> so<00:04:01.420> once

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
to left across to zoom as well so once

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.750 
to left across to zoom as well so once
you<00:04:01.780> understand<00:04:02.410> how<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.709> do<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.640> don't

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
you understand how to do that you don't

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.610

necessarily<00:04:03.970> need<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.900> zoom<00:04:05.080> buttons<00:04:05.440> there

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
necessarily need the zoom buttons there

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.500

anymore<00:04:05.830> you<00:04:06.130> can<00:04:06.280> get<00:04:06.459> rid<00:04:06.610> of<00:04:06.640> them<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.000> then

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
anymore you can get rid of them and then

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.570
