case and i did that for a reason because

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.429 
case and i did that for a reason because
i'm<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.149> sure<00:02:03.390> exactly<00:02:03.840> what's<00:02:04.049> going<00:02:04.259> on

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
i'm not sure exactly what's going on

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.499 
i'm not sure exactly what's going on
here<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.729> my<00:02:05.939> particular<00:02:06.149> case

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
here with this but in my particular case

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.410 
here with this but in my particular case
these<00:02:07.290> pop<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.610> i'm<00:02:08.670> not<00:02:08.729> sure<00:02:08.849> if<00:02:09.270> you're

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
these pop out so i'm not sure if you're

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.910 
these pop out so i'm not sure if you're
meant<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.720> keep<00:02:09.869> them<00:02:10.080> out<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:10.410> leave<00:02:10.560> them<00:02:10.739> in

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
meant to keep them out or leave them in

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.340 
meant to keep them out or leave them in
or<00:02:11.190> if<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.400> like<00:02:11.430> an<00:02:11.610> optional<00:02:12.090> thing

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
or if it's like an optional thing

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.710 
or if it's like an optional thing
it<00:02:13.340> works<00:02:13.580> fine<00:02:13.790> with<00:02:14.030> them<00:02:14.210> in<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.690> course

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
it works fine with them in and of course

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.080 
it works fine with them in and of course
it<00:02:15.560> works<00:02:15.770> just<00:02:15.890> fine<00:02:16.160> with<00:02:16.370> them<00:02:16.490> out<00:02:16.670> as<00:02:16.910> well

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
it works just fine with them out as well

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.090 
it works just fine with them out as well
a<00:02:17.120> little<00:02:17.330> bit<00:02:17.510> harder<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.930> get<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.320> them<00:02:18.470> with

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
a little bit harder to get to them with

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.800 
a little bit harder to get to them with
them<00:02:19.490> out<00:02:19.670> i'm<00:02:19.910> assuming<00:02:20.210> they're<00:02:20.510> meant<00:02:20.720> to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
them out i'm assuming they're meant to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.110 
them out i'm assuming they're meant to
be<00:02:20.900> left<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.380> but<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:22.130> my<00:02:22.340> cases<00:02:22.730> they<00:02:22.880> pop

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
be left in but on my cases they pop

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.550 
be left in but on my cases they pop
right<00:02:23.150> out<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:23.720> again<00:02:23.990> maybe<00:02:24.230> it's<00:02:24.440> an

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
right out so again maybe it's an

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.890 
right out so again maybe it's an
optional<00:02:25.010> thing<00:02:25.040> I'm<00:02:25.670> not<00:02:25.940> sure<00:02:26.210> they<00:02:26.570> fit<00:02:26.780> in

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
optional thing I'm not sure they fit in

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.900 
optional thing I'm not sure they fit in
just<00:02:26.960> fine<00:02:27.230> as<00:02:27.980> long<00:02:28.040> as<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.340> remember<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.760> put

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
just fine as long as you remember to put

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.670 
just fine as long as you remember to put
them<00:02:29.030> in<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.240> right<00:02:29.420> way<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.050> there<00:02:30.530> they<00:02:30.650> go

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
them in the right way and there they go

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.920 
them in the right way and there they go
they<00:02:30.860> stick<00:02:31.160> right<00:02:31.340> back<00:02:31.520> in<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.360> again<00:02:32.780> if

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
they stick right back in so again if

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.140 
they stick right back in so again if
