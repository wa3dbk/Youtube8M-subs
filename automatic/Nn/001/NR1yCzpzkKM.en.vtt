00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
hair right now looks pretty much the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.929 
hair right now looks pretty much the
same<00:00:26.760> as<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.330> did<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:28.140> morning<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.859> did<00:00:29.609> have

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
same as it did this morning I did have

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.220 
same as it did this morning I did have
to<00:00:30.529> wet<00:00:31.529> some<00:00:32.099> pieces<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.180> front<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.989> kind

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
to wet some pieces in the front to kind

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.740 
to wet some pieces in the front to kind
of<00:00:34.350> get<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.100> definition<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.210> bring<00:00:36.450> some<00:00:36.660> of

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
of get the definition and bring some of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.680 
of get the definition and bring some of
the<00:00:36.809> curl<00:00:37.079> back<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.590> maybe<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> pulled<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the curl back so maybe when I pulled it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.569 
the curl back so maybe when I pulled it
up<00:00:39.840> because<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.500> how<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> slept<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.250> put<00:00:41.460> it

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
up because that's how I slept I put it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.150 
up because that's how I slept I put it
up<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.910> ponytails<00:00:42.840> maybe<00:00:43.290> when<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.649> pulled<00:00:43.980> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
up in ponytails maybe when I pulled it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.540 
up in ponytails maybe when I pulled it
up<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.520> stretched<00:00:45.000> out<00:00:45.890> some<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> pieces

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
up that stretched out some of the pieces

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.840 
up that stretched out some of the pieces
too<00:00:48.030> much<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> did<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> put<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
too much and so I did have to put a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.910 
too much and so I did have to put a
little<00:00:51.059> water<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.780> bring<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> curl

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
little water on it to bring the curl

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.939 
little water on it to bring the curl
back<00:00:53.160> basically<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.620> look

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
back basically this is this is the look

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.729 
back basically this is this is the look
it<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.699> very<00:00:56.910> different<00:00:57.510> than<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> look<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.500> got

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it is very different than the look I got

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.660 
it is very different than the look I got
with<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.579> kinky<00:01:00.270> curly<00:01:00.629> curling<00:01:01.230> custard<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
with the kinky curly curling custard and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.670 
with the kinky curly curling custard and
I<00:01:03.270> think<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> biggest<00:01:04.170> differences

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
I think one of the biggest differences

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.800 
I think one of the biggest differences
is<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.070> I'm<00:01:05.220> not<00:01:05.489> giving<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.939> hang<00:01:06.180> time<00:01:06.510> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
is that I'm not giving the hang time so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.719 
is that I'm not giving the hang time so
I<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:07.049> incredible<00:01:07.439> definition<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.549> lot

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
I have incredible definition and a lot

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.210 
I have incredible definition and a lot
of<00:01:08.880> shine<00:01:09.119> I'm<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.570> sure<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.830> video<00:01:11.010> is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
of shine I'm not sure if the video is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.510 
of shine I'm not sure if the video is
capturing<00:01:12.090> exactly<00:01:12.750> how<00:01:12.990> shiny<00:01:13.380> my<00:01:14.010> hair<00:01:14.280> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
capturing exactly how shiny my hair is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.160 
capturing exactly how shiny my hair is
but<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.090> course<00:01:15.299> there's<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.570> great<00:01:15.960> deal<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
but of course there's a great deal of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.999 
but of course there's a great deal of
definition<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:18.180> curl<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.990> lot<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.740> spring

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
definition and the curl a lot of spring

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580 
definition and the curl a lot of spring
break<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> curl<00:01:20.759> too<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.110> definitely

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
break in the curl too so so definitely

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.749 
break in the curl too so so definitely
did<00:01:23.340> not<00:01:23.420> elongate<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> same<00:01:25.110> way<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.979> I

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
did not elongate in the same way and I

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.050 
did not elongate in the same way and I
believe<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:28.579> kinky<00:01:29.579> curly<00:01:29.820> curling

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
believe that the kinky curly curling

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.480 
believe that the kinky curly curling
custard<00:01:33.079> literally<00:01:34.079> makes<00:01:34.470> my<00:01:34.680> hair<00:01:34.890> heavier

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
custard literally makes my hair heavier

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.010 
custard literally makes my hair heavier
because<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.909> don't<00:01:36.119> even<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.570> don't<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
because I don't even I don't have the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.050 
because I don't even I don't have the
same<00:01:37.200> type<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.619> swing<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.640> course<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:38.970> you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
same type of swing and of course if you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.940 
same type of swing and of course if you
watched<00:01:39.299> my<00:01:39.540> video<00:01:39.720> my<00:01:40.170> styling<00:01:40.619> video<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
watched my video my styling video I

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
watched my video my styling video I
tried<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.670> best<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.060> could<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.570> keep<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
tried as best I could to keep the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.340 
tried as best I could to keep the
technique<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> same<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.659> course<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.229> know

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
technique the same so of course you know

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.260 
technique the same so of course you know
nothing's<00:01:46.680> perfect<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> really<00:01:48.000> think

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
nothing's perfect but I really think

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.840 
nothing's perfect but I really think
that<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.659> product<00:01:49.310> literally<00:01:50.310> gives<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.640> hair

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
that that product literally gives a hair

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.580 
that that product literally gives a hair
more<00:01:51.119> weight<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.810> really<00:01:52.079> gives<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.380> more

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
more weight and really gives you more

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.910 
more weight and really gives you more
hang<00:01:52.920> time<00:01:52.970> this<00:01:53.970> gives<00:01:54.329> incredible

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
hang time this gives incredible

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.990 
hang time this gives incredible
definition<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.250> fine<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.670> know<00:01:56.790> what<00:01:56.820> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
definition just fine you know what I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.459 
definition just fine you know what I
guess<00:01:57.180> that's<00:01:57.450> consistent<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> name

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
guess that's consistent with the name

the<00:02:15.510> hair<00:02:15.780> really<00:02:16.140> really<00:02:16.769> held<00:02:17.430> up<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
the hair really really held up to the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.940 
the hair really really held up to the
heat<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> humidity<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.200> even<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
heat of the humidity and even the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.520 
heat of the humidity and even the
swelling<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.640> volume<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.390> see<00:02:21.660> came

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
swelling and volume that you see came

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.100 
swelling and volume that you see came
more<00:02:22.950> from<00:02:23.340> my<00:02:23.580> manipulating<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.569> hair<00:02:24.840> and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
more from my manipulating the hair and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.080 
more from my manipulating the hair and
stretching<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:25.799> rather<00:02:26.190> than<00:02:26.370> from<00:02:26.730> going

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
stretching it out rather than from going

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.289 
stretching it out rather than from going
outside<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.440> really<00:02:28.830> did<00:02:29.069> actually<00:02:29.310> take
