00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
capable of shooting this down which is a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.590 
capable of shooting this down which is a
bold-faced<00:00:40.620> lie<00:00:40.920> they<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.730> satellites<00:00:42.329> on

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
bold-faced lie they have satellites on

the<00:00:42.780> region<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:44.040> watching<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.700> real<00:00:44.940> time

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the region the watching it in real time

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.770 
the region the watching it in real time
and<00:00:45.860> they<00:00:46.860> also<00:00:47.039> state<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:48.480> flight

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780

and I think it's kind of obvious they
were<00:00:53.640> blindsided<00:00:54.180> by<00:00:54.539> whatever<00:00:54.750> took<00:00:55.110> them

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
were blindsided by whatever took them

out of the sky now like I've showed in
the<00:00:57.899> other<00:00:58.020> videos<00:00:58.760> there's<00:00:59.760> nothing<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.390> the
