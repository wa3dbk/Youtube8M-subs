for a while one of the strongest is
embroidered<00:00:25.949> fabrics<00:00:26.400> now<00:00:27.210> there<00:00:27.689> are<00:00:28.260> still

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
embroidered fabrics now there are still

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.740 
embroidered fabrics now there are still
a<00:00:28.920> lot<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.369> fabrics<00:00:29.699> around<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.420> category

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
a lot of fabrics around in this category

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.020 
a lot of fabrics around in this category
but<00:00:31.560> they<00:00:31.769> are<00:00:31.920> changing<00:00:32.460> from<00:00:32.640> how<00:00:32.850> they've

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
but they are changing from how they've

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.549 
but they are changing from how they've
been<00:00:33.180> over<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> last<00:00:33.540> few<00:00:33.780> years<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.290> think

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
been over the last few years and I think

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.870 
been over the last few years and I think
the<00:00:34.710> difference<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.489> some<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the difference is is some of the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.119 
the difference is is some of the
embroidery<00:00:36.270> becoming<00:00:36.719> looser<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.350> little<00:00:38.010> bit

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
embroidery becoming looser a little bit

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.709 
embroidery becoming looser a little bit
more<00:00:38.280> graphic<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.850> little<00:00:39.059> bit<00:00:39.180> more<00:00:39.360> modern

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
more graphic a little bit more modern

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.930 
more graphic a little bit more modern
but<00:00:39.960> there's<00:00:40.110> also<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.440> lot<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.770> color<00:00:41.160> involved

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
but there's also a lot of color involved

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.930 
but there's also a lot of color involved
in<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> fabrics<00:00:42.660> another<00:00:43.469> look<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.250> saw

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
in the fabrics another look that we saw

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.270 
in the fabrics another look that we saw
was<00:00:45.180> actually<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.440> kind<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.739> look<00:00:46.920> that's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
was actually a so kind of a look that's

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.270 
was actually a so kind of a look that's
based<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.879> kind<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.360> 1930s<00:00:49.260> 1950s<00:00:50.129> it's

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
based on that kind of 1930s 1950s it's

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.799 
based on that kind of 1930s 1950s it's
quite<00:00:50.489> interesting<00:00:50.910> when<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.329> look<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.660> the
