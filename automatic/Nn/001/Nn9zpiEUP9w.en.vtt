00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.930 
I think the audience relates to each one
of<00:03:17.370> these<00:03:17.579> films<00:03:17.909> because<00:03:18.780> they<00:03:19.560> are<00:03:19.879> and<00:03:20.879> I

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
of these films because they are and I

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.430 
of these films because they are and I
think<00:03:21.120> that's<00:03:21.239> why<00:03:21.359> audiences<00:03:21.959> or<00:03:22.290> why

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
think that's why audiences or why

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.289 
think that's why audiences or why
readers<00:03:22.889> relate<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.400> comic<00:03:23.669> books<00:03:23.849> is<00:03:23.970> because

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
readers relate to comic books is because

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.289

these characters are human but have

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.879 
these characters are human but have
these<00:03:27.540> super<00:03:27.870> ability<00:03:28.229> you<00:03:28.290> know<00:03:28.379> superhuman

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
these super ability you know superhuman

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.599 
these super ability you know superhuman
abilities<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.970> jaws<00:03:30.780> as<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.019> fan<00:03:31.349> I<00:03:31.650> think<00:03:31.919> was
