 fees with your cmr card or with the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.850
 cards that appear on the screen but 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.380
 We are already with our expert in home 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.420
 marisol pÃ©rez to explain this 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.940
 wonderful vacuum cleaner or mother and how 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.710
 you're really happy because actually 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.270
 we have the best vacuum cleaner that we 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 It will help to have our whole house 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.160
 completely clean that I liked 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.190
 we had a pretty similar vacuum 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.140
 and with tremendous success that's what it is 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.870
 same in the same technology and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.239
 towards the chronicle the same model the very 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.980
 modernity the same technology the only 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.510
 which is a little more compact thinking 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.339
 also in the spaces in the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.330
 departments therefore here we are going to 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.580
 have the solution 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.050
 our whole house starts but great 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.420
 it seems to me and in a much more way 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.730
 clean too so because that is 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.580
 this cyclonic technology that means 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.230
 that goes centrifugal force is used and that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.620
 is what is going to catch all 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.840
 but up to 99% of the particles that 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.490
 they are going to produce us in the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.510
 I also have allergies very practical 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.880
 because we do not have to be buying 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.370
 bags or bouquets not because it has a filter 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.990
 special fagot and the hepa filter that 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.000
 we are going to have to wash it but beyond 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.130
 of the six months therefore we are going to 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.330
 keep the air clean let's clean 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.930
 but we're not going to have to be 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.310
 changing that that is also expensive time 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.740
 therefore we are going to save also 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.360
 even in that but very much more 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.010
 hygienic you can also show me how 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.320
 but of course look here we have the 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.410
 vacuum cleaner that you see it ideal compact 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.990
 because every time we have fewer spaces and 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.290
 well we are ready I press this 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.690
 little button and sack here is the filter 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.270
 hepa that white that is and here they are going to 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.060
 accumulate dust and dirt and I 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.700
 I press here and it opens and what capacity 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.000
 has good has a capacity madrid 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.769
 of accumulation of dust and dirt and 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.680
 has a power of 1600 that 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.480
 enough for any type of floor or 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.670
 any type of floor and here we have 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.890
 a demonstration with floating floor with 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.750
 ceramic and with carpet that are the 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.130
 most common floors that we have 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.260
 our house seems to me that I try them 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.690
 let's see why in any case 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.660
 let's go now with the floor 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.370
 floating and the earth and the mud that 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.840

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.730
 well come prepared 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.500
