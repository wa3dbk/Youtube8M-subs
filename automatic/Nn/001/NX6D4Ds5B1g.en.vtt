00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.090 
b-minus one for the reasons that it's so
darn<00:01:57.390> expensive<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.290> don't<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:58.890> worth

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
darn expensive I don't think it's worth

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.270 
darn expensive I don't think it's worth
that<00:01:59.340> much<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.880> second<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.409> seen<00:02:02.100> my

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
that much and second is I just seen my

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.100 
that much and second is I just seen my
skin<00:02:02.610> kind<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.909> break<00:02:03.210> out<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.750> along<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
skin kind of break out like along the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.649 
skin kind of break out like along the
sides<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.829> my<00:02:04.890> jaw<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.640> don't<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:06.390> what<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.630> is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
sides of my jaw I don't know what it is

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.139 
sides of my jaw I don't know what it is
I've<00:02:07.110> gone<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.590> Paleo<00:02:08.009> diet<00:02:08.280> right<00:02:08.670> now<00:02:08.700> so

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
I've gone on the Paleo diet right now so

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.480 
I've gone on the Paleo diet right now so
I

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
I

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.660 
I
it<00:02:09.550> had<00:02:09.760> like<00:02:09.940> any<00:02:10.150> bread<00:02:10.510> for<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:10.990> long<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.610> I

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
it had like any bread for so long so I

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.890 
it had like any bread for so long so I
don't<00:02:12.820> think<00:02:12.970> it's<00:02:13.060> my<00:02:13.180> diet<00:02:13.420> I'm<00:02:13.720> not

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
don't think it's my diet I'm not

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.350 
don't think it's my diet I'm not
stressed<00:02:14.200> out<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.680> really<00:02:15.370> think<00:02:15.640> it's<00:02:15.970> this

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
stressed out I really think it's this

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.940 
stressed out I really think it's this
because<00:02:16.720> I've<00:02:16.870> been<00:02:17.050> using<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.560> pretty<00:02:17.800> much

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
because I've been using this pretty much

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.520 
because I've been using this pretty much
every<00:02:18.310> day<00:02:18.550> underneath<00:02:19.000> my<00:02:19.120> makeup<00:02:19.510> when<00:02:20.440> I'm

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
every day underneath my makeup when I'm

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.380 
every day underneath my makeup when I'm
wearing<00:02:20.710> makeup<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.580> just<00:02:21.730> find<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:22.120> it

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
wearing makeup and I just find that it

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.500 
wearing makeup and I just find that it
has<00:02:22.630> this<00:02:23.350> ingredient<00:02:24.010> called<00:02:24.730> I'm<00:02:25.300> gonna<00:02:25.420> put

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
has this ingredient called I'm gonna put

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.450 
has this ingredient called I'm gonna put
here<00:02:25.900> because<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.230> can't<00:02:26.530> exactly<00:02:26.980> pronounce

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
here because I can't exactly pronounce

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.530 
here because I can't exactly pronounce
it<00:02:27.640> but<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.870> feel<00:02:29.320> like<00:02:29.640> primers<00:02:30.640> for<00:02:31.030> me<00:02:31.240> in

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
it but I feel like primers for me in

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.840 
it but I feel like primers for me in
general<00:02:31.570> cause<00:02:32.350> me<00:02:32.710> to<00:02:32.830> break<00:02:33.070> out<00:02:33.280> like<00:02:33.520> crazy

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
general cause me to break out like crazy

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.170 
general cause me to break out like crazy
and<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:35.350> think<00:02:35.620> this<00:02:35.950> has<00:02:36.310> been<00:02:36.340> contributing

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
and I think this has been contributing

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.930 
and I think this has been contributing
to<00:02:37.390> some<00:02:37.630> breakouts<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:39.160> if<00:02:39.550> you're<00:02:39.700> not<00:02:39.880> sure

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
to some breakouts so if you're not sure

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.640 
to some breakouts so if you're not sure
whether<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.360> get<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:40.720> or<00:02:40.870> not<00:02:41.020> definitely<00:02:41.530> get

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
whether to get it or not definitely get

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.800 
whether to get it or not definitely get
the<00:02:41.770> baby<00:02:41.980> size<00:02:42.280> or<00:02:42.610> ask<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.000> sample<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.600> see

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
the baby size or ask for a sample to see

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.600 
the baby size or ask for a sample to see
if<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.050> break<00:02:44.290> out<00:02:44.470> it's<00:02:44.740> good<00:02:45.010> i<00:02:45.040> wish<00:02:45.400> i

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
if you break out it's good i wish i

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.090 
if you break out it's good i wish i
could<00:02:46.030> like<00:02:46.600> use<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.230> more<00:02:47.470> but<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.310> just

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
could like use it more but it's just

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.190 
could like use it more but it's just
just<00:02:51.100> too<00:02:51.400> darn<00:02:51.670> expensive<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:52.720> not<00:02:52.750> worth

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
just too darn expensive and not worth

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.890
