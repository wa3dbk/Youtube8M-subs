00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Who crossed the eyes of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 "RASPOUTINE" 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Did not he sell his soul to ... 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 "RASPUTIN"? 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.700
 Long coat, oily hair, 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.300
 Calm hands, a cold look 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000
 Open collar on a cross, 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.600
 Moujik and staretz at once 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.200
 He drinks it until "Zapoi" 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.800
 Ten times a day he makes love 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.400
 When he dances he goes into a trance 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.900
 EnvoÃ»tant until the tsarine 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.300
 "RAS- 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.600
 -POU- 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.600
 -TINE ... " 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.000
 A miracle here, 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.700
 A miracle there, 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.400
 While wiping her fingers, 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.000
 On taffeta cushions. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.600
 Singing "Kalinka", 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.200
 He shouted to the Devotchkas, 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.700
 A cut between the teeth: 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 "Long live the sin that reigns!" 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.200
 Stand up the devil is at home 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 Come from Tyumen for you! 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.800
 Rasputin! 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.000
 Rasputin !! 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 "Gaspaja, 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.800
 Pamagitnie Pojalusta? " 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.900
 In Moscow, everything goes: 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.900
 "Pray Rasputin!" 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.200
 "You have a bad liver?" 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.100
 "Pray Rasputin !!" 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.900
 And if he takes you in his arms, 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.300
 God will forgive you 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.900
 Let yourself be made Gaspaja! 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.500
 His ointment will heal you! 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.500
 "AH AH AH" 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.800
 He trussed marquees 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.300
 Plucked Kniazs at will, 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.100
 Look after the Tsetsarevich, 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.600
 Along with the Lubavitch, 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.100
 In front of Kazan's maiden, 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.600
 Rabid Ataman, 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.500
 At war he said "NIET!": 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.400
 It was necessary to kill the beast! 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.700
 Stand up the devil is at home 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.100
 Come from Tyumen for you! 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.500
 "Rasputin!" 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 "Rasputin !!" 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.400
 "Gaspaja, 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.600
 Pamagitnie Pojalusta? " 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.000
 He said no to the Cossacks, 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.600
 By swallowing his barbaque 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.100
 He toasted his Vodka, 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.700
 By adjusting his Shepka, 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.400
 It was cyanide that was gavait 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.800
 But he asked for more! 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.600
 Two bullets in the head, 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.600
 Two bullets in the body, 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.200
 But he was still moving ... 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.500
 Projected in Nevka 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.400
 Landed with ... 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.000
 FRACAS! 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.600
 But before drinking the cup, 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.200
 He melted the ice, 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.800
 His two blue eyes rekindled, 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.400
 The moon illuminated 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.000
 They all vivified me 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.700
 For the sweats of my nights 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.300
 He's a monster, an ogre, a gorilla, 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.700
 Is death made for him? 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.000
 "Rasputin!" 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.600
 "Rasputin !!" 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.100
 "Gaspaja, pamagitnie pojalusta" 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.600
 Rasputin! 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.200
 Rasputin ... !! 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.000
 RAS-PUTIN !!
