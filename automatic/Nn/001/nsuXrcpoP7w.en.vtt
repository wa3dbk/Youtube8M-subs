clocks<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> highest<00:00:28.019> quality

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
clocks of the highest quality

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.330 
clocks of the highest quality
today<00:00:30.570> many<00:00:30.869> clocks<00:00:31.260> made<00:00:31.619> by<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.859> cutters

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
firm and to find a cuckoo clock from

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.299 
firm and to find a cuckoo clock from
this<00:00:41.340> period<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.000> betta<00:00:42.239> Meier<00:00:42.480> case<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
this period in a betta Meier case is

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.920 
this period in a betta Meier case is
very<00:00:44.309> rare<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.879> they're<00:00:44.969> very<00:00:45.210> collectible

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
very rare and they're very collectible

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.310 
very rare and they're very collectible
this<00:00:46.320> clock<00:00:46.620> predates<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.670> carving<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
this clock predates the carving that is

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.860 
this clock predates the carving that is
traditionally<00:00:50.100> associated<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.660> Black

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
traditionally associated with the Black

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.180 
traditionally associated with the Black
Forest<00:00:52.199> cuckoo<00:00:52.559> clock<00:00:52.829> today

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
Forest cuckoo clock today

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.910 
Forest cuckoo clock today
it<00:00:53.910> also<00:00:54.090> predates<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.079> use<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> pine

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
it also predates the use of the pine

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.250 
it also predates the use of the pine
cone<00:00:56.190> weight<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.730> also<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.719> carved<00:00:58.079> bone

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
cone weight and also the carved bone

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.849 
cone weight and also the carved bone
hand<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> great<00:01:01.050> example<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.739> an

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
hand so this is a great example of an

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.189 
hand so this is a great example of an
early<00:01:02.070> cuckoo<00:01:02.579> clock<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.629> went<00:01:03.989> from<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
early cuckoo clock that went from the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.149 
early cuckoo clock that went from the
early<00:01:04.619> shield<00:01:05.010> style<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> case<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.890> then

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
early shield style to the case and then

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.520 
early shield style to the case and then
further<00:01:08.430> developments<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.780> cuckoo<00:01:09.960> evolved

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
further developments the cuckoo evolved

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.200 
further developments the cuckoo evolved
into<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> cuckoo<00:01:11.189> clock<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.670> most<00:01:11.850> people

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
into a cuckoo clock that most people

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.550 
into a cuckoo clock that most people
relate<00:01:12.479> today<00:01:14.360> you<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.659> has<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> nice<00:01:16.110> front
