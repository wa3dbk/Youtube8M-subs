 good day 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.980
 The first description of the patient is leaps and bounds 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.750
 clonic epilepsy 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:23.369

 epileptic syndrome gave almost a century 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.120
 later after the first literary 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.420

 names that gave the syndrome 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.659
 authors actually the term hume came in 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.500
 English literature from Minsk only 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.080
 the mid 80s of the twentieth century goes 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.840
 seizures described in age from 8 to 39 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.340
 years at photo 7 network patients 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.900
 the disease usually begins 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.759
 earlier than not photo sensitive 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.759
 we make up more than 10 percent of all 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.070
 cases both lucy and in the world and 26 percent 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.570
 all hypothetical cases

 generalized great sei 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.329
 the disease is more common in women 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.579
 than men environmental attacks 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.250
 usually occur after waking up and in 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.810
 mostly involving hands are the most 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.299
 the main symptom of the syndrome 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.310
 such seizures are associated with short 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.520
 discharges diffuse and gallipoli peak 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.619
 complete complexes on the hepa myoclonus 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.540
 varies in intensity often 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.759
 ignored by sick before joining 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.500
 convulsive seizures 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.960
 to identify it in the past is necessary 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.610
 actively questioning not environmentally priest 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.890
 patients do not usually get in 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.690
 serious inconvenience and many 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.080
 I prefer to take the drug 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.960
 for the sake of getting rid of these 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.360
 risks on the other hand for many 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.700
 sick unpleasant often and a reminder of 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.560
 their epilepsy and frequent 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.120
 myoclonia 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.160
 if I have clonic seizures 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.850
 Apsars are combined with generalized 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.500
 convulsive seizure shows the value 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.970
 epileptic drugs from 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.250
 generalized convulsive seizure 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.700
 video cameras at work filmed 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.340
 patient we see here the onset of an attack 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.190
 the patient seemed to forget why you came 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.120
 starts before stomping then 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.650
 conical clonic phase of attack 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.140
 unfortunately many doctors still 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.910
 reason at the level what if fell 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.510
 instantly melts generalized 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.990
 epilepsy 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.420
 but there was something and then fell for example 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.480
 aura of automatism deviation galaru and so 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.190
 further then this is focal epilepsy on 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.260
 in fact, in any form were all 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.740
 before the start of su need priest possible 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.030
 certain phenomena on what else 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.890
 should pay attention to 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.020
 duration of panic attack 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.580
 environmental phase of bailiffs in total 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.580
 difficulties last less than a minute 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.880
 as I have already said that there is no 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.670
 there the description of the bailiffs immediately became all 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.620
 Clear prices can forget about the level 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.680
 the initial phase of the attack is called 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.600
 award down and besides data 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.490
 inform them of patients by relatives or 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.400
 witnessing overwhelming attacks 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.260
 most inaccurate and incomplete even 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.000
 if everything is described in detail the same 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.280
 signs can be observed at various 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.390
 forms of epilepsy 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.520
 for example, visual aura deviation 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.240
 heads at the beginning of an attack before loss 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.490
 of consciousness 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.520
 characteristic symptoms hypothetically photo 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.440
 sensitive occipital epilepsy and often 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.480
 appear in sick you we also 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.520
 the coexistence of myclonic 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.730
 seizures and occipital peaks on the CSE at 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.350
 of a number of patients with both syndrome here we are 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.240
 see you sans when conducting hyper 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.170
 ventilation of a child from a nursery station 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.570

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.570
 Admission is not drove Monich nym 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.210
 a sign of disease rules about sans 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.250
 tricks are shorter and less frequent than before 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.740
 to identify them you need a focused 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.910
 questioning a number of patients during 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.130
 video monitoring reveal the so-called 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.250
 phantom absans that is so 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.430
 short that is not sick and those around them 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.560
 just does not notice relativity 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.500
 admissions meeting right in 30 percent 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.660
 cases more often in women should be noted 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.340
 that photo 72 on steam is separate 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.740
 signs that are obviously due to 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.940
 various mutations are capable 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.650
 inherit isolated 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.720
 i.e. maybe mind without photo 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.500
 sensitivity and photo sensitivity without 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.840
 Hume as a random find on the ege 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.790
 their field and peak wave complexes on the game 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.980
 directly prevails in the forehead on the central 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.750
 leads as a rule of discharge 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.820
 variable in purity duration 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.470
 localization here we see clearly by 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.290
 frontal prevalence at the beginning 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.000
 discharge on the same discharge will love the waves 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.970
 The above helped blow to the central topic on 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.100
 occipital vision basic rights frames 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.680
 bailiff receptions sleep deprivation or earlier 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.880
 violent awakening same frequent 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.340
 the provocateur is the decline 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.080
 blood alcohol concentration factors 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.090
 very often meet together 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.000
 I constantly drank alcohol in the evening 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.480
 late lay down 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.890
 got up early and his priest happened also 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.580
 Typically wire attacks already 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.840
 previously mentioned photo stimulation in 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.150
 women feeling bailiffs can be 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.160
 associated with menstruation others 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.820
 bailiff provocateurs serve stress and 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.560
 fatigue in some cases takes 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.140
 it is impossible the so-called reflex 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.290
 thought-induced letter attacks 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.550
 or specific followers 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.110
 here we see the diffuse peak wave 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.790
 cut by amplitude prevalence in 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.890
 curls the central parts of the patient with 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.290
 Yumi five minutes after previously worn 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.150

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.100
 higher and bit like collect

 vulnerability and spring awakening 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:37.880
 characteristic signs minds drug for 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.919
 treatments we can divide on these 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.110
 clonic who used something not 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.669
 myoclonus of various etiologies and anti 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.100
 epileptic which are applied 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.150
 treatment of epilepsy 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.160
 system what is the course of the disease 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.070
 life long treatment should be harder 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.290
 than the disease of the patient with rare 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.800
 by variations or combinations talked about 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.210
 sans can not take the drug 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.490
 the gold standard of treatment are 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.050
 walbro then however no drug should 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.780
 used by a young woman for 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.550
 serious side effects 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:11.510
 instead of evol selling such cases, we 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:13.460
 recommend levetiracetam zip 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.510
 use as an additional drug 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.680
 in the treatment of resistant and clone all 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.750
 feast on effective relationships 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.960
 generalized seizures however his 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.610
 anti mechanical effect variable a 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.419
 side effects are more common motul 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:31.729
 brother should emphasize that such 

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:34.010
 classic drugs like phenytoin ikar 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:37.820
 Mazepin and many new drugs 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.860
 generations can purify the absences and or 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:43.240
 myoclonia 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:46.630
 what are their techniques applicable impractical 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.630
 thank for it
