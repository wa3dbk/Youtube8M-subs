00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
hundred and fifty GP each it's because

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.290 
hundred and fifty GP each it's because
of<00:00:22.260> divination<00:00:22.590> because<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.580> need<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:24.240> think

of divination because you need I think
for<00:00:24.779> limestone<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.439> make<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.359> forgot<00:00:27.359> what

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
for limestone to make this I forgot what

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.589 
for limestone to make this I forgot what
buttons<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:29.640> basically<00:00:30.150> extends<00:00:30.570> your

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
buttons it basically extends your

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.900 
buttons it basically extends your
gravestone<00:00:31.140> timer<00:00:31.529> by<00:00:31.859> six<00:00:32.219> minutes<00:00:32.610> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
gravestone timer by six minutes and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.060 
gravestone timer by six minutes and
that's<00:00:33.239> why<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.540> need<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> will<00:00:34.530> always

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that's why you need it so it will always

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.450 
that's why you need it so it will always
be<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.610> demand<00:00:36.290> now<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.800> course<00:00:38.129> mine

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
be in demand now we can of course mine

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.479 
be in demand now we can of course mine
limestone<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.750> buy<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.500> from<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.160> shop

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
limestone or you can buy it from a shop

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.060 
limestone or you can buy it from a shop
that's<00:00:41.850> what<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.059> instantly<00:00:42.510> thought<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.710> for

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
that's what I instantly thought so for

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.770 
that's what I instantly thought so for
this<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.370> work<00:00:44.489> very<00:00:44.879> efficiently<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.750> will

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
this to work very efficiently you will

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.350 
this to work very efficiently you will
need<00:00:46.140> dragons<00:00:46.800> medallion<00:00:47.520> which<00:00:47.850> requires

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
need dragons medallion which requires

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.930 
need dragons medallion which requires
quite<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> lot<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.230> quests<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.789> use

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
quite a lot of quests or you can use

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
quite a lot of quests or you can use
game<00:00:51.210> necklace<00:00:51.719> which<00:00:52.140> also<00:00:52.530> requires<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
game necklace which also requires to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.459 
game necklace which also requires to
play<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> mini<00:00:53.730> game<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.360> ten<00:00:54.629> hours

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
play a mini game for like ten hours

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.950 
play a mini game for like ten hours
so<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.949> do<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.430> efficiently<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.539> need<00:00:57.719> one

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so to do this efficiently you need one

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.740 
so to do this efficiently you need one
of<00:00:57.989> these<00:00:58.829> two<00:00:59.160> items<00:00:59.340> but<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> don't<00:01:00.539> have

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
of these two items but if you don't have

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.000 
of these two items but if you don't have
them<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.230> still<00:01:01.410> make<00:01:01.649> some<00:01:01.859> money

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
them you can still make some money

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.149 
them you can still make some money
probably<00:01:02.730> only<00:01:03.090> half<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.989> what<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.530> will<00:01:04.650> make

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
probably only half of what I will make

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.480 
probably only half of what I will make
in<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.580> video<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.110> will<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.680> mahdi
