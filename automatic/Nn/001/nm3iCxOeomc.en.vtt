00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:11.400
 but we continue means passed since 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:14.849
 spraying 25 minutes of candles I already unscrewed 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.420
 candles with were originally dry and in 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.130
 Basically they have not changed anything 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.340
 were still there by the way after laurel they 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.060
 were such cleared on these nothing 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.429
 changed means in two cylinders 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.900
 there is a little bit of liquid 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.640
 I tried and pumped out with a syringe 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.630
 pumped out probably very little but her 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.630
 seen in the fourth is empty in the third is empty 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.480
 plugged holes with toilet paper 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.989
 suddenly something will fly out 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.410
 instructions are written so as not to fall on 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:01:02.550
 painted surface now try 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:05.329
 by buzzing with the master all the toilet 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.329
 the paper flew out 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:20.140
 after laurel does not jump out 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:23.910
 all flew away insert and laurel we still 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.910
 rag we set up now we're experiencing 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:35.280
 so here we open strong and try 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.450
 and try again 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:06.670
 let's go look at from lava kindling 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.830
 shit was not on the piston ut it 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.650
 This is your third cylinder 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:25.970
 principle is dirty but so much joy 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:27.440
 of course in general which body is so 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.989
 now I will twist the candles 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:36.680
 that's about the second cylinder while someone is good 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:38.600
 Seen dirty dirty very dirty straight 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.810
 good in the top dead center probably 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.810
 worth 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:57.629
 very many there some guys and here 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:04.269
 look first cylinder 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:07.299
 you can see a little bit of metal but itâ€™s me 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.900
 already like it more well 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:14.670
 require well put candles and try 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.670
 start off for now
