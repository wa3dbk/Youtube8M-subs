00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.820
 Who made this game that was written by 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.530
 budapest capital of hungary is 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.140

 I can not give you here in Brazil, man. 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.820

 He's gay because of something I do not even 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.520
 I dare speak here because the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.510
 surname has a lot of consonant 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.370
 Minor theme idea 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.600
 but there in the description of the video is clear from 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.190
 the credits to him 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.780
 Good. Let's go, then, remembering that you 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.149
 download this game in addition to 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.810
 many others there on the channel blog now 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.100
 yes finally left gameplay 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.869
 look just starting there on the screen 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.940
 character selection 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.490
 pay attention to the wealth of detail 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.880
 It was really cool. 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.610
 from the bottom there the cartoons is also 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.920
 who catch fire at the end has a boat 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.490
 that passes in front of a dinosaur I do not know 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.220
 what 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.470
 but everything in the environment involves deadly 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.820
 Very cool kombat, I'm going to do it here. 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.280
 same standard I will choose that 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.750
 character but then of course make a 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.939
 editing the video trying to 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.830
 show a little too much of others 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.189
 characters also beauty 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.189
 let's go 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:10.369
 will the world 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:12.890
 It was a good home before the game started. 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.060
 here is a very cool introduction only 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.040
 that I had to cut because 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.140
 of course could give some problem 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.330
 with copyrights for you to have 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.610
 one idea is several fight scenes 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.920
 between the mortal kombat fighters but 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.200
 in gc form was very cool and 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.360
 background soundtrack is nothing more nothing 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.489
 less than a band called disturbed 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.830
 who likes rock, I'm sure 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.620
 will recognize it's really cool is fine 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.050
 made even everything fits with the music 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.820
 with the world of the deadly kombat series anyway 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.100
 Well done 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.769
 It also has an introduction of 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.120
 each character 1 if you start the fight 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.010
 it 's very cool too 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.650
 Only unfortunately I had to take it out here. 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.480
 of the video because of copyright 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.760
 about the difficulty of the game now it is 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.459
 really very appealing 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.380
 looks honestly is a great game 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.470
 but it is very difficult too 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.600
 in fact all these ancient mortal kombat 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.940
 they were relatively difficult, right? 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.320
 Of course, until you get morale, you have 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.840
 people who say she does not have a problem 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.090
 none that passes I want here of good but 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.920
 I admit to you that I'm a good cloud. 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.989
 mortal kombat and has a bit of 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.030
 difficulty at first I even got 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.799
 to turn the game with two characters was 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.989
 book who is khan tea 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.180
 the rest with society can not 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.070
 for not mastering same character 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.650
 but if you like it if you are ninja and 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.650
 will certainly achieve good and beautiful 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.540
 It is also worth mentioning the people who 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.200
 Channel blog has several other games 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.360
 morgen 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.120
 plus other deadly kombat and street 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.819
 fighter knights of the zodiac dragon 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.040
 ball marvel versus capcom a king of 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.380
 fighters and both the game there and neither 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.989
 I do not even remember anymore should have more than 80 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.480
 or 90 games a way is just to get there 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.880
 on the blog and download beauty remembering that 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.040
 some old videos are there on the channel 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.959
 new, who wants to say new, right? 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.910
 is the old school channel that is a channel that 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.620
 I recently did just to put the 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.110
 old videos that have been deleted 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.209
 there in the old canal then there is a lot 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.130
 that is on the blog and the game planet in this 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.829
 old school channel that is clear and these 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.030
 here are also on the blog and the 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.030
 gameplay you check here 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.020
 I spoke earlier about the screen 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.330
 players select snow was fine 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.250
 made full of details and finally 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.260
 really it's not only that 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.300
 the characters also some are 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.400
 edited has a few more strokes than 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.430
 you can not find the original version 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.840
 In addition, the steels are the main 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.440
 I see this game here. 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.789
 they got very well done totally 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.280
 what I mean by the 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.710
 original it is based on button series 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.510
 combat but there are some other things 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.410
 were implemented and were very 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.150
 cool 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.100
 you 'll check out over the course of the gameplay 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.260
 which has several suits that you 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.479
 surely they have never seen and neither with another 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.680
 game that is not in this is very cool 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.680
 very interesting indeed 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:40.610
 the good is good 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.950
 Good, I'm going to stay here, I hope. 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.050
 that you liked the gameplay 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.940
 the idea of ​​the video is very short even just 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.770
 to give you an idea of ​​what the game is and there 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.520
 you decide whether or not to do the 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.040
 download 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.140
