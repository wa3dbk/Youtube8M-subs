hey everybody welcome to the fifth taryn
toolbox<00:00:07.720> this<00:00:08.050> is<00:00:08.139> going<00:00:08.260> to<00:00:08.350> be<00:00:08.530> a<00:00:09.180> two-parter

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
toolbox this is going to be a two-parter

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.480 
toolbox this is going to be a two-parter
we're<00:00:10.299> gonna<00:00:10.389> have<00:00:10.690> a<00:00:10.990> look<00:00:11.320> at<00:00:11.620> mineral

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
we're gonna have a look at mineral

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.860 
we're gonna have a look at mineral
walking<00:00:12.820> so<00:00:12.940> we're<00:00:13.059> going<00:00:13.179> to<00:00:13.240> be<00:00:13.599> able<00:00:13.660> to

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
walking so we're going to be able to

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.260 
walking so we're going to be able to
move<00:00:14.080> through<00:00:14.139> units<00:00:14.830> with<00:00:15.009> our<00:00:15.160> CBS<00:00:15.639> and<00:00:15.880> then

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
move through units with our CBS and then

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.210 
move through units with our CBS and then
we're<00:00:16.420> also<00:00:16.570> going<00:00:16.750> to<00:00:16.810> look<00:00:16.990> at<00:00:17.259> how<00:00:17.560> to<00:00:17.619> stop

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
we're also going to look at how to stop

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.130 
we're also going to look at how to stop
building<00:00:18.520> a<00:00:18.759> building<00:00:18.939> without<00:00:19.540> actually

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
building a building without actually

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.839 
building a building without actually
canceling<00:00:20.649> that<00:00:20.680> building<00:00:21.130> so<00:00:21.310> we<00:00:21.520> can<00:00:21.700> keep

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
canceling that building so we can keep

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.310 
canceling that building so we can keep
the<00:00:22.029> building<00:00:22.329> up<00:00:22.450> and<00:00:22.630> keep<00:00:22.779> the<00:00:22.899> progress

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
the building up and keep the progress

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.700 
the building up and keep the progress
going<00:00:23.349> on<00:00:23.860> and<00:00:24.520> then<00:00:25.210> we<00:00:25.419> will<00:00:25.689> will<00:00:26.529> be<00:00:26.560> able

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
going on and then we will will be able

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.260 
going on and then we will will be able
to<00:00:26.800> keep<00:00:27.040> those<00:00:27.160> alive<00:00:27.430> right<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.059> first

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
to keep those alive right the first

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.429 
to keep those alive right the first
trick<00:00:28.450> we're<00:00:28.599> going<00:00:28.720> to<00:00:28.779> be<00:00:28.840> looking<00:00:28.960> forward

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439

today or looking at today it's going to
be<00:00:31.630> mineral<00:00:31.960> walking<00:00:32.439> I've<00:00:32.680> got<00:00:33.010> a<00:00:33.040> group<00:00:33.250> of

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
be mineral walking I've got a group of

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.510 
be mineral walking I've got a group of
SUVs<00:00:33.850> I<00:00:34.120> do<00:00:34.570> have<00:00:34.840> a<00:00:34.870> zealot<00:00:35.680> on<00:00:35.829> hold<00:00:36.100> position

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
SUVs I do have a zealot on hold position

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.860 
SUVs I do have a zealot on hold position
up<00:00:36.610> here<00:00:36.880> so<00:00:37.060> let's<00:00:37.240> just<00:00:37.450> see<00:00:37.570> what<00:00:37.720> would

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
up here so let's just see what would

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.240 
up here so let's just see what would
happen<00:00:38.050> if<00:00:38.260> we<00:00:38.350> try<00:00:38.530> to<00:00:38.590> get<00:00:38.770> into<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.070> base

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
happen if we try to get into the base

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.780 
happen if we try to get into the base
with<00:00:39.940> this<00:00:40.120> whole<00:00:40.330> position<00:00:40.540> zealot<00:00:41.790> notice

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
with this whole position zealot notice

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.090 
with this whole position zealot notice
they<00:00:43.420> won't<00:00:43.630> get<00:00:43.810> in<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.200> this<00:00:44.470> out<00:00:44.680> will<00:00:44.920> just

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
they won't get in and this out will just

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.280 
they won't get in and this out will just
ruin<00:00:45.250> their<00:00:45.490> day<00:00:45.520> now<00:00:46.300> this<00:00:46.420> works<00:00:46.660> on<00:00:46.870> units

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
ruin their day now this works on units

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.810 
ruin their day now this works on units
that<00:00:47.410> are<00:00:47.440> either<00:00:47.650> on<00:00:47.770> hold<00:00:48.160> position<00:00:48.580> or<00:00:48.670> not

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
that are either on hold position or not

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.280 
that are either on hold position or not
so<00:00:49.329> I'm<00:00:49.390> gonna<00:00:49.480> put<00:00:49.690> this<00:00:49.720> guy<00:00:49.990> up<00:00:50.140> here

hold position he's actually gonna

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.250 
hold position he's actually gonna
trapped<00:00:53.920> by<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.250> whole<00:00:54.460> position<00:00:54.640> zealot

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
trapped by the whole position zealot

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.240 
trapped by the whole position zealot
next<00:00:56.260> we're<00:00:56.410> going<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:56.560> click<00:00:56.770> on<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:56.980> mineral

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
next we're going to click on the mineral

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.300 
next we're going to click on the mineral
line<00:00:57.900> notice<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:59.170> workers<00:00:59.530> are<00:00:59.770> going<00:01:00.220> to

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
line notice the workers are going to

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.000 
line notice the workers are going to
push<00:01:00.520> right<00:01:00.820> through<00:01:01.380> the<00:01:02.380> zealots<00:01:02.800> and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
push right through the zealots and

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.740 
push right through the zealots and
they're<00:01:03.730> going<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.030> be<00:01:04.119> in<00:01:04.239> your<00:01:04.329> opponent's

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
they're going to be in your opponent's

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.649 
they're going to be in your opponent's
base<00:01:05.310> it's<00:01:06.310> very<00:01:06.640> useful<00:01:06.850> if<00:01:07.119> you<00:01:07.210> need<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.570> get

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
base it's very useful if you need to get

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.320 
base it's very useful if you need to get
past<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.409> hold<00:01:08.740> position<00:01:09.159> unit<00:01:09.400> or<00:01:09.610> any<00:01:10.060> amount

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
past a hold position unit or any amount

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.640 
past a hold position unit or any amount
of<00:01:10.420> units<00:01:10.540> on<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.870> ramp<00:01:11.140> whether<00:01:11.470> they're

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
of units on a ramp whether they're

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.560 
of units on a ramp whether they're
protoss<00:01:12.040> terran<00:01:12.370> surrogate<00:01:13.360> really<00:01:13.450> doesn't

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
protoss terran surrogate really doesn't

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.170 
protoss terran surrogate really doesn't
matter<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.530> work<00:01:14.710> against<00:01:15.130> most<00:01:15.400> units<00:01:15.760> there

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
matter so work against most units there

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.270 
matter so work against most units there
are<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.360> couple<00:01:16.510> of<00:01:16.659> exceptions<00:01:17.170> such<00:01:17.890> as<00:01:17.950> siege

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
are a couple of exceptions such as siege

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.710 
are a couple of exceptions such as siege
tanks<00:01:18.700> can't<00:01:18.970> be<00:01:19.090> mineral<00:01:19.360> walk<00:01:20.020> past<00:01:21.720> all

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
tanks can't be mineral walk past all

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.060 
tanks can't be mineral walk past all
right<00:01:22.810> for<00:01:23.049> the<00:01:23.140> next<00:01:23.380> trick<00:01:23.560> we're<00:01:23.860> going<00:01:24.010> to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
right for the next trick we're going to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.010 
right for the next trick we're going to
look<00:01:24.190> at<00:01:24.430> pulling<00:01:24.820> our<00:01:25.030> workers<00:01:25.330> off<00:01:25.659> of<00:01:25.870> the<00:01:25.990> a

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
look at pulling our workers off of the a

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.280 
look at pulling our workers off of the a
building<00:01:27.180> without<00:01:28.180> camps<00:01:28.780> in<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:28.930> building

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
building without camps in the building

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.770 
building without camps in the building
so<00:01:29.320> we<00:01:29.560> do<00:01:29.710> have<00:01:29.740> this<00:01:30.430> barracks<00:01:30.940> that<00:01:31.090> is<00:01:31.479> in

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
so we do have this barracks that is in

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.210 
so we do have this barracks that is in
the<00:01:31.870> middle<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.110> building<00:01:32.320> we<00:01:32.950> want<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.159> get

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
the middle of building we want to get

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.710 
the middle of building we want to get
the<00:01:33.340> SCG<00:01:33.760> off<00:01:33.940> because<00:01:34.270> you've<00:01:34.390> noticed<00:01:34.659> that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
the SCG off because you've noticed that

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.000 
the SCG off because you've noticed that
there's<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:34.990> couple<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.290> zealots<00:01:35.590> down<00:01:35.830> there

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
there's a couple of zealots down there

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.490 
there's a couple of zealots down there
so<00:01:36.610> while<00:01:37.060> it's<00:01:37.240> building<00:01:37.600> we<00:01:37.840> just<00:01:38.049> press<00:01:38.229> the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
so while it's building we just press the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.730 
so while it's building we just press the
T<00:01:38.710> button<00:01:39.010> it's<00:01:39.850> also<00:01:40.330> highlighted<00:01:41.320> down<00:01:41.440> here

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
T button it's also highlighted down here

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.670 
T button it's also highlighted down here
that's<00:01:42.070> going<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.369> be<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.700> alt<00:01:43.570> button<00:01:43.930> we're

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
that's going to be the alt button we're

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.560 
that's going to be the alt button we're
not<00:01:44.830> canceling<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.400> building<00:01:45.729> we're<00:01:46.299> just

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
not canceling the building we're just

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.710 
not canceling the building we're just
stopping<00:01:46.990> with<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.890> SUV<00:01:48.700> from<00:01:48.820> doing<00:01:49.119> it<00:01:49.240> so

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
stopping with the SUV from doing it so

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.410 
stopping with the SUV from doing it so
that<00:01:49.900> way<00:01:50.080> we<00:01:50.439> can<00:01:50.590> maybe<00:01:50.770> throw<00:01:51.040> down<00:01:51.220> add<00:01:51.420> an

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
that way we can maybe throw down add an

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.170 
that way we can maybe throw down add an
extra<00:01:52.810> depot<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:54.189> actually<00:01:54.700> complete<00:01:55.030> this

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
extra depot and actually complete this

extra depot and actually complete this
wall<00:01:55.390> in<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.840> then<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.890> know<00:01:56.979> without

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
wall in and then you know without

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.800 
wall in and then you know without
actually<00:01:57.580> having<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.790> pull<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.299> workers<00:01:58.659> off

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.780 
the line sometimes it's just a little
bit<00:02:00.580> faster<00:02:00.939> to<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.180> that

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790
