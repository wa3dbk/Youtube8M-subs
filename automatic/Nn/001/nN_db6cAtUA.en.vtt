00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.320
 CHANEL N°5 Music Movie Behind the Scenes 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.600
 Character articles 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.640
 Gisele Bundchen starring 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.000
 Mitchell Whistman 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.200
 Catherine Martin Art Director 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.400
 Director Buzz Luman 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.840
 Giselle has a new world of sensual temperament 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.760
 And I think 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.680
 Like Coco Chanel, both of them are refreshing. 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.960
 Cocoa creates a new era for the old world 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.280
 She broke the stereotypes 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.640
 She is in close communication with the art pioneers. 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.360
 She is 100% new 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.800
 100% looking for possibilities 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.720
 100% pursuit of autonomy 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.240
 I think it might be a pleasure to endorse Giselle for N°5. 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.160
 I have known Giselle for a long time. 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.880
 She is a growing woman 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.000
 As the outside world rumors, she can step on the beach 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.120
 It shows the grace of sportsmen 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.040
 She is a mother 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.680
 Also pay great attention to emotional life 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.280
 Moreover, her career 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.040
 Can let her create that kind of desirable 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.080
 Sensual and glamorous image 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.240
 For her, the most important 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.560
 I can't say too much 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.320
 Is love, is satisfied 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.040
 I think this is what we want to express in this movie. 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.280
 I really think that you can see for yourself that Giselle’s work in the field is very important. 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.160
 What many people don’t understand is 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.480
 Giselle as a model 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.840
 The images created are not true to her. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.120
 She will let you know that it is just a character 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.480
 She is able to use body language very well 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.400
 To express sensibility or strength but that is just a role 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.480
 Fascinating 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.720
 And the image of women that is difficult to achieve 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.920
 You will be eager for this image and this is our original intention. 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.440
 In my opinion, Giselle is very down to earth. 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.800
 Very humorous, very straightforward 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.080
 Very smart, very enterprising, and full of power 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.320
 Giselle has her uniqueness 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.560
 She is good at limb expression 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.000
 She has a good athletic talent and she uses it skillfully. 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.760
 Clothing and body 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.560
 The way to express emotions in front of the camera 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.080
 Is so different 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.120
 She glows with a certain temperament 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.200
 And this can be in the image 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.080
 The skills to create emotions are amazing 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.760
 Maybe it’s different from the scene you originally imagined working with the model. 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.680
 And she is doing so well 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.760
 She is extremely energetic, it will make you 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.000
 a feeling of strength and active participation 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.280
 What surprised her audience is 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.360
 Although I have expected it 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.760
 But even I am surprised that 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.920
 Her extraordinary performance talent 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.200
 And the ability to express emotions 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.440
 Our time is always not enough 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.720
 We need more time but we can't do it. 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.880
 We only have one challenge. It doesn't matter with money, it's time. 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.320
 Mitchell is a good young actor 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.440
 His acting career has risen and starred in "The Game of Power" 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.640
 He has no dialogue in this short film. 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.160
 In the entire film he needs 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.920
 Truly express intricate emotions 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.880
 But not by language 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.560
 This is a big challenge for actors. 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.520
 Need appropriate acting skills 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.320
 Suddenly he felt someone behind him 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.760
 That is Miss G. 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.560
 He looked at her 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.280
 Slower, keep this expression going on... 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.400
 The camera moves forward and finds 5 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.360
 Kiss, kiss again... 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.920
 Arm down! Keep kissing and arm down! 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.120
 Arm down! 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.680
 This kiss is good! Ok, my arms are coming to kiss. Eight o'clock 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.080
 If you kiss him, I will have a lot of trouble. 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.080
 Stop, don't kiss again! 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.760
 Downtime, well 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.320
 This kiss is so beautiful! 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.800
 Thank you very much!
