00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 the magical gonzález a spectacular thing 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.300
 what I do is what craig told me 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.450
 The barcelona almost told me 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.920
 bambino that is what is between the five 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.770
 better foreigners than I saw play at 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.890
 magical soccer gonzález but to the 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.260
 wagon wagon training what 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.320
 It was at 10 o'clock, it was 11 o'clock, 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.570
 11 o'clock came the two of you know what they 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.680
 I gave the Donald Duck alarm clock 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.719
 I did saw in training 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 to be like that it seemed to go to a doctor I was 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.680
 magical if you do not wake up with this from 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.180
 true with my taste the other day 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.030
 training training the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.280
 arms 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.350
 they immediately have no solution 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.190
 then he knows what I do so he has a 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.190
 flamenco orchestra 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.989
 and start 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.130
 and magical but training we are not 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.189
 waiting 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:15.960
 the door that opens the door slowly and 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.960
 if I get up because I like music 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:30.479
 because I like music salvadores 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.189
 saviors 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.109
 this is the play that several 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.459
 inscriptions and rebounds and the ball arrives 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.380
 the Salvadoran has a day of form 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.659
 parabolic to the present environment 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.070
 from espanyol 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.330
 this auction 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.640
 Gonzalez again showed that he continues 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.890
 being magical I was lucky to play 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.620
 with the junior correntino with the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.990
 barcelona and then see the hooks 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.200
 that hit the Spanish birds 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.600
 It was unique because if you wanted to imitate the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.640
 magical gonzález could everything we wanted 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.580
 we wanted in training 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.890
 systematic of the computer hookup and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.230
 that what we wanted had a hook 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.850
 almost tear everything is within the 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.850
 players around the world 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.810
 that I played that I had in the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.110
 history has been magical gonzález grande 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.890
 who remembers her equator and that if 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.330
 I would leave that if I left the field and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.660
 revolutionized a match and you average 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.660
 goals 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.150
 although it is true here in the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.100
 Savior, if I was called a magician, 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.650
 certainly not so much in the savior itself 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.769
 but when our selection that 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.250
 qualified for Spain 82 then started to 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.709
 make your blanks matches from scratch 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.200
 the in the city of the angels yes yes 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.580
 I was told by a magician there 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.730
 Now, being in Spain, yes, there is 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.270
 changed what magician magician because I 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.000
 gave a slight explanation in which 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.970
 in which the magician is the one who does the magic and 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.990
 that they told me 'not magical because 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.400
 was the magician like that and it does not really fit 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.870
 doubt that the executioner of the brave is 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.510
 late in the ramón de carranza has been 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.430
 Gonzalez was again the magic 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.870
 Salvadoran scored the second goal and here 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.920
 we see him from the play of the first one 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.800
 it facilitates it to cheeks first second 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.440
 with the night of you if well and 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.740
 perfectly alone or accompanied by 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.620
 way how 231 accompanied can 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.500
 I do not know, I just love it because I feel that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.180
 in a certain way I relax I was sprained 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.670
 but I am accompanied also I love 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.520
 the mauer different in everything since you 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.760
 you see appear through the user's door 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.410
 until he should get dressed and especially 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.810
 it's different when you catch the ball that 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.870
 for me it has been I have not seen anyone 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.430
 do what I 've seen him do 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.890
 So for me it has been a real 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.720
 idol have been fulfilled 30 years of the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.150
 arrival of Salvadoran player Jorge 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.400
 magical gonzález to spain played nine 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.560
 seasons of them one in the Valladolid 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.260
 although it's been a long time since 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.180
 he left the cadiz nobody has forgotten him and he is 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.520
 that no one can forget that golazos 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.980
 that got the moves that his 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.040

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:48.100
 and many memories of the magician in his house 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.230

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:31.620

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.530
 we propose in this case 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.539
 footballingly speaking of a month that 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.979
 he considers me someone is me 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.949
 considering me I'm not 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:46.409

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.669
 there are positivists in all this because 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:49.669
