00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
combining aquaculture and hydroponics we

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.569 
combining aquaculture and hydroponics we
have<00:01:37.530> canceled<00:01:38.530> out<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.740> negative<00:01:39.130> aspects

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
of each here in this system we have

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.520 
of each here in this system we have
edible<00:01:42.640> fish<00:01:42.969> who<00:01:43.210> are<00:01:43.329> providing<00:01:43.930> nutrients

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
edible fish who are providing nutrients

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.670 
edible fish who are providing nutrients
into<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.399> water<00:01:45.640> system<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.689> that<00:01:47.469> water

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
into the water system and that water

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.139 
into the water system and that water
gets<00:01:47.920> pumped<00:01:48.219> up<00:01:48.310> through<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.579> hydroponic

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
gets pumped up through the hydroponic

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.270 
gets pumped up through the hydroponic
portion<00:01:49.600> where<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.049> plants<00:01:50.950> are<00:01:51.070> cleaning

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
portion where the plants are cleaning

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.980 
portion where the plants are cleaning
the<00:01:51.460> water<00:01:51.670> for<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.030> fish<00:01:52.240> at<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.539> same<00:01:52.689> time

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
the water for the fish at the same time

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.020 
the water for the fish at the same time
so<00:01:53.560> what<00:01:53.680> we've<00:01:53.829> got<00:01:53.859> is<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.369> symbiotic

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
so what we've got is a symbiotic

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.450 
so what we've got is a symbiotic
relationship<00:01:55.240> here<00:01:56.109> but<00:01:56.350> we've<00:01:56.740> also<00:01:56.920> got<00:01:57.250> is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
relationship here but we've also got is

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.630 
relationship here but we've also got is
a<00:01:57.490> simple<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.450> assisted<00:01:58.960> eco<00:01:59.380> system<00:01:59.829> okay

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
a simple and assisted eco system okay

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.569 
a simple and assisted eco system okay
this<00:02:00.939> is<00:02:01.359> the<00:02:01.810> raft<00:02:02.200> method<00:02:02.740> or<00:02:02.979> deep<00:02:03.310> water

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
this is the raft method or deep water

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.959 
this is the raft method or deep water
culture<00:02:03.850> in<00:02:04.359> this<00:02:05.170> situation<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.250> plants<00:02:06.850> are

so<00:02:56.230> in<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:56.680> hydroponic<00:02:57.160> technique<00:02:57.940> we're

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
so in this hydroponic technique we're

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.260 
so in this hydroponic technique we're
able<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.840> grow<00:02:59.140> completely<00:02:59.920> organic<00:03:00.460> food<00:03:00.910> I

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
able to grow completely organic food I

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.730 
able to grow completely organic food I

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
got to tell you Chris I can't believe

got to tell you Chris I can't believe
how<00:03:02.920> simple<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.790> looks<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.600> is<00:03:04.630> incredibly

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
how simple that looks it is incredibly

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.070 
how simple that looks it is incredibly
simple<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.860> used<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.520> grow<00:03:06.820> hydroponically<00:03:07.810> and

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
simple I used to grow hydroponically and

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.380 
simple I used to grow hydroponically and
every<00:03:08.380> day<00:03:08.590> I'd<00:03:08.800> have<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.280> check<00:03:09.520> nutrient

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
every day I'd have to check nutrient

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.500 
every day I'd have to check nutrient
levels<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.900> ph's<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:12.010> adjust<00:03:12.880> things<00:03:13.090> in

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
levels and ph's and adjust things in

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.380 
levels and ph's and adjust things in
this<00:03:13.750> system<00:03:13.960> I<00:03:14.350> come<00:03:14.620> out<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:14.860> feed<00:03:15.040> fish<00:03:15.390> I

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
this system I come out and feed fish I

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.370 
this system I come out and feed fish I
love<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:16.930> there's<00:03:17.110> no<00:03:17.260> chemicals

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
love that and there's no chemicals

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.840 
love that and there's no chemicals
involved<00:03:17.950> no<00:03:18.190> chemicals

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
involved no chemicals

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.840 
involved no chemicals
well<00:03:19.480> there's<00:03:19.870> chemicals<00:03:20.470> involved<00:03:20.740> but<00:03:21.130> not

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
well there's chemicals involved but not

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.260 
well there's chemicals involved but not
like<00:03:22.000> we<00:03:22.180> see<00:03:22.530> spraying<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:24.280> yes<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.970> buffer

like we see spraying and yes to buffer
my<00:03:25.420> pH<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:25.960> use<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.170> chemical<00:03:26.500> called<00:03:26.980> calcium

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
my pH I use a chemical called calcium

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.880 
my pH I use a chemical called calcium
carbonate<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.300> calcium<00:03:29.110> carbonate<00:03:29.710> has

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
carbonate and calcium carbonate has

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.550 
carbonate and calcium carbonate has
simply<00:03:30.250> ground-up<00:03:30.850> seashells<00:03:31.300> and<00:03:31.600> coral

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
simply ground-up seashells and coral

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.620 
simply ground-up seashells and coral
sand<00:03:32.770> I<00:03:33.010> put<00:03:33.520> that<00:03:33.640> into<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.030> system<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.540> so

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
sand I put that into the system and so

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.890 
sand I put that into the system and so
the<00:03:34.660> pH<00:03:34.930> naturally<00:03:35.650> drops<00:03:36.490> low<00:03:36.820> it<00:03:37.300> fizzes

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
the pH naturally drops low it fizzes

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.650 
the pH naturally drops low it fizzes
