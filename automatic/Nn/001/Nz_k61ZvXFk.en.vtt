android system for this unit right here

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.089 
android system for this unit right here
all<00:02:09.629> right<00:02:09.840> pretty<00:02:10.410> cool<00:02:10.590> eh<00:02:10.619> give<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
all right pretty cool eh give you a

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.600 
all right pretty cool eh give you a
little<00:02:12.319> carrying<00:02:13.319> case

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.920 

and<00:02:19.220> well<00:02:20.220> that's<00:02:20.430> pretty<00:02:21.060> neat<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.540> actually

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and well that's pretty neat it actually

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.580 
and well that's pretty neat it actually
has<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.500> where<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.730> blocks<00:02:24.300> or<00:02:24.780> basically

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
has it where it blocks or basically

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.090 
has it where it blocks or basically
keeps<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.190> unit<00:02:26.490> in<00:02:26.700> place<00:02:27.350> so<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.650> think<00:02:28.740> you

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
keeps the unit in place so I think you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.300 
keeps the unit in place so I think you
just<00:02:30.140> unlock<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.380> or<00:02:31.500> pull<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:31.920> out<00:02:32.070> or

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
just unlock it or pull it out or

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.620 
just unlock it or pull it out or
something<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.350> just<00:02:34.560> slide<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.490> out

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
something and you just slide it out

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.710 
something and you just slide it out
pretty<00:02:36.630> easy<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.590> then<00:02:38.250> here<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:39.420> unit

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
pretty easy and then here it is the unit

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.120 
pretty easy and then here it is the unit
right<00:02:39.870> here<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:41.880> peel<00:02:42.270> off<00:02:42.300> the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130
