bottle so first what we're gonna do just
take<00:00:43.079> off<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> bottom<00:00:45.500> usually<00:00:46.500> comes<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.860> a

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
take off the bottom usually comes with a

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.240 
take off the bottom usually comes with a
spongy<00:00:48.210> particulate<00:00:48.870> filter<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:50.070> has

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:24.679 
it so we'll just take this disgusting
order<00:01:08.390> turn<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:11.150> few<00:01:12.150> pumps<00:01:23.420> they<00:01:24.420> don't<00:01:24.570> show

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
order turn it few pumps they don't show

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.899 
order turn it few pumps they don't show
this<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.960> many<00:01:25.140> other<00:01:25.320> videos<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:25.920> clear<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
this in many other videos but clear the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:42.280 
this in many other videos but clear the
directions<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> fluid<00:01:28.170> starts<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.719 

and<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.409> thing<00:01:43.619> filters<00:01:44.009> down<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:46.729> 15

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
and this thing filters down to 15

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.120 
and this thing filters down to 15
nanometers<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.680> should<00:01:49.860> taste<00:01:50.009> like

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
nanometers so this should taste like

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.740 
nanometers so this should taste like
clean<00:01:51.030> water<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.940> certainly<00:01:57.240> does<00:01:57.420> taste<00:01:57.659> like

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
clean water it certainly does taste like

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.680 
clean water it certainly does taste like
clean<00:01:58.049> water<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.850> don't<00:01:59.850> taste<00:02:00.119> any<00:02:00.330> mosquito

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
clean water I don't taste any mosquito

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.050
