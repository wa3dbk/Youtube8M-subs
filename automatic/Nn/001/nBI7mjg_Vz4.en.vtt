 fold that is sewn and serves to adjust 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.930
 parts of a piece of clothing 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.669

 on this little skirt at the level of 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.660
 belt 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.460
 the simple clip that starts from the edge of the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.250
 fabric is shown on the patterns in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.010
 general by a triangle sometimes by a

 simple line we start with reporter 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.539
 the boss landmarks on the fabric for 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.520
 that you can use a little too much 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.500
 erase the machine for 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.560
 diffusers and a chalk for fabrics 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.060

 come and mark a location that is not 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.720
 not on the edges of the fabric take a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.579
 pin and come stung behind your 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.160
 fabric is the boss then you can 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.170
 removed the boss is marked with your 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.550
 felt or your cream the location of 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.550
 pin to finish marking 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.979
 you will then be able to pay your 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.469
 fabric place versus place for 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.079
 preformed your complexion then it will have to 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.030
 come pinned start with the singles 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.439
 and along the marking line at 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.750
 every time you plant a pin 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.850
 on your line on the right check that at 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.219
 left it stands out well on the same 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.869
 line you will be so sure we are not 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.819
 far in this way that the lines 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.319
 well coincide you two sides and that 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.319
 your bread and well trained 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.840
 to finish pinned come take the 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.310
 pins that you will click 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.470
 perpendicular to the line of 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.810
 sewing and removing the first pins 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.060
 that you have placed another option 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.060
 would be to build your seam 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.950
 when you place your pins 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.540
 perpendicular to your night's 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.310
 sewing think about not too much 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.989
 to sink into the fabric it will be more 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.900
 simple for sewing machine by the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.120
 after the machine we will use a 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.690
 classic straight stitch with a length 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.800
 rather tight points 2 1 or 2 2 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.019
 check by turning the steering wheel towards you 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.300
 that the eight is well positioned then 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.769
 makes three points forward and three 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.110
 points back this is called 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.170
 a point bar and then you can 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.910
 do your sewing take your time 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.380
 to sew well on the lily and remove 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.700
 the pins as you go 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.959
 See how we do not have them too 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.319
 think they are a lot easier 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.319
 to remove 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.090
 when you arrive to the tip of 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.940
 your hunger especially do not stop 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.570
 went all the way to sewing 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.820
 in the void 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.740
 beyond the fabric it's over you can 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.600
 lift your foot lenders and cut the 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.760
 son of the fabric in this well let a 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.260
 small margin of 5 to 10 cm hanging on 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.170
 your point because we are going to have 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.880
 need to finish and that's what 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.960
 looks like your ends once she 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.660
 is sewn you can come cut the 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.470
 son of the edge of your bread and for this 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.510
 who from the tip 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.610
 you are going to come to the mano a 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.610
 double knot to secure the seam 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.390
 if we point it to the hand it's 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.010
 because the back point to the club 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.030
 would leave too many traces effect 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.030
 replied lapointe 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.150
 we end up by shaping the clip to 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.650
 using the iron by folding the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.650
 clip right or left 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.910
 here you know how to sew an end you 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.100
 can you stop there or if you 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.260
 would like to sew your side brush on 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.060
 which you have turned down as we have 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.019
 for example on this little skirt 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.019
 at the belt level 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.000
