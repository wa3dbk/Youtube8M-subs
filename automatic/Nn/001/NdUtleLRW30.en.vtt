clipper<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.270> few<00:00:06.480> days<00:00:06.600> ago<00:00:07.429> because<00:00:08.429> my<00:00:08.490> BGR

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
clipper a few days ago because my BGR

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.509 
clipper a few days ago because my BGR
went<00:00:09.630> out<00:00:09.929> my<00:00:10.500> BGR<00:00:11.010> v1<00:00:11.880> on<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.090> fritz

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.430 

it<00:00:14.910> had<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> variable<00:00:15.599> speed<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> two

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it had the variable speed with the two

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.710 
it had the variable speed with the two
buttons<00:00:16.770> right<00:00:16.859> here<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.940> switch<00:00:18.300> started

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
buttons right here that switch started

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.279 
buttons right here that switch started
going<00:00:18.930> out

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
going out

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.960 
going out
so<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> Clipper<00:00:19.740> wouldn't<00:00:20.130> turn<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.310> properly

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
so the Clipper wouldn't turn on properly

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060 
so the Clipper wouldn't turn on properly
and<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.449> had<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.720> play<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.560> buttons<00:00:22.890> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and I had to play with the buttons to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.210 
and I had to play with the buttons to
get<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.640> start<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.140> ended<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.800> returning

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
get it to start so I ended up returning

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
get it to start so I ended up returning
that<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.939> my<00:00:27.480> aunt<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.840> Superliner<00:00:28.289> which<00:00:28.500> I

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
that because all the rest of them have

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.140 
that because all the rest of them have
these<00:01:28.470> big<00:01:28.680> huge<00:01:28.710> cases<00:01:29.490> where<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.790> one's<00:01:30.000> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
these big huge cases where this one's so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.359 
these big huge cases where this one's so
small<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:31.290> get<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.590> feel<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.799> heat<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> only

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
small you get to feel the heat the only

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.740 
small you get to feel the heat the only
time<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.729> feel<00:01:32.909> heat<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.240> from<00:01:33.600> this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
time you feel heat really from this

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.050 
time you feel heat really from this
thing<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.079> from<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.759> see<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
thing is from here but you can see the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:45.429 
thing is from here but you can see the
difference<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> sound<00:01:41.090> wow<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.329> is

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:52.969 

compared<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:51.500> would<00:01:52.500> say<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.799> is

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
compared to this so I would say this is

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.999 
compared to this so I would say this is
a<00:01:53.009> nice<00:01:53.280> clipper<00:01:53.689> works<00:01:54.689> real<00:01:54.960> good<00:01:55.009> blades

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
a nice clipper works real good blades

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.090 
a nice clipper works real good blades
don't<00:01:56.159> get<00:01:56.369> hot<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:57.240> super<00:01:57.689> light<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.710> even

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
don't get hot it's super light it's even

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.389 
don't get hot it's super light it's even
as<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.179> I<00:02:00.209> got<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:02.360> master<00:02:03.360> here

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
as you can see I got the master here

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.490 
as you can see I got the master here
same<00:02:05.399> length<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.569> even<00:02:06.719> thinner<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
same length but it's even thinner in the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.369 
same length but it's even thinner in the
body<00:02:08.000> so<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.239> even<00:02:09.509> gonna<00:02:09.629> be<00:02:09.810> easier<00:02:10.229> to

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
body so it's even gonna be easier to

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.240 
body so it's even gonna be easier to
handle<00:02:10.670> then<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.849> fade<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.540> clipper<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.980> it's

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
handle then you fade and clipper so it's

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.089 
handle then you fade and clipper so it's
gonna<00:02:14.370> cut<00:02:14.610> down<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> lot<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.239> fatigue<00:02:16.099> being

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
gonna cut down on a lot of fatigue being

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.350 
gonna cut down on a lot of fatigue being
that<00:02:17.280> small<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.680> would<00:02:19.860> say<00:02:20.209> this<00:02:21.209> is

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
that small so I would say this is

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.330 
that small so I would say this is
something<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.690> might<00:02:21.840> want<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.079> pick<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.440> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
something you might want to pick up and
