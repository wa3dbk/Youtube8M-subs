00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
use and set the keenya mm squirrel trap

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.160 
use and set the keenya mm squirrel trap
the<00:00:08.970> first<00:00:09.210> thing<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.420> want<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.660> mention<00:00:09.809> is

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
the first thing I want to mention is

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.839 
the first thing I want to mention is
that<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> kill<00:00:11.460> trap<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.679> basically

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
that this is a kill trap and basically

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.660 
that this is a kill trap and basically
it<00:00:14.849> operates<00:00:15.450> off<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.870> one<00:00:16.080> large<00:00:16.379> spring<00:00:16.920> as

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
it operates off of one large spring as

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.310 
it operates off of one large spring as
you<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:18.000> see<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> back<00:00:18.660> here<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
you can see in the back here this is the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.279 
you can see in the back here this is the
spring<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.939> upper<00:00:21.240> spring<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
spring you have the upper spring and the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.980 
spring you have the upper spring and the
lower<00:00:22.500> spring<00:00:23.330> the<00:00:24.330> lower<00:00:24.570> part<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
lower spring the lower part of the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.609 
lower spring the lower part of the
spring<00:00:25.320> actually<00:00:25.830> comes<00:00:26.519> down<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.439> hits<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
spring actually comes down and hits the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.230 
spring actually comes down and hits the
kill<00:00:28.859> bar<00:00:29.099> down<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.029> actually

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
kill bar down here and that is actually

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.299 
kill bar down here and that is actually
the<00:00:30.570> mechanism<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.650> which<00:00:31.769> kills<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the mechanism to which kills the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.310 
the mechanism to which kills the
squirrel

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
squirrel

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.500 
squirrel
since<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.500> upper<00:00:34.890> part<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> spring<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
since the upper part of the spring is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.869 
since the upper part of the spring is
still<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.440> supper<00:00:37.770> latch<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.550> still

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
still in the supper latch it is still

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.479 
still in the supper latch it is still
loaded<00:00:39.379> in<00:00:40.379> order<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.770> set<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.250> will<00:00:41.340> have

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
loaded in order to set it we will have

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.119 
loaded in order to set it we will have
to<00:00:41.640> unload<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.239> trap<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.680> we'll<00:00:43.920> set

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to unload this trap to do that we'll set

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.459 
to unload this trap to do that we'll set
it<00:00:44.219> down<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.610> firm<00:00:44.879> surface<00:00:45.320> grip<00:00:46.320> it

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it down on a firm surface grip it

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.770 
it down on a firm surface grip it
tightly<00:00:46.710> push<00:00:47.399> down<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> upper<00:00:48.480> spring

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
tightly push down on the upper spring

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.170 
tightly push down on the upper spring
and<00:00:48.989> bring<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.649> out<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> latch<00:00:52.969> we'll<00:00:53.969> push

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and bring it out of the latch we'll push

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.760 
and bring it out of the latch we'll push
this<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.600> way<00:00:54.750> back<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:58.140> side<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
this all the way back on the side as you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.099 
this all the way back on the side as you
can<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.160> there's<00:00:59.820> an<00:01:00.030> access<00:01:00.449> panel<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.930> the

can see there's an access panel to the
where<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> trigger<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.120> other

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
where the trigger and the other

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.630 
where the trigger and the other
mechanisms<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.650> open<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.189> panel

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
mechanisms are to open up this panel
