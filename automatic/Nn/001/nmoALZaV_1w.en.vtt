if<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.649> haven't<00:01:56.830> tried<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.039> you<00:01:57.220> can<00:01:57.340> go<00:01:57.429> to

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
if you haven't tried it you can go to

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.580 
if you haven't tried it you can go to
Sephora<00:01:57.789> and<00:01:58.239> just<00:01:58.840> throw<00:01:59.020> some<00:01:59.200> on<00:01:59.289> and<00:01:59.470> see

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
Sephora and just throw some on and see

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.699 
Sephora and just throw some on and see
how<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.770> like<00:02:00.009> it<00:02:00.039> and<00:02:00.989> while<00:02:01.989> I<00:02:02.020> do<00:02:02.170> like<00:02:02.500> it

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
how you like it and while I do like it

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.430 
how you like it and while I do like it
this<00:02:03.039> is<00:02:03.310> only<00:02:03.569> $14<00:02:04.569> I<00:02:04.780> mean<00:02:04.899> it's<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.259> much

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
this is only $14 I mean it's so much

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.800 
this is only $14 I mean it's so much
cheaper<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.190> me<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:06.399> feel<00:02:07.030> like<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.390> has<00:02:07.569> the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
cheaper and to me I feel like it has the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.469 
cheaper and to me I feel like it has the
same<00:02:08.080> performance<00:02:08.950> I've<00:02:09.819> had<00:02:10.330> more

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
same performance I've had more

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.290 
same performance I've had more
experience<00:02:10.899> with<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.110> Dior<00:02:11.580> skin<00:02:12.580> flash<00:02:12.970> one

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
experience with the Dior skin flash one

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.270 
experience with the Dior skin flash one
and<00:02:13.629> I<00:02:14.110> feel<00:02:14.290> like<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.650> performs<00:02:15.040> better

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and I feel like this performs better

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.020 
and I feel like this performs better
than<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.640> one

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
than that one

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.210 
than that one
and<00:02:16.570> it's<00:02:16.720> less<00:02:17.230> than<00:02:17.260> half<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.710> cost<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:18.100> it

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
and it's less than half the cost of it

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.330 
and it's less than half the cost of it
so<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.420> really<00:02:19.990> like<00:02:20.320> this<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.680> applied<00:02:21.070> this

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
so I really like this I applied this

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.790 
so I really like this I applied this
before<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:21.910> apply<00:02:22.270> my<00:02:22.300> foundation<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:23.350> then<00:02:23.710> I

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
before I apply my foundation and then I

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.760 
before I apply my foundation and then I
bought<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.130> in<00:02:24.250> just<00:02:24.400> my<00:02:24.610> fingers<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.710> just<00:02:26.710> a

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
bought it in just my fingers and just a

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.920 
bought it in just my fingers and just a
little<00:02:26.950> tip<00:02:27.190> for<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.490> long<00:02:27.670> time<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:27.970> used<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.330> so

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
little tip for a long time I used to so

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.540 
little tip for a long time I used to so
try<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.080> still<00:02:29.380> do<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.650> when<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:30.160> would<00:02:30.340> do<00:02:30.490> stuff

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
try to still do it when I would do stuff

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.150 
try to still do it when I would do stuff
under<00:02:30.880> my<00:02:30.910> eyes<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.630> would<00:02:32.080> kind<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.320> like<00:02:32.410> open

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160

my mouth and stretch out my skin and I

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.810 
my mouth and stretch out my skin and I
would<00:02:34.990> start<00:02:35.350> like<00:02:35.980> kind<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.250> squish<00:02:36.550> my

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820

forehead<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.330> little<00:02:37.420> bit<00:02:37.750> what<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.590> should

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
forehead a little bit what you should

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.370 
forehead a little bit what you should
really<00:02:38.980> do<00:02:39.250> our<00:02:39.520> way<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> remedy<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.840> just

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
really do our way to remedy that is just

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.530 
really do our way to remedy that is just
look<00:02:41.770> up<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.310> seems<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:42.760> silly<00:02:43.000> maybe<00:02:43.300> you

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
look up it seems so silly maybe you

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.570 
look up it seems so silly maybe you
already<00:02:43.780> do<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.080> but<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.440> didn't<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.100> didn't

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
already do that but I didn't I didn't

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.830 
already do that but I didn't I didn't
know<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.820> little<00:02:46.120> trick<00:02:46.300> for<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.510> really<00:02:46.720> long

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
know that little trick for a really long

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.449 
know that little trick for a really long
time<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:47.320> if<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.440> just<00:02:47.590> look<00:02:47.770> up<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.310> lot

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
time so if you just look up it's a lot

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.190 
time so if you just look up it's a lot
easier<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:48.850> you<00:02:49.030> don't<00:02:49.209> have<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.450> scrunch<00:02:50.020> any

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
easier and you don't have to scrunch any

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.400 
easier and you don't have to scrunch any
of<00:02:50.260> your<00:02:50.350> skin<00:02:50.560> around<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.570> usually<00:02:52.959> apply

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
of your skin around so I usually apply

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.130 
of your skin around so I usually apply
this<00:02:53.470> quite<00:02:54.400> heavily<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.090> then<00:02:55.570> when<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.720> go<00:02:55.989> in

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
this quite heavily and then when I go in

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.690 
this quite heavily and then when I go in
with<00:02:56.170> my<00:02:56.410> foundation<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:57.010> don't<00:02:57.190> apply<00:02:57.489> any

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
with my foundation I don't apply any

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.250 
with my foundation I don't apply any
foundation<00:02:58.090> straight<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.780> but<00:02:58.959> as<00:02:59.080> I'm

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260

doing my foundation working in it and

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.850 
doing my foundation working in it and
working<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.140> noticed<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.590> know<00:03:02.709> my

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
working it in and I noticed you know my

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.740 
working it in and I noticed you know my
foundation<00:03:03.760> starting<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.120> kind<00:03:04.300> of<00:03:04.360> blend<00:03:04.540> in

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
foundation starting to kind of blend in

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.000 
foundation starting to kind of blend in
more<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.170> more<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.470> have<00:03:05.620> less<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:05.950> less

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
more and more and I have less and less

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.890 
more and more and I have less and less
of<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.220> on<00:03:06.340> my<00:03:06.459> brush<00:03:06.700> then<00:03:07.270> I<00:03:07.420> just<00:03:07.600> kind<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.780> go

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
of it on my brush then I just kind of go

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.130 
of it on my brush then I just kind of go
in<00:03:08.080> here<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.470> smooth<00:03:09.160> out<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:10.330> edges<00:03:10.690> and

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.630 
in here and smooth out the edges and
just<00:03:11.380> kind<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:11.950> mix<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.280> with<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.520> foundation

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
just kind of mix it with the foundation

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.270 
just kind of mix it with the foundation
a<00:03:13.000> little<00:03:13.209> bit<00:03:13.450> before<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.780> start<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:15.070> works

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
a little bit before I start and it works

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.650 
a little bit before I start and it works
like<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.640> dream<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:15.970> works<00:03:16.090> better<00:03:16.270> than<00:03:16.390> any

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
like a dream it works better than any
