college dorms didn't have the money for
an<00:04:58.420> apartment<00:04:58.660> so<00:04:59.110> this<00:04:59.290> was<00:04:59.470> an<00:04:59.650> ideal

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
and as students go when people would ask

and as students go when people would ask
me<00:05:09.460> where<00:05:09.790> where<00:05:10.510> you're<00:05:10.690> staying<00:05:10.930> i<00:05:11.170> said<00:05:11.380> in

me where where you're staying i said in

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.610 
me where where you're staying i said in
the<00:05:11.560> bell<00:05:11.830> building<00:05:12.280> and<00:05:13.260> most<00:05:14.260> students

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
the bell building and most students

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.900 
the bell building and most students
didn't<00:05:14.830> even<00:05:14.980> know<00:05:15.070> what<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.340> bell<00:05:15.520> building

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
didn't even know what the bell building

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.610 
didn't even know what the bell building
was<00:05:16.650> times<00:05:17.650> Marland<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:19.290> this<00:05:20.290> place

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
was times Marland and this place

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.270 
was times Marland and this place
certainly<00:05:20.950> has<00:05:21.310> seen<00:05:22.350> seen<00:05:23.350> better<00:05:23.560> times<00:05:23.650> and

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
certainly has seen seen better times and

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.480 
certainly has seen seen better times and
I<00:05:24.669> think<00:05:25.390> it's<00:05:25.540> great<00:05:25.690> that<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:27.040> Medical

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
I think it's great that the Medical

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.450 
I think it's great that the Medical
Center<00:05:27.820> is<00:05:27.910> moving<00:05:28.270> ahead<00:05:28.390> and<00:05:29.370> tearing<00:05:30.370> this

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
Center is moving ahead and tearing this

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.960 
Center is moving ahead and tearing this
place<00:05:30.580> down<00:05:30.790> and<00:05:31.419> and<00:05:32.730> building<00:05:33.730> something

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
place down and and building something

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.770 
place down and and building something
else<00:05:34.240> here<00:05:34.500> it<00:05:35.500> is<00:05:35.710> inevitable<00:05:36.400> that<00:05:36.780> change

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
else here it is inevitable that change

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.670 
else here it is inevitable that change
occurs<00:05:38.229> and<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.680> bell<00:05:39.370> building<00:05:40.229> is<00:05:41.229> no

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
occurs and the bell building is no

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.710 
occurs and the bell building is no
longer<00:05:42.100> the<00:05:42.790> kind<00:05:43.060> of<00:05:43.180> building<00:05:43.540> that

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
longer the kind of building that

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.350 
longer the kind of building that
supports<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.680> nature<00:05:45.130> of<00:05:45.520> research<00:05:46.330> that

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
supports the nature of research that

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.140 
supports the nature of research that
needs<00:05:46.690> to<00:05:47.050> be<00:05:47.169> done<00:05:47.350> today<00:05:47.560> so<00:05:47.740> it<00:05:48.580> has<00:05:48.790> served

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
needs to be done today so it has served

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.320 
needs to be done today so it has served
this<00:05:49.390> time<00:05:49.750> I<00:05:50.250> think<00:05:51.250> that<00:05:51.400> the<00:05:51.490> bell<00:05:51.700> building

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
this time I think that the bell building

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.320 
this time I think that the bell building
was<00:05:52.600> the<00:05:53.350> perfect<00:05:53.620> substrate<00:05:54.460> the<00:05:54.700> perfect

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
was the perfect substrate the perfect

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:04.440 
was the perfect substrate the perfect
forum<00:05:56.290> the<00:05:56.880> perfect<00:05:58.590> experiment<00:06:00.540> and<00:06:01.540> I<00:06:02.850> and<00:06:03.850> I

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
forum the perfect experiment and I and I

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.620 
forum the perfect experiment and I and I
think<00:06:04.690> it<00:06:04.780> had<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.140> right<00:06:05.320> mix<00:06:05.770> of<00:06:06.010> people

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
think it had the right mix of people

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.530 
think it had the right mix of people
with<00:06:07.630> wonderful<00:06:08.500> sensibilities<00:06:09.419> there<00:06:10.419> was

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
with wonderful sensibilities there was

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.840 
with wonderful sensibilities there was
more<00:06:10.840> that<00:06:10.900> happen<00:06:11.620> other<00:06:11.890> than<00:06:12.010> wonderful

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
more that happen other than wonderful

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.300 
more that happen other than wonderful
experiments<00:06:13.660> and<00:06:13.780> lots<00:06:14.020> of<00:06:14.310> scientific

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
experiments and lots of scientific

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.510 
experiments and lots of scientific
discourse<00:06:15.610> that<00:06:16.030> happened<00:06:16.890> but<00:06:17.890> what<00:06:18.340> might

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
discourse that happened but what might

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.050 
discourse that happened but what might
have<00:06:18.669> been<00:06:18.790> even<00:06:19.270> as<00:06:19.590> important<00:06:20.610> was<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:21.820> fact

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
have been even as important was the fact

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.370 
have been even as important was the fact
that<00:06:22.300> there<00:06:22.990> were<00:06:23.610> those<00:06:24.610> first<00:06:25.030> steps<00:06:25.380> that

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
that there were those first steps that

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.930 
that there were those first steps that
allow<00:06:26.650> people<00:06:27.010> to<00:06:27.820> do<00:06:28.360> just<00:06:28.930> what<00:06:29.110> was<00:06:29.290> right

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
allow people to do just what was right

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.300 
allow people to do just what was right
to<00:06:30.940> dismantle<00:06:32.580> the<00:06:33.870> segregation<00:06:34.870> that

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
to dismantle the segregation that

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.790 
to dismantle the segregation that
duquette<00:06:36.310> lived<00:06:36.610> in<00:06:36.880> for<00:06:37.120> such<00:06:37.300> a<00:06:37.330> long<00:06:37.600> time

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
duquette lived in for such a long time

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.270 
duquette lived in for such a long time
to<00:06:38.800> show<00:06:39.730> people<00:06:40.150> that<00:06:40.390> at<00:06:41.170> the<00:06:41.590> base<00:06:41.830> of<00:06:41.860> this

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
to show people that at the base of this

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.970 
to show people that at the base of this
is<00:06:42.700> just<00:06:43.030> about<00:06:43.240> people<00:06:43.720> so<00:06:44.620> I<00:06:44.680> don't<00:06:44.770> think

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
is just about people so I don't think

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.710 
is just about people so I don't think
that<00:06:45.160> the<00:06:45.310> bell<00:06:45.490> building<00:06:45.970> will<00:06:46.150> ever<00:06:46.390> go<00:06:46.630> away

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
that the bell building will ever go away

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.040 
that the bell building will ever go away
you<00:06:47.080> physically<00:06:47.830> may<00:06:48.400> go<00:06:48.610> away<00:06:48.730> but<00:06:49.720> it<00:06:49.780> won't

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
you physically may go away but it won't

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.590 
you physically may go away but it won't
ever<00:06:50.260> go<00:06:50.410> away
