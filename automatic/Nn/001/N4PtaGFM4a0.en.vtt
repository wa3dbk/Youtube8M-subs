00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hi the buzz takes a little video 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.259
 to explain to you in less than three 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.850
 minutes how to make your beer all 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.850
 grain go it's gone follow me 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:25.070
 according to our recipe we will integrate 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.770
 wheat barley from the malting circle 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.189
 koladÃ© malt caramel malts palou soon 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.439
 now 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.110
 it is then to cut its grains 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.930
 in five small pieces in order to be able to 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.220
 Collectively extracted milk sugar from 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.440
 cereals this is called the 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.690
 crushing 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.629
 this grain is mixed for about one 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.280
 hour at around 65 degrees that's what 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.780
 call in soup it allows to extract 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.030
 cereals sugar 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.890
 we then try to get rid of 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.440
 cereals to recover only the juice 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.059
 sweet that's what we call the soft 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.269
 soft will be transferred to another 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.500
 tank and to be sure to occupy the 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.539
 sugar case in cereals 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.600
 Well we go to Reims and yet 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.700
 young water in our worship right 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.570
 but it's mainly the dredges 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.060
 who played me a very vital role 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.979
 liquid it is time to add 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.750
 hops the beer runs what will 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.270
 to give bitterness for that in the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.200
 second that we will mount our moore to 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.659
 100 Â° the forecasts and then all that 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.720
 for another hour nail against the 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.340
 hungry it's not that men 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.890
 at the end of this stage we have finished 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.430
 cooking and our hot thought ingredients 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.350
 we sterilize the order say we're going 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.960
 to pass water through this species 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.400
 swirl that worker and then it's going 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.760
 rebuild our liquid now 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.310
 transfer our liquid in the home 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.360
 very important temptation it is necessary that 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.110
 everything is fine well clean well clean 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.300
 it's when its prey that it's 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.010
 dangerous to remember we can taste 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.440
 it is not the coliseum that sparkling but 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.180
 it was already very long before adding 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.810
 yeast we will violently turn the beer 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.140
 to oxygen and then we ready for 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.850
 inoculated with the yeast flat else 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.770
 of work and will make beer 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.430
 sparkling alcoholic course 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.500
 delicious it only remains to wait 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.290
 a small month before the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.610
 taste you smell and loot and 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.610
 especially for brewing freedom 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.440
 these days
