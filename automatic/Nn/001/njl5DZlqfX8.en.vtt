00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.090
 it's at the heart of the Breton symbol giving 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.190
 that we have an appointment with the 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.170
 singer songwriter pat o'may for the 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.170
 release of his new album the chipmunks 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.820
 more 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.230
 it's a fast album ie 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.550
 I started to worry about three titles 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.380
 whose medley surfer nothing stival 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.930
 I went to see a record company 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.750
 that I would have proposed the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.130
 the problem and then so after he has 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.510
 had to put to work because he got me 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.090
 said but when could you 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.620
 go out in 2013 or something like that 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.190
 I said no no no we're going to take him out 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.130
 November 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.850
 the idea was to really write in 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.230
 the urgency is so the whole composition 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.930
 was made in June 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.740
 after we will start recording months 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.180
 of july august and but I had some 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.220
 shot at the same time finally good it's 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.410
 it was small end to end 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.770
 and then on the other hand we kept all the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.030
 October and then we ended up with a 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.550
 once the mix is â€‹â€‹doing the mastering so 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.190
 celebrated on the v-rod in the shade I try 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.830
 to mix ethnic music and then 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.210
 that metal etc 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.440
 of course using music 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.290
 Celtic water is Arabic music 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.460
 Chinese has plenty of things there 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.570
 I really wanted to have something 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.870
 to tighten and dale more a little bit towards 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.150
 my roots be they 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.300
 emotional for brittany 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.430
 that it be genetic for ireland and 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.070
 wherever they are musical for the 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.930
 metal side or who is really the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.720
 music I started with 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.330
 and then and then bah of the coup I asked 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.950
 to a whole lot of friends to become on 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.010
 the album which sent brennan who is 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.770
 came to make a duet 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.440
 johnatan no here the bassist arxiv but 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.430
 also gary moore's bassist 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.980
 finally the last guy bassist and me 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.570
 since unfortunately a year ago we 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.600
 has now left two years and then 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.890
 of course there is martine bar the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.040
 guitarist to be south with whom I 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.970
 works now since times that makes 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.700
 three years we work together 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.930
 now I believe 3 4 years old and I play 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.770
 also in his group by the way that he has 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.090
 acquired the climb so that's great 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.090
 because it's a two song says in 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.220
 boxing patois and it's extraordinary 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.650
 and then as well are of course 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.500
 the duo we did with alan stivell or 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.050
 mac os writes the text and that's very 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.959
 very nice adventure with alan it's 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.209
 yeah it's ordinary too I surround myself 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.989
 of people who have a talent for sick people and 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.060
 which sublimates 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.160
 actually the parts that I wrote 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.870
 that said that's the best idea as 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.250
 as I am now working with the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.510
 same team since that's fifty 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.950
 five six years we are together 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.650
 so I know exactly what they are 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.000
 able to do and when I write the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.390
 arrangements with the parties 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.650
 battery for example i know what fred 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.379
 can do I know what will suppose 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.939
 I know how far I can push too 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.129
 result it gives a very successful album 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:34.849
 then and next is in five months 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:37.040
 also on the tour that especially from his 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.370
 tour that starts the first date 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.900
 is the 5th of April in brittany to saint 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.909
 brieuc 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.790
 this is where we will present the show or 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.430
 to people and then me not bad to people the 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.290
 profession so inevitably and after the 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.989
 tour actually starts June so 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.010
 I have a lot of dates in 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.920
 advantage 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.310
 I heard that we would come on 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.400
 nantes 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.569
 so I'm very happy with that and then 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.930
 learns also in the east of the 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.360

 there will be all the summer festivals 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.000

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.920

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.109
