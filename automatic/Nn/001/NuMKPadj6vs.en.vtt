 Hi there, this is a continuation of the video clip 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.290
 replacement of the drive gland under warranty and 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.330
 so today came from from official 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.390
 dealer 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:26.189
 winter replaced steel drive oil seal 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:30.630
 and stretched the box as I am now to you 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.279
 show on video was during well as i 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.480
 I noticed my 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:43.559
 should flows through the rider and then on 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:46.079
 I saw the photos as if what I had 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.280
 still ticking a little 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.800
 with a short on what the master suggested to me 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.660
 stretch this one here leaked to me 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.469
 he was stretched said you will be 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.040
 leaking then we will have a radical 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.110
 where the action is what to shoot the box 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.180
 half will affect the sealant does not understand 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.659
 why winds does not make everything stretched 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.119
 right now it seems dry 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.939
 Basically I 'll show you the pictures 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.470
 as if before and after well, there can be seen on the see 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:32.759
 what he actually was working 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:35.220
 made here he is our new old man were his 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:41.869
 then I noticed a little butter it I 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.869
 I knew what she changed his oil well 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.689
 Yes, and the people began to shame even for food 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:54.360
 a couple of days look in general it is still 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.450
 sort of arranges so still wanna say something 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.450
 what 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:07.020
 how would I come in fact ru 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.899
 they are not but different machines have not become 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.650
 we are what I basically refused and 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.300
 wash everyone to offer that grace came 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.820
 the car was washed and the parts are gone and how would I 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.660
 let her go first make sure to her 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:30.900
 the spare part got mur and we will carry on 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:34.490
 quarrel talk so watched it here u 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.850
 I could have been hurt a little because 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:43.880
 flows drops just like with us 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.880
 the first is not spring came on the street damp 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.240
 Here I have how to take it 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:03.360
 give us a hookah for the best 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:05.820
 result, we will check you extremely 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.120
 check and you know cleansing 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.030
 the boomon that will remove the oil and the floor but you 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.480
 you will see smudges all essays but to 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.300
 it was evident weaves flowing well media cruiser 200 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.400
 rubles as a balloon because I did 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.840
 chores and everything else 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.620
 free so here's another thing you forgot 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.290
 tell now we changed the fund oms i 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.870
 already got out from under the car 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:38.880
 what happens when you change the oil like you but i don't 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.450
 I know what it depends on 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.400
 the car began to drive a little bit better and 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:50.520
 old gear when your 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:56.010
 45 you are healthy hot tea reached 70 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:58.170
 it became much quieter to buzz so here I am 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.710
 noticed and in first gear she became 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:05.340
 quieter somehow did not pick the seeds from 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:10.890
 first gear to first second gear 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:13.290
 became an approach very significant so far 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.340
 I satisfied so that the coating will be sick 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.780
 fill a bit probably 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.060
 In short, who wants to change the oil in 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.970
 dori box and thinks changes whether it is not worth 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.090
 worth it and change for good you 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.130
 You understand what he was reading but I will speak 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.840
 about the transfer somehow easily turns me on 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.220
 hard to talk about this car to me 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.590
 New year, how to give it to me so 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.510
 sticking 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:50.070
 great so here someone video was 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:51.650
 useful to all until new meetings like 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.480
 so it creaked 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.610
 as promised photos this old 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.530
 gland here this new it is clear that he 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.740
 new drops this water 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.250
 nauthiz here at my junction box 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.680
 flowed 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:10.560
 and did not stretch it after the service 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.850
 face all dry only than me 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.410
 This cog was in oil 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.160
 a little bit but I understand it when 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:25.180
 poured the oil out of the box yes what is it 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:30.100

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:36.290

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:39.010
