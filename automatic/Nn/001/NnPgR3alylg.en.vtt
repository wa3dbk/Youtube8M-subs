00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.090
 girls hello and this video will be 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.950
 on the theme of design and games as 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.529
 so many girls have already asked me 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.079
 about my eyebrows, I decided to remove this 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.210
 a short video I can not say that 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.610
 she will be very not information okay 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.640
 because virtually no care for 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.590
 no updates but if you're interested 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.480
 stay with me so i must say 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.900
 that eyebrows I never asked 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.240
 i have such thick black since childhood 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.480
 so I actually never tried 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.670
 somewhere a year ago I started a little bit of them 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.800
 tint just know that a lot 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.600
 girls for quite a long time 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.060
 time for eyebrow shaping 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.820
 it would certainly be easier for my someone 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.190
 show but see what we have 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.680
 it will turn out so we need a brush 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.390
 for the eyebrows here is such a beveled brush and I 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.130
 I use just such a little thin 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.590
 brush you can use 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.170
 absolutely any brushes that you 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.020
 the best way to work and so i take 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.350
 brush for took and a little scratching 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.490
 our brow, as you can see , I have eyebrows 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.700
 I am very black so I and them 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.390
 in fact, I don't touch everyday life 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.330
 but they cost a little to correct 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.830
 paint on then when for example you need 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.490
 somewhere in the evening 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.590
 I do not know the club in the restaurant for the wedding 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.900
 some event can be so me 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:54.710
 need 3 colors one black another 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.990
 gray and the last is such a matte 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.600
 brown gray color but in fact 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.520
 on camera he looks lighter than he 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.460
 have you take those shades accordingly 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.890
 that match your loud color 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.080
 many use shades and more to the right 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.170
 based on your natural color 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:18.220
 hair and so very little i take 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:20.520
 dark gray and respectively 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.850
 this one 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.370
 brown gray is a shade of 520 and so 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.790
 how we scored on brush 3 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.470
 In this case, I typed 3 shades 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:41.340
 and as you see, I have here 10 here 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:44.580
 clearance and they need to fill in a little bit 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.580
 I'm starting to apply 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.830
 in this tip 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:00.700
 a little bit to try to fill color 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:03.880
 was somehow evenly spaced because 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.950
 what if you have one there 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.100
 darkens any saddle it will not be very 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.100
 beautiful 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.720
 Well, I'm the Crimea and my eyebrows 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.660
 deal with in this case is not very me 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.750
 I think that you are interested, but if you take 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:29.870
 general concept yes how to make eyebrows 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:34.820
 then we look to start 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:38.060
 eyebrow about where the corner begins 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.460
 inside the inner corner of the eye here 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.430
 there can be here and so there is a line where 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.530
 what stick do not attach and see 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.900
 but it comes to me a little bit because 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.090
 I am the mood of such blood if 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.330
 I will remove a little bit then I will have an eyebrow 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.890
 short but if you take and again 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.560
 general concepts that should be here are here 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.240
 starting eyebrow straight line in order 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.960
 to understand where should end 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.620
 eyebrow 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.800
 we must also take this wand 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:13.330
 attach to the nose stretch through the outer 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:18.500
 corner of the eye and that means about here 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:21.550
 like this you will understand 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.420
 proportions should end eyebrow 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.360
 Here I see you are missing a little 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.930
 there i can also paint on there but 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.350
 again rarely done and 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.510
 corner top most top point 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:41.030
 eyebrows 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:50.760
 must pass through your pupil 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:52.770
 again through the nose that is like this 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.900
 In general, three points must be observed for 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:02.570
 In order to understand the proportion of your brows 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.570
 so let's say right to the role and 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:15.240
 here's how you see here a little bit there 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.100
 its clearance is also desirable to remember 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.460
 for eyebrow looked at 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:25.640
 full I again take these 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.640
 three colors will complement a little more at low tide and 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.350
 I will go 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.900
 neck brow 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:45.270
 very convenient to paint with a beveled brush and 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:49.919
 if we again turn to proportions then 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:53.850
 we take a wand and define we carry 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.680
 through the corner of the outer eye and determine 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.880
 a clip and finish eyebrow 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.039
 my case somewhere a day so i can 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.960
 a little bit 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:08.880
 extend quite a bit it could be 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:17.430
 just some kind of zealand she 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:19.759
 will give the correct clear line 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.770
 your group 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:26.449
 I've painted on this eyebrow and 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.860
 Generally with this eyebrow difference 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.720
 the minimum of course here it looks 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.180
 brighter honor 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.070
 Well, the final touch that probably 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.370
 necessary not too recently 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.040
 started to use 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.100
 This thing is my eyebrow gel 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.300
 eyebrow gel from essense very 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.610
 not bad to fix 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:53.240
 the beauty of our brow so that it 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.790
 stayed in such a state as she 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:59.080
 looks and now we are quite a bit 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:02.650
 opening the cheeks of blood and after that i 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:06.380
 I will walk it with a brush to 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.360
 excess gel to collect also have a second 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.350
 a way for those who for example do not have 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.560
 eyebrow gel 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.720
 but there is hairspray we take varnish for 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.660
 hair is my way m dude with mine 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.240
 image of 2-3 years ago, I 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.630
 photographed for this company and take 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:27.800
 such a brush and spray varnish on 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:30.400
 brush a little bit and comb 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.400
 our girl 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:37.120
 this way the design of our brows 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:38.740
 everything will be fixed on it 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.230
 this is the full video we have with you 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.210

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.370
 I know how useful it was to you 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.380

 girls who made a request for it 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.830
