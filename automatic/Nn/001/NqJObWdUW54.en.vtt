years<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:05.330> Falcon<00:04:05.720> do<00:04:05.810> I've<00:04:05.959> been<00:04:06.170> a<00:04:06.200> big

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
years the Falcon do I've been a big

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.350 
years the Falcon do I've been a big
strong<00:04:06.830> broad-shouldered<00:04:07.430> looking<00:04:08.120> car<00:04:08.330> I

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
strong broad-shouldered looking car I

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.270 
strong broad-shouldered looking car I
expect<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:09.110> continue<00:04:09.260> something<00:04:10.130> that's

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
expect that to continue something that's

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.630 
expect that to continue something that's
quite<00:04:10.880> modern<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:11.569> crisp<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.290> styling<00:04:13.069> but

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
quite modern and crisp and styling but

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.760 
quite modern and crisp and styling but
also<00:04:13.940> I<00:04:14.300> guess<00:04:14.510> conservative<00:04:15.110> enough<00:04:15.260> also<00:04:15.709> to

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
also I guess conservative enough also to

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.970 
also I guess conservative enough also to
to<00:04:16.609> appeal<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:17.180> middle<00:04:18.079> Australia's<00:04:18.590> this<00:04:18.859> is

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
are going into a frenzy trying to get a

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.180 
are going into a frenzy trying to get a
closer<00:04:50.389> look<00:04:50.570> what<00:04:51.470> are<00:04:51.770> their<00:04:51.950> first

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
closer look what are their first

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.850 
closer look what are their first
impressions<00:04:52.630> it's<00:04:53.630> quite<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.870> different<00:04:54.320> look

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
impressions it's quite a different look

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.070 
impressions it's quite a different look
and<00:04:55.070> feel<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.610> across<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.270> range<00:04:56.450> now<00:04:56.780> and

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
and feel to the across the range now and

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.390 
and feel to the across the range now and
that<00:04:57.350> wasn't<00:04:57.500> always<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.860> case<00:04:58.010> with<00:04:58.340> belt

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
that wasn't always the case with belt

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.800 
that wasn't always the case with belt
and<00:04:58.700> so<00:04:58.850> I<00:04:58.880> think<00:04:59.090> that's<00:04:59.240> going<00:04:59.389> to<00:04:59.450> be<00:04:59.600> a<00:04:59.630> good

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
and so I think that's going to be a good

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.450 
and so I think that's going to be a good
thing<00:04:59.960> for<00:05:00.020> them<00:05:00.290> as<00:05:00.440> well<00:05:00.470> this<00:05:01.070> one's<00:05:01.280> a
