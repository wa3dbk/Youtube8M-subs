your barrel of wine today we're going to

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.040 
your barrel of wine today we're going to
be<00:00:07.710> doing<00:00:08.040> what's<00:00:08.309> called<00:00:08.490> racking<00:00:09.050> basically

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
be doing what's called racking basically

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.470 
be doing what's called racking basically
through<00:00:10.620> fermentation<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:12.030> grape<00:00:12.240> skins

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
through fermentation the grape skins

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.560 
through fermentation the grape skins
break<00:00:12.780> down<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.230> leave<00:00:13.349> behind<00:00:14.059> sediment<00:00:15.059> so

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
break down and leave behind sediment so

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
break down and leave behind sediment so
what<00:00:15.719> we're<00:00:15.839> doing<00:00:16.049> today<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.260> we're<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
what we're doing today is we're going to

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.900 
what we're doing today is we're going to
be<00:00:16.710> removing<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.220> sediment<00:00:17.640> out<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
be removing the sediment out of the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.310 
be removing the sediment out of the
barrel<00:00:18.180> we're<00:00:18.300> going<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.480> use<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.840> racking

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
barrel we're going to use this racking

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.500 
barrel we're going to use this racking
lon<00:00:19.529> you'll<00:00:20.490> notice<00:00:20.699> there's<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.000> bolt<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
lon you'll notice there's a bolt on the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.240 
lon you'll notice there's a bolt on the
end<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.779> offsets<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.470> off<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.769> bottom<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
end it offsets it off the bottom of the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.800 
end it offsets it off the bottom of the
barrel<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.150> don't<00:00:24.180> suck<00:00:24.480> up<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
barrel it's just so we don't suck up the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.109 
barrel it's just so we don't suck up the
sediment<00:00:25.340> we<00:00:26.340> want<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.580> leave<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> set<00:00:26.939> up<00:00:27.029> in

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
sediment we want to leave the set up in

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.189 
sediment we want to leave the set up in
the<00:00:27.150> barrel<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.510> we're<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.869> rinse<00:00:28.050> it

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the barrel and we're going to rinse it

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.290 
the barrel and we're going to rinse it
all<00:00:28.320> out<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:29.519> we're<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.820> pump<00:00:30.000> your<00:00:30.119> wine

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300

from here into this stainless tank and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.720 
from here into this stainless tank and
sits<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.309> front<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.610> us<00:00:34.219> you<00:00:35.219> taking<00:00:35.460> about<00:00:35.520> 10

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
sits in front of us you taking about 10

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.310 
sits in front of us you taking about 10
or<00:00:35.820> 15<00:00:35.910> minutes<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.390> pump<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.780> once<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.200> get

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
or 15 minutes to pump it out once we get

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.690 
or 15 minutes to pump it out once we get
it<00:00:37.440> flow<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.860> we'll<00:00:37.950> get<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.129> guys<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> taste

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
it flow and we'll get you guys a taste

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.520 
it flow and we'll get you guys a taste
of<00:00:38.820> your<00:00:38.969> wine<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.960> kind<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> first

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
of your wine this is kind of the first

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.400 
of your wine this is kind of the first
time<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.489> tasted<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.969> at<00:00:42.120> pressing<00:00:42.899> obviously

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
time you tasted it at pressing obviously

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.709 
time you tasted it at pressing obviously
but<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.340> coming<00:00:44.700> right<00:00:44.850> off<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.149> skin<00:00:45.420> so

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
but it's coming right off the skin so

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.410 
but it's coming right off the skin so
three<00:00:46.440> months<00:00:46.590> later<00:00:46.789> you<00:00:47.789> should<00:00:47.820> see<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> nice

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
three months later you should see a nice

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.940 
three months later you should see a nice
change

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
change

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.720 
change
so<00:00:50.600> once<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.860> flip<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> barrel<00:00:53.250> upside<00:00:53.520> down

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
so once we flip the barrel upside down

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.680 
so once we flip the barrel upside down
we're<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.090> wash<00:00:54.240> it<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.540> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
we're going to wash it out with the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.600 
we're going to wash it out with the
barrel<00:00:54.990> of<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.080> day<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:56.130> we're<00:00:56.220> going<00:00:56.310> to<00:00:56.370> pump

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
barrel of a day then we're going to pump

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.850 
barrel of a day then we're going to pump
the<00:00:56.700> wine<00:00:56.850> right<00:00:57.060> back<00:00:57.240> into<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> barrel<00:00:58.110> at

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
the wine right back into the barrel at

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.500 
the wine right back into the barrel at
that<00:00:58.980> point<00:00:59.220> we've<00:00:59.430> removed<00:00:59.700> removed<00:01:00.360> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that point we've removed removed a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.300 
that point we've removed removed a
little<00:01:00.750> bit<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.960> volume<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.130> we're<00:01:02.220> going

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
little bit of volume so what we're going

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.740 
little bit of volume so what we're going
to<00:01:02.430> use<00:01:02.610> is<00:01:02.820> we're<00:01:02.910> going<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> use<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.360> top<00:01:03.540> off

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
to use is we're going to use the top off

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.350 
to use is we're going to use the top off
wine<00:01:03.990> that<00:01:04.800> we<00:01:05.010> collected<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.520> pressing<00:01:05.940> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
wine that we collected it pressing and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.490 
wine that we collected it pressing and
we're<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.660> to<00:01:06.720> top<00:01:06.870> off<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> barrel

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
we're going to top off the barrel

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.960 
we're going to top off the barrel
because<00:01:07.620> at<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:07.979> point<00:01:08.070> air<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> enemy

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
because at this point air is the enemy

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.969 
because at this point air is the enemy
so<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.870> keep<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.470> air<00:01:10.590> out<00:01:10.620> of<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
so to keep all of the air out of the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.330 
so to keep all of the air out of the
barrel<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.770> you're<00:01:13.770> also<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.190> see<00:01:14.310> us

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
barrel so you're also going to see us

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.560 
barrel so you're also going to see us
put<00:01:14.550> a<00:01:14.580> tablespoon<00:01:14.910> of<00:01:15.060> potassium

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
put a tablespoon of potassium

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.930 
put a tablespoon of potassium
metabisulfite<00:01:15.660> into<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:16.620> wine<00:01:16.940> basically

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
metabisulfite into your wine basically

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.730 
metabisulfite into your wine basically
what<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.120> does<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.660> prevents<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.620> from

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
what that does is it prevents it from

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.010 
what that does is it prevents it from
oxidizing<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:21.150> since<00:01:21.390> we're<00:01:21.540> aerating<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
oxidizing and since we're aerating the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
oxidizing and since we're aerating the
wiring<00:01:22.320> through<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.710> step<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.850> need<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> put

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
wiring through this step we need to put

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.340 
wiring through this step we need to put
that<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.540> desoto<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> line<00:01:25.170> doesn't

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that in there desoto the line doesn't

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.440 
that in there desoto the line doesn't
oxidize<00:01:25.590> too<00:01:26.009> much<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> only

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
oxidize too much so this is the only

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.820 
oxidize too much so this is the only
time<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.869> put<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.259> throughout<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> whole

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
time we put it in throughout the whole

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.560 
time we put it in throughout the whole
