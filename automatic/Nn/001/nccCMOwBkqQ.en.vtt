all<00:02:26.770> microsoft<00:02:27.430> needs<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.820> do<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.090> hook<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.420> up

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
all microsoft needs to do is hook it up

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.390 
all microsoft needs to do is hook it up
to<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:29.580> one<00:02:30.580> guide<00:02:32.010> let<00:02:33.010> me<00:02:33.100> actually<00:02:33.220> show

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
to the one guide let me actually show

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.180 
to the one guide let me actually show
that<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.690> pauses<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:37.650> which<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.800> something<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
that it pauses to which is something the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.120 
that it pauses to which is something the
ex<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.700> PlayStation<00:02:40.510> 3<00:02:40.750> did<00:02:40.960> not<00:02:40.990> do<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.560> don't

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
ex the PlayStation 3 did not do I don't

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.930 
ex the PlayStation 3 did not do I don't
think<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:44.230> we're<00:02:44.350> gonna<00:02:44.440> go<00:02:44.620> back<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.940> I'm

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
think so we're gonna go back and I'm

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.850 
think so we're gonna go back and I'm
going<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.150> press<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.480> pause<00:02:49.690> button<00:02:50.020> stay

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
going to press the pause button stay

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.580 
going to press the pause button stay
pauses<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.959> think<00:02:52.959> I'm<00:02:53.050> guessing<00:02:53.440> it's

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
pauses I think I'm guessing it's

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.100 
pauses I think I'm guessing it's
buffering<00:02:53.920> automatically<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.930> don't<00:02:55.930> know<00:02:55.989> how

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
buffering automatically I don't know how

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.630 
buffering automatically I don't know how
long<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.440> will<00:02:56.470> last<00:02:56.560> but<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.190> know<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.580> is

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
long it will last but you know this is

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.800 
long it will last but you know this is
good<00:02:57.850> enough<00:02:57.940> for<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.239> bathroom<00:02:58.570> break<00:02:58.600> and

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
good enough for a bathroom break and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:10.729 
good enough for a bathroom break and
then<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.200> play<00:03:03.239> pause<00:03:04.239> again<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:07.420> then<00:03:07.540> play

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.100 

that's<00:03:11.739> pretty<00:03:11.980> much<00:03:12.040> it
