00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
slightly painful past reloads we got

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.890 
slightly painful past reloads we got
steady<00:01:31.590> aim<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:32.040> those<00:01:32.670> panic<00:01:33.090> no<00:01:33.299> scopes<00:01:33.659> in

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
steady aim for those panic no scopes in

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.760 
steady aim for those panic no scopes in
case<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.170> ever<00:01:34.229> get<00:01:34.409> into<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.590> bad<00:01:34.740> situation

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
case you ever get into a bad situation

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.770 
case you ever get into a bad situation
you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.759> try<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> hipfire<00:01:36.509> your

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you can just try and you hipfire your

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
you can just try and you hipfire your
sniper<00:01:37.020> rifle<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> guy<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.890> maybe<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.549> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
sniper rifle of the guy and maybe have a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.950 
sniper rifle of the guy and maybe have a
little<00:01:38.670> bit<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:38.970> accuracy<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.630> were<00:01:39.720> going

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
little bit more accuracy we were going

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.340 
little bit more accuracy we were going
at<00:01:40.110> it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
at it

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.020 
at it
we<00:01:40.500> got<00:01:40.680> quick-draw<00:01:41.100> which<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.460> course<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.850> for

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
we got quick-draw which of course is for

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.580 
we got quick-draw which of course is for
a<00:01:42.060> quick<00:01:42.240> scoping<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.840> helps<00:01:43.020> out<00:01:43.140> snipers<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
a quick scoping it helps out snipers a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.929 
a quick scoping it helps out snipers a
lot<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.220> about<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:44.490> snipers<00:01:44.909> use

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
lot I think just about all snipers use

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.219 
lot I think just about all snipers use
quick-draw<00:01:45.479> regardless<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.140> your

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
quick-draw regardless of your

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.840 
quick-draw regardless of your
quickscoper<00:01:46.829> or<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.310> helps<00:01:47.729> out

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
quickscoper or not it just helps out

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.639 
quickscoper or not it just helps out
with<00:01:48.030> snipers<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.450> general<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.200> we've<00:01:49.470> got

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
with snipers in general and we've got

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.950 
with snipers in general and we've got
focus<00:01:49.950> which<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.579> borderline<00:01:50.970> overpowered<00:01:51.810> on

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
focus which is borderline overpowered on

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.569 
focus which is borderline overpowered on
sniper<00:01:52.259> rifles<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.890> mean<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.130> remember<00:01:53.220> back<00:01:53.549> in
