00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
order and for a change I thought we

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.419 
order and for a change I thought we
would<00:00:05.490> just<00:00:05.520> do<00:00:05.850> some<00:00:06.740> video<00:00:07.740> on<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.189> roads

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429

and we're going to just play some notes
from<00:00:15.719> all<00:00:15.870> three<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:16.470> we<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.770> compare<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
from all three so we can compare the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.460 
from all three so we can compare the
various<00:00:18.300> sounds<00:00:18.720> from<00:00:19.050> these<00:00:19.199> fine

condition<00:00:42.079> exquisite<00:00:43.079> museum<00:00:44.070> quality<00:00:45.050> as

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
condition exquisite museum quality as

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.330

with<00:00:46.350> most<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> instruments<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.460> have

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it's the black roads p.m. so we'll just

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.479 
it's the black roads p.m. so we'll just

2d<00:01:25.580> 1960<00:01:28.700> piano<00:01:29.700> bass<00:01:29.939> down<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:38.750> now<00:01:39.750> as

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
2d 1960 piano bass down here now as

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080 
2d 1960 piano bass down here now as
regards<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.430> at<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> end<00:01:41.820> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
regards to this one here at the end I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.139 
regards to this one here at the end I
think<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.840> probably<00:01:42.869> would<00:01:43.439> benefit<00:01:43.890> from

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
think it probably would benefit from

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.010 
think it probably would benefit from
using<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.420> preamp<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.590> amplify<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> signal<00:01:48.020> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
using a preamp to amplify the signal the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.719 
using a preamp to amplify the signal the
reason<00:01:49.350> being<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.920> such<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> very<00:01:50.460> old

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
reason being it's just such a very old

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.830 
reason being it's just such a very old
instrument<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.659> beautiful

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
instrument but it's in beautiful

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.670 
instrument but it's in beautiful
condition<00:01:53.509> as<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:57.229> we<00:01:58.229> cover<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
condition as you can see we cover the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.950 
condition as you can see we cover the
inside<00:01:59.070> no<00:01:59.250> expense<00:01:59.670> was<00:01:59.850> spared<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.570> put<00:02:00.750> some

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
inside no expense was spared to put some

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.609 
inside no expense was spared to put some
velvet<00:02:01.380> inside<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.579> lid<00:02:03.229> whereas<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.380> older

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
velvet inside the lid whereas the older

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.359 
velvet inside the lid whereas the older

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
ones of course only have the tall x but

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.550 
ones of course only have the tall x but
this<00:02:08.520> one's<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.849> fantastic<00:02:09.509> condition<00:02:10.080> as

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
this one's in fantastic condition as

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.750

well
it's<00:02:12.299> cleaned<00:02:12.599> up<00:02:12.750> really<00:02:13.019> well<00:02:14.780> just<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.840> few

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
it's cleaned up really well just a few

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.100 
it's cleaned up really well just a few
cracks<00:02:16.349> there<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.860> keys<00:02:17.099> very<00:02:17.760> minor<00:02:18.110> but

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
cracks there on the keys very minor but

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.460 
cracks there on the keys very minor but
not<00:02:19.260> surprising<00:02:19.920> because<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.310> its<00:02:20.430> age

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
not surprising because of its age

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.819 
not surprising because of its age
nineteen<00:02:22.470> sixty<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:26.819> sounding<00:02:27.239> too<00:02:27.450> bad

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
nineteen sixty and not sounding too bad

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:53.349

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.309 

let's<00:02:54.359> try<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:54.659> out<00:02:54.750> now<00:02:54.959> on<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.200> silver<00:02:55.560> one

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
let's try it out now on the silver one

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.039 
let's try it out now on the silver one
but<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.650> fresh<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.099> your<00:02:59.129> heads<00:03:03.049> what

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
it's a different sound that's kind of

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.210 
it's a different sound that's kind of
more<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.400> Dorothy<00:03:09.920> sound<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.099> we're

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
more like the Dorothy sound that we're

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:22.300 
more like the Dorothy sound that we're
all<00:03:11.340> used<00:03:11.609> to
