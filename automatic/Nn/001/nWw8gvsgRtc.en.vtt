00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.210 
that's a skid mark
I<00:01:57.159> think<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:57.940> yeah<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:59.260> think<00:01:59.350> what<00:01:59.770> he's<00:01:59.890> got

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
I think so yeah I think what he's got

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.830 
I think so yeah I think what he's got
he's<00:02:00.550> very<00:02:00.790> ill<00:02:01.150> of<00:02:01.300> a<00:02:01.330> lover<00:02:01.630> he<00:02:02.700> died<00:02:03.700> in<00:02:04.450> June

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
he's very ill of a lover he died in June

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.440 
he's very ill of a lover he died in June
so<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.650> gear<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.160> not<00:02:06.400> to<00:02:06.580> lose<00:02:07.150> this

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
so the gear is not to lose this

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.540 
so the gear is not to lose this
confusing<00:02:08.140> yeah<00:02:08.320> yeah<00:02:08.920> it's<00:02:09.190> like<00:02:09.340> when

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
confusing yeah yeah it's like when

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.490 
confusing yeah yeah it's like when
Superman<00:02:09.910> voiced<00:02:10.330> underwear<00:02:10.810> outside<00:02:11.080> his

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
Superman voiced underwear outside his

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.030 
Superman voiced underwear outside his
joint

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
joint

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.920 
joint
yeah<00:02:12.640> he's<00:02:12.820> trying<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.180> be<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.300> Superman<00:02:13.750> by

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
yeah he's trying to be a Superman by

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.050 
yeah he's trying to be a Superman by
wearing<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.290> ear<00:02:14.530> inside<00:02:14.950> his<00:02:15.190> shields<00:02:15.640> yeah

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
wearing this ear inside his shields yeah

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.510 
wearing this ear inside his shields yeah
so<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.480> think<00:02:16.660> we<00:02:17.380> should<00:02:17.590> shoot<00:02:17.830> him<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.310> see

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
so I think we should shoot him and see

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.280 
so I think we should shoot him and see
if<00:02:18.550> he's<00:02:18.820> bulletproof<00:02:19.150> II<00:02:19.480> it's<00:02:19.600> not<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.260> I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
if he's bulletproof II it's not that I

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.810 
if he's bulletproof II it's not that I
think<00:02:20.590> we<00:02:20.680> saved<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.040> world<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.400> whole<00:02:21.550> lot<00:02:21.730> of
