00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
flying f-18s every day since I was 24

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.370 
flying f-18s every day since I was 24
years<00:00:28.349> old<00:00:29.539> fun<00:00:30.539> airplane<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.960> fly<00:00:31.019> cuz<00:00:31.320> you

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
years old fun airplane to fly cuz you

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.750 
years old fun airplane to fly cuz you
don't<00:00:31.499> think<00:00:31.650> about<00:00:31.739> flying<00:00:32.100> it<00:00:32.310> you<00:00:32.640> can

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
don't think about flying it you can

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.010 
don't think about flying it you can
think<00:00:32.820> about<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.150> mission<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.690> airplane<00:00:33.930> is

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
think about the mission the airplane is

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.320 
think about the mission the airplane is
easy<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.500> fly<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.070> then<00:00:35.580> the<00:00:35.670> mission<00:00:35.940> system

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
easy to fly and then the mission system

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.080 
easy to fly and then the mission system
is<00:00:36.450> very<00:00:36.690> human<00:00:37.170> factors<00:00:37.530> friendly<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
is very human factors friendly so you

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.880 
is very human factors friendly so you
can<00:00:39.510> put<00:00:39.720> almost<00:00:40.200> all<00:00:40.380> of<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.590> intellectual

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
can put almost all of your intellectual

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.340 
can put almost all of your intellectual
energy<00:00:41.160> into<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> missions<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:43.110> why<00:00:43.320> I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
energy into the missions in that's why I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.520 
energy into the missions in that's why I
like<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.710> earn<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.750> think<00:00:45.750> from<00:00:45.990> a<00:00:46.080> naval

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
like to earn it I think from a naval

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.250 
like to earn it I think from a naval
perspective<00:00:47.250> us<00:00:48.150> being<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.630> utility

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
perspective us being the utility

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
perspective us being the utility
outfielders<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.340> fits<00:00:50.820> perfectly<00:00:51.330> when<00:00:51.690> we

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
outfielders it fits perfectly when we

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.870 
outfielders it fits perfectly when we
show<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.560> an<00:00:52.620> aircraft<00:00:52.950> carrier<00:00:53.130> you<00:00:53.850> got

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
show up with an aircraft carrier you got

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.970 
show up with an aircraft carrier you got
to<00:00:54.150> come<00:00:54.330> as<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.600> are<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.080> since<00:00:55.830> we<00:00:55.950> have

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
to come as you are and since we have

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.580 
to come as you are and since we have
limited<00:00:56.310> flight<00:00:56.910> deck<00:00:57.120> space<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:58.080> had<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> pick

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
limited flight deck space we had to pick

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.260 
limited flight deck space we had to pick
a<00:00:58.620> jack-of-all-trades<00:00:59.070> airplane<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
a jack-of-all-trades airplane the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.690 
a jack-of-all-trades airplane the
fundamental<00:01:00.630> design<00:01:00.990> of<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.380> f-18<00:01:01.860> is<00:01:02.100> very

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
fundamental design of the f-18 is very

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.539 
fundamental design of the f-18 is very
versatile<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:04.109> does<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.619> swing<00:01:04.890> mission<00:01:05.309> very

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
versatile it does the swing mission very

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.749 
versatile it does the swing mission very
well<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.420> also<00:01:06.630> has<00:01:07.380> an<00:01:07.770> architecture<00:01:08.429> that<00:01:08.460> is

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
well it also has an architecture that is

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.149 
well it also has an architecture that is
very<00:01:09.240> conducive<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.200> expansion<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
very conducive to expansion and

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.080 
very conducive to expansion and
modification<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.749> have<00:01:12.869> taken<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:14.090> lot

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.570 
like everything we do in the Navy when
when<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.060> system<00:02:02.360> gives<00:02:02.960> us<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.320> tool<00:02:03.590> we<00:02:04.340> take

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
when the system gives us a tool we take

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.180 
when the system gives us a tool we take
hold<00:02:04.850> of<00:02:04.940> it<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:05.420> make<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.930> work<00:02:06.110> we<00:02:07.070> were

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
hold of it and we make it work we were

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.010 
hold of it and we make it work we were
blessed<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.670> have<00:02:07.760> a<00:02:07.940> very<00:02:08.270> flexible<00:02:08.840> and

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
blessed to have a very flexible and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.470 
blessed to have a very flexible and
capable<00:02:09.590> long-lasting<00:02:10.100> tool<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.820> I<00:02:11.240> think

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
capable long-lasting tool and I think

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.090 
capable long-lasting tool and I think
when<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.720> take<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.080> innovation<00:02:12.710> of<00:02:12.800> naval

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
when you take the innovation of naval

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.640 
when you take the innovation of naval
aviation<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.300> supply<00:02:14.960> it<00:02:15.020> with<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.320> good

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
aviation and you supply it with a good

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.980 
aviation and you supply it with a good
flexible<00:02:16.190> tool<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:17.060> get<00:02:17.330> this<00:02:17.570> kind<00:02:17.840> of

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
flexible tool you get this kind of

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.170 
flexible tool you get this kind of
outcome<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.950> might<00:02:19.160> consider<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.910> jack<00:02:20.150> of

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
outcome you might consider it a jack of

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.150 
outcome you might consider it a jack of
all<00:02:20.390> trades<00:02:20.750> master<00:02:20.840> of<00:02:21.200> none<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.680> would<00:02:21.980> argue

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
all trades master of none I would argue

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.220 
all trades master of none I would argue
that<00:02:22.820> most<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.420> missions<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.020> world

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
that most of the missions in the world

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.930 
that most of the missions in the world
are<00:02:24.500> jack-of-all-trades<00:02:24.980> missions<00:02:25.730> and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
are jack-of-all-trades missions and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.120 
are jack-of-all-trades missions and
that's<00:02:26.690> why<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.900> Hornets<00:02:27.320> just<00:02:27.590> rocks<00:02:27.830> it

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
that's why the Hornets just rocks it

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.550 
that's why the Hornets just rocks it
really<00:02:28.370> does
