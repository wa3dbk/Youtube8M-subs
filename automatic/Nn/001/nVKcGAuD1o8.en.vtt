00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:07.859
 so the record went hello dear 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.259
 my channel subscribers in general today 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.690
 I decided to shoot video material as 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.700
 do it yourself can say 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.970
 stove car 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.070
 car gazelle everything 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.910
 I picked it up so I don’t know months probably 2 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.439
 whichever i had 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.900
 Job 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.359
 I thought everything over but I don’t know everything until 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.650
 I think of the end today we will 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.870
 experiment watch it all 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.629
 will turn off like where it all will be 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.280
 I will be put with might and main on visually 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 tell show because in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.739
 On the Internet, I myself was looking for material such 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.350
 how to make a stove in a gazelle let's say 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.079
 booth additionally to here at least 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.859
 what is the plus but the temperature is sicker 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.410
 was normal 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:58.440
 but nowhere this material I could not 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.949
 find even have such a club site 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.559
 gazelists in my here and there, too, I like 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.570
 would not be able to find this materialchik well 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.430
 I decided to confuse the whole thing 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.790
 shoot do not know what happens to me 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.770
 general, see for yourself and so we start with 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.230
 the fact that I cooked all sorts of 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.720
 before you see yourself now all that I am 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.880
 prepared from this in principle we will 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.100
 start now i will tell about 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.360
 about 4000 the whole price of this comes out 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.280
 the stove itself radiator itself 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.800
 together with a motor I go there for 1000 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.890
 rubles but there on the cheap from friends 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.570
 its here all the rest I'm natural 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.990
 bought the store well 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.710
 I had a total cost of about 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:50.870
 about 4000 probably although you can stove 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.550
 let's make the booth Arab plan 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.980
 15000 it costs but if you yourself 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.500
 do it naturally free come out 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.160
 that is, the stove itself 15,000 is still a plus work 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.860
 but free or give to the master who 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.480
 can turn off the plan of the Russian stove but 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.580
 I don't like the fact that she is on 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.430
 diesel works that is, it needs more 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.530
 cares court diesel fuel constantly 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:20.280
 that 's what my idea is good about 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.480
 more precisely maybe not my idea but in general 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.799
 what i will do 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.120
 you yourself will see what this idea is good about 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:34.129
 that it works and antifreeze 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:39.510
 all drove so look what to have 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:44.030
 hose diameter in my 18 if i don't 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.919
 mistaken u up to diameter 18 next 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.709
 extra pump in my 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:52.019
 I do not even know Russian production 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.689
 he called me and even as it 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.760
 nothing came with it that is 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.180
 just 1 com pack to complete the mixer 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.719
 Further and here such that a fungus of the unit 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.120
 Brega itself is such a radiator he 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.120
 I got about a thousand rubles 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.949
 here to this hose 18 i have here 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.440
 such insulation to under the car 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:22.470
 the antifreeze didn't freeze quickly naturally 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.389
 we need need a wire why 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.220
 red because it will be a plus 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:30.199
 wire well, of course we need a lot 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.879
 will throw further double button well 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:36.840
 why double because most likely 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.530
 I have triple motors 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.750
 contacts 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.970
 that is, it will most likely overclock there 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.189
 there will be three speeds probably or 2 exactly 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.159
 I do not know never used it here 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.840
 In general, I will connect electrical 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.780
 because I can't do it 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.199
 Immediately I say well, everything else is 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.189
 Basically, I will do 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:02.419
 install this stove and so on 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.419
 need bolts 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.819
 Naturally here such a cage is needed 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.510
 then to fix this whole thing 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:17.410
 clamps a bunch of need and basically everything is now 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.280
 we will set the whole thing here 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:26.050
 at about the booth at this level up 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.490
 to the ceiling about the middle as 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.520
 opportunities i will include 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.919
 video camera and will do it all 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:38.110
 I will write down the discouragement 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:42.400
 and so on so in general this is what we have 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:46.960
 It turns out at the moment the principle 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:51.550
 a huge amount of work has been done here 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.930
 fixed it turns out here we have so far 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.960
 I have one pipe 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.750
 I turned naturally, I will shove him in Perm 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:04.410
 insulation in the shell so as not to 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:07.720
 cool antifreeze here we get 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.060
 the entrance that is here will be filled with owls 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.760
 it will naturally pass from here 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.789
 cold and here will be further still 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.500
 last hang around today I am the workload 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.349
 exhausted 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.900
 it's cold outside so I froze 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.800
 went home from tomorrow I think 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.800
 will continue
