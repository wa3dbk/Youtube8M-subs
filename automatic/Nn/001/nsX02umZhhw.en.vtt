the athletes loved about it though is

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.380 
the athletes loved about it though is
even<00:00:45.859> though<00:00:46.219> it's<00:00:46.399> an<00:00:46.489> injection<00:00:47.059> molded

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
optics it is one of those that when you

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.299 
optics it is one of those that when you
crash<00:00:51.800> it's<00:00:52.070> not<00:00:52.219> if<00:00:52.429> when<00:00:53.269> those<00:00:53.449> has<00:00:54.309> they're

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
crash it's not if when those has they're

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.220 
crash it's not if when those has they're
gonna<00:00:55.519> crash<00:00:55.730> no<00:00:56.149> doubt<00:00:56.359> about<00:00:56.480> it<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.989> thing

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
gonna crash no doubt about it the thing

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.990 
gonna crash no doubt about it the thing
actually<00:00:57.469> bounce<00:00:57.800> backs<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:58.370> is<00:00:58.460> super<00:00:58.820> tough

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
actually bounce backs and is super tough

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.520 
actually bounce backs and is super tough
which<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.329> typically<00:00:59.870> don't<00:01:00.019> see<00:01:00.320> this<00:01:00.469> kind

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
which you typically don't see this kind

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.040 
which you typically don't see this kind
of<00:01:00.769> deformation<00:01:01.070> yeah<00:01:01.699> an<00:01:02.390> injection<00:01:02.929> while

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
of deformation yeah an injection while

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.509 
of deformation yeah an injection while
the<00:01:03.140> lens<00:01:03.320> they<00:01:03.469> typically<00:01:03.890> would<00:01:03.980> crack<00:01:04.250> pop

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
the lens they typically would crack pop

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.120 
the lens they typically would crack pop
at<00:01:04.730> least<00:01:05.090> decide<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.290> CEO<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:06.710> then<00:01:07.040> you

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
at least decide and the CEO and then you

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.950 
at least decide and the CEO and then you
get<00:01:07.250> phi<00:01:07.490> e<00:01:07.550> yeah<00:01:08.090> we<00:01:08.270> good<00:01:08.570> luck<00:01:08.720> trying<00:01:08.840> to

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
get phi e yeah we good luck trying to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.480 
get phi e yeah we good luck trying to
get<00:01:09.050> it<00:01:09.170> back<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.470> shape<00:01:09.800> it's<00:01:09.980> storming<00:01:10.370> out

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
get it back in shape it's storming out

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.550 
get it back in shape it's storming out
so<00:01:11.120> they<00:01:11.300> love<00:01:11.480> the<00:01:11.600> durability<00:01:11.930> love<00:01:12.410> the

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
so they love the durability love the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.410 
so they love the durability love the
optics<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.670> other<00:01:13.790> thing<00:01:13.970> Gio<00:01:14.180> has<00:01:14.270> done<00:01:14.390> a

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
optics the other thing Gio has done a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.270 
optics the other thing Gio has done a
great<00:01:14.600> job<00:01:14.720> with<00:01:15.020> their<00:01:15.470> collaboration<00:01:16.160> with

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
great job with their collaboration with

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.850 
great job with their collaboration with
Carl<00:01:16.520> Zeiss<00:01:16.670> vision<00:01:17.120> is<00:01:17.420> anti<00:01:17.810> fog<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.350> not

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
Carl Zeiss vision is anti fog and not

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.040 
Carl Zeiss vision is anti fog and not
just<00:01:19.100> in<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.280> coating<00:01:19.760> but<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.330> depths<00:01:20.870> the

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
just in the coating but the depths the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.930 
just in the coating but the depths the
contours<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.800> shapes<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.460> know<00:01:22.550> you<00:01:22.610> see<00:01:22.820> the

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
contours the shapes you know you see the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.000 
contours the shapes you know you see the
vent<00:01:23.150> shield<00:01:23.390> on<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.660> top<00:01:23.870> this<00:01:24.500> thing<00:01:24.770> is

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
vent shield on the top this thing is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.160 
vent shield on the top this thing is
amazing<00:01:25.190> how<00:01:25.850> it<00:01:25.970> allows<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.570> flow<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.870> come

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
amazing how it allows the flow to come

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.570 
amazing how it allows the flow to come
through<00:01:27.410> so<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:27.620> don't<00:01:27.710> have<00:01:27.980> that<00:01:28.130> fogged<00:01:28.400> up

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
through so you don't have that fogged up

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.310 
through so you don't have that fogged up
whether<00:01:28.790> you're<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.090> park<00:01:29.360> or<00:01:29.960> up<00:01:30.080> on<00:01:30.200> the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
whether you're in the park or up on the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.050 
whether you're in the park or up on the
mountain<00:01:30.590> this<00:01:30.680> thing<00:01:30.860> is<00:01:30.950> clean<00:01:31.070> nice<00:01:31.550> and<00:01:31.910> it

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
mountain this thing is clean nice and it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.310 
mountain this thing is clean nice and it
