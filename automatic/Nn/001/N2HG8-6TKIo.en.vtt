00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 
fellow said on eBay and I had a look at

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.830 
fellow said on eBay and I had a look at
it<00:00:24.770> and<00:00:24.980> you<00:00:25.700> know<00:00:25.760> he's<00:00:25.970> right<00:00:26.150> so<00:00:27.550> obviously

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
it and you know he's right so obviously

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.979 
it and you know he's right so obviously
it<00:00:29.840> does<00:00:30.140> display<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.590> black<00:00:30.890> screen<00:00:31.280> tell<00:00:31.989> me

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
it does display a black screen tell me

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.959 
it does display a black screen tell me
how<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:33.170> looks<00:00:33.379> a<00:00:33.440> bit<00:00:33.469> wider<00:00:33.829> wonder<00:00:34.789> why<00:00:34.910> is

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
how this looks a bit wider wonder why is

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.340 
how this looks a bit wider wonder why is
that<00:00:35.710> normally<00:00:36.710> was<00:00:36.890> dark<00:00:38.019> maybe<00:00:39.019> because

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
that normally was dark maybe because

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.290 
that normally was dark maybe because
there<00:00:39.589> capacitors<00:00:40.249> are<00:00:40.399> heated<00:00:40.670> up<00:00:40.789> more<00:00:41.030> but

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
there capacitors are heated up more but

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.610 
there capacitors are heated up more but
I<00:00:41.480> don't<00:00:41.929> know<00:00:42.019> I<00:00:42.050> think<00:00:42.140> I<00:00:42.320> might<00:00:42.469> be

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
I don't know I think I might be

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.479 
I don't know I think I might be
something<00:00:42.859> to<00:00:42.920> do<00:00:42.980> with<00:00:43.039> the<00:00:43.160> power<00:00:43.309> supply

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
something to do with the power supply

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.040 
something to do with the power supply
you<00:00:46.489> can<00:00:46.519> hear<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.940> disk<00:00:47.210> spinning<00:00:47.690> I've<00:00:47.929> got

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
you can hear the disk spinning I've got

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.770 
you can hear the disk spinning I've got
a<00:00:48.079> game<00:00:48.289> disk<00:00:49.070> inside<00:00:49.609> and<00:00:49.969> it's<00:00:50.120> stopped

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
a game disk inside and it's stopped

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.930 
a game disk inside and it's stopped
brave<00:00:51.309> assault<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.690> I<00:00:54.309> know<00:00:55.309> I<00:00:55.339> still<00:00:55.640> reckon

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
brave assault and I know I still reckon

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.369 
brave assault and I know I still reckon
it's<00:00:56.059> a<00:00:56.120> power<00:00:56.300> supply<00:00:56.449> issue<00:00:56.839> it's<00:00:57.199> got

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
it's a power supply issue it's got

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.869 
it's a power supply issue it's got
nothing<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:57.679> do<00:00:57.859> with<00:00:57.890> any<00:00:58.219> chips<00:00:58.550> on<00:00:58.789> the

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
nothing to do with any chips on the

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.419 
nothing to do with any chips on the
mainboard<00:00:59.300> it<00:01:00.260> was<00:01:00.409> it<00:01:00.739> was<00:01:00.979> to<00:01:01.129> do<00:01:01.219> it<00:01:01.339> with

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
mainboard it was it was to do it with

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:02.649 
mainboard it was it was to do it with
chips<00:01:01.640> on<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.850> mainboard<00:01:02.210> I'm<00:01:02.420> pretty

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
chips on the mainboard I'm pretty

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.460 
chips on the mainboard I'm pretty
screwed<00:01:02.870> but<00:01:03.970> but<00:01:04.970> power<00:01:05.540> supply<00:01:05.960> I<00:01:05.990> think

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
screwed but but power supply I think

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.850 
screwed but but power supply I think
I've<00:01:06.530> got<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.710> better<00:01:06.890> chance<00:01:07.010> of<00:01:07.490> fixing<00:01:07.700> so

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
I've got a better chance of fixing so

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.140 
I've got a better chance of fixing so

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
inspection and machine looks pretty

00:01:14.240 --> 00:02:12.490
