 he returned to www.servigardes.fr 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.240
 in this video we are going to 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.289
 present a product that we 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.400
 now market from 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.470
 many years for our biker friends 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.510
 upholstery interior decoration 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.789
 outer 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.609
 we offer a faux leather so a 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.140
 high quality vinyl that is presented 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.210
 here in low carbon structured version 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.190
 it is a product of high quality in 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.989
 direct from the sinn so we are the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.570
 official distributors there for the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.660
 france of this product so we have here 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.059
 a whole range in different colors and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.309
 in different texture in the simili 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.020
 leather or simili alcantara we have 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.770
 also on other videos that you 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.489
 could see the adhesive carpets and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.550
 non- adhesive 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.550
 then it exists in gray in red 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.340
 so we tried to go here on 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.470
 this video the best image quality 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.990
 possible it is not easy to give 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.330
 so a really natural color to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.140
 the screen and so we have to settle 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.150
 the device with the most accurate accuracy 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.229
 more reliable possible so you can 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.220
 the white the green here so it's a green 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.310
 dark the material is very flexible and at 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.820
 the very resistant time there is a white 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.170
 cream 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.479
 so it's an off-white so there is 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:46.220
 also the so-called addiction 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.220
 kamel beige version 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.399
 if we can really see the rank of 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.049
 against day here the wood 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.679
 glossy black 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.250
 and matte black is a structure a 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.799
 very little different for the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.829
 black version morning so it's a 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.890
 imitation leather of a thickness of a wine 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.530
 more or less which is so perfectly 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.750
 waterproof for our biker friends only asks 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.489
 very often to know if this product is 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.989
 compatible to achieve those of 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.750
 good bikes in this video you go 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.540
 to be able to check for yourself that those 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.159
 this is perfectly compatible for the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.269
 motorcycle upholstery so you can 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.560
 the employee on the leaf the crate you 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.560
 can the employee will be full of others 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.379
 things we can position them so with 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.790
 a seam or else with our necks 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.919
 that you can find on our 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.659
 shop is also his school 's 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.189
 contact or school years near every 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.049
 metros the setting up and the 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.769
 realization of the different arts 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.109
 different media 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:09.370
 so when a little text then so 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:12.489
 here we can see here that the product so 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.609
 is waterproof and does not allow water 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:19.870
 but we are going after improving a 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:22.239
 little bit the test massaging one goes 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.349
 to say leather or faux leather for my 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.669
 raymond baer show you that there is 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.859
 no penetration of water to 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:34.359
 inside the fabric have validated the 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:37.239
 excess water runoff 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.870
 perfectly on the structure and to 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.459
 the rear 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.459
 everything is perfectly dry 1 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.350
 so here a second test or there we 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.510
 let's go mass is really the leatherette 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.010
 to try to get in the water is 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.130
 may have arrived so has a permeability 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.520
 from lomÃ© you can see this product 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.520
 perfectly 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.930
 you remember the very members 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.319
 flexible setting up 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:20.739
 we can see here so it's in the 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:24.169
 goals 2 mm thick it has a structure 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.130
 which is a little different for the 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.169
 black carbon version 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.900
 and then before structures if a 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.900
 spoon quite standard and you 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.699
 can therefore use for this setting 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:43.479
 place our contact necks where begins 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:46.099
 you will find on www.cnrs.fr 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.110
