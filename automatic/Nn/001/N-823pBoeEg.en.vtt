welcome to another mr. game's official
video<00:00:04.170> in<00:00:04.859> this<00:00:04.979> video<00:00:05.160> we're<00:00:05.400> going<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.580> look

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
video in this video we're going to look

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.840 
video in this video we're going to look
at<00:00:05.850> some<00:00:06.089> minimums<00:00:06.720> for<00:00:06.990> overclocking<00:00:07.850> we're

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
at some minimums for overclocking we're

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.789 
at some minimums for overclocking we're
gonna<00:00:08.969> see<00:00:09.240> if<00:00:09.299> you<00:00:09.959> can<00:00:10.110> actually<00:00:10.260> overclock

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:10.799 
gonna see if you can actually overclock

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.689 
gonna see if you can actually overclock
your<00:00:10.830> cpu<00:00:11.039> and<00:00:13.010> we're<00:00:14.010> also<00:00:14.129> going<00:00:14.369> to<00:00:14.430> look<00:00:14.610> at

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:14.699 
your cpu and we're also going to look at

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.620 
your cpu and we're also going to look at
some<00:00:14.969> more<00:00:15.090> advanced<00:00:15.510> overclocking<00:00:16.020> features

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
some more advanced overclocking features

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.360 
some more advanced overclocking features
all<00:00:18.630> right<00:00:18.780> so<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> first<00:00:19.230> point<00:00:19.950> I<00:00:20.130> want<00:00:20.340> to

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.370 
all right so the first point I want to

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.600 
all right so the first point I want to
make<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:21.690> have<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.960> know<00:00:22.130> how<00:00:23.130> modern<00:00:23.400> your

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
make is you have to know how modern your

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.910 
make is you have to know how modern your
hardware<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.030> if<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.020> Pentium<00:00:25.470> 2<00:00:25.500> or

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
hardware is if you have a Pentium 2 or

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.570 
hardware is if you have a Pentium 2 or
something

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
something

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.430 
something
some<00:00:26.970> sort<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.240> old<00:00:27.510> second-hand<00:00:27.960> office

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
some sort of old second-hand office

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.740 
some sort of old second-hand office
computer<00:00:28.860> it's<00:00:29.820> pretty<00:00:30.180> unlikely<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
computer it's pretty unlikely that

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
computer it's pretty unlikely that
you're<00:00:30.900> going<00:00:30.930> to<00:00:31.050> be<00:00:31.140> able<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.440> overclock

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
you're going to be able to overclock

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.920 
you're going to be able to overclock
because<00:00:32.270> they're<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.360> really<00:00:33.480> designed<00:00:33.840> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
because they're not really designed to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.460 
because they're not really designed to
overclock<00:00:34.260> they're<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.730> old<00:00:36.000> they're<00:00:36.900> so<00:00:37.260> weak

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
overclock they're so old they're so weak

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.510 
overclock they're so old they're so weak
you're<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:37.800> even<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.160> get<00:00:38.220> any

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
you're not even going to get any

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
you're not even going to get any
advantage<00:00:38.850> from<00:00:39.090> overclocking<00:00:39.810> really<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
advantage from overclocking really so

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.090 
advantage from overclocking really so
it's<00:00:42.540> pretty<00:00:42.750> much<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.020> waste<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.410> time<00:00:43.560> to<00:00:43.800> even

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
it's pretty much a waste of time to even

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.010 
it's pretty much a waste of time to even
consider<00:00:44.640> it

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
consider it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.240 
consider it
you're<00:00:46.020> better<00:00:46.200> off<00:00:46.290> if<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.890> budget<00:00:47.040> allows

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you're better off if your budget allows

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.819 
you're better off if your budget allows
us<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:48.030> buy<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> whole<00:00:48.480> whole<00:00:49.380> new<00:00:49.620> system

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
us to just buy a whole whole new system

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.490 
us to just buy a whole whole new system
which<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.970> be<00:00:51.120> bought<00:00:51.239> fairly<00:00:51.809> cheaply<00:00:52.110> these

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
which can be bought fairly cheaply these

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.400 
which can be bought fairly cheaply these
days<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.480> any<00:00:54.630> questions<00:00:55.079> on

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
days so if you have any questions on

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.229 
days so if you have any questions on
your<00:00:55.710> hardware<00:00:56.130> if<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.760> you're<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.059> sure<00:00:57.210> if

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
your hardware if if you're not sure if

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
your hardware if if you're not sure if
you<00:00:57.420> can<00:00:57.600> actually<00:00:57.780> overclock<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:59.129> just

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
you can actually overclock just just

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.959 
you can actually overclock just just

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
alright so if you are ready to overclock

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.149 
alright so if you are ready to overclock
you<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.429> make<00:01:08.579> sure<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.920> your<00:01:10.920> mother

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you have to make sure that your mother

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.340 
you have to make sure that your mother
board<00:01:11.399> actually<00:01:11.729> has<00:01:12.030> overclocking<00:01:12.780> features

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
board actually has overclocking features

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.429 
board actually has overclocking features
on<00:01:13.469> it<00:01:14.299> not<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.569> them<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.899> a<00:01:16.109> lot<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.319> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
on it not all of them do a lot of the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.160 
on it not all of them do a lot of the
cheaper<00:01:16.619> ones<00:01:16.889> don't<00:01:17.689> you're<00:01:18.689> probably<00:01:18.869> going

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
cheaper ones don't you're probably going

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.389 
cheaper ones don't you're probably going
to<00:01:19.229> want<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.439> check<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.740> before<00:01:19.889> you<00:01:20.100> go<00:01:20.279> out

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
to want to check this before you go out

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:21.830 
to want to check this before you go out
and<00:01:20.549> buy<00:01:20.639> any<00:01:20.819> extra<00:01:20.850> hardware<00:01:21.329> for

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and buy any extra hardware for

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.359 
and buy any extra hardware for
overclocking<00:01:22.350> because<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.130> could<00:01:23.279> be

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
overclocking because you could be

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.849 
overclocking because you could be
disappointed<00:01:25.639> also<00:01:26.639> a<00:01:27.139> CPU<00:01:28.139> cooler<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.649> a<00:01:28.679> good

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
disappointed also a CPU cooler is a good

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.059 
disappointed also a CPU cooler is a good
idea<00:01:29.359> you<00:01:30.359> don't<00:01:30.479> need<00:01:30.779> to<00:01:31.409> necessarily

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
idea you don't need to necessarily

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.699 
idea you don't need to necessarily
replace<00:01:32.819> your<00:01:33.209> old<00:01:33.329> CPU<00:01:33.929> cooler<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.499> it's<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
replace your old CPU cooler but it's a

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:37.069 
replace your old CPU cooler but it's a
good<00:01:34.859> idea<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.999> your<00:01:36.179> standard<00:01:36.389> typical

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
good idea like your standard typical

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.679 
good idea like your standard typical
it's<00:01:37.399> it's<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.490> good<00:01:38.609> idea<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> actually<00:01:39.209> get<00:01:39.569> an

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it's it's a good idea to actually get an

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.019 
it's it's a good idea to actually get an
aftermarket<00:01:40.079> one<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:41.159> they<00:01:41.399> they<00:01:41.849> are<00:01:41.999> a

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:42.029 
aftermarket one because they they are a

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:44.469 
aftermarket one because they they are a
lot<00:01:42.240> better<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.829> if<00:01:43.829> you're<00:01:44.039> worried<00:01:44.279> about

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
lot better and if you're worried about

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.080 
lot better and if you're worried about
over<00:01:45.479> overheating<00:01:46.109> your<00:01:46.139> hardware<00:01:47.060> they're<00:01:48.060> a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
over overheating your hardware they're a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.120 
over overheating your hardware they're a
good<00:01:48.389> idea<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.419> also<00:01:51.889> make<00:01:52.889> sure

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
good idea to have you can also make sure

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.819 
good idea to have you can also make sure
that<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.429> have<00:01:53.639> case<00:01:54.179> fans<00:01:54.450> at<00:01:54.929> least<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.469> for

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that you have case fans at least one for

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.449 
that you have case fans at least one for
a<00:01:55.859> mild<00:01:56.130> overclock<00:01:57.829> that'll<00:01:58.829> sort<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
a mild overclock that'll sort of

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.190 
a mild overclock that'll sort of
ventilate<00:01:59.819> all<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.029> heat<00:02:00.179> that's<00:02:00.419> inside<00:02:00.779> the

ventilate all the heat that's inside the
case<00:02:01.849> outside<00:02:03.409> obviously

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759

now<00:02:06.759> one<00:02:06.880> thing<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.150> want<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.860> let<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.920> know

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
now one thing I want to let you know

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.430 
now one thing I want to let you know
about<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:09.550> some<00:02:09.789> some<00:02:10.539> boards<00:02:10.929> do<00:02:11.890> overclock

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
about is some some boards do overclock

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.949 
about is some some boards do overclock
but<00:02:14.440> they<00:02:14.650> sort<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.130> limit<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.910> overclock<00:02:16.330> for

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
but they sort of limit the overclock for

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.130 
but they sort of limit the overclock for
example<00:02:17.380> an<00:02:17.800> older<00:02:18.640> motherboard<00:02:19.510> with<00:02:20.020> in

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
example an older motherboard with in

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.520 
example an older motherboard with in
newer<00:02:20.290> CPU<00:02:20.850> might<00:02:21.850> not<00:02:22.090> be<00:02:22.720> able<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.110> get<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
newer CPU might not be able to get the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.050 
newer CPU might not be able to get the
best<00:02:23.709> results<00:02:24.190> out<00:02:24.400> of<00:02:25.000> an<00:02:25.180> overclock<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.700> you

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
best results out of an overclock so you

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.400 
best results out of an overclock so you
might<00:02:28.239> have<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.540> raise<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.840> voltage<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.290> bit

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
might have to raise the voltage a bit

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.040 
might have to raise the voltage a bit
higher<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.920> might<00:02:30.850> have<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.600> settle<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:31.930> a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
higher you might have to settle with a

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.130 
higher you might have to settle with a
lower<00:02:32.319> frequency<00:02:33.780> all<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:35.050> sort<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.319> stuff

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
lower frequency all that sort of stuff

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.650 
lower frequency all that sort of stuff
so<00:02:38.140> once<00:02:38.290> again<00:02:38.410> for<00:02:38.739> those<00:02:38.890> people<00:02:39.310> who<00:02:39.660> don't

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
so once again for those people who don't

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.270 
so once again for those people who don't
have<00:02:40.780> any<00:02:40.989> money<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.380> go<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.530> buy<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.830> and

off for 50 bucks a pretty good one you
know<00:03:30.220> if<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.880> chuck<00:03:31.090> in<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.269> little<00:03:31.480> bit<00:03:31.570> more

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
know if you chuck in a little bit more

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.960 
know if you chuck in a little bit more
you'll<00:03:32.769> get<00:03:32.920> something<00:03:33.100> that's<00:03:33.340> even<00:03:33.850> better

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
you'll get something that's even better

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.560 
you'll get something that's even better
obviously<00:03:37.380> you're<00:03:38.380> gonna<00:03:38.560> need<00:03:39.060> well<00:03:40.060> it's<00:03:40.480> a

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
obviously you're gonna need well it's a

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.500 
obviously you're gonna need well it's a
good<00:03:40.720> idea<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:41.019> have<00:03:41.260> better<00:03:41.530> thermal<00:03:41.890> paste

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
good idea to have better thermal paste

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.270 
good idea to have better thermal paste
slightly<00:03:43.510> more<00:03:43.660> expensive<00:03:43.799> usually<00:03:44.799> these

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
slightly more expensive usually these

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.240 
slightly more expensive usually these
coolers<00:03:46.150> do<00:03:46.390> come<00:03:46.630> with<00:03:46.810> them<00:03:47.010> better<00:03:48.010> thermal

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
coolers do come with them better thermal

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.670 
coolers do come with them better thermal
paste<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:49.510> you're<00:03:50.200> going<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.410> need<00:03:50.530> thermal

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
paste you you're going to need thermal

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.380 
paste you you're going to need thermal
paste<00:03:50.920> either<00:03:51.220> way<00:03:51.370> if<00:03:51.760> you're<00:03:52.209> going<00:03:52.329> to

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
paste either way if you're going to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.680 
paste either way if you're going to
replace<00:03:52.600> your<00:03:52.780> fan<00:03:53.010> but<00:03:54.329> while<00:03:55.329> you're<00:03:55.480> at<00:03:55.600> it

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
replace your fan but while you're at it

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.699 
replace your fan but while you're at it
you<00:03:55.720> might<00:03:55.870> as<00:03:55.959> well<00:03:55.989> get<00:03:56.170> something<00:03:56.500> that's<00:03:56.650> a

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
you might as well get something that's a

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.080 
you might as well get something that's a
little<00:03:56.829> bit<00:03:56.980> high<00:03:57.640> quality<00:03:58.739> also<00:03:59.850> more<00:04:00.850> case

that's<00:04:13.299> really<00:04:13.750> advanced<00:04:14.019> stuff<00:04:15.659> if<00:04:16.659> you're

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
that's really advanced stuff if you're

that's really advanced stuff if you're
just<00:04:17.049> starting<00:04:17.260> out<00:04:17.530> it's<00:04:18.340> not<00:04:18.549> necessary

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
just starting out it's not necessary

just starting out it's not necessary
really--it's<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.919> know<00:04:21.009> things<00:04:21.400> like<00:04:21.519> liquid

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
really--it's you know things like liquid

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.809 
really--it's you know things like liquid
nitrogen<00:04:21.879> that<00:04:22.449> that's<00:04:22.870> crazy<00:04:23.470> stuff

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:25.819 
nitrogen that that's crazy stuff

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:28.010 
nitrogen that that's crazy stuff
so<00:04:26.819> there's<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.270> few<00:04:27.449> things<00:04:27.509> you<00:04:27.840> need<00:04:27.990> to

obviously dust if if you're using this
the<00:04:32.789> stock<00:04:33.919> cooler<00:04:35.750> obviously<00:04:36.750> you're<00:04:37.710> gonna

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
the stock cooler obviously you're gonna

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.379 
the stock cooler obviously you're gonna
need<00:04:38.039> to<00:04:38.129> check<00:04:38.340> for<00:04:38.699> dust<00:04:38.909> more<00:04:39.289> those<00:04:40.289> things

pick up a lot of dust and especially if
you're<00:04:44.159> running<00:04:44.490> your<00:04:44.789> hardware<00:04:45.509> so<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:46.830> fast

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
you're running your hardware so so fast

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.399 
you're running your hardware so so fast
you're<00:04:48.150> gonna<00:04:48.300> need<00:04:48.509> to<00:04:48.900> make<00:04:49.020> sure<00:04:49.229> that

winter you know your room temperature

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.260 
winter you know your room temperature
could<00:04:57.539> be<00:04:58.430> considerably<00:04:59.430> lower<00:04:59.669> then<00:05:00.090> in
