of that but we will have a we will have
a<00:03:36.010> sheet<00:03:36.400> online<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.420> can<00:03:37.570> look<00:03:37.780> at<00:03:37.990> for

a sheet online that you can look at for

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.300 
a sheet online that you can look at for
the<00:03:38.290> different<00:03:38.680> burners<00:03:40.830> when<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:41.980> look<00:03:42.190> at

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
the different burners when you look at

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.850 
the different burners when you look at
the<00:03:42.430> different<00:03:42.820> burners<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:44.650> have<00:03:44.830> a

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
the different burners you have a

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.470 
the different burners you have a
different<00:03:45.340> end<00:03:45.520> cone<00:03:45.820> in<00:03:46.060> each<00:03:46.180> burner

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
different end cone in each burner

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.780 
different end cone in each burner
they're<00:03:46.930> not<00:03:47.080> all<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.410> same<00:03:47.790> this

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
they're not all the same this

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.380 
they're not all the same this
handy-dandy<00:03:49.390> little<00:03:49.750> gauge<00:03:50.790> will<00:03:51.790> also<00:03:52.180> help

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
handy-dandy little gauge will also help

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.920 
handy-dandy little gauge will also help
you<00:03:52.630> set<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.890> nozzle<00:03:54.700> distance<00:03:55.209> from<00:03:55.750> the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
you set the nozzle distance from the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.050 
you set the nozzle distance from the
combustion<00:03:56.320> head

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.880 

so<00:04:01.060> once<00:04:01.300> you<00:04:01.450> identify<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:02.140> burner<00:04:02.739> assembly

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
so once you identify the burner assembly

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.729 
so once you identify the burner assembly
that<00:04:03.550> you<00:04:03.700> have<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:05.020> can<00:04:05.230> go<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.470> your

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
that you have and you can go to your

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.600 
that you have and you can go to your
spec<00:04:06.069> sheet<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.660> can<00:04:07.840> adjust<00:04:08.310> due<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.489> the

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
spec sheet and you can adjust due to the

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.410 
spec sheet and you can adjust due to the
spec<00:04:09.880> sheet<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.660> appropriate<00:04:11.230> distances
