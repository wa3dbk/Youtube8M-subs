gers<00:00:30.410> but<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:32.130> think<00:00:32.460> that's<00:00:32.579> only<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

gers but I think that's only going to
work<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.239> my<00:00:33.360> advantage<00:00:33.390> because<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.410> was<00:00:34.500> a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
work to my advantage because it was a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.770 
work to my advantage because it was a
