so it's not as touch sensitive as the
iPhone<00:01:46.020> se<00:01:46.290> would<00:01:46.470> be<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.880> does<00:01:48.149> work<00:01:48.329> just

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
iPhone se would be but it does work just

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.450 
iPhone se would be but it does work just

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
know it's not going to be as responsive

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.940 
know it's not going to be as responsive
as<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.549> some<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> new<00:01:56.969> smartphones<00:01:57.450> are

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
as like some of the new smartphones are

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.340 
as like some of the new smartphones are
but<00:01:58.950> overall<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.060> unit<00:02:00.360> works<00:02:00.600> great<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
but overall the unit works great it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.139 
but overall the unit works great it
picks<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.740> satellite<00:02:02.130> reception<00:02:02.399> really<00:02:02.880> fast

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
picks up satellite reception really fast

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.990 
picks up satellite reception really fast
it<00:02:03.750> does<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.710> three<00:02:05.189> access<00:02:05.520> electronic

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
it does have the three access electronic

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.999 
it does have the three access electronic
compass<00:02:06.360> which<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.540> awesome<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.320> when<00:02:07.770> you're

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
compass which is awesome so when you're

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.499 
compass which is awesome so when you're
standing<00:02:08.280> still<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.910> you're<00:02:09.030> trying<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.270> plot

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
standing still and you're trying to plot

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.540 
standing still and you're trying to plot
a<00:02:09.569> course<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.500> simply<00:02:10.860> turn<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.190> unit<00:02:11.459> and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
a course you simply turn the unit and

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.589 
a course you simply turn the unit and
it's<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.879> tell<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.090> which<00:02:12.239> direction

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
it's going to tell you which direction

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.240 
it's going to tell you which direction
that<00:02:12.750> you're

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
that you're

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.470 
that you're
in<00:02:13.670> as<00:02:14.600> opposed<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.700> 5/10<00:02:16.700> 6/10<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.420> the

GC Magellan explores where you have to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.400 
GC Magellan explores where you have to
actually<00:02:20.150> start<00:02:20.300> walking<00:02:20.840> up<00:02:20.960> to<00:02:21.050> 3<00:02:21.260> meters

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
actually start walking up to 3 meters

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.740 
actually start walking up to 3 meters
before<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.070> can<00:02:22.190> triangulate<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.060> pick

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
before it can triangulate you and pick

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.810 
before it can triangulate you and pick
up<00:02:23.900> your<00:02:24.160> your<00:02:25.160> direction<00:02:25.490> that<00:02:25.700> you're

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
up your your direction that you're

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.400 
up your your direction that you're
heading<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.180> that's<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.480> nice<00:02:26.630> feature<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.380> also

heading so that's a nice feature it also

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.160 
heading so that's a nice feature it also
has<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.220> altimeter<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.480> barometer<00:02:29.630> built

has a altimeter and a barometer built

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.890 
has a altimeter and a barometer built
into<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.500> unit<00:02:30.800> which<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.370> really<00:02:31.670> cool
