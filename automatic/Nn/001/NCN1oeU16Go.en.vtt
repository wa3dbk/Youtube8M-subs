 more girls in this new program them 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.240
 we will show another peripheral that they bring 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.799
 many functions and that will be of use 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.799
 exclusive for all types of dinars 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.830
 and be with you the mac karthy erase 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.540
 7 this mouse is another mouse of 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.670
 high-end series of mouse gamers 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.050
 there are boards of brands designed in 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.070
 players looking for precision and 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.100
 comfort when playing 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.079
 we will proceed to open the box we will see that 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.420
 It has a magnetic cap with which 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.370
 We can see the product just like 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.410
 Other models of the flavor series for 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.770
 remove the product you have to remove the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.770
 security seals 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.770
 and as you will see we have in our hands 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.140
 the flavor rat 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.200
 7 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.680
 and we put aside the mouse we can see 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.130
 another additional cover we removed it and 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.770
 we find the manual available 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.570
 in Spanish and also with a catalog of 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.570
 products exclusively for gamers 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.660
 and inside we find a case 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.490
 white which brings all the 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.120
 additional peripherals to implement 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.120
 to our mouse 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.409
 never ice cream 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.240
 and it should be noted that this mouse does not bring 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.180
 its installation since windows it 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.460
 recognizes automatically and in addition to 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.560
 this you can download the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.290
 applications and configuration 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.659
 drivers on the official cyborg page 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.969
 dotcom gaming 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.439
 this peripheral is very different from the 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.469
 that many could expect from a mouse 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.049
 since it has multiple moving parts and 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:14.560
 open sections in the front 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:17.739
 as you will see 34 buttons and the wheel 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.840
 the two basic clicks to the side and the side 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.250
 left another button that serves to 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.459
 change the different schedules 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.500
 that can be done and just below 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.360
 the mouse wheel the button that serves 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.430
 to change the mouse's dpd with 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.880
 values ​​ranging from 25 to 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.670
 6,400 on the left side of the mouse is 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.250
 where we see several remarkable things the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.170
 two programmable buttons and this button 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.750
 color that you see here that at 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.910
 activate it the precision control will be 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.980
 more fickle because the speed of 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.430
 mouse will decrease and we can perform 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.080
 more precise movements also 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.480
 we can reconfigure it to give it the 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.390
 use that we want in the back of the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.060
 mouse we will see a metallic screw what 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.150
 unscrew moss and we will see the allen key 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.860
 what we need later using the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.769
 allen key we can take some 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.870
 pieces of the mouse and adjust others in the 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.720
 case as you will see we will find 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.100
 a total of 4 accessories as pieces of 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.010
 change 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.870
 a case of weights something already typical of 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.060
 the most gamers that will help us do 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.030
 the weight to the magician much more appropriate for 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.130
 the hand we take the allen key 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.470
 and we can remove the right panel 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.360
 of the mouse that as you will see comes ready by 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:38.140
 defect we remove this and we will have 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.440
 change it to one more grip or also to a 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.150
 post to little fingers 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.230
 I'm going to use the spend miles 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.230
 placed here 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.560
 insert the screw in red with the key 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.170
 allen and as you will see it was already adjusted to my 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.910
 half with this same key we can do 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.190
 turn the mechanism of the platform of 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.470
 left side to make it move forward or 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.540
 back and also it helps us to 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.090
 adjust it to our position the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.030
 doll through this your thumb 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:18.310
 can be more comfortable now we stop 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.560
 side and we can see that besides this 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.260
 includes two extra breaks for the 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.870
 palm of the hand as you will see a 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.030
 identical to the other but this one here has 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.940
 one higher height and the other has a 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.340
 rough texture these pieces thanks to the 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.890
 carbines allow them to adjust to the 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.790
 measure of your hand since if you have a 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.530
 big hand 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.140
 you can extend it or if you have a hand 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.160
 small you can decrease it and in the part 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.510
 below is an insert the weights 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.290
 we remove the insurance 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.900
 and here are the mouse weights 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.030
 we put the ones we think necessary in 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.330
 this case I insert in all those that 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.330
 have 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.660
 I put the insurance 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.250
 insert the allen key 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.789
 and the weight of my mother has increased one 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.620
 of the most outstanding points of this 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.200
 mouse is the second wheel with which 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.530
 account 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.540
 since it is here it can be used with the 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.180
 thumb when we are not using the 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.280
 buttons on the left in this one 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.080
 can program functions when swiping 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.270
 the roller up or down 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.270
 as if they were any other button 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.400
 well now I connect the mouse 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.139
 as you come and has been 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.030
 configured everything in order and in addition to 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.330
 this I placed the pieces with which 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.490
 I feel more comfortable and we will move to a 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.639
 small test with the classic counter 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.639
 strike 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.000
 configure a couple of buttons to my liking 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.460
 have the necessary for this type of 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.500
 games no more nor less the program of 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.840
 configuration gives us everything we need 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.820
 to have a ready the software is very 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.980
 complete and allows us to assign any 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.840
 key or function to the mouse buttons 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.840
 include the sequence of macros 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.730
 these buttons here I have configured them 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.730
 to change weapons repeatedly 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.419
 as you will see I have the screen very fast 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:40.639
 but how am I using a rifle or 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.900
 steinberg I will use the control of 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:47.770
 precision that is this button 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:50.979
 and now as you will see the sight has been put 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:53.680
 much slower and we will have a greater 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:56.880
 range when you are using a 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.880
 game in fps 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.710
 this wheel that we have here we can 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:06.600
 configure it as much as to bring the 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.670
 look at the editor or how to return it 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.740
 and besides this is not the only function 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.990
 what can you add but 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.930
 depending on the game you can adapt it to 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.910
 your measurement and eh configure to my style 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:22.490
 and you can also do the same 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.490
 of gesa this mouse seibo rats 7 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:27.389
 let's hope that the program has 

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:31.319
 served to get to know this mouse better
