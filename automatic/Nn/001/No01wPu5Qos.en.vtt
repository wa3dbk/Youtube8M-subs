00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.940
 welcome you to my channel in this 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.019
 video I want to show you how i am 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.309
 made drinkers and feeders or portable 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.580
 cells on quails so here they are 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.390
 I will look you now in detail 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.869
 tell you what I did for this as I do 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.869
 collected 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:46.840
 but attached feeders I bought pipes 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:48.879
 sanitary plastics and jammers i 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.260
 used foam 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:56.420
 pipe I just pressed foam 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.610
 squeezed circles 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.610
 these circles will be my stubs 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:12.140
 foam for stubs or halved 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.310
 the foam used i stayed with 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.160
 built in homes for outside for 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.179
 external insulation more porous and 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.179
 strong foam 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:35.790
 and the hole where to fill the water for water 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:44.780
 drinker I used width 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:44.780
 4 centimeter hole is enough 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.550
 it was convenient I used a grinder 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:18.360
 quickly cut a hole and now 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:21.170
 install downloads to 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.170
 no water leaked 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.209
 I used first I tried silicone 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.230
 but then still stopped at 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.230
 sealant 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.200
 silicone because it is soaked by water and 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.540
 the flow and slowly falls off to begin 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:55.710
 skip feeder sealant ok 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:56.220
 keeps hold water I coat everything 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.760
 slots 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:06.440
 sealant so that the passes were not with 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.440
 two sides and smear all these fingers 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.310
 so here is the end result 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.310
 see 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.410
 I fasten just nothing special 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:33.560
 not come up with the cheapest what you can 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:34.220
 was coming up and the same thing it was 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.940
 for water 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:43.540
 and this you feed feeder 10 diameter 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.860
 pipe and wider 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:52.960
 if you compare here the pipe more 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:04:01.750
 diameter bought a tsunami in the front 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:01.750
 cells like put huskies
