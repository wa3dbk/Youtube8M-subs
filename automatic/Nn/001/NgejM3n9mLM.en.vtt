physician treating an entire family is

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.119 
physician treating an entire family is

that you get to have a comprehensive
picture<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:21.540> where<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.900> can<00:02:22.280> understand<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
picture to where you can understand the

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.349 
picture to where you can understand the
dynamics<00:02:23.969> of<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.209> family<00:02:25.489> how<00:02:26.489> different

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
dynamics of the family how different

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.929 
dynamics of the family how different
family<00:02:27.659> members<00:02:27.989> having<00:02:28.430> medical<00:02:29.430> problems
