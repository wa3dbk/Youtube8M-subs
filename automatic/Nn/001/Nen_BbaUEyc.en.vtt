we have 1 4 9 16 what we call the square
numbers<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.780> actually<00:01:23.049> not<00:01:23.139> too<00:01:23.259> hard<00:01:23.289> to

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:23.499 
numbers it's actually not too hard to

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:24.660 
numbers it's actually not too hard to
find<00:01:23.649> a<00:01:23.799> form<00:01:24.009> of<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.189> screen<00:01:24.429> numbers

find a form of the screen numbers

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.919 
find a form of the screen numbers
everyone<00:01:24.909> I<00:01:24.939> think<00:01:25.060> would<00:01:25.299> say<00:01:25.450> if<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.780> n

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
everyone I think would say if the n

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.319 
everyone I think would say if the n
square<00:01:26.409> number<00:01:26.439> is<00:01:26.829> N<00:01:27.130> squared<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:28.210> is

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
square number is N squared it is

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.609 
square number is N squared it is
actually<00:01:28.600> possible<00:01:28.749> to<00:01:28.960> find<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.229> form<00:01:29.439> for<00:01:29.530> the

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
actually possible to find a form for the

actually possible to find a form for the
triangle<00:01:30.009> numbers<00:01:30.219> as<00:01:30.310> well<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:31.420> thing

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
triangle numbers as well and the thing

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.429 
triangle numbers as well and the thing
to<00:01:31.749> look<00:01:31.780> for<00:01:32.139> that<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:33.280> if<00:01:33.429> I<00:01:33.490> take<00:01:33.700> a<00:01:33.759> triangle

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
to look for that is if I take a triangle

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.690 
to look for that is if I take a triangle
with<00:01:35.439> the<00:01:35.530> space<00:01:35.799> I'll<00:01:36.009> take<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.249> fourth<00:01:36.490> one

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
with the space I'll take the fourth one

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.550 
I'll call T 4 is actually half a
rectangle<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.389> how<00:01:58.689> high<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:58.929> the<00:01:59.079> rectangle

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
rectangle and how high is the rectangle

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.120 
rectangle and how high is the rectangle
it's<00:01:59.889> four<00:02:00.159> high<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:01.029> it's<00:02:01.329> five<00:02:01.719> wide<00:02:02.049> so<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
it's four high and it's five wide so the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.800 
it's four high and it's five wide so the
forth<00:02:03.369> trunk<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.759> number<00:02:03.939> is<00:02:03.999> actually<00:02:04.149> half

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
forth trunk a number is actually half

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.100 
forth trunk a number is actually half
four<00:02:05.560> times<00:02:05.920> five<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:07.450> that's<00:02:07.630> have<00:02:07.749> one<00:02:07.899> very

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
four times five now that's have one very

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.809 
four times five now that's have one very
specific<00:02:08.319> example<00:02:08.950> but<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.160> same<00:02:09.369> principle

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
specific example but the same principle

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.940 
specific example but the same principle
can<00:02:10.360> apply<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.660> any<00:02:10.929> size<00:02:11.200> triangular<00:02:11.680> number

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
can apply to any size triangular number

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.199 
can apply to any size triangular number
and<00:02:12.130> we<00:02:12.190> can<00:02:12.220> actually<00:02:12.520> show<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.700> nth

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
and we can actually show the nth

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.890 
and we can actually show the nth
triangle<00:02:13.810> number<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.530> one-half<00:02:15.190> n<00:02:15.660> times<00:02:16.660> n

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
triangle number is one-half n times n

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.570 
triangle number is one-half n times n
plus<00:02:16.930> 1<00:02:17.380> being<00:02:17.950> coming<00:02:18.190> from<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.370> width<00:02:18.520> of

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
plus 1 being coming from the width of

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.580 
plus 1 being coming from the width of
the<00:02:18.670> original<00:02:18.940> triangle<00:02:19.180> n<00:02:19.540> plus<00:02:20.020> 1<00:02:20.260> because

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
the original triangle n plus 1 because

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.440 
the original triangle n plus 1 because
the<00:02:20.800> Wizards<00:02:21.160> second<00:02:21.610> triangle<00:02:21.880> plus<00:02:22.209> one

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the Wizards second triangle plus one

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.710 
the Wizards second triangle plus one
more<00:02:22.599> dot<00:02:23.549> great<00:02:24.549> so<00:02:25.390> there's<00:02:25.569> this

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
more dot great so there's this

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.600 
more dot great so there's this
triangular<00:02:26.500> numbers<00:02:26.829> the<00:02:27.040> square<00:02:27.310> knot

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
triangular numbers the square knot

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.610 
triangular numbers the square knot
for<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.420> Greeks<00:02:28.600> course<00:02:28.930> went<00:02:29.110> further<00:02:29.320> and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
for the Greeks course went further and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.810 
for the Greeks course went further and
they<00:02:29.770> went<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.070> pentagonal<00:02:30.370> numbers<00:02:30.760> so

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
they went to the pentagonal numbers so

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.010 
they went to the pentagonal numbers so
does<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.000> batagor<00:02:31.360> numbers<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.810> have<00:02:31.930> this

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
does the batagor numbers that have this

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.470 
does the batagor numbers that have this
very<00:02:32.350> strange<00:02:32.770> connection<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.030> partition

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
very strange connection to the partition

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.930 
very strange connection to the partition
mums<00:02:34.660> as<00:02:35.200> I'll<00:02:35.350> show<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.770> so<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.550> get<00:02:36.820> the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
mums as I'll show it so to get the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.930 
mums as I'll show it so to get the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
potato entangle numbers going I need to

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.100 
potato entangle numbers going I need to

okay<00:02:42.760> clean<00:02:43.420> board<00:02:43.720> but<00:02:44.350> with<00:02:44.470> some<00:02:44.590> triangle

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
okay clean board but with some triangle

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.950 
okay clean board but with some triangle
numbers<00:02:45.100> on<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.360> I'm<00:02:46.360> gonna<00:02:46.480> construct<00:02:46.750> the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
numbers on it I'm gonna construct the

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.390 
numbers on it I'm gonna construct the
square<00:02:47.290> numbers<00:02:47.590> again<00:02:47.830> in<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.070> different<00:02:48.220> way

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
square numbers again in a different way

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.340 
square numbers again in a different way
we<00:02:48.640> do<00:02:48.730> something<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> little<00:02:49.120> bit<00:02:49.210> strange<00:02:49.510> and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
we do something a little bit strange and

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.630 
we do something a little bit strange and
I<00:02:50.410> start<00:02:50.620> with<00:02:50.710> a<00:02:50.770> single<00:02:50.950> dot<00:02:51.220> for<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.430> first

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
I start with a single dot for the first

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.520 
I start with a single dot for the first
square<00:02:51.910> number<00:02:52.210> but<00:02:52.600> let<00:02:52.720> me<00:02:52.780> just<00:02:52.960> draw<00:02:53.200> a

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
square number but let me just draw a

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.980 
square number but let me just draw a
couple<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.100> guiding<00:02:54.520> lines<00:02:54.810> because<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.900> can

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
couple of guiding lines because I can

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.580 
couple of guiding lines because I can
think<00:02:56.020> of<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.380> next<00:02:56.740> square<00:02:56.980> number<00:02:57.430> as<00:02:57.580> a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
think of the next square number as a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.100 
think of the next square number as a
triangle<00:02:59.700> plus<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:01.000> triangle<00:03:01.660> glued<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.020> it

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
triangle plus a triangle glued to it

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.800 
triangle plus a triangle glued to it
there's<00:03:02.560> my<00:03:02.740> four<00:03:02.800> dots<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:04.420> next<00:03:04.660> square

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
there's my four dots the next square

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.080 
there's my four dots the next square
number<00:03:05.080> nine<00:03:05.320> dots<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.860> can<00:03:06.010> create<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.820> third

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
number nine dots I can create the third

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.540 
number nine dots I can create the third
triangle<00:03:07.420> number<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:08.740> third<00:03:08.770> triangle

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
triangle number and the third triangle

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.310 
triangle number and the third triangle
number<00:03:09.640> glued<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.210> it<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.510> there<00:03:10.990> is<00:03:11.140> actually

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
number glued to it and there is actually

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.170 
number glued to it and there is actually
an<00:03:11.500> array<00:03:11.740> of<00:03:12.010> three<00:03:12.340> by<00:03:12.520> three<00:03:12.700> array<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.940> dots

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
an array of three by three array of dots

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.670 
an array of three by three array of dots
that's<00:03:13.420> this<00:03:13.630> these<00:03:13.900> are<00:03:14.140> third<00:03:14.380> square

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
that's this these are third square

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.970 
that's this these are third square
number<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.760> on<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.810> get<00:03:16.960> the<00:03:17.110> next<00:03:17.740> square

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
number and so on to get the next square

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.320 
number and so on to get the next square
number<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.460> can<00:03:18.550> think<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:18.940> that's<00:03:19.030> two

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
number I can think of that's two

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.480 
number I can think of that's two
triangles<00:03:19.840> glued<00:03:20.050> together<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:21.280> if<00:03:21.370> you'd

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
triangles glued together so if you'd

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.150 
triangles glued together so if you'd
like<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:21.940> could<00:03:22.060> set<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.660> n<00:03:22.840> square<00:03:23.440> number<00:03:23.470> is

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
like I could set the n square number is

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.230 
like I could set the n square number is
actually<00:03:24.700> two<00:03:25.210> triangles<00:03:26.100> two<00:03:27.180> triangle<00:03:28.180> to

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
actually two triangles two triangle to

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.910 
actually two triangles two triangle to
accept<00:03:28.540> these<00:03:28.690> guys<00:03:28.990> would<00:03:29.230> double<00:03:29.500> counted

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
accept these guys would double counted

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.190 
accept these guys would double counted
and<00:03:30.070> if<00:03:30.730> I've<00:03:30.820> done<00:03:30.850> in<00:03:31.240> rows<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:31.900> means<00:03:32.080> I've

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
and if I've done in rows that means I've

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.960 
and if I've done in rows that means I've
double<00:03:32.440> counted<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:32.920> dots<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:33.760> need<00:03:33.910> to

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
double counted and dots so I need to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.330 
double counted and dots so I need to
subtract<00:03:34.300> n<00:03:34.480> from<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:34.930> formula<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:36.160> to

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
subtract n from that formula and to

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.340 
subtract n from that formula and to
check<00:03:36.520> ourselves<00:03:36.550> in<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.780> previous<00:03:38.140> of<00:03:38.260> the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
check ourselves in the previous of the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.080 
check ourselves in the previous of the
section<00:03:38.680> we<00:03:38.950> set<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.250> earth<00:03:39.400> trial<00:03:39.730> number<00:03:40.030> is

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
section we set the earth trial number is

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.340 
section we set the earth trial number is
one-half<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.840> tons<00:03:41.530> n<00:03:41.770> plus<00:03:42.010> 1<00:03:42.250> minus<00:03:43.060> n<00:03:43.350> what

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
one-half and tons n plus 1 minus n what

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.690 
one-half and tons n plus 1 minus n what
would<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.530> do<00:03:44.590> if<00:03:44.739> I<00:03:44.830> got<00:03:44.980> that<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.370> twos<00:03:45.610> cancel

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
would I do if I got that the twos cancel

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.440 
would I do if I got that the twos cancel
that's<00:03:46.300> N<00:03:46.570> squared<00:03:47.050> plus<00:03:47.230> n<00:03:47.560> minus<00:03:48.250> n<00:03:48.459> that's

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
that's N squared plus n minus n that's

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.000 
that's N squared plus n minus n that's
just<00:03:49.660> N<00:03:49.840> squared<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.320> is<00:03:50.470> indeed<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.770> n

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
just N squared that is indeed the n

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.710 
just N squared that is indeed the n
square<00:03:51.370> number<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.790> algebraically<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.570> can

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
square number so algebraically I can

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.630 
square number so algebraically I can
prove<00:03:53.110> this<00:03:53.290> but<00:03:53.739> geometrically<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.280> can<00:03:54.520> see

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
prove this but geometrically I can see

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.280 
prove this but geometrically I can see
that<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.850> square<00:03:55.150> is<00:03:55.300> really<00:03:55.540> two<00:03:55.750> triangles

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
that a square is really two triangles

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.890 
that a square is really two triangles
glued<00:03:56.650> together<00:03:57.090> but<00:03:58.090> this<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.450> key<00:03:58.690> to

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
glued together but this is the key to

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.300 
glued together but this is the key to
figure<00:03:59.110> out<00:03:59.200> how<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.380> go<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.800> next<00:03:59.980> level

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
figure out how to go to the next level

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.660 
figure out how to go to the next level
up<00:04:00.489> on<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:00.880> figure<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.270> numbers<00:04:01.600> so<00:04:02.590> if<00:04:03.459> a

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
up on this figure it numbers so if a

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.760 
up on this figure it numbers so if a
square<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.209> two<00:04:04.510> triangles<00:04:05.050> I<00:04:05.260> guess<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.590> next

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
square is two triangles I guess the next

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.210 
square is two triangles I guess the next
thing<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.160> do<00:04:06.280> is<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:07.780> glue<00:04:07.900> together<00:04:08.220> three

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
thing to do is to glue together three

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.420 
thing to do is to glue together three
triangles<00:04:09.640> here's<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.780> third<00:04:10.989> triangle<00:04:11.430> so

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
triangles here's the third triangle so

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.449 
triangles here's the third triangle so
here's<00:04:12.670> one<00:04:12.880> dot<00:04:13.140> here's<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.860> next<00:04:15.100> number

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
here's one dot here's the next number

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.460 
here's one dot here's the next number
which<00:04:15.730> would<00:04:15.850> be<00:04:15.910> a<00:04:16.239> row<00:04:16.600> of<00:04:16.690> two<00:04:16.959> each<00:04:17.260> of

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
which would be a row of two each of

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.440 
which would be a row of two each of
those<00:04:17.560> triangles<00:04:17.830> here's<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.910> next<00:04:19.090> numbers

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
those triangles here's the next numbers

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.510 
those triangles here's the next numbers
row<00:04:19.630> 3<00:04:19.989> Row<00:04:20.200> three<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.830> number<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.220> three

or<00:04:22.180> a<00:04:22.240> four<00:04:22.450> row<00:04:22.750> four<00:04:23.080> or<00:04:23.440> four<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.270> folks

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
or a four row four or four and folks

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.940 
or a four row four or four and folks
called<00:04:25.600> these<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:26.140> put<00:04:26.290> a<00:04:26.440> cone<00:04:26.590> on<00:04:26.680> but<00:04:26.830> if<00:04:26.890> you

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
called these to put a cone on but if you

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.680 
called these to put a cone on but if you
look<00:04:27.100> at<00:04:27.190> books<00:04:27.370> they<00:04:27.610> sometimes<00:04:27.880> try<00:04:28.390> to<00:04:28.419> draw

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
look at books they sometimes try to draw

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.800 
look at books they sometimes try to draw
a<00:04:28.720> Pentagon<00:04:29.230> like<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:30.240> so<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.360> Greeks<00:04:31.570> call

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
a Pentagon like that so the Greeks call

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.290 
a Pentagon like that so the Greeks call
these<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.200> pentagonal<00:04:32.500> numbers

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
these the pentagonal numbers

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.340 
these the pentagonal numbers
unfortunately<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.360> use<00:04:34.450> P<00:04:34.720> values<00:04:34.960> P

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
unfortunately you use P values P

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.730 
unfortunately you use P values P
subscript<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.130> for<00:04:36.580> the

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
subscript and for the

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.460 
subscript and for the
in<00:04:36.860> pentagonal<00:04:37.760> number<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.750> we<00:04:38.930> can<00:04:39.050> see<00:04:39.230> it's

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
in pentagonal number and we can see it's

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.200 
in pentagonal number and we can see it's
easy<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.740> get<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.890> formula<00:04:40.160> it's<00:04:40.670> just<00:04:40.880> actually

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
easy to get a formula it's just actually

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.450 
easy to get a formula it's just actually
three<00:04:41.570> triangles<00:04:42.020> glued<00:04:42.440> together<00:04:42.590> with<00:04:43.010> a

three triangles glued together with a
double<00:04:43.790> count<00:04:44.000> here<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.750> another<00:04:45.320> double

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
double count here and another double

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.400 
double count here and another double
count<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:47.030> if<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:47.510> do<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.750> algebra<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:48.290> this

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
count and if you do the algebra and this

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.910 
count and if you do the algebra and this
this<00:04:48.980> turns<00:04:49.250> out<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.520> be<00:04:49.750> 3<00:04:50.750> times<00:04:51.080> in<00:04:51.410> 3<00:04:51.680> and

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
this turns out to be 3 times in 3 and

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.490 
this turns out to be 3 times in 3 and
minus<00:04:52.430> 1<00:04:52.820> all<00:04:53.390> over<00:04:53.450> 2<00:04:54.700> all<00:04:55.700> right

the reason I want to pull out the pin
take<00:04:58.760> more<00:04:58.910> numbers<00:04:59.180> I'll<00:04:59.450> fade<00:04:59.660> out<00:04:59.780> later<00:04:59.960> to

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
take more numbers I'll fade out later to

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.020 
take more numbers I'll fade out later to
get<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.230> sequence<00:05:00.500> it<00:05:00.770> goes<00:05:00.950> 1<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.550> then<00:05:01.910> as

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
get the sequence it goes 1 and then as

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.640 
get the sequence it goes 1 and then as
what<00:05:02.150> is<00:05:02.240> it<00:05:02.330> are<00:05:02.450> fives<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.110> next<00:05:03.380> pentagonal

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
what is it are fives the next pentagonal

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.410 
what is it are fives the next pentagonal
number<00:05:03.920> obviously<00:05:04.040> and<00:05:04.460> then<00:05:04.610> it's<00:05:04.730> 12<00:05:05.150> and

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
number obviously and then it's 12 and

number obviously and then it's 12 and
then<00:05:05.900> 22

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
then 22

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.260 
then 22
there's<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.580> sequence<00:05:07.940> of<00:05:08.000> particular

former<00:05:21.590> I'm<00:05:21.680> about<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:21.890> give<00:05:22.040> in<00:05:22.310> a<00:05:22.400> moment

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
former I'm about to give in a moment

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.460 
former I'm about to give in a moment
that<00:05:23.390> there<00:05:23.510> are<00:05:23.570> other<00:05:23.690> numbers<00:05:24.110> involved

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
that there are other numbers involved

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.790 
that there are other numbers involved
there<00:05:25.100> was<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.220> 2<00:05:25.520> here<00:05:25.850> there<00:05:26.330> was<00:05:26.450> a<00:05:26.480> lysias<00:05:27.470> 7

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
there was a 2 here there was a lysias 7

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.970 
there was a 2 here there was a lysias 7
here<00:05:28.070> a<00:05:28.250> 15<00:05:28.910> here<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.210> so<00:05:29.630> on<00:05:29.830> but<00:05:30.830> actually

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
here a 15 here and so on but actually

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.550 
here a 15 here and so on but actually
the<00:05:31.250> numbers<00:05:31.580> he<00:05:31.850> found<00:05:32.150> in<00:05:32.270> his<00:05:32.450> formula<00:05:32.900> were

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
the numbers he found in his formula were

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.170 
the numbers he found in his formula were
what<00:05:34.040> he<00:05:34.220> called<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.670> generalized

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
what he called the generalized

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.550 
what he called the generalized
pentagonal<00:05:35.660> numbers<00:05:36.080> because<00:05:36.320> they<00:05:36.440> actually

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
pentagonal numbers because they actually

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.480 
pentagonal numbers because they actually
follow<00:05:36.890> the<00:05:37.010> formula<00:05:37.310> 3<00:05:38.180> times<00:05:38.840> 3<00:05:39.140> and<00:05:39.380> minus<00:05:40.160> 1

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
follow the formula 3 times 3 and minus 1

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.000 
follow the formula 3 times 3 and minus 1
over<00:05:40.610> 2<00:05:40.850> is<00:05:40.910> the<00:05:41.150> pink<00:05:41.360> is<00:05:41.480> the<00:05:41.660> purple<00:05:41.930> ones<00:05:42.080> or
