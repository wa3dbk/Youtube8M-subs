00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 

all<00:00:00.750> right<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:01.050> here<00:00:01.199> we're<00:00:01.350> gonna<00:00:01.469> graph<00:00:01.800> this

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
all right so here we're gonna graph this

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.360 
all right so here we're gonna graph this
polar<00:00:02.340> curve<00:00:02.730> R<00:00:03.060> equals<00:00:03.570> two<00:00:03.780> sine<00:00:03.990> theta

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
polar curve R equals two sine theta

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.920 
polar curve R equals two sine theta
again<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:05.549> could<00:00:05.730> start<00:00:06.060> plotting<00:00:06.540> points

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
again we could start plotting points

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.830 
again we could start plotting points
thinking<00:00:07.620> about<00:00:07.830> angles<00:00:08.220> theta<00:00:08.840> picking

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
thinking about angles theta picking

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.150 
thinking about angles theta picking
values<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.889> know<00:00:11.010> getting

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
values for you know getting

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.789 
values for you know getting
corresponding<00:00:11.880> values<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.269> R<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.900> plotting

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
corresponding values for R and plotting

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.470 
corresponding values for R and plotting
points<00:00:14.009> what<00:00:14.639> I'm<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.210> turn<00:00:15.420> it

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
points what I'm going to do is turn it

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.980 
points what I'm going to do is turn it
back<00:00:15.690> into<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:17.300> rectangular<00:00:18.300> equation

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
back into a rectangular equation

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.710 
back into a rectangular equation
involving<00:00:19.439> X<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.859> y-coordinates<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.789> again<00:00:21.630> I

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
involving X and y-coordinates so again I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.300 
involving X and y-coordinates so again I
would<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.199> an<00:00:22.320> R<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.920> my<00:00:23.070> sine

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
would like to have an R with my sine

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.400 
would like to have an R with my sine
theta<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.420> I'm<00:00:24.510> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.720> multiply<00:00:25.199> both

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
theta so I'm going to multiply both

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.920 
theta so I'm going to multiply both
sides<00:00:25.769> by<00:00:25.859> r<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.880> I'll<00:00:27.000> get<00:00:27.119> R<00:00:27.300> squared<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
sides by r so I'll get R squared on the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.460 
sides by r so I'll get R squared on the
left<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.650> two<00:00:29.369> R<00:00:29.670> sine<00:00:30.420> theta<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> right

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
left and two R sine theta on the right

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.240 
left and two R sine theta on the right
well<00:00:32.399> R<00:00:32.640> squared<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.239> x<00:00:33.630> squared<00:00:34.079> plus<00:00:34.680> y

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
well R squared is just x squared plus y

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.680 
well R squared is just x squared plus y
squared<00:00:36.620> R<00:00:37.620> sine<00:00:38.340> theta<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.210> same<00:00:39.420> thing

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
squared R sine theta is the same thing

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.400 
squared R sine theta is the same thing
as<00:00:39.960> Y<00:00:41.270> well<00:00:42.270> now<00:00:42.660> I'm<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> same

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
as Y well now I'm going to do the same

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.410 
as Y well now I'm going to do the same
thing<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:43.890> saw<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.399> another<00:00:44.520> example<00:00:45.239> I'm

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
thing that we saw in another example I'm

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.630 
thing that we saw in another example I'm
going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:48.200> subtract<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.410> 2y<00:00:49.890> over<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
going to subtract the 2y over to the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.209 
going to subtract the 2y over to the
left<00:00:50.879> side<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.989> now<00:00:52.590> I'm<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
left side and now I'm just going to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.180 
left side and now I'm just going to
complete<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> square<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.629> x<00:00:55.530> squared<00:00:55.920> if

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
complete the square so x squared if

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.970 
complete the square so x squared if
there's<00:00:56.399> no<00:00:56.550> linear<00:00:57.420> term<00:00:57.780> no<00:00:58.079> X<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> first

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
there's no linear term no X to the first

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.040 
there's no linear term no X to the first
term<00:00:59.430> we<00:01:00.000> don't<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.420> worry<00:01:00.629> about<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
term we don't have to worry about that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.090 
term we don't have to worry about that
part<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:02.550> Y<00:01:02.789> squared<00:01:03.149> minus<00:01:03.570> 2y<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
part so Y squared minus 2y this is the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.450 
part so Y squared minus 2y this is the
part<00:01:05.339> will<00:01:05.519> complete<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> square<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:07.460> so

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
part will complete the square on so

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.370 
part will complete the square on so
again<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.820> would<00:01:08.909> take<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.330> half<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.869> negative

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
again we would take one half of negative

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.969 
again we would take one half of negative
2<00:01:10.799> which<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.670> negative<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.710> negative<00:01:13.710> one

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
2 which is negative one negative one

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.850 
2 which is negative one negative one
squared<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.119> positive<00:01:15.450> one<00:01:15.960> so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
squared is going to be positive one so

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.649 
squared is going to be positive one so
we're<00:01:17.009> gonna<00:01:17.100> throw<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.430> plus<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:18.090> inside<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
we're gonna throw a plus one inside the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.450 
we're gonna throw a plus one inside the
parentheses

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
parentheses

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.580 
parentheses
and<00:01:20.580> again<00:01:20.820> if<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.300> got<00:01:22.140> rid<00:01:22.410> of<00:01:22.440> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and again if you got rid of the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
and again if you got rid of the
parentheses<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.460> plus<00:01:23.760> one<00:01:24.060> would<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.390> have

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
parentheses this plus one would not have

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.630 
parentheses this plus one would not have
been<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:24.900> before<00:01:25.260> so<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.250> means<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.520> have

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
been there before so that means I have

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.820 
been there before so that means I have
to<00:01:26.760> add<00:01:26.940> one<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> right<00:01:27.930> side<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.500> make<00:01:28.530> our

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
to add one to the right side to make our

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.780 
to add one to the right side to make our
equation<00:01:29.400> equal<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.100> we<00:01:32.160> would<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.520> x

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
equation equal and now we would have x

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.690 
equation equal and now we would have x
squared<00:01:33.210> plus<00:01:33.660> well<00:01:34.229> Y<00:01:34.680> squared<00:01:35.100> minus<00:01:35.430> 2y

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
squared plus well Y squared minus 2y

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.350 
squared plus well Y squared minus 2y
plus<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.590> factors<00:01:38.160> is<00:01:38.340> y<00:01:38.550> minus<00:01:39.120> one

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
plus one that factors is y minus one

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.609 
plus one that factors is y minus one
quantity<00:01:39.840> squared<00:01:40.200> equals<00:01:41.150> one<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.500> know

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
quantity squared equals one and you know

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.990 
quantity squared equals one and you know
if<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.040> wanted<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.520> could<00:01:44.610> even<00:01:44.670> write

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
if you wanted to you could even write

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.680 
if you wanted to you could even write
this<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.420> X<00:01:45.720> plus<00:01:46.590> zero<00:01:47.310> squared<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.450> still

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
this as X plus zero squared but still

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.060 
this as X plus zero squared but still
gives<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.960> x<00:01:49.229> squared<00:01:51.080> plus<00:01:52.080> y<00:01:52.380> minus<00:01:52.410> one

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
gives you x squared plus y minus one

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.450 
gives you x squared plus y minus one
squared<00:01:53.790> equals<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.070> again<00:01:56.220> we've

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
squared equals one so now again we've

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.109 
squared equals one so now again we've
got<00:01:56.490> an<00:01:56.759> equation<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.840> circle<00:01:58.910> it's<00:01:59.910> got<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
got an equation of a circle it's got a

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.180 
got an equation of a circle it's got a
center<00:02:01.460> at<00:02:02.460> 0<00:02:03.030> comma<00:02:03.360> positive<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.800> remember

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
center at 0 comma positive one remember

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.560 
center at 0 comma positive one remember
you<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.460> kind<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.820> take<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.060> opposite

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
you have to kind of take the opposite

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.390 
you have to kind of take the opposite
signs<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.040> would<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> radius

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
signs and then it would have a radius

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.040 
signs and then it would have a radius
well<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.730> take<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.090> square<00:02:12.270> root<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
well we take the square root of the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.140 
well we take the square root of the
number<00:02:13.200> well<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.400> square<00:02:14.610> root<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.790> one<00:02:15.000> is

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
number well the square root of one is

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.660 
number well the square root of one is
just<00:02:15.180> one<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.890> says<00:02:17.040> what<00:02:17.190> we<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.459> in<00:02:17.580> this

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
just one so it says what we have in this

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.630 
just one so it says what we have in this
case<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:17.940> we've<00:02:18.390> got<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.570> circle<00:02:19.520> centered<00:02:20.520> at

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
case is we've got a circle centered at

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.670 
case is we've got a circle centered at
zero<00:02:20.970> one<00:02:21.270> with<00:02:22.020> radius<00:02:22.470> one

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
zero one with radius one

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.270 
zero one with radius one
so<00:02:25.220> zero<00:02:25.640> one<00:02:26.120> would<00:02:26.420> be<00:02:26.540> up<00:02:26.659> here<00:02:26.989> so<00:02:27.769> radius

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
so zero one would be up here so radius

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.229 
so zero one would be up here so radius
one<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:28.909> let's<00:02:29.060> see<00:02:29.209> here's<00:02:29.540> one<00:02:29.900> one<00:02:31.239> there's

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
one so let's see here's one one there's

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.350 
one so let's see here's one one there's
0<00:02:33.019> 2<00:02:33.079> negative<00:02:33.709> 1<00:02:34.670> 1<00:02:35.269> would<00:02:35.510> be<00:02:35.540> over<00:02:35.870> there<00:02:36.189> so

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
0 2 negative 1 1 would be over there so

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.520 
0 2 negative 1 1 would be over there so
all<00:02:38.360> we're<00:02:38.629> doing<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.019> just<00:02:39.079> getting<00:02:39.319> an

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
all we're doing is just getting an

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.949 
all we're doing is just getting an
equation<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.430> circle<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:41.420> been<00:02:41.599> kind<00:02:41.870> of

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
equation of a circle it's been kind of

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.800 
equation of a circle it's been kind of
pushed<00:02:42.319> up<00:02:42.590> along<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.400> y<00:02:43.790> axis<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:44.420> little<00:02:44.629> bit

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
pushed up along the y axis a little bit

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.920 
pushed up along the y axis a little bit
and<00:02:45.260> that's<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.030> again<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.629> could<00:02:47.750> always

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
and that's it so again you could always

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.970 
and that's it so again you could always
plot<00:02:48.620> points<00:02:49.189> picking<00:02:49.670> values<00:02:49.849> for<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:51.890> know

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
plot points picking values for you know

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.220 
plot points picking values for you know
typically<00:02:52.489> what<00:02:52.640> we'll<00:02:52.819> do<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.390> at<00:02:53.900> least<00:02:54.079> what

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
typically what we'll do is at least what

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.470 
typically what we'll do is at least what
I<00:02:54.260> do<00:02:54.379> them<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.769> pick<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.040> value<00:02:55.310> first<00:02:55.700> off<00:02:55.970> for

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
I do them I pick a value first off for

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.289 
I do them I pick a value first off for
theta<00:02:56.799> calculate<00:02:57.799> my<00:02:57.950> R<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.879> then<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.060> start

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
theta calculate my R and then I start

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.629 
theta calculate my R and then I start
trying<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.720> plot<00:02:59.959> points<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.530> way<00:03:00.859> but<00:03:01.549> again

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
trying to plot points that way but again

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.599 
trying to plot points that way but again
a<00:03:01.790> lot<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.060> times<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.540> more<00:03:02.750> efficient<00:03:03.609> exact

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
a lot of times a more efficient exact

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.930 
a lot of times a more efficient exact
way<00:03:04.879> is<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.329> turn<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.659> back<00:03:05.870> into<00:03:06.940> rectangular

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
way is to turn it back into rectangular

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.580 
way is to turn it back into rectangular
coordinates<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.810> know<00:03:08.930> maybe<00:03:09.170> by<00:03:09.349> plotting

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
coordinates you know maybe by plotting

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.410 
coordinates you know maybe by plotting
points<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:10.310> would<00:03:10.489> be<00:03:10.579> like<00:03:10.730> yeah<00:03:10.939> I<00:03:10.970> think<00:03:11.180> it

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
points I would be like yeah I think it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.300 
points I would be like yeah I think it
looks<00:03:11.450> like<00:03:11.689> a<00:03:11.750> circle<00:03:12.230> if<00:03:12.349> I'm<00:03:12.470> making<00:03:12.769> a<00:03:12.799> good

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
looks like a circle if I'm making a good

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.520 
looks like a circle if I'm making a good
graph<00:03:13.659> but<00:03:14.659> once<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.019> turn<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.379> into

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
graph but once I turn it into

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.190 
graph but once I turn it into
rectangular<00:03:16.370> coordinates<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.269> I<00:03:17.780> see<00:03:18.019> all

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
rectangular coordinates and I see all

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.319 
rectangular coordinates and I see all
the<00:03:18.349> equations<00:03:18.950> well<00:03:19.189> okay<00:03:19.700> now<00:03:19.879> I'm<00:03:20.090> positive

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
the equations well okay now I'm positive

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.459 
the equations well okay now I'm positive
that<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.870> am<00:03:21.139> in<00:03:21.290> fact<00:03:21.560> getting<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:22.099> circle
