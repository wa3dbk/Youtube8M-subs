as<00:02:09.850> we<00:02:10.119> would<00:02:10.300> have<00:02:10.360> liked<00:02:11.850> later<00:02:12.850> scans<00:02:13.650> show

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
as we would have liked later scans show

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.320 
as we would have liked later scans show
that<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:15.489> tumors<00:02:15.940> are<00:02:16.090> still<00:02:16.330> growing<00:02:21.330> it's

that the tumors are still growing it's

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.270 
that the tumors are still growing it's
getting<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.840> stage<00:02:23.230> where<00:02:23.260> we<00:02:23.980> need<00:02:24.190> to

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
getting to the stage where we need to

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.540 
getting to the stage where we need to
talk<00:02:24.550> about<00:02:24.610> whether<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:25.660> worth<00:02:25.959> continuing

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
talk about whether it's worth continuing

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:37.580
