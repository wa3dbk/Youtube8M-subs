 six against six on the mat express 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.080

 and the second round also goes through because it naturally consists of second 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.199
 round gas leak can watch where the little boy doesn't do that 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.280

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.600
 playing the gates I also sat here in a two or three man party 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.719

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.199
 those guns are downright just about few ever you shoot a pillar of 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.850
 dubai the branch 35 times and shoot two bullets from about ten fifteen 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.369
 meters away and you also have two bullets in painter ccl 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.380
 the bins each there no more than but here was really a price tag should you 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.490
 you have to pay attention but after that I'm going to be nice, she stayed with both cevat 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.130
 she strained she could just actually set the decor and in the second round I started 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.929
 I got the nuclear nice when I just a bit nice by but 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.069
 idea that wave ends but nice because of what I have today again in July 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.609
 submit to you because today no walking the dog at 12 o'clock and I was 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.599
 then just put her to bed because yes I had an arm to sleep in you thought you could 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:32.039
 to mention 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.469
 all that day before, the film was a time with those who exceeded them 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.359
 watch a movie I watch a movie behind the names adorn the same 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.609
 film and then we talk about truancy can live at beach zero under the 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:42.070
 movie 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.060
 First there were watching a movie that ended half an hour 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.060
 to order another movie he is very dry 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.050
 and I just fell asleep showing the movie so I wasn't watching 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.570
 at half past three in the past yellow film they wanted to peel 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.080
 It didn't get easy but the woman was quite dry last Martin Gig 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.630
 slowly awake says that to me 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.539
 this deliberately 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.390
 redeating scholarships red goodnight the shifting was just there 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.610
 further dropped on his bed hopefully he is not online on yet 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.519
 skylge referee let those horse people still be funny but it was 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.770
 became very late, she had remained in bed from home until 12 o'clock 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.900
 He woke up to lie with the dog runner I always walk to a species 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.290
 from 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.400
 channel and then you have to cross a busy road just sickly 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.920
 decently 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.819
 on the button once and for all from those people who don't really notice the 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.120
 they usually stop lights 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.640
 look to the left and right to see if there might be someone on it 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.340
 comes driving for example because of red driving I do very often at traffic lights 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.179
 because very often 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.900
 you press the button you become the red button for the traffic light red 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.970
 and I still have a small person just recently with the scooter or with 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.540
 a car that just crosses the driving candides 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.690
 but ask what this just woke up a few minutes on the outside particle 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:48.909
 on 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.779
 the traffic light on green I also once again that solved so I walk 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.000
 very tasty 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.690
 points will drive this part hard and I saw him at the very last moment 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.829
 I see no bears on the road to a halt 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.209
 he almost drove through red but had to look awake and squeak 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.149
 tires city 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:07.379
 all the tracks on the road that came up he was a samba and matched mouth and 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.829
 I was so lucky that I just got soft and I myself was also lucky that I had the botnets 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.569
 evenings on the road actually just quiet maybe as I was 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:14.590
 run through from 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.459
 what those just can cross through messaoud that you only one I think 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.460
 also 80 on a road where you were allowed 50 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.850
 but I myself am quite a bit since time when I am in the car I have 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.610
 of course now 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.940
 but the but he stays with the busy but I myself am sitting in the car 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.040
 and I also know that I have to do that in a car that you think so 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.270
 verdict young eels on a slight decrease to 5 5 around kilos of such a car 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.460
 so if you die someone with that then he is out for a total of 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.619
 Jesus 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.569
 batch of respondents said worse so in a car you have to pay attention but 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:42.260
 by bike 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.480
 I personally am not really just working safely was such a price came up 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.699
 through roundabout on the 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.620
 road that I often run on and yes on the bike 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.529
 I think it's a shame of you to grab a novel, like for example 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:56.279
 tough rule that traffic lights in the Netherlands that map failure I find 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.399
 what they should make sensors in traffic lights for cyclists and 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:02.909
 pedestrians what if the cda year got that they just get green once 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.059
 what sun are you on the bike 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.669
 at everton the way to school you have to stop at the traffic light 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.279
 Heineken does not start the traffic light to help rock hard while you 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.059
 completely soaked with there is half an hour to wait and thinks of flakkee 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:14.689
 I'm just going to cross 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.629
 and it is on the bike I do things by red bakery in the car and 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:20.760
 just not at all with the deceased boys I save your websites 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.470
 have you ever experienced anything so that you don't meet anyone 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.290
 died or something else I had it even when I was young already experienced that 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.060
 there is no need to learn from the left and to the right 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.830
 only his right 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.180
 or maybe the car will turn but like 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.860
 I naturally live in front of a traffic light when I used to play on it 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.129
 schoolyard then 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.999
 I am just no across the street and the tricky choice literally in my 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.969
 peed on pants 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.289
 because mistakes are made to the quay wall family that car rock hard bears mercer 4 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:48.740
 you have to stop just before my head 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.900
 so on the road again 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.400
 malik 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.169
 were placed there that had a large proportion of rebels 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.319
 killed but that kind of pissed my pants off 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.009
 crossed the best road and can therefore know that this old map of the zeeuw and I know 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.040
 now how old I was when it was primary school 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.710
 and that was a long time ago, but when he is fit, they will be two different 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.480
 Being there he was sometimes wanted to see us in the middle of a dive 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.670
 may be nice to count this kind of frills no longer just about the game 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.090
 play and just about this just neat something nice in between what alone 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.630
 but black ops eiffel a buzzword who is of course not nice I am going to marisa 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.120
 tomei games they were allowed to come on Saturday to present games in germany 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.530
 then he might meet me, but you can still find them 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.740
 you can come across me again 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.470
 I wish the Catalans could throw his Konmar youth campaign in the photo 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.610
 if you want that now i'm gonna die guys complete dnb was also dropping 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.210
 in the kitchen 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.080
 swallowing backwards that showed talent to drive above time 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.009
 that won the people
