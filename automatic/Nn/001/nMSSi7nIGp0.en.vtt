here's<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.319> little<00:00:01.620> clip<00:00:01.860> on<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.429> overflow

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
here's a little clip on the overflow

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.440 
here's a little clip on the overflow
that<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.959> put<00:00:04.350> in<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.589> turtle<00:00:05.040> pond<00:00:05.450> right

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
that I put in the turtle pond right

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.129 
that I put in the turtle pond right
there<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:07.109> had<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.160> do<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> little<00:00:08.610> bit<00:00:08.849> of

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
there I had to do a little bit of

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.440 
there I had to do a little bit of
modification<00:00:10.309> but<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.330> that's

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
modification but what that is is that's

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.200 
modification but what that is is that's
a<00:00:12.660> jet<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.349> goes<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.799> hot<00:00:14.009> tub<00:00:14.040> or<00:00:14.610> goes<00:00:14.820> and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
a jet that goes in a hot tub or goes and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.540 
a jet that goes in a hot tub or goes and
a<00:00:15.269> swimming<00:00:15.570> pool<00:00:15.839> where<00:00:16.619> water<00:00:16.859> comes<00:00:17.100> out<00:00:17.340> of

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
a swimming pool where water comes out of

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.040 
a swimming pool where water comes out of
and<00:00:17.699> it's<00:00:17.820> got<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.119> little<00:00:18.180> swivel<00:00:18.630> head<00:00:18.869> on

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
and it's got that little swivel head on

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.290 
and it's got that little swivel head on
it<00:00:19.199> well<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> went<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.220> my<00:00:20.340> pool<00:00:20.609> store<00:00:20.939> and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
it well I went to my pool store and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.509 
it well I went to my pool store and
bought<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.830> got<00:00:22.980> threads<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
bought that and it's got threads on the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.279 
bought that and it's got threads on the
other<00:00:23.670> side<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.630> were<00:00:24.750> able<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.019> thread<00:00:25.260> it

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
other side so we were able to thread it

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.640 
other side so we were able to thread it
in<00:00:25.500> there<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.150> actually<00:00:27.150> drilled<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.320> flange

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
in there I actually drilled the flange

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.310 
in there I actually drilled the flange
and<00:00:29.010> put<00:00:29.789> four<00:00:30.029> stainless<00:00:30.300> steel<00:00:30.689> screws<00:00:30.869> on

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and put four stainless steel screws on

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.220 
and put four stainless steel screws on
that<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.460> did<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.000> drilled<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.780> two

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that so what I did is I drilled the two

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.130 
that so what I did is I drilled the two
and<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> half<00:00:34.590> inch<00:00:34.800> hole<00:00:35.070> through<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> liner

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
and a half inch hole through the liner

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.690 
and a half inch hole through the liner
through<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> styrofoam<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.100> through<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
through the styrofoam and through the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.540 
through the styrofoam and through the
plywood<00:00:39.210> at<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> same<00:00:39.660> time<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:41.370> I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
plywood at the same time and then I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.639 
plywood at the same time and then I
drilled<00:00:42.360> through<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> other<00:00:42.809> side<00:00:42.899> where<00:00:43.379> my

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
drilled through the other side where my

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.080 
drilled through the other side where my
tongue<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.550> groove<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.930> that's<00:00:46.410> got

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
tongue and groove is and then that's got

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.490 
tongue and groove is and then that's got
what<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.239> plan<00:00:48.480> chimes<00:00:48.809> behind<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
what that plan chimes behind it is a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.819 
what that plan chimes behind it is a
gasket<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.219> silicone<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.110> silicone<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
gasket and silicone so I silicone and

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.709 
gasket and silicone so I silicone and
put<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> gasket<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.550> squash<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.300> whole<00:00:54.449> thing

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
put the gasket on squash the whole thing

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
put the gasket on squash the whole thing
on<00:00:54.899> there<00:00:55.140> put<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.739> stainless<00:00:56.250> steel<00:00:56.280> screws

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
on there put the stainless steel screws

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.959 
on there put the stainless steel screws
in<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.149> that's<00:00:57.270> tight<00:00:57.690> against<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> liner<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
in so that's tight against the liner and

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.200 
in so that's tight against the liner and
then<00:01:00.140> I<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:02.070> siliconed<00:01:02.550> around<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
then I we siliconed around it and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.899 
then I we siliconed around it and
silicone<00:01:03.809> two<00:01:04.140> stainless<00:01:04.409> steel<00:01:04.739> screw<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.760> as

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
silicone two stainless steel screw so as

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.609 
silicone two stainless steel screw so as
you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.180> see<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:06.479> now<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.869> ponds<00:01:07.229> at<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you can see right now the ponds at the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.130 
you can see right now the ponds at the
water<00:01:07.830> level<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.310> wanted<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.140> God

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
water level that I wanted at and God

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.960 
water level that I wanted at and God
forbid<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.830> dumbass<00:01:11.310> thing<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
forbid I do a dumbass thing like I

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.719 
forbid I do a dumbass thing like I
always<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.170> let<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> water<00:01:13.680> run<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.400> here

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
always do and let the water run in here

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.940 
always do and let the water run in here
which<00:01:14.909> means<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.450> drop<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> hose<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
which means I drop a hose in and then I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.620 
which means I drop a hose in and then I
take<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.189> phone<00:01:17.460> call<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.939> go<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.299> something

take a phone call or I go do something

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.020 
take a phone call or I go do something
else<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.470> let<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> hose<00:01:19.950> run<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.490> believe

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
else and I let the hose run and believe

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.520 
else and I let the hose run and believe
me<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.240> flooded<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.780> basement<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.320> enough

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
me I flooded this basement out enough

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.160 
me I flooded this basement out enough
times<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.009> no<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:24.090> anyway<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.689> water<00:01:24.900> will

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
times and no but anyway the water will

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.109 
times and no but anyway the water will
go<00:01:25.350> into<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.159> once<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> reaches<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.060> level

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
go into that once it reaches that level

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.050 
go into that once it reaches that level
which<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.630> only<00:01:27.930> an<00:01:28.080> inch<00:01:28.290> higher<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:29.430> these

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
which is only an inch higher then these

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.840 
which is only an inch higher then these
rocks<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.960> no<00:01:31.110> catastrophe<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
rocks which is no catastrophe and it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.390 
rocks which is no catastrophe and it
goes<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.810> goes<00:01:33.990> through<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.650> wall<00:01:34.829> in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
goes in that it goes through the wall in

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.440 
goes in that it goes through the wall in
the<00:01:35.670> pipe<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:37.189> as<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.970> comes<00:01:39.210> out

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the pipe and as you can see it comes out

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.140 
the pipe and as you can see it comes out
of<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> wall<00:01:39.810> right<00:01:40.110> there<00:01:40.369> let<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.520> down<00:01:41.850> into

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
of the wall right there let go down into

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.389 
of the wall right there let go down into
the<00:01:42.360> trap<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.590> I've<00:01:43.710> got<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.920> check<00:01:44.189> valve

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the trap and then I've got a check valve

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.090 
the trap and then I've got a check valve
right<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.200> then<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.380> ties<00:01:46.590> into<00:01:46.890> my

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
right there and then it ties into my

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.850
