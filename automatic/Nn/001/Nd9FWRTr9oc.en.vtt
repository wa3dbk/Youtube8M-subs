00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
thinking how the hell is that multiple

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.160 
thinking how the hell is that multiple
to<00:02:17.200> work<00:02:17.349> another<00:02:17.620> strip<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.540> when<00:02:19.540> they<00:02:19.720> can

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
to work another strip and when they can

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.220 
to work another strip and when they can
stand<00:02:20.470> up<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:22.540> drips<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.050> if<00:02:23.110> you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
stand up to it and it drips but if you

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.160

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
a nine out of ten purely because I

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.440 
a nine out of ten purely because I
didn't<00:03:11.590> expect<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.190> be<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.310> big<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.910> I've

didn't expect it to be this big and I've

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.660 
didn't expect it to be this big and I've
made<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:13.810> shelf<00:03:14.109> for<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.350> down<00:03:14.530> here<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.519> I

made this shelf for it down here and I

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.610 
made this shelf for it down here and I
was<00:03:15.730> hoping<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.480> would<00:03:16.630> fit<00:03:16.870> on<00:03:17.019> it<00:03:17.079> like<00:03:17.380> that

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
was hoping it would fit on it like that

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.740 
was hoping it would fit on it like that
but<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.700> do<00:03:18.820> have<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.390> put<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:19.630> diagonal<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:21.750> so

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.289
