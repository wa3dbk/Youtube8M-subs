00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.600 
to have I believe a concept where the
foundation<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.850> love<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.500> level<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.310> real

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
foundation of love is that level of real

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.690 
foundation of love is that level of real
naked<00:02:20.940> Austin<00:02:21.770> with<00:02:22.770> each<00:02:22.920> person<00:02:23.400> you're

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
naked Austin with each person you're

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.640 
naked Austin with each person you're
there<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.750> know<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:24.870> if<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.260> meet<00:02:25.410> somebody

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
there you know and if you meet somebody

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.780 
there you know and if you meet somebody
else<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.220> think<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.610> absolutely

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
else that you think is absolutely

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.610 
else that you think is absolutely
wonderful<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.660> can<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.900> completely<00:02:28.050> love

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
wonderful and you can be completely love

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.130 
wonderful and you can be completely love
with<00:02:28.740> them<00:02:28.860> well<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.940> alone<00:02:30.270> just<00:02:30.780> isn't

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
with them well that alone just isn't

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.270 
with them well that alone just isn't
quite<00:02:31.290> good<00:02:31.530> enough<00:02:31.740> if<00:02:31.920> you're<00:02:32.070> going<00:02:32.190> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
quite good enough if you're going to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.550 
quite good enough if you're going to
forge<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.760> community<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.360> family<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:34.470> know

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
forge a community and family you know

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.610 
forge a community and family you know
everybody<00:02:35.010> else<00:02:35.280> there<00:02:36.000> has<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.510> feel<00:02:36.720> that

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
everybody else there has to feel that

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.350 
everybody else there has to feel that
way<00:02:37.860> too<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.340> they<00:02:38.610> have<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.880> feel<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.090> way

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
way too and they have to feel that way

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.780 
way too and they have to feel that way
with<00:02:39.540> everybody<00:02:39.750> else<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.230> know<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:41.100> have<00:02:41.340> we

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
with everybody else you know we have we

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.510 
with everybody else you know we have we
created<00:02:42.120> our<00:02:42.450> concept<00:02:43.020> of<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:44.040> Raven<00:02:44.340> heart

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
created our concept of the Raven heart

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.080 
created our concept of the Raven heart
family<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> line<00:02:45.330> marriage<00:02:46.100> in<00:02:47.100> which<00:02:47.489> it

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
family is a line marriage in which it

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.820 
family is a line marriage in which it
wasn't<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.540> requirement<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.200> everybody<00:02:49.620> has

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
wasn't a requirement that everybody has

wasn't a requirement that everybody has
to<00:02:49.860> marry<00:02:50.220> everybody<00:02:50.670> else<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.720> know<00:02:51.750> as<00:02:51.900> long

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
to marry everybody else you know as long

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.520 
to marry everybody else you know as long
as<00:02:52.200> somebody's<00:02:52.530> plugged<00:02:52.890> in<00:02:53.100> but<00:02:54.080> but<00:02:55.080> in<00:02:55.320> fact

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
it's got internal loops you to hell and

it's got internal loops you to hell and
it's<00:02:58.140> sort<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.800> we<00:02:59.430> kind<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.730> liked<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.090> too<00:03:00.390> if

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
it's sort of we kind of liked it too if

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.790 
it's sort of we kind of liked it too if
we<00:03:00.720> try<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.959> diagram<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.560> looks<00:03:01.680> like

they're<00:03:30.470> not<00:03:30.620> going<00:03:30.740> to<00:03:30.800> want<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:31.070> do<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.310> and

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
they're not going to want to do it and

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.570 
they're not going to want to do it and
and<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.380> do<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:33.710> you<00:03:33.920> just<00:03:33.980> really<00:03:34.340> have<00:03:34.460> to

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
and to do that you just really have to

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.310 
and to do that you just really have to
be<00:03:34.790> honest<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.210> talk<00:03:35.390> about<00:03:35.690> things<00:03:35.870> even<00:03:36.230> if

be honest to talk about things even if

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.110 
be honest to talk about things even if
they're<00:03:36.350> painful<00:03:36.680> things<00:03:37.100> even<00:03:37.970> if<00:03:38.060> they're

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
they're painful things even if they're

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.460 
they're painful things even if they're
difficult<00:03:38.360> things<00:03:38.810> even<00:03:39.080> if<00:03:39.170> they're<00:03:39.200> things
