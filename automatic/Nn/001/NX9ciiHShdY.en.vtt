Transformer Prime has Nvidia's Tegra 3
quad-core<00:00:31.410> mobile<00:00:32.340> processor<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.480> also

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
quad-core mobile processor it's also

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.810 
quad-core mobile processor it's also
about<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:34.260> gigabyte<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.890> RAM<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.309> two

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
about one gigabyte of RAM and two

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.729 
about one gigabyte of RAM and two
storage<00:00:36.210> options<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.840> actually<00:00:37.170> come<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.530> at

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
storage options that actually come in at

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.920 
storage options that actually come in at
the<00:00:38.129> exact<00:00:38.460> same<00:00:38.670> price<00:00:38.940> point<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.420> original

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the exact same price point as original

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
the exact same price point as original
transformer<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.219> 32<00:00:41.610> gigabyte<00:00:41.910> version

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
transformer so the 32 gigabyte version

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
transformer so the 32 gigabyte version
is<00:00:42.450> still<00:00:42.930> 499<00:00:43.789> with<00:00:44.789> an<00:00:44.940> added<00:00:45.360> version<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.840> 64

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
is still 499 with an added version of 64

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.560 
is still 499 with an added version of 64
gigabytes<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.129> adds<00:00:47.399> 100<00:00:47.730> otters<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> 5

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
gigabytes that adds 100 otters up to 5

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.720 
gigabytes that adds 100 otters up to 5
99<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.289> pretty<00:00:49.829> much<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> same<00:00:50.309> baseline

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
99 so pretty much the same baseline

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.340 
99 so pretty much the same baseline
price<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.360> you're<00:00:51.480> looking<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:51.809> comparable

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
price if you're looking at comparable

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.459 
price if you're looking at comparable
storage<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.840> obviously<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> really<00:00:55.289> nice

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
storage so obviously it's a really nice

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.700 
storage so obviously it's a really nice
device<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.510> really<00:00:57.510> nice<00:00:57.660> spun<00:00:58.530> aluminum

HDMI slot and a volume toggle okay so

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.810 
HDMI slot and a volume toggle okay so
let's<00:02:33.720> take<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.900> closer<00:02:34.140> look<00:02:34.260> at<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.950> OS<00:02:35.520> on

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
let's take a closer look at the OS on

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.150 
let's take a closer look at the OS on
the<00:02:35.910> transformer<00:02:36.330> prime<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:37.440> obviously<00:02:37.770> you

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
the transformer prime so obviously you

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.100 
the transformer prime so obviously you
know<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.460> does<00:02:38.640> still<00:02:38.940> run<00:02:39.120> Android<00:02:39.600> 3.2

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
know that does still run Android 3.2

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.170 
know that does still run Android 3.2
honeycomb<00:02:40.550> there's<00:02:41.550> not<00:02:41.640> much<00:02:41.760> different

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
honeycomb there's not much different

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.370 
honeycomb there's not much different
here<00:02:42.210> from<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.570> drawer<00:02:42.750> transformer

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
here from the drawer transformer

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.020 
here from the drawer transformer
although<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.010> does<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.250> some<00:02:44.880> additional

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
although it does have some additional

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.600 
although it does have some additional
menu<00:02:45.720> items<00:02:46.170> now<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.100> going<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.459> switch

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
menu items now this is going to switch

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.270 
menu items now this is going to switch
to<00:02:47.640> Android<00:02:48.630> 4.0<00:02:49.140> Ice<00:02:49.320> Cream<00:02:49.500> Sandwich<00:02:49.709> very

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich very

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.370 
to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich very
soon<00:02:50.490> with<00:02:50.640> an<00:02:50.760> over-the-air<00:02:51.120> update<00:02:51.510> but

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
soon with an over-the-air update but

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.900 
soon with an over-the-air update but
until<00:02:52.800> then<00:02:52.920> we<00:02:53.070> can<00:02:53.190> see<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.820> know

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
until then we can see that you know

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:54.949 
until then we can see that you know
things<00:02:54.090> are<00:02:54.300> different<00:02:54.510> here<00:02:54.690> we've<00:02:54.930> got

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
things are different here we've got

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.770 
things are different here we've got
different<00:02:55.830> power<00:02:56.130> modes<00:02:56.370> now<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:57.240> a<00:02:57.540> power

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
different power modes now so a power

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.350 
different power modes now so a power
saving<00:02:58.170> mode<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> balance<00:02:59.760> mode<00:02:59.970> high

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
saving mode but a balance mode high

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.040 
saving mode but a balance mode high
performance<00:03:00.650> salt<00:03:01.650> normal<00:03:01.980> speed<00:03:02.250> mode<00:03:02.459> and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
performance salt normal speed mode and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.240 
performance salt normal speed mode and
what's<00:03:04.050> interesting<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.500> note<00:03:04.650> with<00:03:04.770> these<00:03:05.010> is

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
what's interesting to note with these is

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.430 
what's interesting to note with these is
that<00:03:05.540> when<00:03:06.540> we're<00:03:06.660> on<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.900> balance<00:03:07.200> moment

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
that when we're on the balance moment

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.040 
that when we're on the balance moment
for<00:03:07.560> example<00:03:07.950> we're<00:03:08.459> actually<00:03:08.610> using<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:09.360> fifth

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
for example we're actually using a fifth

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.840 
for example we're actually using a fifth
companion<00:03:10.770> course<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.310> mentioned<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.820> a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
companion course I mentioned this is a

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.850 
companion course I mentioned this is a
quad-core<00:03:12.150> tablet<00:03:12.570> but<00:03:13.350> does<00:03:13.500> actually<00:03:13.650> have

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
quad-core tablet but does actually have

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.500 
quad-core tablet but does actually have
a<00:03:13.920> fifth<00:03:14.250> Corps<00:03:14.610> on<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.030> what<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.270> cord

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
a fifth Corps on it and what that cord

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.110 
a fifth Corps on it and what that cord
does<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.989> obviously<00:03:16.860> uses<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.160> lot<00:03:17.280> less<00:03:17.340> by

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
does is obviously uses a lot less by

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.360 
does is obviously uses a lot less by
your<00:03:18.300> life<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:19.290> really<00:03:19.590> runs<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.950> desktop

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
your life and it really runs the desktop

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.800 
your life and it really runs the desktop
quite<00:03:20.700> smoothly<00:03:21.120> when<00:03:21.390> you're<00:03:21.510> not<00:03:21.600> using

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
quite smoothly when you're not using

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.140 
quite smoothly when you're not using
really<00:03:22.200> graphic<00:03:22.470> intensive<00:03:22.860> tasks<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.970> if<00:03:24.060> I

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
really graphic intensive tasks so if I

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.490 
really graphic intensive tasks so if I
load<00:03:24.360> up<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.540> game<00:03:24.750> obviously<00:03:25.050> it's<00:03:25.290> going<00:03:25.440> to

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
load up a game obviously it's going to

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.770 
load up a game obviously it's going to
switch<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:26.040> tag<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.250> four<00:03:26.610> or<00:03:27.480> check<00:03:27.690> your

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
switch to the tag of four or check your

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.420 
switch to the tag of four or check your
3<00:03:27.900> quad-core<00:03:28.170> processor<00:03:28.860> but<00:03:29.010> until<00:03:29.280> then

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
3 quad-core processor but until then

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.630 
3 quad-core processor but until then
it's<00:03:30.180> running<00:03:30.360> quite<00:03:30.750> nicely<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.650> that

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
it's running quite nicely on that

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.949 
it's running quite nicely on that
companion<00:03:33.060> court<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.450> because<00:03:33.630> that's<00:03:33.780> going

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
companion court and because that's going

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.780 
companion court and because that's going
to<00:03:34.050> get<00:03:34.110> around<00:03:34.290> 12<00:03:34.650> hours<00:03:35.100> of<00:03:35.130> battery<00:03:35.730> life

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
to get around 12 hours of battery life

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.970 
to get around 12 hours of battery life
on<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.180> tablet<00:03:36.420> now<00:03:37.410> something<00:03:37.620> else<00:03:37.769> nobody

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
on this tablet now something else nobody

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.530 
on this tablet now something else nobody
helps<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.370> buy<00:03:38.519> your<00:03:38.640> life<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.150> if<00:03:39.300> you<00:03:39.420> can

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
helps to buy your life to is if you can

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.810 
helps to buy your life to is if you can
turn<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.959> screen<00:03:40.230> brightness<00:03:40.410> down<00:03:40.830> so<00:03:41.459> right

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
turn the screen brightness down so right

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.340 
turn the screen brightness down so right
now<00:03:41.850> I've<00:03:42.060> got<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.750> know<00:03:42.840> obviously<00:03:43.019> a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
now I've got it you know obviously a

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.410 
now I've got it you know obviously a
little<00:03:43.769> bit<00:03:43.890> too<00:03:44.010> dark<00:03:44.250> for<00:03:44.310> for<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.150> setting

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
little bit too dark for for the setting

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.740 
little bit too dark for for the setting
we<00:03:45.540> have<00:03:45.660> now<00:03:45.840> but<00:03:46.080> if<00:03:46.200> it's<00:03:46.380> brighter<00:03:47.750> it's

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
we have now but if it's brighter it's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.449 
we have now but if it's brighter it's
going<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:48.930> be<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.080> lot<00:03:49.230> easier<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.680> use<00:03:49.830> outdoors

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
going to be a lot easier to use outdoors

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.670 
going to be a lot easier to use outdoors
so<00:03:51.239> this<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.510> really<00:03:51.690> bright<00:03:52.019> panel<00:03:52.470> and

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
so this is a really bright panel and

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.440 
so this is a really bright panel and
it's<00:03:52.920> an<00:03:53.040> IPS<00:03:53.489> display<00:03:53.820> which<00:03:54.000> means<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.299> if

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
it's an IPS display which means that if

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.530 
it's an IPS display which means that if
I<00:03:54.540> tilted<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.080> side<00:03:55.170> you<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.160> see<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.640> it

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
I tilted to the side you can see that it

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.960 
I tilted to the side you can see that it
actually<00:03:57.570> stays<00:03:58.110> quite<00:03:58.980> clear<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.400> can<00:03:59.730> see

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
actually stays quite clear you can see

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.650 
actually stays quite clear you can see
the<00:04:00.330> picture<00:04:01.160> really<00:04:02.160> nicely<00:04:02.340> even<00:04:03.269> though

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
the picture really nicely even though

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.030 
the picture really nicely even though
you're<00:04:04.500> viewing<00:04:04.799> from<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.310> really<00:04:05.640> steep<00:04:06.510> angle

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
you're viewing from a really steep angle

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.470 
you're viewing from a really steep angle
now<00:04:08.040> what's<00:04:08.700> really<00:04:08.940> cool<00:04:09.150> about<00:04:09.209> this

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
now what's really cool about this

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.330 
now what's really cool about this
display<00:04:09.810> is<00:04:09.840> actually<00:04:10.380> it's<00:04:10.650> not<00:04:10.799> just<00:04:10.950> an<00:04:11.040> IPS

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
display is actually it's not just an IPS

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.370 
display is actually it's not just an IPS
display<00:04:11.610> it's<00:04:11.790> actually<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.090> super<00:04:12.570> IPS<00:04:12.750> plus

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
display it's actually a super IPS plus

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.410 
display it's actually a super IPS plus
display<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:14.010> it's<00:04:14.760> really<00:04:14.910> hard<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.209> tell<00:04:15.390> on

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
display and it's really hard to tell on

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.520 
display and it's really hard to tell on
my<00:04:15.570> camera<00:04:15.810> because<00:04:16.049> it's<00:04:16.169> going<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.320> auto

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
my camera because it's going to auto

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.530 
my camera because it's going to auto
adjust<00:04:16.739> for<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.100> brightness<00:04:17.489> but<00:04:17.729> if<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.359> hit

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
adjust for the brightness but if I hit

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.719 
adjust for the brightness but if I hit
this<00:04:18.660> button<00:04:18.870> here<00:04:19.160> it's<00:04:20.160> actually<00:04:20.489> going<00:04:20.640> to

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
this button here it's actually going to

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.310 
this button here it's actually going to
increase<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.330> brightness<00:04:21.479> by<00:04:21.840> about<00:04:21.959> ten<00:04:22.200> or

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
increase the brightness by about ten or

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.200 
increase the brightness by about ten or
twenty<00:04:22.530> percent<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.070> that's<00:04:23.729> really<00:04:24.090> going

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
twenty percent and that's really going

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.370 
twenty percent and that's really going
to<00:04:24.270> help<00:04:24.330> for<00:04:24.810> outdoor

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380

so like I mentioned it's really hard to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.570 
so like I mentioned it's really hard to
tell<00:04:28.530> on<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.710> camera<00:04:29.010> because<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.310> camera<00:04:29.550> is

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
tell on the camera because the camera is

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.920 
tell on the camera because the camera is
going<00:04:29.640> to<00:04:29.790> auto<00:04:29.970> adjust<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.660> different

going to auto adjust to the different
brightness<00:04:31.260> but<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:31.890> a<00:04:31.920> really<00:04:32.190> handy

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
brightness but that is a really handy

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.360 
brightness but that is a really handy
button<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.530> really<00:04:34.530> helps<00:04:34.800> for<00:04:35.010> outdoor

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
button and really helps for outdoor

similar bathroom to what you had on the
transformer<00:05:53.430> itself<00:05:53.729> this<00:05:53.939> time<00:05:54.090> it's<00:05:54.270> more
