the the triggers left right up or
whatever<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.130> turn<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.880> phone<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.420> uses

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
whatever you turn the phone so it uses

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.650 
whatever you turn the phone so it uses
the<00:02:14.780> sensor<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.670> really<00:02:17.360> don't<00:02:17.510> like

the sensor and so I really don't like
that<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.930> tried<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:18.790> some<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:20.000> may<00:02:20.209> like
