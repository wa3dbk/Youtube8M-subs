00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.650 
and I think it's going to come out
pretty<00:00:26.650> good<00:00:27.099> there<00:00:27.490> was<00:00:27.640> no<00:00:27.939> crust<00:00:28.360> on<00:00:28.599> it

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
pretty good there was no crust on it

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.220 
pretty good there was no crust on it
from<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.200> gel<00:00:29.700> cuz<00:00:30.700> i<00:00:30.849> use<00:00:31.060> so<00:00:31.300> much<00:00:31.480> of<00:00:31.810> the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
from the gel cuz i use so much of the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.920 
from the gel cuz i use so much of the
unconditional<00:00:33.100> green<00:00:33.399> so<00:00:34.360> i<00:00:34.390> think<00:00:34.600> it's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
unconditional green so i think it's

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.460 
unconditional green so i think it's
going<00:00:35.079> to<00:00:35.170> turn<00:00:35.470> out<00:00:35.649> well<00:00:36.100> i<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:37.690> a<00:00:37.720> few<00:00:38.170> more

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.700 
it's a pretty good twist that and you're
not<00:03:41.920> a<00:03:41.980> story<00:03:42.490> it's<00:03:43.110> always<00:03:44.110> better<00:03:44.470> the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
not a story it's always better the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.300 
not a story it's always better the
second<00:03:45.310> day<00:03:45.490> right<00:03:46.090> there

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.320 

so<00:03:50.760> it's<00:03:50.970> better<00:03:51.209> just<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.660> we<00:03:51.810> think

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
so it's better just that we think

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.070 
so it's better just that we think
but<00:03:53.100> I'm<00:03:54.100> happy<00:03:54.400> with<00:03:54.670> this<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:56.610> think<00:03:57.610> is<00:03:57.850> that

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
but I'm happy with this I think is that

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.290 
but I'm happy with this I think is that
Oh<00:03:59.140> is<00:03:59.920> no<00:04:00.100> does<00:04:00.280> not<00:04:00.310> take
