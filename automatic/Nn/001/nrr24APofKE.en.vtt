they're kind of like um accident-prone

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.550

but<00:01:24.880> he's<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.270> point<00:01:25.509> now<00:01:25.749> where<00:01:25.779> he's

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
but he's to the point now where he's

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.949 
but he's to the point now where he's
writing<00:01:27.159> a<00:01:27.249> little<00:01:27.429> trike<00:01:27.759> and<00:01:28.240> he's<00:01:28.689> trying

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:28.959 
writing a little trike and he's trying

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:30.929 
writing a little trike and he's trying
out<00:01:29.139> the<00:01:29.289> scooter<00:01:29.709> and<00:01:29.979> he<00:01:30.369> just<00:01:30.579> needs<00:01:30.759> this

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
out the scooter and he just needs this

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.029 
out the scooter and he just needs this
so<00:01:31.179> this<00:01:31.329> was<00:01:31.509> only<00:01:31.600> five<00:01:31.990> dollars<00:01:32.439> and<00:01:32.709> I<00:01:32.889> had

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
so this was only five dollars and I had

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.709 
so this was only five dollars and I had
planned<00:01:33.340> on<00:01:33.490> putting<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:34.029> in<00:01:34.179> the<00:01:34.329> budget<00:01:34.509> for

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
planned on putting it in the budget for

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.569 
planned on putting it in the budget for
October<00:01:35.349> to<00:01:35.439> buy<00:01:35.590> him<00:01:35.799> a<00:01:35.829> helmet<00:01:36.159> at<00:01:36.249> Walmart

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
October to buy him a helmet at Walmart

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.339 
October to buy him a helmet at Walmart
so<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.270> like<00:01:37.509> less<00:01:37.810> than<00:01:37.959> half<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.319> price

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:38.349 
so this is like less than half the price

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:39.569 
so this is like less than half the price
of<00:01:38.560> what<00:01:38.859> I<00:01:38.889> was<00:01:39.039> going<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.189> have<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.369> pay<00:01:39.549> a

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
of what I was going to have to pay a
