 th size and not very old deck 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.950
 which I have here is a long time 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.410
 I do not remember what it's called because 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.340
 the packer was lost long ago but it 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.969
 also piatnik 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.920
 she they are completely plastic personal to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.899
 plastic cards are not exactly 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.059
 negative but not positive to me 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.420
 more like these cards where 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.800
 it is used exactly semi plastic 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.500
 technology that is with plastic 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.510
 coated but they're inside the paper there 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.359
 layered but and so on for extremely 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.049
 least exactly these cards see pay 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.060
 attention they are a little lost in color then 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.890
 have they started a little styling i'm not 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.530
 I know what it is and they started 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.960
 to the grid this is exactly what they are 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.110
 Matt in general, and they cost 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.729
 quite expensive remember crazy going 600 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.890
 rubles they were worth it was the bit 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.810
 like a madman well I will not criticize 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.310
 because probably I did not use 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.770
 just such good plastic 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.720
 cards in the comments write what you 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.210
 use plastic cards, they are there for you 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.670
 like exactly one hundred percent plastic 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.770
 let's look at exactly these cards 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.150
 not from plastic for example 5 stealth nickname 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.310
 I wrote in the comments that Fingers 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.360
 they are not as good as fighters 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.970
 compare them is useless but after a long 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.979
 operating friday express bridges go 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.220
 size I can say about them in 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.659
 In principle, their quality is very good. 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.890
 I have been using this deck already 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.010
 several months 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.460
 I do not remember exactly when I bought but they 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.460
 Good if you buy exactly 5 express 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.350
 worth 150 rubles you will not earn for 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.720
 beginners who can not for example 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.640
 do or for those whom small hand 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.350
 cannot do this example withdrawal 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.480
 deck of cards with one hand then these cards 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.440
 perfect quality is no worse 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.270
 buysell 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.860
 let's talk about glass for example 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.680
 given that viewing deck which I 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.190
 In general, for several years I studied everything on it 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.320
 basic tricks to do and see what she is 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.180
 already a bad box but it seems to be living 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.950
 this buy scala rider back 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.210
 See what they are all black steel 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.160
 the deck feels very good 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.610
 of course she is already dirty 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.210
 here look see how everything even in places 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:50.250
 but not wrinkled but but but she keeps 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.050
 blow just a bang like a deck of cards not 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.480
 don't even think completely out 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.420
 operation but over time pay 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.280
 attention with the time of the fan 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.950
 It will work out because the cards are together 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.580
 somehow already quietly fastened but 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.340
 if you buy a deck of cards buy scala 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.140
 rider back or standard get ready 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.239
 they will serve you there 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.239
 a very long time if you do not drop the toilet 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.810
 and so it is not by chance that you squeeze everything 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.060
 I advise 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.250
 from such acid pancake cards 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.380
 read the title to be honest i'm not 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.269
 I know how it is correctly read the name 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.300
 cards probably us in the comments to me 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.980
 I personally liked the fact that they are completely 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.860
 flooded then say this color in this 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.360
 case green and white such icons 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.370
 when I bought honestly did not know that 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.500
 it will be like that I will not know what they are 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.519
 will be completely flooded principle very 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.500
 pleased with the purchase 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.810
 only and no he does not know their fault I bought 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.739
 they ask me what is the difference between 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.950
 rider back 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.330
 and the standard I personally do not know me personally 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.340
 wrote comments what it is 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.930
 Basically the same thing, the same firm 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.450
 but something there is something wrong 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.890
 renamed so on difference 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.690
 absolutely no reason therefore 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.370
 bother about it buy 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.260
 what i have i have 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.100
 respectively, blue rider back too 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.550
 were bought along with red ancient 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.260
 but I kept them brand new 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.800
 feel the difference between new and 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.430
 old cards and i have 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.200

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.230
 working decks from when using these 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.520

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:35.280

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.380
 me just lie me often 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.570

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.520

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.890
 so much is enough for me and two 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.490
 deck breeches of tho and poker 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.830
 size 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.410
 I do not know why you have darkness, darkness theme 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.110
 the current deck of the principle of these to me is quite 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.090
 enough and I even almost never 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.830
 not used only if 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.310
 decorative purposes for beauty then 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.020
 say video i used these cards but 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.450
 that's all probably what can be said about 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.030
 I personally use these cards 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.120
