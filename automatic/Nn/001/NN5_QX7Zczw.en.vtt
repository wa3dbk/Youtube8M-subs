00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
gathering some cases and that's not a

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.970 
gathering some cases and that's not a
problem<00:02:30.150> but<00:02:30.420> as<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.350> probably<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.830> that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
problem but as you probably know that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.430

the<00:02:32.160> keys<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.940> open<00:02:32.970> them<00:02:33.270> cost<00:02:33.900> some<00:02:34.080> money<00:02:34.110> so

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
the keys to open them cost some money so

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.230 
the keys to open them cost some money so
I<00:02:34.650> don't<00:02:35.040> know<00:02:35.100> how<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.280> do<00:02:35.490> that<00:02:35.670> because<00:02:35.850> um

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
I don't know how to do that because um

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.590 
I don't know how to do that because um
just<00:02:36.960> recently<00:02:37.290> got<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.800> 780<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:39.090> kind

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
just recently got the 780 I and I kind

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.330 
just recently got the 780 I and I kind
of<00:02:39.630> ordered<00:02:39.840> but<00:02:40.260> there<00:02:40.590> might<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.040> an<00:02:41.250> issue

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
of ordered but there might be an issue

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.070 
of ordered but there might be an issue
with<00:02:41.670> with<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.120> order<00:02:42.390> or<00:02:42.570> something<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.050> I

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
with with the order or something so I

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.110 
with with the order or something so I
have<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.320> look<00:02:43.440> into<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.680> because<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.280> just

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
have to look into that because it just

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.290 
have to look into that because it just
keeps<00:02:45.390> getting<00:02:45.660> delayed<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.170> yeah<00:02:46.740> and

keeps getting delayed and yeah and
besides<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:49.200> main<00:02:49.470> reason<00:02:49.500> why<00:02:49.890> i<00:02:49.920> have

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
besides that the main reason why i have

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.430 
besides that the main reason why i have
