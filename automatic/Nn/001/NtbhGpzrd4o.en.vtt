00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
looking at not this year there's going

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.309 
looking at not this year there's going
to<00:03:33.670> be<00:03:33.730> some<00:03:33.939> growing<00:03:34.180> pains<00:03:34.359> but<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.049> next

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
to be some growing pains but the next

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.470 
to be some growing pains but the next
year<00:03:35.590> with<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.069> way<00:03:36.189> the<00:03:36.310> sec<00:03:36.790> east<00:03:36.819> is<00:03:37.269> right

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
year with the way the sec east is right

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.629 
year with the way the sec east is right
now<00:03:37.689> it's<00:03:38.349> wide<00:03:38.680> open<00:03:38.709> i<00:03:39.099> can't<00:03:39.519> really

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
now it's wide open i can't really

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.039 
now it's wide open i can't really
necessarily<00:03:40.120> say<00:03:40.329> that<00:03:40.510> about<00:03:40.599> the<00:03:40.719> west

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
necessarily say that about the west

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.929 
necessarily say that about the west
because<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.950> talent<00:03:42.280> level<00:03:42.310> i<00:03:42.639> think<00:03:42.849> is

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
because the talent level i think is

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.610 
because the talent level i think is
still<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.209> little<00:03:43.329> bit<00:03:43.510> stronger<00:03:43.749> but<00:03:44.139> with

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
still a little bit stronger but with

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.110 
still a little bit stronger but with

mcilwain coming in with Butch Jones

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.289 
mcilwain coming in with Butch Jones
added<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.079> Tennessee<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.889> think<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.700> SEC<00:03:49.269> East

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
added to Tennessee I think the SEC East

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.439 
added to Tennessee I think the SEC East
is<00:03:49.750> is<00:03:50.079> it<00:03:50.680> ready<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:51.040> war<00:03:51.310> once<00:03:51.609> again<00:03:51.879> well<00:03:52.389> it
