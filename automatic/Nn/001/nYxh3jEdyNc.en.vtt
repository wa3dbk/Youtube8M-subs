what<00:00:10.260> would<00:00:10.680> the<00:00:11.010> fastest<00:00:11.460> player<00:00:11.700> on<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.090> ice

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
what would the fastest player on the ice

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.510 
what would the fastest player on the ice
be<00:00:12.540> wearing<00:00:12.900> if<00:00:13.080> he<00:00:13.200> had<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.380> wear<00:00:13.530> CCM<00:00:14.250> skate

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520 
be wearing if he had to wear CCM skate

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.220 
be wearing if he had to wear CCM skate
and<00:00:14.789> that's<00:00:14.940> how<00:00:15.090> we<00:00:15.150> designed<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.840> CCM

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
and that's how we designed the CCM

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.640 
and that's how we designed the CCM

what<00:00:16.830> we've<00:00:16.980> discovered<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:18.060> truly

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
what we've discovered is that a truly

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.050 
what we've discovered is that a truly
perfect<00:00:19.170> fitting<00:00:19.650> skate<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.190> really<00:00:20.910> what

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
perfect fitting skate is really what

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.300 
perfect fitting skate is really what
allows<00:00:21.240> players<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.810> attain<00:00:22.500> maximum

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
allows players to attain maximum

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.490 
allows players to attain maximum
performance<00:00:23.429> maximum<00:00:24.269> speed<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.380> was

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
performance maximum speed and that was

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.439 
performance maximum speed and that was
our<00:00:25.589> quest<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.189> building<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> CCM<00:00:27.000> jetspeed

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.140 

we<00:00:30.449> had<00:00:30.779> an<00:00:30.990> objective<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.710> picking<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.490> skate

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
we had an objective of picking a skate

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.540 
we had an objective of picking a skate
and<00:00:33.300> picking<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> specifications<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.220> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and picking the specifications that the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.310 
and picking the specifications that the
most<00:00:35.730> elite<00:00:36.120> players<00:00:36.450> would<00:00:36.750> want<00:00:36.990> from<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
most elite players would want from a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.900 
most elite players would want from a
hockey<00:00:37.470> skate<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.220> what<00:00:38.400> we're<00:00:38.520> talking<00:00:38.640> about

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
hockey skate so what we're talking about

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.910 
hockey skate so what we're talking about
is<00:00:39.150> those<00:00:39.480> players<00:00:39.810> that<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.380> been<00:00:40.410> wanting

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
is those players that have been wanting

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.060 
is those players that have been wanting
CCM<00:00:41.400> to<00:00:41.670> develop<00:00:42.060> a<00:00:42.120> skate<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.570> close

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
CCM to develop a skate that's close

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.190 
CCM to develop a skate that's close
contoured<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.280> ergonomic<00:00:45.240> with<00:00:45.720> all<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
contoured and ergonomic with all the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
contoured and ergonomic with all the
right<00:00:46.350> curves<00:00:46.710> around<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.520> foot<00:00:47.730> area<00:00:47.880> so

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
right curves around the the foot area so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.940 
right curves around the the foot area so
that<00:00:48.210> every<00:00:48.780> inch<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> foot<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.530> basically

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that every inch of the foot is basically

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.320 
that every inch of the foot is basically
touched<00:00:50.310> by<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.580> skate<00:00:50.880> so<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.180> there's

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
touched by the skate so that there's

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.390 
touched by the skate so that there's
absolutely<00:00:51.570> no<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.470> room<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.130> foot<00:00:53.370> is

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
absolutely no way the room the foot is

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.700 
absolutely no way the room the foot is
locked<00:00:53.880> and<00:00:54.060> loaded<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.260> player<00:00:55.440> feels

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
locked and loaded and the player feels

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
locked and loaded and the player feels
like<00:00:55.860> they're<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.070> fast<00:00:56.310> as<00:00:56.460> they<00:00:56.580> can

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
like they're as fast as they can

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.630 
like they're as fast as they can
possibly<00:00:56.880> be

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.280 
cram technology that is a brand new way
for<00:01:08.010> us<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.550> build<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> scape<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.570> allows<00:01:10.260> us

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
for us to build the scape and allows us

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.960 
for us to build the scape and allows us
to<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:10.710> get<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.310> shape<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.670> we've

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
to really get at that shape that we've

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.700 
to really get at that shape that we've
never<00:01:12.090> had<00:01:12.330> before<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.780> any<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.080> our<00:01:13.170> skates<00:01:13.500> so

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
never had before in any of our skates so

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.650 
never had before in any of our skates so
we<00:01:14.070> took<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.550> that<00:01:15.030> knowledge<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.570> we

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
we took all of that knowledge that we

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.090 
we took all of that knowledge that we
obtained<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.170> our<00:01:16.290> third-party<00:01:16.830> partners

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
obtained from our third-party partners

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.740 
obtained from our third-party partners
and<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.760> research<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.210> conducted<00:01:18.660> ourselves

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and the research we conducted ourselves

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.260 
and the research we conducted ourselves
as<00:01:19.229> well<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> feedback<00:01:20.280> from<00:01:20.550> all<00:01:20.940> types

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
as well as the feedback from all types

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.850 
as well as the feedback from all types
of<00:01:21.360> different<00:01:21.479> levels<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.990> players<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.440> that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
of different levels of players and that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.990 
of different levels of players and that
allowed<00:01:23.130> us<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.880> an

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
allowed us to really get an

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000 
allowed us to really get an
understanding<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.900> how<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.200> foot<00:01:25.530> works<00:01:25.740> its
