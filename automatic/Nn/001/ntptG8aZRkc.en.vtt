00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
on Craigslist a while back when I got it

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.700 
on Craigslist a while back when I got it
one<00:00:22.990> of<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.140> wheels<00:00:23.320> was<00:00:23.680> damaged<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:26.320> instead

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
one of the wheels was damaged so instead

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.410 
one of the wheels was damaged so instead
of<00:00:26.770> buying<00:00:26.980> stock<00:00:27.520> wheels<00:00:27.789> I<00:00:28.060> went<00:00:28.210> ahead<00:00:28.270> and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
of buying stock wheels I went ahead and

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:35.490 
of buying stock wheels I went ahead and
bought<00:00:29.610> some<00:00:30.610> roving<00:00:30.930> wheels<00:00:33.989> off<00:00:34.989> one<00:00:35.289> of<00:00:35.320> the

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
bought some roving wheels off one of the

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.330 
bought some roving wheels off one of the
short<00:00:35.770> course<00:00:35.980> trucks<00:00:37.800> when<00:00:38.800> I<00:00:38.829> got<00:00:39.130> the

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
short course trucks when I got the

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.250 
short course trucks when I got the
wheels<00:00:39.550> I<00:00:40.530> noticed<00:00:41.530> that<00:00:42.270> my<00:00:43.270> hex<00:00:43.570> adapters

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
wheels I noticed that my hex adapters

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.350 
wheels I noticed that my hex adapters
aren't<00:00:44.739> long<00:00:45.010> enough<00:00:45.040> to<00:00:45.820> go<00:00:45.970> all<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.329> way

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
aren't long enough to go all the way

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.880 
aren't long enough to go all the way
through<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.780> wheel<00:00:47.220> so<00:00:48.220> my<00:00:49.149> hexes<00:00:49.570> don't

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
through the wheel so my hexes don't

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.880 
through the wheel so my hexes don't
screw<00:00:50.890> on<00:00:51.070> as<00:00:51.250> much<00:00:51.489> as<00:00:51.700> I'd<00:00:51.850> like<00:00:52.059> them<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
screw on as much as I'd like them to you

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.950 
screw on as much as I'd like them to you
might<00:00:54.070> check<00:00:54.430> you<00:00:54.760> know<00:00:54.880> make<00:00:55.360> sure<00:00:55.540> that<00:00:55.780> you

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
might check you know make sure that you

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.130 
might check you know make sure that you
have<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.559> longer<00:00:57.120> hex<00:00:58.120> adaptor<00:00:58.660> if<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:58.899> plan<00:00:59.110> on

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
have a longer hex adaptor if you plan on

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.479 
have a longer hex adaptor if you plan on
using<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.860> rent<00:01:00.190> roving<00:01:00.850> wheel<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:03.100> center

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
using the rent roving wheel the center

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.219 
using the rent roving wheel the center
section<00:01:04.269> because<00:01:04.899> it<00:01:05.049> has<00:01:05.170> that<00:01:05.379> metal

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
section because it has that metal

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.169 
section because it has that metal
reinforcing<00:01:08.229> plate<00:01:08.619> seems<00:01:09.609> to<00:01:09.789> be<00:01:09.909> much

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
reinforcing plate seems to be much

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:14.480 
reinforcing plate seems to be much
thicker<00:01:10.539> than<00:01:10.689> like<00:01:11.319> the<00:01:11.499> stock<00:01:11.709> HDI<00:01:12.189> wheel

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
thicker than like the stock HDI wheel

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.419 
thicker than like the stock HDI wheel
that<00:01:15.490> being<00:01:15.819> said<00:01:16.179> this<00:01:16.929> is<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.709> stock<00:01:18.130> wheel

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
that being said this is the stock wheel

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:22.469 
that being said this is the stock wheel
that<00:01:18.670> came<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.270> car<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.880> can<00:01:22.060> see<00:01:22.090> that

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
that came on the car you can see that

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.230 
that came on the car you can see that
there's<00:01:22.749> a<00:01:22.840> dramatic<00:01:23.590> difference<00:01:23.829> in<00:01:24.279> wheel

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
there's a dramatic difference in wheel

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.539 
there's a dramatic difference in wheel
size<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:26.009> much<00:01:27.009> prefer<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.759> larger<00:01:27.909> wheel

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.169 

inside<00:01:34.560> well<00:01:35.560> as<00:01:36.039> I<00:01:36.310> said<00:01:36.520> when<00:01:36.670> I<00:01:36.759> got<00:01:36.909> this

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
inside well as I said when I got this

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:44.669 
inside well as I said when I got this
buggy<00:01:37.599> I<00:01:39.299> bought<00:01:40.299> it<00:01:40.420> off<00:01:40.509> Craigslist<00:01:40.840> used<00:01:43.679> it

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
buggy I bought it off Craigslist used it

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.419 
buggy I bought it off Craigslist used it
had<00:01:44.889> a<00:01:44.920> stock<00:01:45.279> motor<00:01:45.520> stock<00:01:46.270> esc<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:48.189> stock

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
had a stock motor stock esc the stock

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.639 
had a stock motor stock esc the stock
motor<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:48.969> like<00:01:49.179> nine<00:01:50.549> 980<00:01:51.549> kv<00:01:52.119> i<00:01:52.389> believe<00:01:53.229> and

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
motor is like nine 980 kv i believe and

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.859 
motor is like nine 980 kv i believe and
it<00:01:54.429> has<00:01:54.579> this<00:01:54.849> weird<00:01:55.479> esc<00:01:56.439> with<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.799> step<00:01:57.340> in<00:01:58.179> the

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
it has this weird esc with a step in the

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.589 
it has this weird esc with a step in the
throttle<00:01:59.229> curve<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.909> can<00:02:01.060> run<00:02:01.239> it<00:02:01.329> up<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.569> a

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
throttle curve you can run it up to a

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.379 
throttle curve you can run it up to a
certain<00:02:01.989> rpm<00:02:02.169> and<00:02:02.799> then<00:02:03.069> you<00:02:03.909> pull<00:02:04.149> a<00:02:04.179> little

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:04.389 
certain rpm and then you pull a little

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:08.040 
certain rpm and then you pull a little
harder<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.020> it<00:02:05.229> just<00:02:05.609> it<00:02:06.609> throws<00:02:06.999> a<00:02:07.299> lot<00:02:07.989> more

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
harder and it just it throws a lot more

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.240 
harder and it just it throws a lot more
voltage<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.190> motor<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.560> it's<00:02:12.040> not

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
voltage to the motor and so it's not

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.710 
voltage to the motor and so it's not
like<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.610> linear<00:02:14.820> control<00:02:15.820> there's<00:02:16.120> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
like a linear control there's the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.080 
like a linear control there's the
we'd<00:02:16.870> step<00:02:17.320> in<00:02:17.560> there<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:20.700> got<00:02:21.700> annoyed

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
we'd step in there so I got annoyed

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.850 
we'd step in there so I got annoyed
really<00:02:22.540> fast<00:02:23.050> with<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.560> step<00:02:23.830> power<00:02:24.700> ESC<00:02:25.860> so

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
really fast with that step power ESC so

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.060 
really fast with that step power ESC so
I<00:02:26.920> pulled<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.310> ESC<00:02:27.850> out<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.920> went<00:02:29.920> with<00:02:30.040> a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
I pulled that ESC out and I went with a

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.690 
I pulled that ESC out and I went with a
castle<00:02:30.910> Mamba<00:02:31.510> monster<00:02:32.020> ESC<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:35.340> then<00:02:36.340> it

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
castle Mamba monster ESC and then it

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.640 
castle Mamba monster ESC and then it
just<00:02:37.530> when<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.980> had<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.340> out<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:41.260> know<00:02:41.350> pull

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
just when I had it out to you know pull

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.650 
just when I had it out to you know pull
the<00:02:41.800> ESC<00:02:42.400> out<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.610> went<00:02:42.910> ahead<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.120> pulled<00:02:43.420> them

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
the ESC out I went ahead and pulled them

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.680 
the ESC out I went ahead and pulled them
the<00:02:44.530> motor<00:02:44.770> out<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.760> got<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> motor<00:02:46.390> mount

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
the motor out and I got a motor mount

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.940 
the motor out and I got a motor mount
from<00:02:47.050> Kershaw<00:02:47.380> designs<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.660> went<00:02:50.620> ahead<00:02:50.680> and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
from Kershaw designs so I went ahead and

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.130 
from Kershaw designs so I went ahead and
got<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:52.050> 1717<00:02:53.050> castle<00:02:53.620> motor<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:58.020> give<00:02:59.020> it<00:02:59.080> a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
got a 1717 castle motor to give it a

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.320 
got a 1717 castle motor to give it a
little<00:02:59.260> more<00:02:59.440> power

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
little more power

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.670 
little more power
the<00:03:01.620> 17:17<00:03:02.620> council<00:03:03.100> butter<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:04.170> 1680<00:03:05.170> kV

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
the 17:17 council butter is 1680 kV

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.530 
the 17:17 council butter is 1680 kV
motor<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:07.000> I've<00:03:07.180> almost<00:03:07.390> doubled<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.440> kV

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
motor so I've almost doubled the kV

step up and run eight cells in it but

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.960 
step up and run eight cells in it but
it's<00:03:43.180> pretty<00:03:43.450> fast<00:03:43.840> at<00:03:44.170> six<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:45.280> have<00:03:45.790> some

well<00:06:08.330> as<00:06:08.539> you<00:06:09.050> know<00:06:09.139> 1/8<00:06:09.469> scale<00:06:09.650> on<00:06:10.210> 6s<00:06:12.159> that's

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159 
well as you know 1/8 scale on 6s that's

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:15.459 
well as you know 1/8 scale on 6s that's
this<00:06:13.880> one<00:06:14.090> of<00:06:14.180> the<00:06:14.240> main<00:06:14.419> reasons<00:06:15.139> I<00:06:15.289> haven't

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:15.469 
this one of the main reasons I haven't

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.540 
this one of the main reasons I haven't
stepped<00:06:15.860> up<00:06:16.130> to<00:06:16.310> hate<00:06:16.490> us<00:06:16.669> yet<00:06:16.940> um<00:06:18.219> it's<00:06:19.219> really

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
stepped up to hate us yet um it's really

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:26.550 
stepped up to hate us yet um it's really
fast<00:06:20.029> at<00:06:20.360> 6<00:06:22.300> maybe<00:06:23.300> once<00:06:23.630> I<00:06:23.779> get<00:06:23.960> used<00:06:24.139> to<00:06:24.349> it<00:06:24.520> I

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
fast at 6 maybe once I get used to it I

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.510 
fast at 6 maybe once I get used to it I
think<00:06:27.560> I'm<00:06:27.680> gonna<00:06:27.770> put<00:06:27.979> a<00:06:28.039> more<00:06:28.310> powerful

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
think I'm gonna put a more powerful

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.629 
think I'm gonna put a more powerful
servo<00:06:29.210> in<00:06:29.389> it<00:06:29.539> get<00:06:30.110> something<00:06:30.529> that<00:06:30.710> turns

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
servo in it get something that turns

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.850 
servo in it get something that turns
these<00:06:31.819> wheels<00:06:32.060> a<00:06:32.240> little<00:06:32.270> better<00:06:33.069> and<00:06:34.569> I

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
these wheels a little better and I

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.189 
these wheels a little better and I
really<00:06:36.860> haven't<00:06:37.070> decided<00:06:37.550> on<00:06:37.820> where<00:06:38.120> the<00:06:38.599> ESC

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 
really haven't decided on where the ESC

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.129 
really haven't decided on where the ESC
mounts

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
mounts

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.520 
mounts
there's<00:06:41.099> really<00:06:41.430> not<00:06:41.759> a<00:06:41.819> good<00:06:42.180> spot<00:06:42.599> yet<00:06:42.960> so<00:06:43.500> I

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
there's really not a good spot yet so I

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.059 
there's really not a good spot yet so I
might<00:06:43.800> have<00:06:43.830> to<00:06:43.979> custom<00:06:44.550> build<00:06:45.830> some<00:06:46.830> kind<00:06:46.979> of

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:47.069 
might have to custom build some kind of

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:50.059 
might have to custom build some kind of
a<00:06:47.190> mounting<00:06:47.639> system<00:06:48.060> for<00:06:48.090> an<00:06:48.539> ESC<00:06:48.840> I<00:06:49.289> don't

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:50.069 
a mounting system for an ESC I don't

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:51.939 
a mounting system for an ESC I don't
like<00:06:50.220> the<00:06:50.370> ESC<00:06:50.729> being<00:06:50.970> this<00:06:51.180> eye<00:06:51.360> in<00:06:51.509> the<00:06:51.629> air

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:51.949 
like the ESC being this eye in the air

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.790 
like the ESC being this eye in the air
it's<00:06:52.949> a<00:06:53.069> temporary<00:06:53.520> thing<00:06:53.940> right<00:06:54.569> now<00:06:54.750> until<00:06:55.590> I

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
it's a temporary thing right now until I

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.279 
it's a temporary thing right now until I
can<00:06:56.129> figure<00:06:56.400> out<00:06:56.639> a<00:06:56.669> more<00:06:59.810> effective<00:07:00.810> place<00:07:01.020> to

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.289 
can figure out a more effective place to

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:04.629 
can figure out a more effective place to
put<00:07:01.650> the<00:07:01.740> ESD

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.990 

that<00:07:05.639> stays<00:07:06.389> out<00:07:06.629> of<00:07:06.810> the<00:07:06.870> way<00:07:07.020> and<00:07:07.349> is<00:07:08.280> more

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
that stays out of the way and is more

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.709
