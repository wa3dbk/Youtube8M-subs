00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.269
 ie ii 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.920
 hey guys going okay voice still 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.600
 another podium of the master 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:19.260
 I hope you enjoy it this time I will 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:23.279
 spend a price here is in itself 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.289
 ammonia is by picking up and off 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.099
 combining the two techniques ne 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.739
 and at the time of let's say do the look 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.270
 the beginning of the sentence is to have a 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.070
 sequence of two notes per snake that I 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.440
 I always find it a little difficult to always 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.130
 I found the least new proposal 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 to try harder is you have 64 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.660
 we are on the same rope the palette goes more 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.070
 easy now with a dozen always one 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.780
 bit more complicated I did it 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.680
 precisely to train this deficiency 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.210
 is the expert that many people have the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.980
 The choice of new ones is a bit 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.680
 It is atypical if you think about our 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.910
 most used when placing smaller 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.280
 monica nÃ© 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.600
 I know it looks like a fourth house and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.559
 power 4 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.559
 The combination is this one. 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.560
 with 1 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.950
 i 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.950
 Hmm 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.020
 So far it's no problem we 're 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.280
 using the same pattern in all 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.170
 decorum changes 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.700
 he only knows how new to play are these 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.700
 teams arriving spanish 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.780
 It's just that the norm is not a 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.340
 that applied four until the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.390
 here in our class 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.390
 Actually, this party 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.500
 Hmm 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.479
 is what counts is what is also another 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.300
 thing is a team where you 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.380
 will wonder if in China then 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.380
 think this year 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.909
 this is the wine bug the wine 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:40.190
 show dollar the fire of the sea and speak only 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:44.120
 here live at the 7th to 4 in the seventh string 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.459
 it's a decision and I did that other part 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.950
 come back to have that decide 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.530
 It's definitely simple to stop the work. 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.239
 going out cup measures makes several countries 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.709
 what do you charge while here 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.709
 review defeat 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.319
 uai
