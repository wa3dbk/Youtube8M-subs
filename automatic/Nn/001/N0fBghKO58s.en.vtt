is like if you want to do online school

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.470 
is like if you want to do online school
say<00:03:40.109> why<00:03:40.380> not<00:03:40.410> because<00:03:41.190> I'm<00:03:42.060> doing<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:42.359> right

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
say why not because I'm doing it right

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.210 
say why not because I'm doing it right
now<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.810> then<00:03:42.900> stop<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.260> bad<00:03:43.440> is<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.799> harder

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
now and then stop that bad is it harder

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.610 
now and then stop that bad is it harder
or<00:03:44.250> easier<00:03:44.519> than<00:03:44.940> um<00:03:45.239> regular<00:03:45.660> school<00:03:45.870> well<00:03:46.230> it

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
or easier than um regular school well it

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.229 
or easier than um regular school well it
really<00:03:46.769> depends<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.700> I'm<00:03:47.910> pretty

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
really depends like I'm pretty

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.030 
really depends like I'm pretty
independent<00:03:48.959> on<00:03:49.140> my<00:03:49.320> schoolwork

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
independent on my schoolwork

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.580 
independent on my schoolwork
so<00:03:50.220> it's<00:03:50.579> hard<00:03:50.850> as<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.359> like<00:03:52.109> would<00:03:52.320> for

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
so it's hard as it like would for

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.650 
so it's hard as it like would for
