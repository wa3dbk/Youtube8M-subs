we were on our way to form baboons when

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.720 
we were on our way to form baboons when
the<00:02:10.470> road<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.800> were<00:02:10.890> traveling<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.460> was

the road we were traveling on was
blocked<00:02:12.090> by<00:02:12.300> these<00:02:12.360> two<00:02:12.780> male<00:02:13.140> African

buffaloes<00:02:17.209> now<00:02:18.209> they<00:02:18.360> seem<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.630> be<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> bit<00:02:19.020> of

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
buffaloes now they seem to be a bit of

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.190 
buffaloes now they seem to be a bit of
competitive<00:02:20.160> behavior<00:02:20.370> taking<00:02:21.060> place<00:02:21.300> here

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.199 

it<00:02:25.200> seems<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.709> these<00:02:25.950> two<00:02:26.280> were<00:02:26.790> not<00:02:27.000> being

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
it seems that these two were not being

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.570 
it seems that these two were not being
particularly<00:02:27.720> aggressive<00:02:28.190> but<00:02:29.190> one<00:02:29.400> was

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
particularly aggressive but one was

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:38.510 
particularly aggressive but one was
definitely<00:02:29.790> given<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.330> other<00:02:30.450> one<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.780> chase

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.360 

I<00:02:39.080> could<00:02:40.080> see<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.470> these<00:02:40.680> were<00:02:40.860> two<00:02:41.130> mature

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
I could see that these were two mature

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.910 
I could see that these were two mature
males<00:02:41.840> because<00:02:42.840> their<00:02:42.990> horns<00:02:43.320> were<00:02:43.440> massive

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
males because their horns were massive

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.810 
males because their horns were massive
and<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:45.540> central<00:02:46.410> horn<00:02:46.620> base<00:02:46.890> or<00:02:47.160> bosses<00:02:47.460> is

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
and the central horn base or bosses is

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
was very distinct the horns were also

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.830 
was very distinct the horns were also
quite<00:02:52.260> rigid<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:52.830> textured<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.840> indication

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
quite rigid and textured and indication

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:05.390 
quite rigid and textured and indication
of<00:02:54.960> age<00:03:03.140> they<00:03:04.140> seem<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.740> similar<00:03:04.980> size

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
of age they seem to be of similar size

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.700 
of age they seem to be of similar size
but<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.360> take<00:03:06.630> for<00:03:06.810> granted<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.410> one<00:03:07.560> was

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
but I take for granted that the one was

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.360 
but I take for granted that the one was
a<00:03:07.740> bit<00:03:07.950> older<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.610> as<00:03:09.330> happens<00:03:09.600> in<00:03:09.870> nature<00:03:10.370> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
a bit older and as happens in nature the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.490 
a bit older and as happens in nature the
older<00:03:11.790> has<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.450> make<00:03:12.600> way<00:03:12.810> for<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.110> younger

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
older has to make way for the younger

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.340 
older has to make way for the younger
and<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.880> dominance<00:03:15.330> hierarchy<00:03:15.990> will<00:03:16.200> be

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.550 

they<00:03:32.340> were<00:03:32.460> up<00:03:32.580> on<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.850> summit<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:34.440> is

they were up on the summit and this is
quite<00:03:34.740> typical<00:03:34.920> for<00:03:35.250> baboons<00:03:35.760> because<00:03:36.300> they

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
quite typical for baboons because they

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.230 
quite typical for baboons because they
largely<00:03:36.930> diurnal<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.650> there<00:03:38.460> will<00:03:38.640> be<00:03:38.670> up<00:03:39.030> on

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.860 
the top of trees which would be these
places<00:03:43.740> of<00:03:43.920> safety<00:03:44.400> for<00:03:45.000> resting<00:03:45.390> up<00:03:45.510> over<00:03:45.780> the

places of safety for resting up over the
evening

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.260 

it<00:03:53.530> seems<00:03:53.830> at<00:03:54.010> some<00:03:54.250> stages<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:54.970> message

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
it seems at some stages that the message

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.940 
it seems at some stages that the message
got<00:03:55.510> out<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:55.900> was<00:03:56.050> time<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.440> move<00:03:56.590> down

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
got out that was time to move down

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.550 
got out that was time to move down
probably<00:03:57.850> just<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.270> find<00:03:58.510> water<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:58.930> as<00:03:59.350> well

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
probably just to find water and as well

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.820 
probably just to find water and as well
as<00:03:59.680> to<00:03:59.860> forage<00:04:00.130> for<00:04:00.310> food<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:01.380> they<00:04:02.380> started

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
as to forage for food and they started

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.350 
as to forage for food and they started
their<00:04:02.950> process<00:04:03.460> down<00:04:03.640> this<00:04:03.910> huge

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
their process down this huge

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:27.420 
their process down this huge
mountainside<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:26.050> think<00:04:26.740> it's<00:04:26.860> especially<00:04:27.070> the

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
mountainside I think it's especially the

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:40.050 
mountainside I think it's especially the
youngsters<00:04:27.970> that<00:04:28.210> had<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.690> lot<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:28.930> fun<00:04:29.200> with<00:04:29.320> us

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.129 

and<00:04:41.060> it<00:04:41.180> seems<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.450> be<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.600> bit<00:04:41.750> of<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.900> game<00:04:42.110> for

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
and it seems to be a bit of a game for

00:04:42.139 --> 00:05:00.820 
and it seems to be a bit of a game for
all<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.560> them<00:04:42.710> in<00:04:42.860> fact<00:04:59.260> when<00:05:00.260> they<00:05:00.410> reach<00:05:00.620> the

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
all of them in fact when they reach the

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.920 
all of them in fact when they reach the
valley<00:05:01.040> floor<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:01.730> picked<00:05:02.120> up<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.389> little<00:05:02.570> group

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
valley floor I picked up a little group

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.310 
valley floor I picked up a little group
playing<00:05:03.440> in<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.800> kippah<00:05:04.100> psaltery<00:05:04.520> I<00:05:05.290> seem<00:05:06.290> to

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
playing in a kippah psaltery I seem to

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.530 
playing in a kippah psaltery I seem to
be<00:05:06.410> having<00:05:06.560> a<00:05:06.740> bit<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:06.889> fun<00:05:06.980> as<00:05:07.430> well<00:05:08.389> as

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
be having a bit of fun as well as

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:16.210 
be having a bit of fun as well as
probably<00:05:08.780> foraging<00:05:09.410> for<00:05:09.440> food<00:05:09.650> I<00:05:15.100> heard<00:05:16.100> an

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
probably foraging for food I heard an

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.970 
probably foraging for food I heard an
alarm<00:05:16.520> call<00:05:16.790> for<00:05:17.030> one<00:05:17.180> of<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.360> baboons<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:18.410> we

disappeared<00:05:24.169> into<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.530> undergrowth<00:05:25.010> and<00:05:25.280> we

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
disappeared into the undergrowth and we

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:41.620 
disappeared into the undergrowth and we
didn't<00:05:26.060> see<00:05:26.180> too<00:05:26.330> much<00:05:26.450> of<00:05:26.510> them<00:05:26.720> after<00:05:26.960> that
