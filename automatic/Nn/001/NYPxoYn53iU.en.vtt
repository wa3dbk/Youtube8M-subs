 today on the subject chronos contest but that 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.050
 would certainly be wrong today on the subject 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.640
 Last and already minecraft 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.530

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.550
 has gone 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.650

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.530

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:47.230

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.840
 declaration like that now it works 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.840
 It would be best to do it all again 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.219
 I do not say now is 17 in follow 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.050

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.570
 candidates much more than me 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.539
 but would have expected the again 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.220
 they do not follow you so well 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.810
 are or no idea where he says or 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.160

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.259
 I watched with I do not know 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.049
 What has happened is people needing this 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.830
 follow again how to follow 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.030
 I come I mean could now 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.320
 theoretically in the video description 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.310

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.909

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.170

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.700
 That's why I just want to say go 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.530
 just look at my channel 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.360
 they are all marked uniformly 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.350
 These follow through a unified 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.110
 Sewing stand for black and white stuff there 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.840
