plays a big part of this video but that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.430 
plays a big part of this video but that
is<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:34.020> whole<00:00:34.320> car<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.030> whole<00:00:36.420> how<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> get

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
is the whole car as a whole how to get

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.160 
is the whole car as a whole how to get
the<00:00:37.530> most<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.190> let's<00:00:39.030> go<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> first

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the most out of it let's go to the first

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.819 
the most out of it let's go to the first
first<00:00:40.739> point<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.309> out<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.450> many<00:00:42.780> people<00:00:43.110> do

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
first point is out that many people do

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.850 
first point is out that many people do
this<00:00:44.039> I've<00:00:44.820> done<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.719> I've<00:00:46.170> regretted<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
this I've done it and I've regretted it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.079 
this I've done it and I've regretted it
so<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.190> don't<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.670> anymore

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
so I don't do it anymore

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.819 
so I don't do it anymore
the<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:48.989> thing<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.440> when<00:00:50.339> you<00:00:50.489> need<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> part

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
the first thing is when you need a part

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.299 
the first thing is when you need a part
buy<00:00:52.829> it

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
buy it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.229 
buy it
do<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.179> make<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.769> other<00:00:55.980> parts<00:00:56.429> in<00:00:57.059> other

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
do not make do with other parts in other

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.719 
do not make do with other parts in other
words<00:00:57.800> if<00:00:58.850> your<00:00:59.850> engine<00:01:00.659> screws<00:01:01.350> go<00:01:01.679> do<00:01:02.550> not

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
words if your engine screws go do not

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.549 
words if your engine screws go do not
use<00:01:02.969> any<00:01:03.420> other<00:01:03.690> screw

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
use any other screw

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.460 
use any other screw
apart<00:01:05.220> from<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.090> engine<00:01:06.510> screws<00:01:06.930> because

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
apart from the engine screws because

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.490 
apart from the engine screws because
that<00:01:07.830> causes<00:01:08.460> more<00:01:09.210> troubles<00:01:09.690> that<00:01:09.870> is<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
that causes more troubles that is just a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.710 
that causes more troubles that is just a
random<00:01:10.830> example<00:01:11.370> but<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.790> should<00:01:12.060> always<00:01:12.270> buy

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
random example but you should always buy

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440 
random example but you should always buy
the<00:01:13.380> proper<00:01:13.890> parts<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:14.729> they<00:01:14.940> are<00:01:15.000> needed

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the proper parts when they are needed

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.410 
the proper parts when they are needed
because<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.530> only<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.890> when<00:01:17.790> something

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
because not only that when something

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.440 
because not only that when something
breaks<00:01:18.980> if<00:01:19.980> you<00:01:20.160> just<00:01:20.400> carry<00:01:20.760> on<00:01:20.880> running<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
breaks if you just carry on running it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.900 
breaks if you just carry on running it
then<00:01:21.870> more<00:01:22.290> than<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.070> more<00:01:23.430> than<00:01:23.670> likely

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
then more than it is more than likely

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.020 
then more than it is more than likely
that<00:01:24.480> you're<00:01:24.660> going<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.960> end<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.410> breaking

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
that you're going to end up breaking

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.540 
that you're going to end up breaking
more<00:01:27.030> things<00:01:27.390> which<00:01:28.110> means<00:01:28.410> more<00:01:29.070> money<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
more things which means more money to

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.930 
more things which means more money to
spend<00:01:29.720> more<00:01:30.720> parts<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.230> fit<00:01:31.560> now<00:01:32.100> obviously<00:01:32.700> if

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
spend more parts to fit now obviously if

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.540 
spend more parts to fit now obviously if
you<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.900> that's<00:01:34.080> worth<00:01:34.440> it<00:01:34.740> an<00:01:35.040> extra

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
you think that that's worth it an extra

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.930 
you think that that's worth it an extra
10<00:01:35.820> minutes<00:01:35.850> driving<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.110> Sunday<00:01:37.620> afternoon

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
10 minutes driving on a Sunday afternoon

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.680 
10 minutes driving on a Sunday afternoon
then<00:01:38.940> fine

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
then fine

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.080 
then fine
you<00:01:39.900> carry<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.440> but<00:01:40.950> personally<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.820> would

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
you carry on but personally I would

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.480 
you carry on but personally I would
recommend<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.750> any<00:01:42.960> beginner<00:01:43.230> or<00:01:43.710> any<00:01:43.950> person

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
recommend to any beginner or any person

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.920 
recommend to any beginner or any person
that<00:01:44.700> when<00:01:44.880> something<00:01:45.300> breaks<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.690> should

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
that when something breaks you should

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.080 
that when something breaks you should
stop<00:01:46.230> driving<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.430> should<00:01:47.640> order<00:01:47.910> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
stop driving and you should order the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.170 
stop driving and you should order the
parts<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.810> drive<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.260> car<00:01:49.590> again<00:01:50.180> until

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
parts and not drive your car again until

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.990 
parts and not drive your car again until
the<00:01:51.480> parts<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:51.960> been<00:01:52.140> fitted<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:53.130> it's

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the parts have been fitted because it's

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.930 
the parts have been fitted because it's
like<00:01:54.270> running<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.100> driving<00:01:56.460> down<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
like running it's like driving down the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.320 
like running it's like driving down the
road<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.480> a<00:01:57.690> real<00:01:57.930> car<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:59.430> exhaust<00:01:59.940> falls

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
road in a real car and the exhaust falls

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.800 
road in a real car and the exhaust falls
off<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:01.500> I've<00:02:01.800> seen<00:02:02.190> that<00:02:02.400> where<00:02:02.970> people<00:02:03.660> just

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
off now I've seen that where people just

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.570 
off now I've seen that where people just
carry<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.290> driving<00:02:04.560> leaving<00:02:05.130> their<00:02:05.280> exhaust

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
carry on driving leaving their exhaust

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.050 
carry on driving leaving their exhaust
behind<00:02:06.380> basically<00:02:07.380> I'm<00:02:07.680> sure<00:02:08.280> that's<00:02:08.879> not

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
behind basically I'm sure that's not

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.999 
behind basically I'm sure that's not
recommended<00:02:09.810> or<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.349> drive<00:02:10.590> down<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.979> road

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
recommended or they drive down the road

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.309 
recommended or they drive down the road
with<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.370> hanging<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> floor<00:02:12.239> I'm<00:02:13.019> sure

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
with it hanging on the floor I'm sure

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.040 
with it hanging on the floor I'm sure
that's<00:02:13.590> not<00:02:13.680> recommended<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:15.030> it's<00:02:15.780> like

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
that's not recommended so it's like

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.350 
that's not recommended so it's like
carry<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.709> driving<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.250> car<00:02:17.519> with<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.269> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
carry on driving a car with in the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.270 
carry on driving a car with in the
exhaust<00:02:18.690> hanging<00:02:19.110> off<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.620> wouldn't<00:02:19.830> do<00:02:20.129> it

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
exhaust hanging off you wouldn't do it

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.250 
exhaust hanging off you wouldn't do it
so<00:02:20.930> for<00:02:21.930> example<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:23.510> this<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.720> really

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
so for example if this is a really

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.170 
so for example if this is a really
random

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
last its longest moving on to the engine

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.950 
last its longest moving on to the engine
is<00:04:45.580> first<00:04:46.580> thing<00:04:46.760> is<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.000> should<00:04:47.030> use<00:04:47.390> a<00:04:47.420> fuel

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
is first thing is you should use a fuel

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.350 
is first thing is you should use a fuel
filter<00:04:48.260> now<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.280> can<00:04:49.460> see<00:04:49.670> I<00:04:49.700> haven't<00:04:50.060> put<00:04:50.210> one

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
filter now you can see I haven't put one

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
filter now you can see I haven't put one
in<00:04:50.510> here<00:04:51.280> fuel<00:04:52.280> filters<00:04:52.700> are<00:04:53.000> very<00:04:53.030> very<00:04:53.990> cheap

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
in here fuel filters are very very cheap

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.700 
in here fuel filters are very very cheap
but<00:04:54.980> when<00:04:55.820> bashing<00:04:56.360> when<00:04:56.660> driving<00:04:57.020> your<00:04:57.410> RC

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
but when bashing when driving your RC

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.810 
but when bashing when driving your RC
cars<00:04:58.010> often<00:04:58.960> you<00:04:59.960> might<00:05:00.290> get<00:05:00.650> dirt<00:05:01.190> in<00:05:01.580> the

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
cars often you might get dirt in the

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
tank you can see here I have dirt and

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.470 
tank you can see here I have dirt and
all<00:05:05.540> sorts<00:05:05.900> of<00:05:05.960> other<00:05:06.200> stuff<00:05:06.580> around<00:05:07.580> the

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
all sorts of other stuff around the

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.340 
all sorts of other stuff around the
edges<00:05:08.510> of<00:05:09.440> my<00:05:09.770> tight<00:05:10.040> now<00:05:10.760> that<00:05:11.090> is<00:05:11.240> thing<00:05:12.020> if

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
edges of my tight now that is thing if

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.460 
edges of my tight now that is thing if
dirt<00:05:12.980> gets<00:05:13.340> you<00:05:13.490> gets<00:05:13.640> into<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.419> tank<00:05:14.690> then

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
dirt gets you gets into the tank then

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.030 
dirt gets you gets into the tank then
the<00:05:15.830> engine<00:05:16.460> will<00:05:16.880> get<00:05:17.300> that<00:05:17.630> dirt<00:05:17.900> in<00:05:18.140> it<00:05:18.410> now

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
the engine will get that dirt in it now

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.430 
the engine will get that dirt in it now
if<00:05:19.220> you<00:05:19.250> have<00:05:19.669> these<00:05:20.180> fuel<00:05:20.690> filters<00:05:21.140> and

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
if you have these fuel filters and

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.940 
if you have these fuel filters and
nicely

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
nicely

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.420 
nicely
fastened<00:05:22.880> into<00:05:23.060> here<00:05:23.480> then<00:05:24.320> they<00:05:24.950> will<00:05:25.130> catch

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
fastened into here then they will catch

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.020 
fastened into here then they will catch
any<00:05:25.669> dirt<00:05:25.940> particles<00:05:26.540> that<00:05:27.320> makes<00:05:27.860> your<00:05:28.430> nitro

any dirt particles that makes your nitro
engine<00:05:29.419> last<00:05:29.660> longer<00:05:29.990> because<00:05:30.440> then<00:05:30.560> you

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
engine last longer because then you

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.540 
engine last longer because then you
don't<00:05:30.860> have<00:05:31.010> to<00:05:31.070> worry<00:05:31.310> about<00:05:31.460> cleaning<00:05:31.910> carbs

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
don't have to worry about cleaning carbs

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.250 
don't have to worry about cleaning carbs
lastly<00:05:34.570> tuning<00:05:36.100> always<00:05:37.100> to<00:05:38.000> your<00:05:38.510> RC<00:05:38.870> vehicle

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
lastly tuning always to your RC vehicle

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.530 
lastly tuning always to your RC vehicle
properly<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:40.400> is<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:40.730> first<00:05:41.000> thing<00:05:41.270> you

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
properly that is the first thing you

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.960 
properly that is the first thing you
should<00:05:41.840> do<00:05:42.020> I've<00:05:42.500> seen<00:05:42.800> videos<00:05:43.220> on<00:05:43.490> YouTube

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
should do I've seen videos on YouTube

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.140 
should do I've seen videos on YouTube
but<00:05:44.000> they<00:05:44.300> say<00:05:44.540> stuff<00:05:44.870> like<00:05:44.900> Oh<00:05:45.610> first<00:05:46.610> running

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
but they say stuff like Oh first running

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.810 
but they say stuff like Oh first running
before<00:05:47.870> it's<00:05:48.410> been<00:05:48.680> tuned<00:05:49.010> or<00:05:49.310> something<00:05:49.669> like

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
before it's been tuned or something like

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.300 
before it's been tuned or something like
that<00:05:49.960> that<00:05:50.960> you<00:05:51.290> you<00:05:51.560> should<00:05:51.830> not<00:05:51.979> do<00:05:52.160> that

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
that that you you should not do that

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.969 
that that you you should not do that
because<00:05:52.490> that<00:05:53.150> is<00:05:53.479> damaging<00:05:54.140> your<00:05:54.200> engine<00:05:54.410> now

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
because that is damaging your engine now

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.650 
because that is damaging your engine now
I<00:05:55.010> don't<00:05:55.100> think<00:05:55.430> people<00:05:55.580> quite<00:05:56.000> realize<00:05:56.390> just

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
I don't think people quite realize just

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.680 
I don't think people quite realize just
how<00:05:56.810> important<00:05:57.500> the<00:05:57.590> tuning<00:05:58.070> is<00:05:58.450> because<00:05:59.450> if

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
how important the tuning is because if

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.560 
how important the tuning is because if
you<00:05:59.840> get<00:06:00.050> your<00:06:00.200> tuning<00:06:00.590> wrong<00:06:00.860> not<00:06:01.669> only<00:06:02.060> might

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
you get your tuning wrong not only might

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.400 
you get your tuning wrong not only might
your<00:06:02.810> engine<00:06:03.140> overheat<00:06:03.830> or<00:06:04.220> die<00:06:04.780> also

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
your engine overheat or die also

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.010 
your engine overheat or die also
it's<00:06:06.710> actually<00:06:07.460> pretty<00:06:08.000> dangerous<00:06:08.360> because

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
it's actually pretty dangerous because

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.520 
it's actually pretty dangerous because
these<00:06:09.530> are<00:06:09.800> engines<00:06:10.370> and<00:06:10.850> if<00:06:11.479> you<00:06:11.720> don't<00:06:12.229> tune

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
these are engines and if you don't tune

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.890 
these are engines and if you don't tune
them<00:06:12.740> properly<00:06:13.160> I've<00:06:13.700> had<00:06:14.030> an<00:06:14.180> engine<00:06:14.600> fire

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
them properly I've had an engine fire

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.830 
them properly I've had an engine fire
before<00:06:15.140> and<00:06:15.650> that<00:06:16.190> was<00:06:16.460> not<00:06:16.760> pleasant<00:06:17.330> you

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
before and that was not pleasant you

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.990 
before and that was not pleasant you
don't<00:06:18.080> want<00:06:18.200> to<00:06:18.260> hear<00:06:18.470> about<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:18.890> details<00:06:19.070> it

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
don't want to hear about the details it

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.710 
don't want to hear about the details it
just<00:06:20.330> ended<00:06:20.750> up<00:06:20.900> in<00:06:21.140> let's<00:06:21.770> just<00:06:22.010> say<00:06:22.190> a

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
natural disaster and yeah now that

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.800 
natural disaster and yeah now that
wasn't<00:06:28.010> my<00:06:28.130> fault<00:06:28.190> that<00:06:28.640> was<00:06:28.790> just<00:06:29.060> old<00:06:29.360> engine

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
wasn't my fault that was just old engine

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.950 
wasn't my fault that was just old engine
age<00:06:30.020> and<00:06:30.470> fuel<00:06:30.860> gets<00:06:31.070> have<00:06:31.220> got<00:06:31.370> spilt<00:06:31.820> and<00:06:32.180> you

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
age and fuel gets have got spilt and you

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.290 
age and fuel gets have got spilt and you
know<00:06:33.080> it<00:06:33.200> just<00:06:33.229> caught<00:06:33.680> fire<00:06:33.910> that<00:06:34.910> was<00:06:35.030> an<00:06:35.120> old

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
know it just caught fire that was an old

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.600 
know it just caught fire that was an old
car<00:06:35.660> you've<00:06:36.080> never<00:06:36.320> seen<00:06:36.620> it<00:06:36.800> but<00:06:37.190> the<00:06:37.370> thing

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
car you've never seen it but the thing

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.270 
car you've never seen it but the thing
is<00:06:37.880> you<00:06:38.419> must<00:06:38.810> tune<00:06:39.229> your<00:06:39.440> engines<00:06:39.800> properly

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
is you must tune your engines properly

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.390 
is you must tune your engines properly
because<00:06:40.720> tuning<00:06:41.720> will<00:06:42.410> make<00:06:42.950> your<00:06:43.220> engine

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
because tuning will make your engine

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.600 
because tuning will make your engine
last<00:06:44.150> longer<00:06:44.690> it<00:06:45.500> would<00:06:45.680> make<00:06:45.919> your<00:06:46.100> car<00:06:46.430> last

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
last longer it would make your car last

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.240 
last longer it would make your car last
longer<00:06:46.970> which<00:06:47.690> means<00:06:47.720> that<00:06:48.680> then<00:06:48.890> you<00:06:49.070> can

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
longer which means that then you can

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.890 
longer which means that then you can
have<00:06:49.460> longer<00:06:49.789> run<00:06:50.090> time<00:06:50.360> and<00:06:50.390> that<00:06:50.690> means

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
have longer run time and that means

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.330 
have longer run time and that means
you've<00:06:51.080> got<00:06:51.260> longer

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
you've got longer
