00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.670
 most young people think that 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.980
 trains 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.000
 intensely when they look at my 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.250
 training from the side 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.900
 it seems to them that I do not earn when 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.740
 I suggest you do the same thing that I 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.830
 everything becomes its place to 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.750
 better understand the words intensity 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.519
 try taking a wider look at how i 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.030
 I train and what I experience during 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.030
 workout i'm cool 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:39.030
 I kachok words mean intensity 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.850
 tension muscle tension builds up 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.360
 from the rise to the rise and he approach to 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.059
 approach 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.340
 so if in the first approach i'm experiencing 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.469
 voltage of 10 percent then already 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.039
 the sixth approach, it will deliver up to 100 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.039
 percent 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.609
 modern high-intensity techniques 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:02.489
 they say you train short but from 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.559
 intensively they propose to do only 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.509
 one working approach and go drink 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.520
 protein 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.740
 so the next 40 years did not go work 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.320
 in shorts 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.310
 it is convenient it is fast but not effective 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.450
 because there is no good fast 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.000
 only not this 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.369
 Take for example the abstract athlete 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.819
 which can pull up to a maximum of 10 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.149
 once after the first approach and rest in one 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:32.250
 minute he will recover only eighty 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.170
 percent of forces it means already in the second 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.970
 approach he will not be able to be stretched 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.310
 more than 8 times i act differently i 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.170
 leave strength to last approach 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.530
 I hope it became obvious that if you 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.049
 You begin to exercise on the floor, too, to force 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.000
 Fifth under the skin, it turns into 90 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.259
 percent of your strength you have left 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.690
 only 10 percent strength of course you can 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.330
 make 6 approach and the same 5 reps 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.410
 will give one hundred percent intensity or 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.229
 total muscle failure 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.269
 but I do not kill my disciples I them 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.970
 cultivate i grow their muscles i 

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:13.730
 I order you a plant of water people often 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.730
 talking about today I killed my biceps 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.819
 biceps do not need to kill them 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.750
 stimulate growth and 90 percent 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.010
 intensity 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.930
 enough for that 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.850
 stimulating acquaintance with a lion i 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.780
 killing your muscles nervous system now 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.610
 I understood what is correct 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.950
 to cultivate muscles in any business 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.650
 man succeed if 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.570
 is engaged in this business regularly and not from 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.400
 occasionally 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.470
 stimulate the same muscle to grow 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.350
 three times a week with an intensity of 90 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.239
 percent for muscle and clearer than 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.040
 kill her 1 week with a hundred intensity 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.160
 percent start they tint me 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.410
 modern high-intensity techniques 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.430
 recommend killing a muscle once a week 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.650
 it's a good way to kill the psyche on 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.230
 bad way to grow flesh 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.140
 and such education people become 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.810
 nervous or injured to such 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.269
 people used to write something they drink under 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.640
 the sounds of flutes then they measure themselves 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.890
 exercise then they drink 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.959
 water alone and tony dacheva &amp; me 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.310
 things I want to discuss 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.590
 years so in sports appeared the concept of season 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.349
 and off season 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.290
 my technique does not promise brilliant 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.959
 competitive forms but she promises 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.330
 I don't have a good everyday form 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.860
 the concept of season and off season it is 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.739
 only one concept is healthy 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.090
 everyday people who are too 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.040
 strongly exhaust themselves with physical 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.900
 exercises and then they say that 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.269
 they don't care about anything 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.849
 that lacking motivation three times was on 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.900
 bodybuilding scene and a little bit to me already 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.000
 lack of motivation 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.500
 these people say something they want 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.569
 I don't want to train there 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.760
 to train with me this does not happen I 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.980
 I do not like training 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.530
 Well, I do not feel the return of those 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.209
 just notice for example i can in the morning 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.099
 do five sets of pushups by 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.560
 principle to the floor of the force and bringing 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.959
 intensity up to 90 percent occupy 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.930
 I only have 10 minutes and not much 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.079
 straining so from day to day 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.789
 every morning i dial my weekly 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.550
 at least twenty five push ups 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:30.539
 I need to pump up correctly, let's 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.070
 to make my muscles sick my friends don't see 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.580
 when I have time to keep myself in 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.740
 form 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.930
 I don't notice it either, because 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.970
 I train half the strength to intensity 90 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.490
 percent and doing this everyday 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.590
 noticeably between myself I am too 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.750
 talks a lot about abstract athletes that 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.210
 do with such a specific answer like me 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.790
 Approach can pull up two different how 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.040
 I take from it 90 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.380
 I agree that it is very difficult 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.970
 follow the principle of gender strength and bring 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.100
 yourself up to intensity only 90 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.890
 percent if you can reached out only 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.210
 once so for your three exercises 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.640
 with all beginners 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.620
 pupils I add dumbbell traction in 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.060
 slope 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.060
 but I will tell about meetings
