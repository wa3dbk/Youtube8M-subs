00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.910
 in an exclusive interview with avant-garde 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.160
 members of the coahuilense group 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.110
 echoes of the desert speak of the traditional 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.300
 concert of Christmas carols that will offer 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.360
 this weekend in Saltillo and as 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.600
 his project was born from the family 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.940
 originated six years ago is the fifth time 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.800
 We are here in Saltillo six years ago 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.250
 a group of families that had like 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.920
 tradition 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.079
 Christmas sing Christmas carols as a family 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.470
 and shared with others they decided to do 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.010
 a little more formal 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:49.270
 from there the idea arose and it has been growing 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.400
 and the color is made up of 40 voices with a 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.710
 choir of children of another 20 voices and one 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:59.230
 orchestra of 20 of 20 instrumentalists 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.510
 although it is the choir they have performed in 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:07.939
 lion guanajuato reynosa monterrey 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.939
 zacatecas and of course here in 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.869
 we are united by the desire and purpose of 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.380
 share music the joy of making music 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.490
 and to share and transmit 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.930
 especially this Christmas stage in 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.299
 this very difficult time for which he is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.920
 going to our country to a message of 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.920
 hope - or lewis 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.280
 here in saltillo we really live with 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.040
 a group already very well formed but as 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.100
 it says so they started from little 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.630
 truth and when they could no longer in the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.840
 environment in which they were as they grew 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.850
 and they grew up and that's how they got to 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.970
 and to be in the theater isauro martÃ­nez 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.170
 by 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:57.570
 at five years old 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.090
 it was really as if the interest to see 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.100
 and here in Saltillo really came from 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.380
 The gotten right here 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.110
 yes because we knew about the concert we went 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.110
 we liked it so much and we said we want 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.060
 those of saltillo also have that not 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.360
 we can take us to saltillo since what 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.640
 hear so you have to make an effort 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.680
 because of what we do not have any 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.400
 financing of any institution and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.590
 of government but nothing of any kind 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.630
 but we talked with several of our 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.850
 friends that we have dealings with 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.790
 we choose as we see we do something for 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.340
 saltillo and then we decided to get together 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.960
 and every year we make an effort and it's a 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.540
 effort 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.870
 because we bring it because they come in two 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.930
 trucks you have to host those that are 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.000
 110 people that we bring but 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.130
 We think it's worth it because the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.130
 message they bring it sure is 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.650
 hope of joy 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.540
 and we believe that it is our contribution to 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.100
 society in saltillo these families that 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.100
 we come together and we want to contribute that is 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.010
 clay 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.400
 a message of hope are some 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.440
 pieces with orchestras and others with forums and 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.010
 most of all there are some 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.379
 choir entries for children 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.550
 sometimes we are up to 80 musicians from 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.220
 stage 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.620
 the pieces are Christmas carols 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.950
 some traditional such that 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.460
 any recognizes them new ones 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.230
 with less usual but all 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.440
 We feel very nice and with a 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.870
 very important message we all sing it 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.850
 in Spanish although they are Christmas carols 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.100
 other countries in some English cases 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.320
 French animals we sing Spanish 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.290
 because we want to transmit something that is 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.030
 understandable is music sometimes people 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.510
 listen runs orchestra and think about the 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.939
 genre maybe 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.299
 not so popular the truth is that we have 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:56.579
 seen that from young children people 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.739
 gives greater taste the concert 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.599
 we present the repertoire that we are 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.370
 presenting the program because it's the 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.430
 music that September and we want to give them 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.370
 something that serves them is not a time of 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.010
 entertainment we just want that 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.680
 have something that they have left to contribute 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.650
 to their lives not even for this year 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.930
 that is about to end really yes 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.370
 and something for their lives and also for that 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.020
 at the same time they can share with others 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.080
 and that is something that 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.349
 I would like very much to invite for 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.659
 we want to spend some takes time 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.220
 Pause all your activities one 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.470
 hour and 15 minutes than what they will give 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.990
 concert and reflect that it is the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.970
 meaning of Christmas there is something more 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.530
 apart from consumerism , materialism 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.909
 traditions that sometimes day ni 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.550
 we understand those of second more by 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:48.340
 make them there is something more background 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.390
 what impact does it really have 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.390
 celebrate why 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.729
 is a message that transcends or not 

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:57.679
 we believe that if we see that it is transcendent 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.740
 and that makes all the difference in the 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:01.930
 individual and also 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.400
 it really is limitations is to enjoy 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.400
 without thinking
