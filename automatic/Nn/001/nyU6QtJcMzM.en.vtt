00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.310
 possible 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.450
 photo ap photo m 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.090
 then on him 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.090
 the railway and river company umf 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.480
 reflection of the south of 2010 it's a fact 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.780
 during the extension the first part of the extension but if 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.250
 william gallas comes out of the highly contested and that he will be very challenged very 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.350
 questionable with 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.100
 Malouda's free kick at the Cherry handing over judge that normal speed 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.530
 yes a little something 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.140
 this was the case the week 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.820
 the ball of the head at the bottom of the nets 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.010
 we will see it in slow motion 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.130
 well this hand 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.350
 the terrible still look at this 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.710
 right now I'm reading your comments 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.710
 the first may not be with third parties 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.729
 the back of the device as said Jean-pierre earlier affair to 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.090
 to follow tonight but we risk talking about it a lot 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.010
 a lot of the pressure of tomorrow 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.310
 the ball arrives on the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.470
 while from the French striker 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.370
 obviously the referee could have had he could not have it going very very 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.960
 quickly on the spot 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.030
 yesterday the army on understand them because 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.659
 a fatal spell reserved the opportunity to qualify for shots at 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.310
 goal 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.180
 the repression will continue 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.030
 and although he was shortlisted for the 2010 World 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.700
 probably will not pack his bags to go to south africa this goal 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.830
 allows France 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.890
 to qualify for the world but it was complicated for this little 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.649
 girl 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.389
 sarkozy had retired alive from his own who is important is that they 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.779
 work for a hundredth of a second it was necessary that I go to see 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.429
 the referee to tell him that I made my ap ap 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.629
 after 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.659
 did I have the most 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.769
 first it is a volunteer to ensure the development 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.489
 layec and the referee who has not shown it all the players want on the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.119
 ground 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.699
 the reactions were very positive of the fun radio hook to go away 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.699
 see at the first trial but it's flat 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:39.539
 this qualification to the world cup 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:40.619
 but 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.589
 the dutch can be enraged because these are real stole me the 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:47.009
 match be replayed d 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.009

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.429

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:11.949
 they went to the polls 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:15.149
 they are a little less than an hour and a half hour 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:17.789
 no, there were a lot of people 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:18.779
