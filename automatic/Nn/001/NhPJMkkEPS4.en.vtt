them looked kind of similar to the other
collection<00:04:39.100> that<00:04:39.220> I<00:04:39.250> was<00:04:39.400> talking<00:04:39.700> about

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
collection that I was talking about

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.360 
collection that I was talking about
earlier<00:04:40.030> but<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:40.870> kind<00:04:41.710> of<00:04:41.740> did<00:04:41.890> some<00:04:42.040> swatches

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
earlier but I kind of did some swatches

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.910 
earlier but I kind of did some swatches
and<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:43.150> talked<00:04:43.420> to<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.690> mat<00:04:43.870> girl<00:04:44.230> and<00:04:44.530> the

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
and I talked to the mat girl and the

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.830 
and I talked to the mat girl and the
ones<00:04:45.100> that<00:04:45.220> do<00:04:45.490> look<00:04:45.760> a<00:04:45.880> little<00:04:46.270> bit<00:04:46.450> similar

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
ones that do look a little bit similar

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.150 
ones that do look a little bit similar
are<00:04:47.200> actually<00:04:47.790> pretty<00:04:48.790> dark<00:04:49.860> compared<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.040> the

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
are actually pretty dark compared to the

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.560 
are actually pretty dark compared to the
other<00:04:51.280> ones<00:04:51.370> because<00:04:51.790> those<00:04:51.940> were<00:04:52.120> like<00:04:52.330> more

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
other ones because those were like more

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.080 
other ones because those were like more
springy<00:04:52.930> colors<00:04:53.470> so<00:04:54.130> I<00:04:54.460> definitely<00:04:54.760> don't

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
springy colors so I definitely don't

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.390 
springy colors so I definitely don't
think<00:04:55.360> that<00:04:55.510> there's<00:04:55.720> any<00:04:56.290> like<00:04:56.560> exact<00:04:56.950> dupes
