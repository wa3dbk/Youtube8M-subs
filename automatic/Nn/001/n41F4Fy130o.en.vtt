00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:10.809
 Attempt number 2 I want to reboot 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.820
 start the camera and see how it is 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.330
 takes off to show you 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:21.550
 Of course it's better to shoot like this 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:24.070
 no camera buttons here you are shooting a video 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.510
 well you don't want to shoot a video let's 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:32.469
 switch to photo this mode 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:37.260
 more understandable if I want to shift here 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:40.260
 I confuse the focus and now automatically 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.809
 I took a look at the settings 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.819
 there is a normal stabilization shooting mode 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.489
 serial shooting at serial just need 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:50.829
 mumble on the screen everything will flash 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.219
 work or not work screen format 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.199
 16 to 9 4 to play but to the front 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:01.210
 the camera but this is not interesting as they say 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.339
 interesting program item like you 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.050
 summarize 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.050
 this is how zoom works 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.540
 back and forth on the photo screen looks 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:23.020
 not very good it is a disadvantage rather 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:25.420
 the screen itself but generally take pictures 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.610
 possible speed is acceptable when writing 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.930
 Video happening all exactly the same as the most 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:37.119
 the default settings are 720 drunk 1080 and 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.610
 but in general, as they say everything is fine 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.610
 this is a timeshift function 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:48.280
 now we will go somewhere and take off 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:57.820
 different happy faces of people so that later 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:02:00.160
 show how you can change them here 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.530
 we take pictures of Svetlana with us 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.520
 facial recognition goes now we can 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.509
 change face 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:13.540
 and there that we want this game always 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:17.320
 will be with us until the moment is not to 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.329
 sorry here is all this timeshift from 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.640
 cold that was bought by the company 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.870
 nike on blackberry os before from glow 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.870
 in cake machines
