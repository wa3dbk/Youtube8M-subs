00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.590

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.910
 world music precisely and that's 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.380
 huge it's finally I listened to a reggae

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.719
 m 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.890
 for me because they stand out from 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:07.030
 people who are who think themselves different 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.120
 but in fact they are the same and who 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.530
 come who come yeah and from 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.150
 discover things and live together 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.900

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.269
 for five days there are a lot 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.719
 of spacing a meeting place that will 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.719
 I like 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:34.410

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.120
 small city

 I do a little freestyle ya full 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.560
 of different artists to this music plan 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.390
 different and we do not care about the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.460
 others and because we can do what we 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.140
 he wants by advancing mans moto you me 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.000

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.160
 kullas he has glasses like me you 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.720
 know what my ego with giblets on the 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.910
 dour festival you can afford 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.470
 it's a bastard stuff wrote I can 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.470
 do everything there is no limit no 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.220
 m 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.220
 we want the second Iraq question 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.389
 a scam nothing will stop in this 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.389
 highly developed base g 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.470
 for example the truck driver has 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.930
 do twelve hours a day I go out one to 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.240
 twice a year and that's what makes 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.820
 well that's all but requires that 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.460
 people remain responsible on the road 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.980
 that we for example sleep in 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.350
 the car barter and lola we will make a 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.750
 virtuous day the 2 gold and here we go 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.690
 to piss off someone and we will restart 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.970
 that when we will have under thieves 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.310
 let's just look at whether people 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.480
 doing that the same thing then less 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.220
 accidents on the road there would be 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.380
 fewer accidents on the road is 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.200
 all you have to do is leave 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.230
 people sleep make places 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.940
 on purpose or what are there simply and 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.330
 there will be no worries 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.330
 that's all
