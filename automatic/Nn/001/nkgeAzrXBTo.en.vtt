00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Good day and she wore warmly 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.150
 Welcome to the last note presentation 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.450
 today, again, a pack what already 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.070
 is longer outside and must again 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.950
 It's actually been around for a while 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.520
 times are known yes before you is that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.910
 crown balers pack consisting of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.119
 two and baling a 1 share and baling 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.400
 a biaxial and just too 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.640
 a square bale press known from the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.859
 11 13 and 11:11 if I'm not 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.820
 really great and the crown big pack 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.010
 1290 xc hdp yes as I said the model 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.469
 was overworked otherwise it is 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.590
 relatively similar visually in comparison to 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.360
 11 13 model 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.480
 Of course, we do not have those here now 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.730
 bombing textures we know otherwise 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.649
 However, we are also very horny 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.160
 Tires that have to be said by Trelleborg 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.239
 also and otherwise up here the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:04.799
 Inscription is very sharp from the logo too 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.479
 but these are minimal confusions 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.130
 not so bad that I think 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 even that's a little bit the whole 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.590
 liven up the rear 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.240
 area we also have textures in 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.470
 So i would like your texture 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.479
 moderately awarded three stars 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.350
 then just a crown comes 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.759
 great v 180 xc maybe not like that 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.049
 known also pulls a bit 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.770
 Strange is as I said one 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.930
 larger round baler sees this too 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.439
 here at the tires we have others 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.119
 mature understand no trelle but no 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.689
 name of tire 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.460
 haha really like that fits our web 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.229
 yes, the nuns, well, we're up 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.710
 it should not have understood now 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.930
 to let 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.490
 So what are we doing here at the rims 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.880
 to see every case is damn good 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.100
 work that is fact even if it is now 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.360
 at the ripe these are also are profile 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.040
 really great and just like that 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.810
 other two press just as well 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.460
 same mature looks great this 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:06.290
 Baler the uniaxial is called before 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:09.840
 theme v 1500 also with the beautiful 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.180
 number plate here in the back but I have to 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.130
 say that you need getting used to 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.500
 but thats out 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.300
 then again a bit bigger we 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.770
 Just look at it in the shop for a very short time 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.480
 at elections technology you see all three 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.600
 great picture in the logo under the great picture 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.690
 description of the crown big pack 1290 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.700
 costs us 153 1460 euro 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.300
 that's actually a hell of a lot more expensive 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.570
 price if you look at it that way 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.830
 but we really need 155 ps approx 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.380
 minimum for the baler 145 euro 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.240
 maintenance costs and of course 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.360
 straw presses in cuboid ball of course 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.260
 your crown com prima 480 costs our 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.390
 trend 435,000 720 euro 125 euro 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.800
 Maintenance costs on the day we need 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.100
 also almost the same performance 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.670
 at least 140 ps and the smaller one 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.300
 sister then is the crown fÃ¡tima 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.730
 1500 costs 790 1430 euro 95 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.690
 maintenance costs and needed in addition 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.790
 95 ps minimum that is absolutely fine 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.300
 because many tractors have that 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.850
 fulfill 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.500
 I would say we'll take it 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.360
 as an example the customer of the great because 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.420
 both the smaller and the larger 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.640
 children already i believe from ls 13 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.010
 I do not really believe this one here yet 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.940
 so if I was 13 and if 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.160
 I 'm sorry 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.710
 then I suppressed that because 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.180
 I look so ugly but I want 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.830
 Try it out for a while because there is something going on there 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.300
 actually a bit more straw 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.670
 you could test that quite well 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.200
 yes, we have that working 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.200
 light and left is the most important 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.940
 actually the cable can be here 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.350
 lower front and then goes ever going 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.020
 Of course, everything is spinning here in front 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.420
 nice that is one of the most important 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.709
 that I do something here then that is 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.360
 maybe even like to look 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.060
 friends that looks ever horny 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.450
 if she does a lot here and then 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.010
 We could just bale press 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.780
 the one makes higher 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.500
 speed is a bit high 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.350
 I'll get it down a bit 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.030
 set to 20 km / h 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.530
 we can drive a bit nice 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.790
 of course we have tire tracks that 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.800
 you should not forget either 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.440
 By now, there are already 80 90 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.389
 and 100 percent is we open times 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.400
 in the back then we look how big the 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.800
 Bales are in principle standard format 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.639
 what is really noticeable here too 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.840
 like to look in here again 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.810
 that we just really like it 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.960
 what we all see that I have everything here 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.069
 turns and you in principle so much is yes 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.919
 not at all on such a baler 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.240
 At least here we can not do that 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.009
 understand that the then 87,000 euros 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.870
 costs but as I said it is still 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.879
 a little more like this one 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.500
 Beinpresse and yes I would say 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.020
 We also do not have to be good 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.090
 longer than necessary in itself 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.759
 really great spec where everything is included 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.849
 no big balkan round baler one 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.110
 Nice was the baler 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.330
 Of course you can do that too 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.430
 I think I use her individually 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.409
 landed down pack but there you can 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.789
 I believe the three balers 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.909
 unpack and then individually 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.620
 also use the texture here again 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:23.919
 inscription very cool we have faith 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.930
 I would have absolute freedom from errors 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.020
 be it actually co chronicles prima 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.810
 we have the crown at the top then tim 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.240
 krohne big pack absolutely faultless that 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.430
 is important that's good and that's why 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.560
 I will here from the rating here 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.009
 increase to four stars 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.199
 although as I said from the texture yet 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.060
 So a little bit of air would be up 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.840
 Here I would really only have three stars 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.419
 but passed to see top functionality 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.979
 the logos the good quality are the 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.069
 shop description that fits easily 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.210
 There is nothing to complain about 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.800
 unnecessary textures three stars 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.050
 is to go down to find a 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.479
 a bit hard so many great stars 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.759
 for this horny pack and see you 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.310
 friends will be back soon 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.610
 finally with new consequences from mls 15 up 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.860
 visit the name with a visit or not 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.919
 because you visit with friends and times 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.659
 alone and I hope you are happy 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.009
 gta will follow again 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.319
 we will come now today and tomorrow 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.159
 The next days are going to be produced 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:26.139
 go right back after that 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:28.060
 hospital but I'm really happy 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.440
 Now it's up and that 's it 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.750
 for me today for the word 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.409
 notions sleep well at night until 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.409
 morning service
