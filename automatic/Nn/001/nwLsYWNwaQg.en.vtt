fibers up and and again we're not just

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.280 
fibers up and and again we're not just
moving<00:02:41.370> skin<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:41.910> we're<00:02:42.180> getting<00:02:42.660> deep<00:02:42.930> down

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
moving skin here we're getting deep down

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.160 
into the muscle as to be a little
uncomfortable<00:02:47.010> yeah<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.209> they'll<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.989> rule

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
uncomfortable yeah and they'll the rule

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.340 
uncomfortable yeah and they'll the rule
book<00:02:49.470> when<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.190> stop<00:02:50.790> right<00:02:51.180> basically<00:02:52.170> if

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
book when the stop right basically if

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.410 
book when the stop right basically if
you<00:02:52.500> do<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.280> after<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.700> minute<00:02:54.120> or<00:02:54.150> so

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
you do this and after a minute or so

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.720 
you do this and after a minute or so
it's<00:02:54.690> getting<00:02:55.019> worse<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:56.250> not<00:02:56.370> getting

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
it's getting worse it's not getting

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.150 
it's getting worse it's not getting
better<00:02:56.850> it's<00:02:57.330> not<00:02:57.750> going<00:02:58.049> down<00:02:58.080> then<00:02:58.799> it's

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
better it's not going down then it's

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.039 
better it's not going down then it's
probably<00:02:59.400> too<00:02:59.790> sore<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.510> probably<00:03:00.930> too

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
probably too sore it's probably too

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.900 
probably too sore it's probably too
fired<00:03:01.320> up<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.620> do<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.070> take<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.280> nice<00:03:02.459> packet

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
fired up to do this I take a nice packet

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.490 
fired up to do this I take a nice packet
so<00:03:03.060> around<00:03:03.299> there<00:03:03.480> trying<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:04.019> couple<00:03:04.350> days

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
so around there trying to a couple days

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.770 
so around there trying to a couple days
again<00:03:04.860> if<00:03:05.610> it's<00:03:05.910> starting<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.420> get<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.570> little

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
again if it's starting to get a little

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.420 
again if it's starting to get a little
bit<00:03:07.019> better<00:03:07.230> maybe<00:03:07.560> even<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.830> little<00:03:07.980> bit<00:03:08.190> numb

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
bit better maybe even a little bit numb

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.460 
bit better maybe even a little bit numb
that's<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.330> good<00:03:09.480> sign<00:03:09.750> that's<00:03:10.049> what<00:03:10.200> we<00:03:10.320> want

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470
