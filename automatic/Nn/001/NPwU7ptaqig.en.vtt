all of the hair that I lost and I have

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.649 
all of the hair that I lost and I have
really<00:06:18.190> thick<00:06:18.729> I<00:06:19.349> believe<00:06:20.349> my<00:06:20.530> hair<00:06:20.800> type<00:06:21.039> is

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:21.659 
really thick I believe my hair type is

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.350 
really thick I believe my hair type is
383<00:06:22.659> c24<00:06:23.319> a<00:06:23.349> something<00:06:24.009> like<00:06:24.129> that<00:06:24.400> but<00:06:25.210> it's

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
383 c24 a something like that but it's

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.029 
383 c24 a something like that but it's
really<00:06:25.659> oily<00:06:27.810> which<00:06:28.810> makes<00:06:29.139> it<00:06:29.349> more<00:06:29.590> likely

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
really oily which makes it more likely

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:34.920 
really oily which makes it more likely
for<00:06:30.789> me<00:06:31.240> in<00:06:31.419> my<00:06:31.449> case<00:06:31.870> to<00:06:33.210> tangle<00:06:34.210> up<00:06:34.389> but

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
for me in my case to tangle up but

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.580 
for me in my case to tangle up but
that's<00:06:35.080> all<00:06:35.379> the<00:06:35.439> hair<00:06:36.039> that<00:06:36.250> I<00:06:36.279> lost<00:06:36.550> y'all<00:06:36.969> I

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
that's all the hair that I lost y'all I

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.219 
that's all the hair that I lost y'all I
think<00:06:38.590> that's<00:06:38.800> a<00:06:38.949> great<00:06:39.180> thing<00:06:40.180> to<00:06:40.240> lose<00:06:40.810> that

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
think that's a great thing to lose that

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.719 
think that's a great thing to lose that
little<00:06:41.710> bit<00:06:41.860> of<00:06:41.889> hair<00:06:42.250> from<00:06:43.240> detangling<00:06:44.110> and

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729 
little bit of hair from detangling and

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:47.369 
little bit of hair from detangling and
hopefully<00:06:45.729> you<00:06:46.000> learn<00:06:46.270> something<00:06:46.930> and<00:06:47.169> you

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:47.379 
hopefully you learn something and you
