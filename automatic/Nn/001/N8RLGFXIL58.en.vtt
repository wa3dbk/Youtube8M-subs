00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:21.449
 oh yes, many of us love mario kart 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:24.019
 Many of us hate it, too 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.820
 Situations where you can hate the game 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.699
 and how do you always say mario so beautifully 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.869
 kart can destroy friendships 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.349
 luck it was not so with me yet 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.960
 case 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.480
 and today I want you abbreviations 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.430
 show the one or the other 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.620
 Maybe not so well known 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.980
 welcome especially mario kart 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.450
 eight tips for advanced sets 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.960
 He anticipates the game reasonably 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.730
 We start with the mastery 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.040
 Royal Raceway of Nintendo 64 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.720
 a retro track and one of mine 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.720
 personal the in route 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.230
 it is exactly this ramp 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.540
 many of you surely know these 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.580
 Abbreviation is nothing new 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:20.310
 the least often certainly with 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.310
 mushrooms or with the star 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 or maybe a google wants 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.250
 There are many different possibilities 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.350
 but now I show a possibility 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.049
 how you ramp this without any 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.049
 can drive tools look 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.799
 and now again in slow motion 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.560
 now I try you again in more detail 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.780
 to explain her father meets blue number 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.300
 1 hits blue number two and about 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.430
 at this point with a jump 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.900
 jumps zack will be on the lawn with it 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.090
 again, not so much 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.340
 loses speed and then you have 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.290
 her ramp actually profihaft 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.880
 definitely a lot of sport 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.440
 time here with the whole time again 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.520
 a race 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.830
 but here you have to do something different 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.630
 start and you get at the second 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.030
 no other blue meets and must 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.280
 So the kart is definitely jumping 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.080
 better in my opinion suitable for it 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.490
 then I again at the normal 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.960
 actually taken that function too 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.740
 very good because she drives something like that 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.850
 how that works and then I have 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.090
 I again with the quad 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.950
 tried and yes you see yourself 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.980
 Be a bit unwieldy because of it 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.540
 but it's a bit heavier 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.930
 best to keep up with that 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.930
 kart rum 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:12.250
 continue with marius piste some 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.550
 they certainly ask you higher ones 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.750
 Do you give this abbreviation yes that yourself 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.220
 the abbreviation does not exist but me 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.800
 want you now to show what and times 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.920
 goes exactly to the beautiful piranha 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.560
 plant you know it certainly times 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.560
 get lost and get hit 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.060
 either you drive a small bow 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.060
 around the plants like here 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.609
 or compare to the very big one 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.609
 bow to take no risk 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.359
 Now I'll show you a trick we all 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.810
 can pass close to the plant 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:04:00.889
 without getting hit we do the whole thing 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.889
 still my slow motion 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.110
 it is important that you meet one 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.669
 starts and about at this point 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.290
 hit the plant with it 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.699
 next to it and you can already 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.699
 turn tight and save time 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.630
 Of course, this also works 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.630
 this place 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.099
 I have that with the times 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.629
 Rennwald tried and works 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.180
 as with all the other vehicles 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:41.629
 and finally we come to varius 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.629
 Departure 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:57.780
 this is exactly this little one 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.790
 edge because many of you are driving 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.360
 certainly down here and then 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.360
 directly into the water 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.600
 but now a trick we directly into 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.010
 water can drive from up here 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.920
 you have to be around this place 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.390
 jumps zack and again perfect in the 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.390
 water and could continue immediately 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.120
 The batteries certainly can each one of 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.040
 you 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.490
 try everything again with a bike 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.490
 and works just as well 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.650
 Welcome to a kart I hope 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.000
 you liked my little video and 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.100
 you have to decide as a matter of whether the 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.570
 one or the other abbreviate something 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.720
 So it definitely has me 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.510
 already brought a lot in the past 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.669
 and it 's also important regularly or 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.560
 and we practice these shortcuts 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.250
 because it is not a master of the sky 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.389
 like 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.919
 practice makes the master and yes here goes 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.389
 it still to my current videos 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.580
 have a look and if you are 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.680
 do not miss anything then print 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.260
 but on subscribed course friends 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.389
 oh yes and here's the bottom right 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.280
 to my shuffle channel 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.800
 you know what shuffle is from you 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.940
 could just sound like it 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.940
 Have a nice day until then
