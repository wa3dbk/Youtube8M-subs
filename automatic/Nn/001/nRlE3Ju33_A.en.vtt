 who we are our children 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:09.689
 told this day 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.079
 The fourth part of Killzone 3 is once again exclusive to Sony 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.130
 PlayStation 3 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.539
 Contact 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.539
 brings the trip to Herbern really new 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.939
 next to woman pushes 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.189
 and daughters of world rank 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.009
 on this day 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.740
 to be seen alone in the four walls 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.890
 the story of Killzone 3 and now hits Russia as two years 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.449
 the amount of oil production 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.010
 this aria it is said to be dead even after his death is the victory over 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.670
 Increases not decided 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.519
 and so must the heroes of the Internet address title Lions or short 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.190
 Simply IANS rises again to gather a final one 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.440
 Beat against the adversaries of planet Earth 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.500
 Break even if you take one 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.229
 Killzone 3 because special on 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.870
 To present way 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.910
 everything really dark but otherwise colorful and wild 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.670
 You are always looking for the form 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 do not return to hitting ball hail 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.070
 suddenly word becomes fast 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.140
 and either revived by a close-by teammate 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.330
 or even reset to the checkpoint when restarting 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.109
 because even so the solo 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.109
 with these difficulties always unscathed from everything 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
 hardly a degree 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.390
 Keppler wants to come here to speak Savchenko 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.490
 the player plays the detachment two known protagonist Savchenko 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.000
 his girlfriend Vanessa f 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.220
 Today almost never alone is exposed to the whole but mostly 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.939
 Support of the mask otherwise two well-known journeymen 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.939
 for example, South Korea or education 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.900
 r and 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.160
 new, however, is the beautiful Resl creative market as we find 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.890
 a very clear resemblance to the flags I write 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.009
 that relieves the man 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:20.409
 because they are very strong 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.220
 You will always like to fill a lot of variety since then 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.500
 times in a city which was previously hit by a blast of an atomic bomb 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.619
 was haunted 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.429
 then in a colorful and dangerously vegetated Jonge 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:35.629
 or in a cold circle area it just does not get boring and you 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.559
 does not feel full 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.459
 The weapons arsenal of Killzone 3 is really impressive 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.459
 ensured Pauli saw 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:46.750
 stationary guns 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.750
 Which of course invite you to take away 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.900
 Again, even new means of transportation are starting to be there 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.069
 for example, a jetpack of all "James Bond" and they help with that 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.620
 Complete missions alive and right here he shows his playing 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.299
 strengthen 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.620
 Everything will be in a playable company Tischer post-apocalyptic blockbuster 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.839
 from Hollywood Dr 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.469
 even if the opponents are not the absolute 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.469
 they are trained to seek protection 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.099
 that possible 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.529
 the difficulty is kept constant high and so it happens quickly 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.939
 Often one or the other ball faster catches the shortcoming 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.019
 and the 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.999
 may mean early loss in some consorts loss 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:27.579
 because participate in the World Cup 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.069
 the taxable son is then at all 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.169
 it was a bit overwhelmed at the beginning 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.870
 you will gradually become familiar with the controller 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.860
 the ego-shooter or Killzone 2 on PlayStation 3 has played 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.009
 feels used to it quickly 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.009
 Killzone 3 also adds Move support 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.959
 but what was too brutal for Germany? 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.909
 the German version has no scolding on tours comes to Kate on the market 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:59.139
 silently silencing the opponent with a brutal cut through his throat 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.459
 bring 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.609
 or by melee attacks reach the knife in various parts of the body 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:06.730
 that does not help 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.730
 so you simply break the mind of the guest 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:14.809
 coming 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.130
 The multiplayer has the following game modes ready 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.130
 the Iraq war war without relocation use 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.180
 this is about it 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.419
 eliminate so many enemies that a certain number of teams have been reached 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.020
 Warzone, however, offers the freshest MeeGo shooter multiplayer everyday here 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.900
 is it about that 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.479
 to achieve various random mission goals these become arbitrary 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.210
 Once laid down, a particular player is set as important completion goals 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.800
 then it is to conquer from Comte 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.289
 between 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.150
 now bring to the base 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.319
 for a change 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.919
 Price won orders wins the round thereby becomes a dynamic one 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.280
 Games history allows 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.400
 which can be persistent motivation 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.030
 Finally, there is the use mode 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.370
 here there are points to defend or conquer 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.389
 there are a total of four classes paramedics on average Artur engineer 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.479
 and sniper depending on which class you have chosen one 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.669
 Different ways available after the round succeed 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.020
 or did not finish successfully you have the opportunity 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.029
 let the map democratically vote each player has a vote and 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:24.000
 can be jerky 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.240
 if there is no interest, another is automatically selected 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.890
 After each round the earned points are credited 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:32.889
 career ladder 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.809
 that comes from Battlefield or other self-shooters 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:39.659
 Depending on which class you are deepening, the new skills and weapons are playing 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:40.860
 unlocked 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.320
 Overall, the multiplayer-part of their heath fun you should but 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.099
 watch out 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.590
 Unfortunately, a balanced system does not yet exist 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:51.659
 you have to be hard on one of Suva's maybe 33 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.030
 times in a row 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.369
 You have a visit from a coup 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:58.680
 do not know anything else to do with your time 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.470
 because the co-op mode of Killzone 3 is really fun and you play the whole 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.379
 Campaign together 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.309
 Salvator friendly involved the story which of course was a pity 

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:11.589
 but he will give you more time to breathe 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.270
 and who are not looking for a completed quarter they need the stock immediately 

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:27.389
 evacuated 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.760
 the graphics are fresher compared to part 2 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.960
 looks wonderful and does not need to hide 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.029
 the effects such as depth blur explosions 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.719
 or something refined especially the big things in the game make for 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:47.009
 open mouths and you get caught by sometimes even that one stops 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.009
 to enjoy the view 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.649
 knew this too late 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:53.620
 the reality disruptions 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.680
 I love this weapon at ARO 

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:07.589
 otherwise it would be healthy like its predecessors 

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:14.889
 well-tuned soundscape with beautiful audio aspects 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:17.689
 accompany the player on his way against the evil 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:19.060
 only move to the 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.240
 Norbert Roeder Buddhists in places so loud 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.240
 that these are some cats aunt 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.580
 complain 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.169
 these numbers 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:37.810
 netbooks gamers have their Gears of War series and playstation games theirs 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:38.960
 Killzone 3 will 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.990
 playing her lucky role play this role 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.289
 to be allowed to take 

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:47.300
 Killzone 3 has delighted in places open mouths 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.960
 and there is currently neither Florence in the cinema shooter-genre 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.080
 Here, after almost an hour of playing time saw the act and thanks for the 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.080
 Meaning magical post-apocalyptic upkeep 

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:03.399
 b 

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.419
 we have to get rid of the certificate
