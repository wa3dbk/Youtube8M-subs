00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
so you pick up just the pixels that you

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.860 
so you pick up just the pixels that you
want<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:39.620> okay<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:41.760> see<00:02:41.819> that's<00:02:42.510> one

have<00:03:01.590> my<00:03:01.980> align<00:03:02.489> sample<00:03:03.379> or<00:03:04.379> if<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.560> did<00:03:04.769> have<00:03:04.920> it

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
have my align sample or if I did have it

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.479 
have my align sample or if I did have it
checked<00:03:05.430> off<00:03:06.140> whenever<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.200> started<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.950> paint

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
checked off whenever I started to paint

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.809 
checked off whenever I started to paint
again<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.900> would<00:03:10.109> continue<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.130> paint<00:03:11.489> where<00:03:11.790> I

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
again it would continue to paint where I

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.089 
again it would continue to paint where I
left<00:03:12.120> off<00:03:12.359> from<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.319> in<00:03:13.470> other<00:03:13.590> words<00:03:13.829> it

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
left off from so in other words it

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.430 
left off from so in other words it
wouldn't<00:03:14.280> start<00:03:14.609> painting<00:03:14.970> another<00:03:15.440> person

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
wouldn't start painting another person

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.680 
wouldn't start painting another person
it<00:03:16.829> would<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.190> continue<00:03:17.370> painting<00:03:18.239> where<00:03:18.660> I

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
it would just continue painting where I

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.370 
it would just continue painting where I
stopped

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
stopped

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.430 
stopped
so<00:03:19.799> if<00:03:20.299> do<00:03:21.299> be<00:03:21.450> careful<00:03:21.810> if<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.049> have<00:03:22.079> your<00:03:22.410> a

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
so if do be careful if you have your a

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.620 
so if do be careful if you have your a
line<00:03:22.799> sample<00:03:23.430> checked<00:03:23.849> or<00:03:24.120> not<00:03:24.150> checked

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
line sample checked or not checked

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.539 
line sample checked or not checked
because<00:03:25.049> that's<00:03:25.260> very<00:03:25.470> important<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.160> know

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
because that's very important to know

gonna go over to my history palette and
just<00:03:31.319> back<00:03:31.620> up<00:03:31.859> to<00:03:32.220> where<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.400> adjusted<00:03:32.880> my

just back up to where I adjusted my

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.879 
just back up to where I adjusted my

the<00:05:12.100> area<00:05:12.490> of<00:05:12.870> paper<00:05:13.870> in<00:05:14.230> this<00:05:14.350> area<00:05:14.740> is<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:14.890> lot

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
the area of paper in this area is a lot

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.550 
the area of paper in this area is a lot
lighter<00:05:15.610> than<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.630> paper<00:05:16.870> that's<00:05:17.200> on<00:05:17.350> this

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.980 
lighter than the paper that's on this
area<00:05:17.830> so<00:05:18.130> when<00:05:18.370> I<00:05:18.400> start<00:05:18.760> to<00:05:18.910> click<00:05:19.120> and<00:05:19.360> add<00:05:19.540> a

texture it's almost it's very evident
that<00:05:23.169> I'm<00:05:23.290> covering<00:05:23.740> it<00:05:23.830> up<00:05:23.950> so<00:05:24.730> when<00:05:25.150> you<00:05:25.270> work

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
that I'm covering it up so when you work

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.300 
that I'm covering it up so when you work
in<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.660> clone<00:05:25.990> stamp<00:05:26.320> tool<00:05:26.410> it's<00:05:26.980> very

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
in the clone stamp tool it's very

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.120 
in the clone stamp tool it's very
important<00:05:27.790> that<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:28.270> constantly<00:05:29.130> resample

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
important that you constantly resample

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.040 
important that you constantly resample
different<00:05:30.640> areas<00:05:30.970> of<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.270> paper<00:05:31.480> so<00:05:31.840> it<00:05:31.960> will

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
different areas of the paper so it will

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.560 
different areas of the paper so it will
look<00:05:32.230> more<00:05:32.290> authentic<00:05:32.710> more<00:05:33.340> real<00:05:33.610> so<00:05:34.270> I<00:05:34.300> want

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
look more authentic more real so I want

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.620 
look more authentic more real so I want
to<00:05:34.660> copy<00:05:35.470> an<00:05:35.710> area<00:05:36.040> that's<00:05:36.190> a<00:05:36.370> lot<00:05:36.550> closer<00:05:36.880> to

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
to copy an area that's a lot closer to

to copy an area that's a lot closer to
what<00:05:37.780> I<00:05:37.810> want<00:05:37.870> to<00:05:38.080> cover<00:05:38.260> up<00:05:38.410> so<00:05:38.740> this<00:05:38.890> is<00:05:39.040> an
