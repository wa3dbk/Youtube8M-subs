hair is even worse but I would say

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.479 
hair is even worse but I would say
between<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:49.110> two<00:03:49.320> versions<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.950> movie<00:03:50.100> if

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
the theatrical version was like a solid

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.400 
the theatrical version was like a solid
two<00:03:53.160> star<00:03:53.489> maybe<00:03:54.090> two<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.600> half<00:03:54.690> star<00:03:55.019> movie
