2010<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.090> 2011<00:00:18.860> we<00:00:19.860> had<00:00:20.040> a<00:00:20.070> whole<00:00:20.280> series<00:00:20.520> of

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
2010 and 2011 we had a whole series of

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.390 
2010 and 2011 we had a whole series of
earthquakes<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.630> Christchurch<00:00:22.130> 180<00:00:23.130> people

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
earthquakes in Christchurch 180 people

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.560 
earthquakes in Christchurch 180 people
were<00:00:23.610> killed<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> could<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.420> been

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
were killed but it could have been

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.230 
were killed but it could have been
thousands<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.500> way<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.830> save<00:00:26.070> lives<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.730> by

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
thousands the way we save lives is by

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.640 
thousands the way we save lives is by
having<00:00:27.420> controlled<00:00:27.960> damage<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
having controlled damage in the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.529 
having controlled damage in the
buildings<00:00:29.040> so<00:00:29.460> when<00:00:29.610> the<00:00:29.730> building's<00:00:30.120> sway<00:00:30.360> on

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
buildings so when the building's sway on

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.060 
buildings so when the building's sway on
the<00:00:30.630> movement<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.170> some<00:00:31.470> damage<00:00:31.830> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the movement there is some damage and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.490 
the movement there is some damage and
it's<00:00:32.640> controlled<00:00:33.150> damage<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.080> the<00:00:34.200> building

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
it's controlled damage so the building

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.650 
it's controlled damage so the building
won't<00:00:34.680> collapse<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.640> problem<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
won't collapse the problem is that the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.760 
won't collapse the problem is that the
building's<00:00:37.020> may<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.470> to<00:00:37.739> be

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
building's may then have to be

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.920 
building's may then have to be
demolished<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> Christchurch<00:00:39.660> now

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
demolished if you go to Christchurch now

the<00:00:40.230> downtown<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> wasteland<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.629> we

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
the downtown is a wasteland and what we

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.930 
the downtown is a wasteland and what we
learned<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:44.070> good<00:00:44.340> enough<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.820> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
learned was it's not good enough just to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.210 
learned was it's not good enough just to

came up with a low damage system for
concrete<00:00:58.320> buildings<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.950> we<00:00:59.340> took<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> look<00:00:59.790> at

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
concrete buildings and we took a look at

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.639 
concrete buildings and we took a look at
that<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.360> we<00:01:00.510> said<00:01:00.719> let's<00:01:01.079> try<00:01:01.290> that<00:01:01.500> with

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that and we said let's try that with

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.950 
that and we said let's try that with
wood<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> University<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> Canterbury<00:01:03.690> I

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
rockin concrete systems but I was

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.290 
rockin concrete systems but I was
testing<00:01:10.860> wood<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.520> got<00:01:11.700> together<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
testing wood and we got together and

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.700 
testing wood and we got together and
they<00:01:12.420> said<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.720> me<00:01:12.840> why<00:01:13.110> don't<00:01:13.289> we<00:01:13.410> try<00:01:13.649> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
they said to me why don't we try the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.670 
they said to me why don't we try the
rockin<00:01:14.190> system<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:15.000> wood<00:01:15.210> every<00:01:16.020> time<00:01:16.289> we

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
rockin system with wood every time we

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.620 
rockin system with wood every time we
get<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.190> as<00:01:17.310> good<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.550> result<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.420> better

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
get just as good a result if not better

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.240 
get just as good a result if not better
then<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.380> got<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.740> reinforced<00:01:20.220> concrete

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
then we got with reinforced concrete

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.880 
then we got with reinforced concrete

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
press Lam is a name that we've come up

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.490 
press Lam is a name that we've come up
with<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.490> describe<00:01:23.840> pre-stressed<00:01:24.840> laminated

beams and columns and walls and when

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.109 
beams and columns and walls and when
they're<00:01:31.200> manufactured<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.280> leave<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> cavity

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
they're manufactured we leave a cavity

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.210 
they're manufactured we leave a cavity
in<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.330> center<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> beam<00:01:34.260> so<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.040> can

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
in the center of the beam so that we can

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.789 
in the center of the beam so that we can
thread<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.150> steel<00:01:36.570> rod<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.650> can

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
thread in a steel rod and then we can

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.710 
thread in a steel rod and then we can
stress<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.670> anchor<00:01:39.299> everything

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
stress it up and anchor everything

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.020 
stress it up and anchor everything
together<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.740> could<00:01:40.920> imagine<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.549> building

you can have straight tendons or you can
have<00:01:50.400> draped<00:01:50.700> attendants<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:52.080> can<00:01:52.229> do

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
have draped attendants and we can do

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.710 
have draped attendants and we can do
that<00:01:52.560> too<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.400> run<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.580> tendon<00:01:54.090> inside<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that too we can run a tendon inside the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
that too we can run a tendon inside the
hollow<00:01:54.930> beam<00:01:55.229> with<00:01:55.830> some<00:01:56.040> deviator<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.970> is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
hollow beam with some deviator so it is
