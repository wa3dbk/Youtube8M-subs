00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.314
 This Sunday, July 27th 

00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:10.594
 Hong Kong Coffee Black Tea Association will be hosted at New Mong Kok Plaza 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.900
 The 5th Hong Kong International Golden Tea King Competition North American Divisional Competition. 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.500
 We now have the chairman of the organizer, Joe Choi 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.300
 Demonstrate how to make a cup of authentic Hong Kong-style milk tea 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.200
 Hello everyone, I am Joe Choi, Chairman of the Hong Kong Coffee and Black Tea Association, North America. 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.420
 I am Anna Pow, Vice President of North America. 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.240
 In fact, Chairman of the Hong Kong Coffee and Black Tea Association, Huang Jia and Daping Gentleman 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.160
 The Golden Tea King competition is held every year. 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.940
 I hope to provide a platform for people from all over the world. 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.520
 Let more people know about Hong Kong-style milk tea culture. 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.160
 Furthermore, Hong Kong-style milk tea has been listed as a non-material cultural heritage. 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.380
 We hope that through the activities, the next generation of young people will be exposed to the milk tea culture. 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.120
 Let it be held. 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.500
 Judges' guidelines in the competition 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.840
 Is to summarize the opinions of different judgments, 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.400
 Choose the best milk tea from it. 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.120
 The judges are based on color, fragrance, concentration, 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.080
 Tea with milk distribution, scent and thickness score, 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.800
 Finally, sum all the scores together, 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.560
 Thereby selecting the winning milk tea. 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.160
 Hello, Joe, I saw a lot of different kinds of tea on the table. 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.440
 How can I choose a good tea ratio? 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.840
 Depending on the blending formula of different people, 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.920
 I know some people will mix three different teas, 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.080
 Some people will use seven or eight kinds of tea. 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.960
 Let me introduce the five kinds of tables on the market, 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.320
 The restaurant will use the tea. 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.000
 On the far left is "young tea." 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.680
 "Young tea" mainly brings color and taste to milk tea. 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.080
 You can see that "young tea" is a little younger than other species. 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.080
 The middle is the "coarse tea". 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.000
 Bring a fragrant taste to the tea. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.760
 In the middle of "young tea" and "coarse tea" is "medium tea". 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.360
 It is a balance between "young tea" and "coarse tea". 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.880
 It has a tea flavor and aroma. 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.480
 The two names on the right are called "Golden Tea" and "Little Gold Tea". 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.280
 They are very similar to "coarse tea" and are a kind of "coarse tea". 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.160
 And they are more fragrant than "coarse tea" 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.600
 However, if the amount is too much, the tea will become bitter and rough. 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.120
 Then your tea will generally be purchased there? 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.920
 All our tea is shipped in Sri Lanka. 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.560
 This is also the origin of the name "Xi Leng Black Tea". 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.960
 Then we have Joe to show us a cup of Hong Kong-style milk tea. 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.360
 The tea used for tea has: 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.360
 stove, 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:42.000
 Teapot (the industry will use two pots because of the need to "catch tea"), 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:54.760
 Tea bags (sometimes misunderstood because of the appearance of stockings, milk tea is made with stockings), 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 Tea circle, 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.080
 Light milk and tea. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.360
 The water temperature must reach the boiling point, and only the hookah needs to be cooked again. 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.160
 The origin of the name "stocking milk tea" 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
 It is because the tea bag has changed color after a long time. 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:36.400
 In the 1960s and 1970s, tea masters used tea bags to make tea. 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:46.320
 When the foreigner goes through the tea stall, he sees the colored tea bag. 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.720
 I mistakenly thought that the tea master was brewing tea with stockings. 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.520
 Over time, Hong Kong-style milk tea has changed into "stocking milk tea." 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.560
 In fact, the ladies may be more clear than me, 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.800
 If the wearing stockings encounter hot water, it will be damaged. 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.800
 Why do you need to raise the teapot to drop the tea at high altitude? 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.960
 In fact, this action is not specifically for the guests to perform demonstrations. 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.280
 Tea master pours tea into another pot at high altitude 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.400
 Mainly want to bring air into the milk tea, 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.600
 Make the tea more slippery and taste stronger. 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:42.280
 Because of the height of each person and the cooking time, 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.520
 Will the teapot be as high as possible? 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:58.360
 In fact, as long as you try differently with different heights, 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.880
 A cup of smooth milk tea will be brewed. 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.480
 The timer accurately counts us in the cooking tea to prevent tea from cooking for too long. 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.480
 How long does it take to cook? 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.840
 As I said earlier, there is no rule on cooking time. 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.440
 My personal approach will allow tea to be completed in ten minutes. 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.920
 Starting from the boiling point of the water, 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.920
 I will "crash" the tea two or three times. 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.920
 Boil it again for about five minutes. 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.920
 Then "crash" the tea three times, 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.600
 Then boil it, lick it, 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.800
 In general, a pot of tea will be completed in ten minutes. 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.500
 I tried to make milk tea at home. 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.020
 But there is no utensil for making milk tea at home. 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.900
 Is there a way to brew tea at home? 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.320
 Yes, but the most important thing is the water temperature. 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:11.040
 Many people mistakenly think that the water in the kettle in the home reaches enough temperature to brew tea. 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.860
 But generally speaking, the water in the pot is only 80 degrees Celsius to 90 degrees Celsius. 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:21.000
 If you want to brew milk tea at home, you must first boil the water to boiling point. 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.880
 As water for tea, 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:30.240
 I will choose to use some utensils to replace "teacha" with 焗茶. 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.720
 Then he "sweet" the taste of tea. 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:43.600
 If there is a small pot in the house, it can be adjusted according to the appropriate amount. 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.660
 Try "crashing tea." 

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.280
 To make a good cup of milk tea, just use your heart. 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.920
 Know the steps of refining and understand the reasons, 

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.380
 It is a milk tea that is excellent, fragrant and tasteful. 

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.260
 After watching Joe's wonderful milk tea demonstration, 

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.640
 Don’t miss the Sunday at Xinwangjiao Square. 

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.640
 International Golden Tea King Contest.
