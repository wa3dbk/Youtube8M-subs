causes the six to nine pound of weight

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.990 
causes the six to nine pound of weight
gained<00:01:39.680> primarily<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> trunk<00:01:41.250> per<00:01:41.520> year

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and often it also causes a slowing or

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.810 
and often it also causes a slowing or
kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.259> mellowing<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.890> behavior<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.579> what

I do is I take a little ultrasound
device<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.440> I've<00:04:03.980> scanned<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.459> arteries<00:04:04.820> to

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
device and I've scanned the arteries to

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.759 
device and I've scanned the arteries to
see<00:04:05.090> if<00:04:05.150> there's<00:04:05.329> any<00:04:05.450> plot<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:06.320> tells<00:04:06.560> me<00:04:06.709> if

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
see if there's any plot it tells me if

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.060 
see if there's any plot it tells me if
there's<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:06.980> risk<00:04:07.220> of<00:04:07.400> stroke<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:09.070> certainly

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
there's a risk of stroke and I certainly

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.310 
there's a risk of stroke and I certainly
make<00:04:10.370> sure<00:04:10.549> that<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.970> patient<00:04:11.510> is<00:04:11.900> doing

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
make sure that the patient is doing

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.659 
make sure that the patient is doing
monthly<00:04:12.590> self<00:04:13.010> exams<00:04:13.400> for<00:04:13.519> lumps<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.090> gets<00:04:14.989> a

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
monthly self exams for lumps and gets a

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.259 
monthly self exams for lumps and gets a
annual<00:04:16.669> mammogram<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.489> think<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.820> risk<00:04:20.060> of

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
annual mammogram and I think the risk of

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.470 
annual mammogram and I think the risk of
a<00:04:20.539> complication<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.530> is<00:04:21.650> very

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
a complication of that is very
