French fishing the like itself is in the
middle<00:01:05.420> of<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.770> farias<00:01:06.770> that's<00:01:06.979> why<00:01:07.160> it's

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
middle of a farias that's why it's

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.419 
middle of a farias that's why it's
actually<00:01:07.729> now<00:01:07.880> i'm<00:01:07.940> like<00:01:08.240> in<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.479> woods<00:01:08.750> and
