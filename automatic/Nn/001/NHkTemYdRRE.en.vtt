 Here we will explain how to study English for exams here 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:22.920
 Well English that has been bother Well first year of study to than words that do not usually use 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:31.310
 Is a first-grade student who has done a good job 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.310
 As it is strengthening, it is very important to study according to your level 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:45.120
 What do you want me to do first is to review English words and English grammar 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.590
 I have been studying from the first grade ever 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:54.440
 Really from here 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:58.870
 Well I think that Na you can review all if there about a week, but a child that has been lazy so far 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.570
 After all, I have to take time here 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.690
 Because I will never improve my grades 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:12.880
 Let's do it here so as not to pull your hand 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:19.810
 As a method , a text that contains English words and English grammar for acquisition measures 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.560
 The saying is can Well and do one way to buy these things because they sell in bookstores 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.170
 Repeat there if 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.759
 This to in 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.759
 I think I will be able to 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.659
 Once that's done, let's just unravel the next past 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.640
 For example Well 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:44.400
 In the case of English, it's just time allocation 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.600
 It is very important to say that you can become a long sentence, and it is a question of the past to compensate for both 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.730
 is 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.850
 This will definitely increase the score 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:57.530
 Please do earnestly Note 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.610
 Grammars that do not know words or do not know when going 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:06.570
 Such a of the bed which I think comes out a lot 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:14.210
 Let's put together unfairly 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.210
 I think If you leave to be able to later review and Na or Ikeru remember efficiently 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:24.790
 In the end a is still the past surface 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:27.610
 The last is sold to Ehon'ya's like in I think there is a limited number of 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.260
 Long reading problems 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:36.710
 And listening problems Please buy something for these two 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:42.560
 Article after all English 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:45.790
 About half of the democratic problem is the problem of solving long sentences 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:51.480
 If you lose points in the long sentence 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.980
 Since the pass will be have sugar content it is important to train each here to 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.030

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.090
 Please go problem Collection 8 anyway firmly say so 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.660
 After listening problem 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.250
 Very much because this is also not to do usually 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.610
 Also it is good once a day because the ability is is not attached 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.710
 For example 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:21.730
 Also we are good at teaching materials for listening to voice say Oh like a speed-learning 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:23.450

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.460
