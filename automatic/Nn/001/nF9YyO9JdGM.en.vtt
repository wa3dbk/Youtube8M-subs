00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.279 
a custom color scheme and this video I'm
pretty<00:00:30.060> much<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.539> explaining<00:00:31.170> that

and showing what I've done so far so the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.729 
and showing what I've done so far so the
kit<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:38.870> built<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> painted<00:00:40.350> right

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
kit that I built and painted right

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.209 
kit that I built and painted right
before<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.160> got<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.879> O<00:00:42.140> was<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.710> real<00:00:43.920> grade

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
before I got the O was the real grade

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.860 
before I got the O was the real grade
gundam<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:46.559> i<00:00:47.070> was<00:00:47.190> building<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.180> as

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
gundam and as i was building that and as

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.479 
gundam and as i was building that and as
i<00:00:49.260> was<00:00:49.410> looking<00:00:49.710> at<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> Oh<00:00:49.980> before<00:00:50.309> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
i was looking at the Oh before I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.600 
i was looking at the Oh before I
actually<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.649> thought<00:00:52.649> wouldn't<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.550> be

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
actually got it I thought wouldn't it be

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.540 
actually got it I thought wouldn't it be
cool<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.449> could<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.050> real<00:00:55.620> grade<00:00:55.980> style

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
cool if I could do a real grade style

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.650 
cool if I could do a real grade style
color<00:00:57.030> scheme<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.920> master<00:00:58.920> grade<00:00:59.160> Theo

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
color scheme on master grade Theo

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.070 
color scheme on master grade Theo
meaning<00:01:00.660> instead<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.320> using<00:01:02.750> one<00:01:03.750> shade

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
meaning instead of just using one shade

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.160 
meaning instead of just using one shade
of<00:01:04.229> yellow<00:01:04.670> using<00:01:05.750> multiple<00:01:06.750> shades<00:01:06.960> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
of yellow using multiple shades of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.990 
of yellow using multiple shades of
yellow<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:10.369> obviously<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.490> lot<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.939> these

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
yellow and obviously a lot of these

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.690 
yellow and obviously a lot of these
parts<00:01:12.330> are<00:01:12.540> kind<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.930> big<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.200> blank<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.549> can

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
parts are kind of big and blank so I can

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.410 
parts are kind of big and blank so I can
scribe<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.720> some<00:01:15.960> new<00:01:16.080> panel<00:01:16.470> lines<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.040> then

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
scribe on some new panel lines and then

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.200 
scribe on some new panel lines and then
go<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.689> multiple<00:01:19.470> shades<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.860> yellow<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.369> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
go the multiple shades of yellow and so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.890 
go the multiple shades of yellow and so
that's<00:01:21.450> what<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:21.720> doing<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.759> I<00:01:23.759> haven't<00:01:24.720> done

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that's what I'm doing and I haven't done

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.440 
that's what I'm doing and I haven't done
very<00:01:25.080> much<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.909> let's<00:01:26.909> say<00:01:27.060> I've<00:01:27.180> scribe

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
very much but let's say I've scribe

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450 
very much but let's say I've scribe
panel<00:01:27.810> lines<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.259> all<00:01:28.290> these<00:01:28.619> gray<00:01:28.920> parts<00:01:29.340> I

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
panel lines on all these gray parts I

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.310 
panel lines on all these gray parts I
just<00:01:29.670> described<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> pen<00:01:30.659> aligns<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.110> them

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
just described the pen aligns on them

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.190 
just described the pen aligns on them
primed<00:01:31.619> them<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.750> basically<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.170> doing

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
primed them and basically what I'm doing

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.190 
primed them and basically what I'm doing
is<00:01:36.229> I'm<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.590> taking<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.430> regular<00:01:39.420> old<00:01:39.750> pencil

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
is I'm just taking a regular old pencil

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.999 
is I'm just taking a regular old pencil
and<00:01:40.700> drawing<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:42.000> where<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> want<00:01:43.439> my<00:01:43.500> panel

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and drawing out where I want my panel

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.270 
and drawing out where I want my panel
lines<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.399> go<00:01:45.170> as<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.619> all<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.070> is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
lines to go as you can see all this is

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.480 
lines to go as you can see all this is
drawn<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.149> that's<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.630> pencil<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.560> then

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
drawn in that's just pencil and then

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.789 
drawn in that's just pencil and then
I've<00:01:50.790> got<00:01:51.350> two<00:01:52.350> different<00:01:52.560> scribing<00:01:53.250> tools

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
I've got two different scribing tools

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.969 
I've got two different scribing tools
this<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.189> got<00:01:56.729> at<00:01:56.880> Home<00:01:57.149> Depot<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.079> it's

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
this I got at Home Depot it's a it's

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.120 
this I got at Home Depot it's a it's
actually<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.460> scriber<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:01.290> came<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.920> think

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
actually a scriber it came with I think

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.920 
actually a scriber it came with I think
three<00:02:02.430> different<00:02:02.579> tips<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.360> they're<00:02:03.810> all

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
three different tips and they're all

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.749 
three different tips and they're all
carbide<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:05.820> they're<00:02:06.630> pretty<00:02:07.200> tough<00:02:08.009> there's

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
carbide so they're pretty tough there's

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.199 
carbide so they're pretty tough there's
no<00:02:08.970> real<00:02:09.209> worry<00:02:09.810> about<00:02:10.050> those<00:02:10.259> bending<00:02:10.920> at<00:02:11.039> all

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
no real worry about those bending at all

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.809 
no real worry about those bending at all
and<00:02:12.299> it<00:02:12.719> basically<00:02:13.049> it's<00:02:13.340> if<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.489> get<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.760> to

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
and it basically it's if I get it to

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.459 
and it basically it's if I get it to
focus<00:02:15.000> it's<00:02:15.329> more<00:02:15.569> or<00:02:15.629> less<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> metal<00:02:16.170> spike

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
focus it's more or less a metal spike

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.839 
focus it's more or less a metal spike
and<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.359> really<00:02:18.719> useful<00:02:19.109> for<00:02:19.849> describing

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
and this is really useful for describing

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.410 
and this is really useful for describing
curves<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.409> you<00:02:22.650> know<00:02:22.859> squares<00:02:23.420> anytime

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
curves and you know squares anytime

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.170 
curves and you know squares anytime
you're<00:02:24.569> gonna<00:02:24.689> have<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.019> turn<00:02:25.829> a<00:02:25.890> corner<00:02:26.310> this

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
you're gonna have to turn a corner this

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.050 
you're gonna have to turn a corner this
is<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.510> scrubber<00:02:27.959> you'll<00:02:28.140> want<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.349> use<00:02:28.409> I

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
is the scrubber you'll want to use I

it looks kind of funny kind of looks
like<00:02:35.909> a<00:02:36.030> hook<00:02:36.389> but<00:02:37.260> uh<00:02:37.430> basically<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.579> just

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
like a hook but uh basically you just

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.879 
like a hook but uh basically you just
the<00:02:40.769> point<00:02:41.579> is<00:02:41.849> right<00:02:42.209> here<00:02:42.780> again<00:02:43.469> it's<00:02:43.739> not

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
the point is right here again it's not

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.369 
the point is right here again it's not
focusing<00:02:44.519> because<00:02:44.730> my<00:02:45.720> camera<00:02:46.049> stupid

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
focusing because my camera stupid

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.129 
focusing because my camera stupid
autofocus<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:47.189> uh<00:02:47.569> this<00:02:48.569> one's<00:02:48.810> really<00:02:49.019> good

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
autofocus but uh this one's really good

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.210 
autofocus but uh this one's really good
for<00:02:49.470> scrubbing<00:02:49.769> straight<00:02:50.459> lines<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.329> uh

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
for scrubbing straight lines and uh

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.729 
for scrubbing straight lines and uh
basically<00:02:53.220> using<00:02:53.519> these<00:02:53.669> two<00:02:53.939> together<00:02:54.739> I've

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
basically using these two together I've

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.770

is the Hasegawa tri tool and basically
this<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.859> just<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.159> set<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.669> metal<00:03:05.969> templates

tutorial<00:03:32.639> tomorrow<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.329> don't<00:03:33.900> really

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
tutorial tomorrow I don't really

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.839 
tutorial tomorrow I don't really
consider<00:03:34.260> myself<00:03:34.530> very<00:03:35.040> good<00:03:35.250> at<00:03:35.400> scribing

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
consider myself very good at scribing

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.610 
consider myself very good at scribing
but<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.209> know<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.629> basics<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.199> it<00:03:37.319> so<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.530> think

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
but I know the basics of it so I think

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.379 
but I know the basics of it so I think
I'd<00:03:37.919> get<00:03:38.069> away<00:03:38.189> with<00:03:38.459> doing<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:39.060> tutorial

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
I'd get away with doing a tutorial

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.580 
I'd get away with doing a tutorial
without<00:03:39.689> screwing<00:03:40.139> it<00:03:40.319> up<00:03:40.439> too<00:03:40.590> bad<00:03:41.090> but<00:03:42.090> uh

mistakes like right there you'll see
that<00:04:02.220> little<00:04:02.370> scratch<00:04:02.879> where<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.239> messed<00:04:03.509> up

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
that little scratch where I messed up

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.969 
that little scratch where I messed up
I'm<00:04:03.959> gonna<00:04:04.109> have<00:04:04.229> to<00:04:04.319> go<00:04:04.409> back<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.769> fill<00:04:04.949> that

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
in with putty I think there's another

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.270 
in with putty I think there's another
one<00:04:07.650> over<00:04:07.799> here

this guy is going to be going in and uh

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.440 
this guy is going to be going in and uh
using<00:04:33.470> masking<00:04:34.470> tape<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.040> I<00:04:35.520> just<00:04:35.760> use<00:04:36.000> blue

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
using masking tape and I just use blue

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.240 
using masking tape and I just use blue
painters<00:04:36.900> tape<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:39.350> basically<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.590> haven't

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
painters tape and basically I haven't

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.360 
painters tape and basically I haven't
actually<00:04:42.110> decided<00:04:43.110> where<00:04:43.680> I'm<00:04:43.920> gonna<00:04:44.070> put<00:04:44.160> the

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
actually decided where I'm gonna put the

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.340 
actually decided where I'm gonna put the
multiple<00:04:44.730> shades<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:45.060> yellow<00:04:45.180> but<00:04:45.600> I'm<00:04:46.230> gonna

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
multiple shades of yellow but I'm gonna

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.470 
multiple shades of yellow but I'm gonna
be<00:04:46.530> masking<00:04:47.070> off<00:04:47.220> like<00:04:47.730> for<00:04:47.910> example<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:48.360> would

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
be masking off like for example I would

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.760 
be masking off like for example I would
spray<00:04:48.720> this<00:04:48.960> whole<00:04:49.200> piece<00:04:51.020> maybe<00:04:52.020> this<00:04:52.380> shade

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
spray this whole piece maybe this shade

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.850 
spray this whole piece maybe this shade
of<00:04:52.800> yellow<00:04:53.070> this<00:04:53.460> basic<00:04:53.850> Gila<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.560> then<00:04:55.560> mask

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
of yellow this basic Gila and then mask

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.590 
of yellow this basic Gila and then mask
off<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.250> areas<00:04:56.610> that<00:04:56.640> I<00:04:56.820> want<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.090> keep<00:04:57.300> that

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
off the areas that I want to keep that

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.440 
off the areas that I want to keep that
shade<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.110> yellow<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.850> then<00:04:59.850> maybe<00:05:00.090> spray

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
shade of yellow and then maybe spray

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.830 
shade of yellow and then maybe spray
these<00:05:00.630> edge<00:05:00.870> parts<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:02.280> darker<00:05:03.240> yellow<00:05:03.270> or

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
these edge parts a darker yellow or

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.560 
these edge parts a darker yellow or
maybe<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.170> lighter<00:05:04.440> yellow<00:05:05.270> right<00:05:06.270> now<00:05:06.390> I'm

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
maybe a lighter yellow right now I'm

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.640 
maybe a lighter yellow right now I'm
thinking<00:05:06.930> I'm<00:05:06.990> probably<00:05:07.230> gonna<00:05:07.440> go<00:05:07.620> with

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
thinking I'm probably gonna go with

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.550 
thinking I'm probably gonna go with
three<00:05:07.950> shades<00:05:08.340> of<00:05:08.520> yellow<00:05:08.990> I'll<00:05:09.990> probably<00:05:10.290> do

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
three shades of yellow I'll probably do

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.160 
three shades of yellow I'll probably do
this<00:05:11.070> shade<00:05:11.340> of<00:05:11.370> yellow<00:05:11.610> right<00:05:11.910> here<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.420> then

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
this shade of yellow right here and then

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.900 
this shade of yellow right here and then
I'll<00:05:13.320> use<00:05:13.500> one<00:05:13.830> darker<00:05:14.250> shade<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.490> one

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
I'll use one darker shade and one

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.650 
I'll use one darker shade and one
lighter<00:05:15.180> shade<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:17.490> I'm<00:05:18.210> actually<00:05:18.390> thinking

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
lighter shade and I'm actually thinking

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.630 
lighter shade and I'm actually thinking
about<00:05:18.810> maybe<00:05:19.140> throwing<00:05:19.650> some<00:05:19.950> light<00:05:20.220> in<00:05:20.430> here

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
about maybe throwing some light in here

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.420 
about maybe throwing some light in here
not<00:05:20.850> very<00:05:21.180> much<00:05:21.390> but<00:05:21.750> just<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:22.500> few<00:05:22.950> places<00:05:23.190> I

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
not very much but just a few places I

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.280 
not very much but just a few places I
might<00:05:23.640> paint<00:05:24.360> some<00:05:24.540> of<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.690> armor<00:05:24.960> white<00:05:25.460> and

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
might paint some of the armor white and

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.960 
might paint some of the armor white and
yeah<00:05:28.290> that's<00:05:28.740> pretty<00:05:29.070> much<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.820> gist<00:05:30.030> of<00:05:30.180> it

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
yeah that's pretty much the gist of it

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.180 
yeah that's pretty much the gist of it
um<00:05:32.970> like<00:05:33.720> I<00:05:33.870> said<00:05:34.110> I'm<00:05:34.560> gonna<00:05:34.740> try<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:35.010> do<00:05:35.160> a

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
um like I said I'm gonna try and do a

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.550 
um like I said I'm gonna try and do a
scribing<00:05:35.820> tutorial<00:05:36.360> tomorrow<00:05:36.750> because<00:05:37.260> I've

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
scribing tutorial tomorrow because I've

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.320 
scribing tutorial tomorrow because I've
actually<00:05:37.740> already<00:05:38.310> had<00:05:38.670> people<00:05:38.880> ask<00:05:39.120> me<00:05:39.300> about

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
actually already had people ask me about

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.950 
actually already had people ask me about

some<00:05:46.410> more<00:05:46.650> to<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:46.800> panel<00:05:47.070> lines<00:05:47.190> I've<00:05:47.430> done

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
some more to the panel lines I've done

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.780 
some more to the panel lines I've done
on<00:05:47.850> the<00:05:47.970> feet<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:49.010> some<00:05:50.010> of<00:05:50.100> the<00:05:50.190> leg<00:05:50.400> armor

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
on the feet and some of the leg armor

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.110 
on the feet and some of the leg armor
right<00:05:50.940> here<00:05:52.280> scrub<00:05:53.280> some<00:05:53.460> more<00:05:53.610> panel<00:05:53.940> lines

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
right here scrub some more panel lines

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.650 
right here scrub some more panel lines
on<00:05:54.330> the<00:05:54.450> back<00:05:54.930> right<00:05:55.350> there

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
on the back right there

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.260 
on the back right there
on<00:05:57.660> the<00:05:57.750> back<00:05:57.930> of<00:05:57.960> that<00:05:58.110> ankle<00:05:59.030> stuff<00:06:00.030> like

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
on the back of that ankle stuff like

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.260 
on the back of that ankle stuff like
that<00:06:00.480> so<00:06:00.840> hopefully<00:06:01.430> that<00:06:02.430> by<00:06:02.790> the<00:06:02.910> time<00:06:03.120> I'm

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
that so hopefully that by the time I'm

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.170 
that so hopefully that by the time I'm
done<00:06:03.480> scribing<00:06:04.170> all<00:06:04.290> the<00:06:04.440> panel<00:06:04.740> lines<00:06:05.180> vo

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
done scribing all the panel lines vo

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.720 
done scribing all the panel lines vo
will<00:06:06.480> be<00:06:06.630> pretty<00:06:07.500> nicely<00:06:07.800> detailed<00:06:08.220> and<00:06:09.500> if<00:06:10.730> my

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
will be pretty nicely detailed and if my

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.990 
will be pretty nicely detailed and if my
masking<00:06:12.300> job<00:06:12.510> isn't<00:06:12.870> too<00:06:12.990> bad<00:06:13.640> it'll<00:06:14.640> come<00:06:14.880> out

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
masking job isn't too bad it'll come out

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.510 
masking job isn't too bad it'll come out
looking<00:06:15.420> more<00:06:16.170> or<00:06:16.290> less<00:06:16.440> like<00:06:16.710> a<00:06:16.740> real<00:06:17.190> grade

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
looking more or less like a real grade

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.900 
looking more or less like a real grade
vo<00:06:18.260> only<00:06:19.260> in<00:06:19.350> 1<00:06:19.560> to<00:06:19.650> 100<00:06:20.070> scale<00:06:20.220> instead<00:06:20.430> of<00:06:20.640> 1

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
vo only in 1 to 100 scale instead of 1

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.290 
vo only in 1 to 100 scale instead of 1
to<00:06:21.000> 144<00:06:21.510> scale<00:06:22.190> so<00:06:23.190> I<00:06:23.430> guess<00:06:23.700> that<00:06:23.880> about<00:06:24.000> does

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
to 144 scale so I guess that about does

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.110 
to 144 scale so I guess that about does
it<00:06:24.360> for<00:06:24.540> this<00:06:25.290> video<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:26.100> I<00:06:26.670> will<00:06:26.730> see<00:06:27.030> you

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
it for this video and I will see you

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.720 
it for this video and I will see you
guys<00:06:27.270> next<00:06:27.540> time
