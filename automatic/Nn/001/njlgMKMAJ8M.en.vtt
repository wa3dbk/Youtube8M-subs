00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.969
 very good basic like being here a 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.860
 new channel tutorial and a long time ago 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.320
 that I did not do one and good to study 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.670
 pretty much cloudy, so to speak and 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.040
 biology is not only this kind of 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.160
 tutorials but good a nutrient like 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.399
 clone or how to duplicate our rails 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.180
 be it the power this here the power 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:35.750
 real the detector rail and the activator the 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.390
 reactivator the detector and the activator and 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.680
 of the rebel power only these three 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.980
 guys and the engines are pretty 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.230
 simple can not be cloned or 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.690
 multiply the rail is common and circuit 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.239
 is that you can not and well as you see here 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.920
 that is the complete model and here it is 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.359
 of what would be the base then guys 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.030
 let's make the base and first explain 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.730
 How is duplication obtained? 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.749
 first the basis of how it duplicates to see 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.640
 First 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.649
 thing that they have to know in this block 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.930
 a transparent block as is the glass 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.700
 you can not place rails or 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.909
 hold clear enough here I can 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.100
 here I can not already then what if 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.830
 for example I now have here double 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.290
 block of these and I end up for example a 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.810
 piston of this true and now placed 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.210
 this here and simply blew the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.790
 active because it happens is from here as 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.220
 come moves and now yes then leave here 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.100
 a post and I put a crystal what is going to 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.650
 to pass is that I'm going to drop the rail already 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.720
 the guys with this principle we're going to 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.600
 can create 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.490
 our rails computer then 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.080
 guys the base as you see was here the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.820
 we're going to do around here so that 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.380
 see that it is not complicated at all 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.810
 a little cross always leave by the 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.930
 cross like that there perfect on this side goes 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.720
 a crystal then here goes another block 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.180
 perfect and then here goes another what 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.570
 as you want then in this 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.579
 block would say our sticky piston and 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.229
 here would go our other sticky piston 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.149
 then we have the structure made 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.340
 then with a normal rail we go to 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.400
 get us a block that is what I do not 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.140
 I'll occupy it let's make the blockade 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.200
 normal and then we put this such that 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.430
 so perfect you want to spend now 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.650
 we activate this piston 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.150
 is going to take this rail from here and then it's going to 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.190
 pull back and forward what 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.170
 same will happen with the one we place 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.810
 here backwards back to 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.360
 go ahead then what is the grace of 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.590
 do this, that is, there has to be a 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.880
 what is this or so not in this way he 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.910
 they will understand it and they will understand 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.700
 quite complicated and that quotes 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.739
 to explain better said but it 's pretty 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.920
 simple then now they have to know 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.450
 how to create a small system of a 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.700
 watch as you will know now that is the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.519
 repeater the repeater if you do not give a 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.600
 turn like this and activate it and you already have a 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.420
 watch or 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.650
 here and 10 with and we have a very very watch 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.240
 compact 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.580
 then guys what has to be what 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.430
 learned remember here between the 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.840
 energy and over here goes here 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.330
 enter and here it simply comes out 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.250
 then if I activate that I'm going to turn on 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.500
 the energy constantly beaten the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.370
 energy all the time and with this 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.370
 we form a 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.390
 a clock then with this principle what 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.520
 what we have to do is give energy to 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.170
 this and this block because that's what 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.210
 we wanted energy we give energy to 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.180
 piston here then now simply 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.640
 we unite it as they see like that and then here 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.230
 Now we just have to place the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.910
 blog so that way there perfect good 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.970
 let's always give you guys from a 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.180
 space more so either exist here or field of 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.739
 here 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.120
 such that this is not perfect for safety 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.069
 guys does very close can you 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.829
 fail and then how will they see going to happen 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.739
 will happen the following understands me 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.140
 two and now if I do well this happens like 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.019
 come is very very fast and excuse the 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.609
 sound let's get it down quickly 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.299
 download it vote that here perfect 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.099
 night as you see this happens and now if what 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.379
 let's hope it goes out there 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.530
 perfect there it's off as they see ya 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.329
 had our reston system 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.859
 finished then now how will I see 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.090
 that smaller one works the same but 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.810
 sometimes it can fail 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.270
 and fail this system then what are we going 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.420
 to do now we take out what 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.940
 we change the prime time line set 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:38.890
 perfect and I'm going to get out and they'll see 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.350
 see they will take me out of the girl from scratch and 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.780
 now I'm in survival mode we activate 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.720
 our super artifact trainers 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.870
 and just placed is here and it came out 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.920
 bleeding as you see there are two now I have 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.200
 another let's go see let's go see 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.780
 here I had one I had one life I have ten 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.560
 how to see is very very rabid and I go 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.190
 here 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.500
 a video 44 and I'm positioning and how 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.980
 come is very simple I would be nine 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.980
 guys 9 that is we do not grab a burrada 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.930
 and obviously it has a giant bug 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:16.270
 but good many people get a lot and 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:19.090
 externÃ³ 91 is not cool either is here 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.590
 As I was finishing there, I know how it goes like this 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.110
 that's the way it is, everything is fine 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.000
 the day and if they want there they see how they see 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.320
 to only one and now how much do I have to see 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.440
 let's find more here go through here 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.660
 here 20 I already have 20 the same goes for the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.910
 another let's show it so they can see that 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.160
 it's true sides 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.960
 and here let's make another put another 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.330
 we put another and there I explain now 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.130
 for 15 that now because one of these does not 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.630
 it's magic that what happens is that 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.850
 we move is terrible then 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.380
 this risk connects with this but at 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.150
 moment to connect you want to move 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.500
 around here and he moves it for her 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.520
 happens is that it moves at the same time 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.470
 for both sides then what happens 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.870
 can 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.020
 the games fail and it takes like climbing 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:05.040
 two then this is the block this 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:07.950
 European and this one that is so fast 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.360
 that if you can not see how they see that 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:14.040
 what happens then, for example, here 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.570
 I have one that I had already been 16 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.390
 there activator happens exactly the same 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.940
 that is, no difference keeps happening 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.860
 but if I put a normal one what what 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.040
 I said, nothing will happen to them like 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.930
 well in each one and also that one with 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.300
 this new one is unfortunately 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.070
 guys will not work and we do 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.500
 this is what we find and it does not work 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.420
 and nothing guys that tutorial is very 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.540
 simple and very turbid I hope that I have 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.550
 liked the original design is not my work 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.800
 is where the link of the 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.720
 person who does original design that is 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.270
 of alpha ms at least that I saw the 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.740
 video and nothing guys I hope you have 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.510
 liked the tutorial that I'm going to use 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.430
 although a person lives some for me 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.830
 survival because I need to make a 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.690
 small iron farm before that 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.100
 change 1.8 and they tried enough iron 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.320
 at least to have for more 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.000
 go ahead and nothing guys I hope you 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.560
 have liked this tutorial if you liked it 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.600
 the idea would be very many like 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.020
 even life subscribe and see you 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:15.260
 in the next lime video and the 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.860
 guys to win even if it's ugly but not 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.900
 he 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.230
 I honestly see people like Paris as 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.850
 the x-raid that can observe everything and 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.280
 it's also a giant bug that deals 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.870
 enough and this I do not think it's minor 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.580
 so nothing guys I hope you have 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.830
 liked if you liked the grace as you 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.750
 I say your likes and nervous upbringing and we 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:36.200
 we see in the next cover tutorial 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:38.750
 of 170 24 clear clear because I do not feel 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.890
 your channel serial so nobody 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.890
 We see so far ciao
