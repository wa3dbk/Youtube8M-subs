in there you've got to get a knife or
screwdriver<00:00:48.570> or<00:00:49.260> something<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.340> there

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.190 

and<00:00:53.960> lift<00:00:54.320> up<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.800> bar

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.280 

it's<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.860> clip<00:00:59.570> see<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.660> moving<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
it's a little clip see it moving it

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.729 
it's a little clip see it moving it
moves<00:01:01.559> pretty<00:01:01.920> easily<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> wants<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.739> snap

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
moves pretty easily and it wants to snap

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.710 
moves pretty easily and it wants to snap
back<00:01:04.769> down<00:01:05.339> when<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:05.909> not<00:01:06.090> putting<00:01:06.510> tension

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
back down when I'm not putting tension

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.359 
back down when I'm not putting tension
on<00:01:07.080> it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.090 

if<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.969> can<00:01:12.119> get

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
if you can get

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.480 
if you can get
get<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.640> guy<00:01:14.880> up<00:01:15.240> high<00:01:15.690> enough

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.750 

see<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.640> there<00:01:21.760> I<00:01:21.910> got<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.300> thing<00:01:22.570> lift<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.960> up

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
see in there I got that thing lift it up

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.360 
see in there I got that thing lift it up
then<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:27.610> can<00:01:27.790> pull<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.570> wiggle<00:01:29.370> this

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
then we can pull and wiggle this

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:39.500 
then we can pull and wiggle this
mechanism<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.670> should<00:01:34.060> work<00:01:35.370> itself

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.970 

that<00:01:40.140> plate

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.820 

they<00:01:46.370> may<00:01:46.550> not<00:01:46.700> have<00:01:46.760> it<00:01:47.120> high<00:01:47.270> enough

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.260 

there<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.430> go<00:01:53.580> just<00:01:54.380> working<00:01:55.380> off<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.800> plate

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.330 

we're<00:01:58.780> doing<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.170> pulling<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.650> there<00:01:59.860> we<00:01:59.950> go<00:02:00.040> it

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
we're doing it pulling it there we go it

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.000 
we're doing it pulling it there we go it
released<00:02:00.640> now<00:02:01.540> this<00:02:01.720> plate<00:02:02.049> is<00:02:02.500> still<00:02:02.799> going

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
released now this plate is still going

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.460 
released now this plate is still going
to<00:02:03.070> be<00:02:03.190> attached<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.570> inside<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.290> the

is still in there I didn't remove it I
just<00:02:20.050> lifted<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:21.030> release<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.989> part<00:02:23.380> from

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
just lifted it to release this part from

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.340 
just lifted it to release this part from
the<00:02:24.190> other<00:02:24.340> part<00:02:24.700> now<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.840> we've<00:02:25.959> got<00:02:26.140> this

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.330 
the other part now that we've got this
off<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.620> vehicle

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
off the vehicle

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.900 
off the vehicle
there's<00:02:27.580> your<00:02:27.760> lock<00:02:27.940> cylinder<00:02:29.519> grab<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.730> lock

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
there's your lock cylinder grab the lock

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.360 
there's your lock cylinder grab the lock
cylinder<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.540> turn<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.900> 90<00:02:32.260> degrees
