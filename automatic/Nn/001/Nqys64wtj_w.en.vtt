essence one and this one is 499 I found

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.160 
essence one and this one is 499 I found
this<00:01:28.770> at<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:28.950> Fred<00:01:29.250> Meyer<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.790> I'm<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.960> going

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
this at my Fred Meyer and I'm just going

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:57.719 
this at my Fred Meyer and I'm just going
to<00:01:31.229> start<00:01:31.439> applying<00:01:33.530> very<00:01:34.530> very<00:01:35.130> watery

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.389 

so<00:01:58.729> if<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.060> look<00:01:59.210> at<00:01:59.360> my<00:01:59.479> eyes<00:02:02.080> they<00:02:03.080> are

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
so if you look at my eyes they are

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.190 
so if you look at my eyes they are
pretty<00:02:04.399> different<00:02:04.940> right<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:05.570> mean<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:05.960> one

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
pretty different right I mean this one

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.979 
pretty different right I mean this one
is<00:02:06.470> huge<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.190> does<00:02:07.430> look<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.850> little<00:02:08.030> spider<00:02:08.720> eat

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
is huge it does look a little spider eat

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.890 
is huge it does look a little spider eat
at<00:02:09.170> first<00:02:09.519> but<00:02:10.519> I<00:02:10.729> think<00:02:11.000> this<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.269> because<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
at first but I think this is because the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.770 
at first but I think this is because the
formula<00:02:12.440> is<00:02:12.470> fairly<00:02:13.190> new<00:02:13.820> I've<00:02:14.209> used<00:02:14.570> this

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
formula is fairly new I've used this

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.009 
formula is fairly new I've used this
mascara<00:02:15.200> only<00:02:15.560> twice<00:02:16.209> or<00:02:17.209> three<00:02:17.450> times<00:02:17.480> and

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
mascara only twice or three times and

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.110 
mascara only twice or three times and
the<00:02:18.320> formula<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:19.040> still<00:02:19.370> pretty<00:02:19.580> wet<00:02:19.850> there's

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
the formula is still pretty wet there's

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.870 
the formula is still pretty wet there's
still<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.660> lot<00:02:21.019> in<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.470> tube<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.610> comes

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
still a lot in the tube and so it comes

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.199 
still a lot in the tube and so it comes
out<00:02:23.090> very<00:02:23.150> wet<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:25.040> lot<00:02:25.370> comes<00:02:25.640> out<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.120> as

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
out very wet and a lot comes out so as

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.110 
out very wet and a lot comes out so as
you<00:02:26.330> can<00:02:26.450> tell<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.870> does<00:02:27.170> look<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.709> little

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
you can tell it does look a little

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.550 
you can tell it does look a little
spidery<00:02:29.120> but<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.360> think<00:02:29.660> that's<00:02:29.810> very<00:02:29.900> fixable

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
spidery but I think that's very fixable

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.990 
spidery but I think that's very fixable
especially<00:02:31.100> if<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.250> wipe<00:02:31.400> off<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.730> wand

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
especially if you wipe off the wand

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.630 
especially if you wipe off the wand
before<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.959> use<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.230> um<00:02:33.739> so<00:02:34.250> as<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.459> can<00:02:34.580> tell

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
before you use it um so as you can tell

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.870 
before you use it um so as you can tell
my<00:02:35.120> eye<00:02:35.150> with<00:02:35.720> no<00:02:35.930> mascara<00:02:36.380> on<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.069> then<00:02:37.640> I

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.650

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
just wouldn't really build as this one

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.550 
just wouldn't really build as this one
would<00:05:05.210> if<00:05:05.330> you<00:05:05.420> just<00:05:05.600> keep<00:05:05.690> putting<00:05:05.990> more<00:05:06.290> it's

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
would if you just keep putting more it's

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.310 
would if you just keep putting more it's
gonna<00:05:06.740> be<00:05:07.100> like<00:05:07.490> more<00:05:07.880> dramatic<00:05:08.330> but<00:05:08.900> this<00:05:09.110> one

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
gonna be like more dramatic but this one

dramas definitely the essence and even
though<00:05:20.630> both<00:05:20.840> are<00:05:21.050> black<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:22.010> colors<00:05:22.310> are

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
though both are black the colors are

though both are black the colors are
both<00:05:22.640> black<00:05:22.940> for<00:05:23.210> both<00:05:23.360> this<00:05:24.140> one<00:05:24.350> looks<00:05:24.560> a<00:05:24.680> lot

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
both black for both this one looks a lot

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.410 
both black for both this one looks a lot
more<00:05:24.920> dramatic<00:05:25.220> than<00:05:25.610> this<00:05:25.790> one<00:05:26.000> so<00:05:26.030> I've

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
more dramatic than this one so I've

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.110 
more dramatic than this one so I've
never<00:05:26.600> actually<00:05:26.870> um<00:05:27.560> tried<00:05:28.490> these<00:05:28.670> products

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
never actually um tried these products

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.700 
never actually um tried these products
side-by-side<00:05:29.840> this<00:05:29.990> is<00:05:30.110> my<00:05:30.230> first<00:05:30.410> time<00:05:30.530> today

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
side-by-side this is my first time today

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.110 
side-by-side this is my first time today
I<00:05:30.800> just<00:05:31.010> wanted<00:05:31.310> to<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.670> was<00:05:31.820> kind<00:05:32.030> of<00:05:32.060> curious

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
I just wanted to I was kind of curious

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.060 
I just wanted to I was kind of curious
for<00:05:32.600> myself<00:05:32.900> to<00:05:33.470> see<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.740> difference<00:05:34.010> between

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
for myself to see the difference between

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.370 
for myself to see the difference between
the<00:05:34.550> two<00:05:34.790> since<00:05:35.180> they<00:05:35.330> are<00:05:35.510> kind<00:05:35.960> of<00:05:36.170> I<00:05:36.350> don't

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
the two since they are kind of I don't

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.160 
the two since they are kind of I don't
know<00:05:36.620> if<00:05:36.920> anyone<00:05:37.250> copied<00:05:37.670> like<00:05:38.660> who<00:05:38.840> copied

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
know if anyone copied like who copied

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.700 
know if anyone copied like who copied
who<00:05:39.350> or<00:05:39.650> if<00:05:40.070> it<00:05:40.400> was<00:05:40.490> just<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:40.820> coincidence<00:05:40.970> but

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
who or if it was just a coincidence but

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.770 
who or if it was just a coincidence but
it<00:05:42.710> seems<00:05:42.920> like<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:43.250> packaging<00:05:44.090> is<00:05:44.510> pretty

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
it seems like the packaging is pretty

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.920 
it seems like the packaging is pretty
similar<00:05:45.700> the<00:05:46.700> brushes<00:05:46.970> are<00:05:47.420> pretty<00:05:47.630> similar

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
similar the brushes are pretty similar

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.900 
similar the brushes are pretty similar
but<00:05:48.200> the<00:05:48.590> results<00:05:49.070> are<00:05:49.190> not<00:05:49.460> so

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
but the results are not so

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.510 
but the results are not so
the<00:05:51.030> two<00:05:51.240> I'm<00:05:51.510> definitely<00:05:52.020> gonna<00:05:52.470> go<00:05:52.770> with<00:05:53.070> the

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
the two I'm definitely gonna go with the

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.350 
the two I'm definitely gonna go with the
lash<00:05:53.910> mania<00:05:54.680> reloaded<00:05:55.680> by<00:05:55.890> essence<00:05:56.370> it's

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
lash mania reloaded by essence it's

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.930 
lash mania reloaded by essence it's
cheaper<00:05:57.870> bigger<00:05:58.680> better<00:05:59.100> more<00:05:59.580> dramatic

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
cheaper bigger better more dramatic

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.480 
cheaper bigger better more dramatic
results<00:06:00.420> and<00:06:00.570> I<00:06:01.020> don't<00:06:01.560> know<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:01.860> kind<00:06:02.220> of<00:06:02.280> like

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
results and I don't know I kind of like

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.960 
results and I don't know I kind of like
the<00:06:02.640> wet<00:06:02.940> formula<00:06:03.570> more<00:06:04.470> than<00:06:04.950> kind<00:06:05.490> of<00:06:05.580> like<00:06:05.760> I

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
the wet formula more than kind of like I

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.730 
the wet formula more than kind of like I
think<00:06:06.360> it<00:06:06.540> might<00:06:06.690> be<00:06:06.750> the<00:06:06.990> brush<00:06:07.260> though<00:06:07.560> I

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
think it might be the brush though I

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.050 
think it might be the brush though I
think<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:08.040> might<00:06:08.190> be<00:06:08.220> the<00:06:08.430> brushes<00:06:08.760> that<00:06:08.790> have

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
think it might be the brushes that have

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.060 
think it might be the brushes that have
the<00:06:09.210> big<00:06:09.390> difference<00:06:09.690> because<00:06:09.870> i<00:06:10.320> feel<00:06:11.040> like

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
the big difference because i feel like

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.680 
the big difference because i feel like
the<00:06:11.600> l'oreal<00:06:12.600> has<00:06:12.930> smaller<00:06:13.710> bristles<00:06:14.690> so

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
the l'oreal has smaller bristles so

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.360 
the l'oreal has smaller bristles so
therefore<00:06:15.930> is<00:06:16.230> gonna<00:06:16.410> give<00:06:16.620> you<00:06:16.710> like<00:06:16.890> smaller

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
therefore is gonna give you like smaller

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.410 
therefore is gonna give you like smaller
um<00:06:18.590> lash<00:06:19.590> volume<00:06:20.190> and<00:06:20.400> this<00:06:20.550> one<00:06:20.730> is<00:06:20.910> much<00:06:21.180> much

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
um lash volume and this one is much much

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:32.300 
um lash volume and this one is much much
bigger<00:06:21.630> so<00:06:22.350> let<00:06:22.530> me<00:06:22.560> compare<00:06:22.860> them<00:06:23.040> again<00:06:31.310> so

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
bigger so let me compare them again so

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.370 
bigger so let me compare them again so
yeah<00:06:32.730> the<00:06:32.970> l'oreal<00:06:33.390> definitely<00:06:33.840> the<00:06:33.960> bristles

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
yeah the l'oreal definitely the bristles

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.570 
yeah the l'oreal definitely the bristles
are<00:06:34.530> closer<00:06:34.770> together<00:06:35.040> and<00:06:35.310> they're<00:06:35.430> a<00:06:35.460> little

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
are closer together and they're a little

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.450 
are closer together and they're a little
smaller<00:06:36.030> and<00:06:36.270> the<00:06:37.260> essence<00:06:37.680> one<00:06:37.890> has<00:06:38.160> more

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
smaller and the essence one has more

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.340 
smaller and the essence one has more
bigger<00:06:39.000> bristles<00:06:39.510> and<00:06:39.690> they're<00:06:39.810> all<00:06:39.960> kind<00:06:40.260> of

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
bigger bristles and they're all kind of

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.050 
bigger bristles and they're all kind of
far<00:06:40.620> apart<00:06:40.770> from<00:06:41.010> each<00:06:41.220> other<00:06:41.370> so<00:06:41.700> maybe<00:06:41.910> it's

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
far apart from each other so maybe it's

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.240 
far apart from each other so maybe it's
the<00:06:42.150> bristles<00:06:42.510> maybe<00:06:43.290> it's<00:06:43.500> the<00:06:43.620> formula<00:06:44.070> I'm

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
the bristles maybe it's the formula I'm
