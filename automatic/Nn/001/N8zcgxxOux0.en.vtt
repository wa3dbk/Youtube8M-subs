00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 older begins in the central hospital of 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.240
 san isidro the medicine service of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.790
 stress and consists of a cabinet and a 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.519
 body of professionals to evaluate 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.950
 diagnose and treat the treatment 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.199
 of stress syndrome patients 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.210
 they come to the cabinet to the service of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.070
 Stress medicine derived by others 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.930
 doctors who do a pre-diagnosis and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.300
 we take care of evaluating 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.820
 correctly to the patient and follow the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.550
 therapeutic direction this is vital 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.080
 importance in the proposal that the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.070
 secretary of public health towards 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.079
 future is a subject and a thing very very very 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.510
 interesting because society really 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.079
 you are suffering or think you are suffering from stress 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.700
 and good always thinking the authorities 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.820
 in the neighbors there will be talks 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.520
 public to the general public where 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.870
 different members of the service between 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.539
 which I include myself we are going to give 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.600
 talks to society so they know 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.620
 what stress is about so that 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.210
 demystify that they know it's a 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.799
 normal reaction mechanism of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.820
 organism what happens that above 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.590
 a level 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.360
 symptoms but it's just like sugar in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.700
 blood the blood sugar is normal 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.860
 But if there's a lot, it's called diabetes. 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 stress is the same is a reaction 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.390
 mental and physical versus things to the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 threats past a level we call stress 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.890
 abnormal or pathological or distress and is what 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.180
 same as the string of a guitar the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.250
 string a guitar has to have a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.450
 tension so that it sounds good if the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.040
 tension is greater 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.110
 it sounds bad and it can even break 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.090
 well what we are going to work is that 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.950
 so that the guitar string of all 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.340
 we are in the proper care 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.170
 the stress syndrome the first thing 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.759
 harms the person is happiness a 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.399
 person with stress is not well not 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.320
 feels good is not happy just 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.259
 he just does not feel well he's tense 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.300
 he is nervous he does not enjoy he does not have 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.310
 projects and how is the drop that horada 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.259
 the stone many people do not go 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.840
 realizing that that is happening by 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.280
 that's important to know about stress 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.649
 that we 're going to go out to the community 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.869
 to say is this is this is this 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.700
 buzz that the symptoms look come without 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.020
 User manual when 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.210
 we are born 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.470
 one buys a software and has manual 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.390
 of the user the people do not have 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.400
 user's manual you have to learn to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.140
 manage in the medicine service of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.030
 stress the patient who arrives is 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.040
 studied is studied by tests 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.990
 cognitive psychology is studied by 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.390
 psychology specialists have 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.710
 guided and structured interviews but 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.380
 also in some cases they are made 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.290
 biological physical measurements to see 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.240
 how the body reacts to stress 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.580
 simulated standardized is to say what 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.110
 we do with the equipment that we have in the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.820
 hospital that is a polygraph that 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.310
 psycho scanner flame is measure 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.800
 artificially how is the reaction 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.020
 physical versus psychological stress of 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.790
 such or such a person according to that the 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.680
 people are divided into tense reactors 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.420
 and calm reactors is a little bit more than 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.100
 that but basically that's it and a reactor 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.440
 tense is what is popularly called 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.850
 it is not hot you are the heater is the 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.220
 person who at the same level of stress 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.360
 have more physical reaction that is to say 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.270
 same level of psychological stress 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.970
 perceived has more increase is greater than 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.340
 heart rate increased higher than 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.870
 cholesterol blood sugar and so on 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.790
 etcetera then when we 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.770
 we can biologically diagnose that 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.620
 we have 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.520
 let's say precise indications for that 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.520
 kind of people
