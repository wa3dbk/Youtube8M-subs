cup of Nutella I added in in a little at
a<00:01:09.030> time<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.500> blend<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.980> until<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.400> was

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
a time and I blend it until it was

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.720 
a time and I blend it until it was
completely<00:01:11.910> incorporated<00:01:13.220> I'm<00:01:14.220> using<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
completely incorporated I'm using a

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.180 
completely incorporated I'm using a
stand<00:01:15.000> mixer<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:16.050> mix<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
stand mixer to mix all this up with the

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.340 
stand mixer to mix all this up with the
whisk<00:01:17.520> attachment<00:01:17.780> but<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.110> most

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
whisk attachment but you can most

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.900 
whisk attachment but you can most
certainly<00:01:19.440> do<00:01:19.800> this<00:01:19.920> by<00:01:20.130> hand<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> whisk

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
certainly do this by hand with a whisk

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.890 
certainly do this by hand with a whisk
or<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.660> hand<00:01:21.750> mixer<00:01:23.180> once<00:01:24.180> Nutella<00:01:24.660> was

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
or with a hand mixer once Nutella was

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.410 
or with a hand mixer once Nutella was
blended<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.410> I<00:01:25.710> added<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.910> water<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
blended in I added in the water and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
blended in I added in the water and
gelatin<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:28.170> continue<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.980> stir<00:01:29.190> that<00:01:29.310> around

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
gelatin and continue to stir that around

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.110 
gelatin and continue to stir that around
until<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.390> incorporated<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.490> as<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.760> was

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
until that was incorporated and as I was

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.500 
until that was incorporated and as I was
mixing<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.410> didn't<00:01:35.190> like<00:01:35.370> the<00:01:35.640> color<00:01:36.090> that

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
mixing this I didn't like the color that

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.030 
mixing this I didn't like the color that
I<00:01:36.720> was<00:01:36.870> getting<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.260> wanted<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> little

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
I was getting I wanted it to be a little

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.470 
I was getting I wanted it to be a little
bit<00:01:38.250> darker<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.880> wanted<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.330> to

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
bit darker because I wanted it to

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.010 
bit darker because I wanted it to
resemble<00:01:40.020> cooked<00:01:40.340> hamburger<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.180> added<00:01:42.840> an

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
resemble cooked hamburger so I added an

1/2 cup of Nutella to it and once I
blended<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.320> liked<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.280> final<00:01:50.640> color

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850

until it is completely set it'll take

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.570 
until it is completely set it'll take
about<00:02:23.340> two<00:02:23.640> hours<00:02:24.950> now<00:02:25.950> for<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.220> hamburger

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the only problem with this one is it has

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.550 
the only problem with this one is it has
a<00:02:35.130> hole<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.640> middle<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.450> can<00:02:36.480> find<00:02:37.110> Donuts

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560
