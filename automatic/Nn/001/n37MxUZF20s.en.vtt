00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.580 
cinema4d release 13 comes with an
all-new<00:00:08.069> muscle<00:00:08.760> system<00:00:09.179> it's<00:00:10.170> not<00:00:10.380> only

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
all-new muscle system it's not only

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.980 
all-new muscle system it's not only
rewritten<00:00:11.130> from<00:00:11.370> scratch<00:00:11.790> but<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.420> also<00:00:12.630> gives

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
rewritten from scratch but it also gives

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.230 
rewritten from scratch but it also gives
you<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.259> possibility<00:00:13.440> for<00:00:14.240> dynamics

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
you the possibility for dynamics

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.760 
you the possibility for dynamics
behavior<00:00:16.010> but<00:00:17.010> how<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> setup<00:00:17.699> done<00:00:18.770> let's

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
behavior but how is the setup done let's

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.220 
behavior but how is the setup done let's
look<00:00:20.039> at<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.340> scene<00:00:20.689> we've<00:00:21.689> got<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> muscle

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
look at this scene we've got a muscle

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.170 
look at this scene we've got a muscle
here<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.189> play<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> animation<00:00:24.060> you

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
here and if we play the animation you

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.710 
here and if we play the animation you
can<00:00:24.210> see<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> muscle<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.050> working<00:00:25.230> perfectly

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
can see the muscle is working perfectly

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.500 
can see the muscle is working perfectly
if<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.960> go<00:00:28.140> back<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.590> frame<00:00:28.830> 0<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.519> change<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
if we go back to frame 0 and change the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.560 
if we go back to frame 0 and change the
animate<00:00:30.960> mode<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.410> edit<00:00:31.769> mode<00:00:32.149> you<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.329> see

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
animate mode to edit mode you can see

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.860 
animate mode to edit mode you can see
what<00:00:33.750> we've<00:00:33.930> done<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:35.510> you<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.600> three

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
what we've done here you have three

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.470 
what we've done here you have three
states<00:00:37.140> relaxed<00:00:37.800> compressed<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.670> extend<00:00:39.329> it

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
states relaxed compressed and extend it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.110 
states relaxed compressed and extend it
in<00:00:40.200> most<00:00:40.500> cases<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.190> only<00:00:41.399> need<00:00:41.670> relaxed

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
in most cases you will only need relaxed

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.869 
in most cases you will only need relaxed
and<00:00:42.329> compressed<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:43.219> you've<00:00:44.219> created<00:00:44.430> your

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and compressed if you've created your

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.110 
and compressed if you've created your
muscle<00:00:45.270> from<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> character<00:00:46.289> menu<00:00:47.120> simply

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
muscle from the character menu simply

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.450 
muscle from the character menu simply
move<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.840> points<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> proper<00:00:49.920> positions

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
move the points to the proper positions

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.790 
move the points to the proper positions
make<00:00:51.000> sure<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> second<00:00:52.199> point<00:00:52.500> has<00:00:52.770> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
make sure that the second point has a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.340 
make sure that the second point has a
slight<00:00:53.190> offset<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.910> joint<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:55.020> when<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
slight offset to the joint so when the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.939 
slight offset to the joint so when the
arm<00:00:55.559> bends<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:57.420> muscle<00:00:57.809> has<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> chance<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
arm bends the muscle has the chance to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.660 
arm bends the muscle has the chance to
get<00:00:59.100> shorter<00:00:59.809> now<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> straight<00:01:01.350> position

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
get shorter now in the straight position

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.060 
get shorter now in the straight position
go<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.969> relaxed<00:01:03.390> state<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.840> click<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.739> set

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
go to the relaxed state and click on set

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.780 
go to the relaxed state and click on set
this<00:01:05.790> will<00:01:06.060> save<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.689> length<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.380> muscle

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
this will save the length of the muscle

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.530 
this will save the length of the muscle
now<00:01:08.790> bend<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.240> arm<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.729> go<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.030> compress

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
now bend your arm and go to the compress

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.230 
now bend your arm and go to the compress
state<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.020> click<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.590> set<00:01:13.860> again<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.820> muscle

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
state and click on set again the muscle

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
state and click on set again the muscle
is<00:01:15.450> now<00:01:15.659> shorter<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.890> compressed<00:01:17.340> date

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
is now shorter and the compressed date

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.440 
is now shorter and the compressed date
is<00:01:17.850> saved<00:01:19.430> afterwards<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:20.880> into<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
is saved afterwards you can go into the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.539 
is saved afterwards you can go into the
relaxed<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.049> compressed<00:01:22.500> state<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.920> points

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
relaxed and compressed state in points

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.670 
relaxed and compressed state in points
mode<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.970> define<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.080> shape<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.710> muscle

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.230 

now<00:01:29.680> what<00:01:29.860> you<00:01:29.980> only<00:01:30.160> need<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.640> make<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:30.970> work

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
now what you only need to make this work

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.230 
now what you only need to make this work
is<00:01:31.420> an<00:01:31.660> M<00:01:31.810> skin<00:01:32.230> object<00:01:32.680> create<00:01:33.610> an<00:01:33.760> M<00:01:33.970> skin

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
is an M skin object create an M skin

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.540 
is an M skin object create an M skin
object<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:34.900> make<00:01:35.230> it<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.440> child<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:36.040> your<00:01:36.280> arm

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
object and make it a child of your arm

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.660 
object and make it a child of your arm
but<00:01:37.330> make<00:01:37.540> sure<00:01:37.870> that<00:01:38.380> it<00:01:38.590> comes<00:01:38.830> after<00:01:39.100> the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
but make sure that it comes after the

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.260 
but make sure that it comes after the
skin<00:01:39.910> object<00:01:41.310> now<00:01:42.310> if<00:01:42.550> you<00:01:42.700> go<00:01:42.850> back<00:01:43.060> to

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
skin object now if you go back to

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.080

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
you will see that the muscle is doing

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.850 
you will see that the muscle is doing
