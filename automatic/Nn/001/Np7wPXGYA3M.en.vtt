00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.760
 that goes from games has come out again to the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.860
 street to know first hand what it is 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.390
 what they think after having seen the 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.100
 presentation of playstation 4 by 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.280
 part of sony in the gamers 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.770
 directly then we go inside 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.940
 to join us and you have to see this 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.580
 video because watching the whole video 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.580
 citizenship 'you want to know more crazy 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.770
 farÃ­as 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.989
 MMM 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.700
 our teams 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.979
 is 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.560
 Oh 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.979
 we have here to nothing well you know that has 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.900
 been the playstation meeting recently 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.930
 who have presented to playstation 4 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.520
 they have given a lot of data they have turned us 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.900
 crazy to all but what do you think of that 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.100
 launch of the future console 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.100
 sound 3 614 well neither 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.890
 who have not shown what it is 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.020
 physically the console that you already 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.880
 We remember that there was a trail of 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.070
 console by nowhere by smith and 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.430
 It's pretty good I've seen enough 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.460
 ideas is very well presented 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.570
 the quality and everything seems pretty good 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.120
 keep moving forward 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.130
 from always and the truth the unlocking 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.900
 it's pretty good so people can 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:24.640
 reuse new nobody uses about 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.459
 bad bolts at all you see it a little 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.320
 poor expectation that occurred 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.450
 that it was going to be the bomb that was going to 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.700
 have dried a lot 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.830
 polished to so many means to go to 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.209
 see it and in the end to start that I 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.300
 I understand that they are reserving for the e3 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.720
 but a rally to tighten a console 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.440
 if the console that everything they do try 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.250
 but not to me 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.610
 the logical thing I would like but the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.610
 medicines 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.450
 to 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.040
 on those sides capacity 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:19.440
 now yes capacity we are here already with 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.490
 all right 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.090
 let's talk about the command of the t4 of 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.010
 4th that is conservative and progressive what 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.940
 you think of the command the new screen about 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.910
 a command 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.310
 well I do not know I guess 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.080
 I command that I have seen the images 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.739
 that I have seen seems to project in certain 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.900
 way what 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.730
 yes 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.500
 this is a prototype what we have 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.500
 taught to be zero 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:56.840
 better for the network 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:59.900
 because it can be quite has already left 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.760
 a lot of data we also have the 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.130
 date of departure that can be said to 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.010
 it's later this year 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.010
 globally except world catastrophe 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.620
 They say Christmas but actually is 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.959
 say a lot 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.820
 if you would have to contribute everything to a 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.019
 number all what price to put myself 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.160
 He was achieved 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.450
 so that it is affordable for all 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.810
 world would have to know more or less 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.650
 who is walking by now 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.389
 300 journeys that what they try but 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.610
 in the physical format I do not think 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.580
 It should disappear if you have paid for a 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.419
 game I think you should be able to play 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.860
 that game without having to go through boxes 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.900
 and regarding the command for example we already 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.840
 have taught the dualshock 4 or a command 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.120
 with a very cute little screen she very 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.370
 base fix is different 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.430
 tucker is conservative another resist in 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.800
 that progressive sense and certainly the 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.100
 I do not like anything after 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.590
 have left the wiiu I think that is 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.740
 a step to a model that would have to 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.740
 follow 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.960
 well there has been vox populi the town has 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.789
 spoken and the people are sovereign these 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.190
 they are the answers of all our 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.430
 readers and the people and if you want more 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.530
 you just have to catch and the one at the foot 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.560
 of the news and leave your opinions 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:32.780
 so you know how to visit her games 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:36.250
 puntocom and meanwhile I cojones 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.250
 I hope I have pp 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.810
 do not
