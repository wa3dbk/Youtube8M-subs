I<00:02:10.990> think<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.410> certain<00:02:12.500> extent<00:02:13.130> may<00:02:13.670> be

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
I think to a certain extent may be

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.600 
I think to a certain extent may be
spending<00:02:14.060> too<00:02:14.270> much<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.780> kind<00:02:15.230> of<00:02:15.320> extensive

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
spending too much is kind of extensive

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.940 
spending too much is kind of extensive
but<00:02:16.610> not<00:02:16.880> as<00:02:17.660> like<00:02:18.170> just<00:02:18.200> an<00:02:18.530> average<00:02:18.830> amount

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
but not as like just an average amount

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.680 
but not as like just an average amount
because<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.250> spent<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.550> lot<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.850> money<00:02:20.120> on<00:02:20.420> card

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
because I spent a lot of money on card

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.260 
because I spent a lot of money on card

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
at our locals that spend a lot of money

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.699 
at our locals that spend a lot of money
on<00:02:28.700> cards<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.150> they're<00:02:29.330> not<00:02:29.480> even<00:02:29.780> they<00:02:30.620> don't

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
play competitively in a way so it's like

play competitively in a way so it's like
spending<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.010> guess<00:02:34.280> they<00:02:34.400> may<00:02:34.519> make<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.760> money

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
spending I guess they may make the money

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.630 
spending I guess they may make the money
back<00:02:35.170> but<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.709> spend<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.980> lot<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.130> money<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.489> not

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
back but to spend a lot of money and not

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.490 
back but to spend a lot of money and not
make<00:02:37.850> something<00:02:38.239> out<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.750> think<00:02:39.080> is<00:02:39.230> a

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
make something out of it I think is a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.990 
make something out of it I think is a
little<00:02:39.950> too<00:02:40.040> much<00:02:40.220> but<00:02:40.459> if<00:02:40.550> you're<00:02:40.640> making

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
little too much but if you're making

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.820 
little too much but if you're making
money<00:02:41.120> back<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.630> you're<00:02:42.260> profiting<00:02:42.680> then

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.380 
money back and you're profiting then
there's<00:02:43.010> nothing<00:02:43.250> wrong<00:02:43.370> with<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.610> it's<00:02:44.269> more

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
there's nothing wrong with it it's more

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.670 
there's nothing wrong with it it's more

because if you do next thing you know
you<00:03:15.709> make<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.040> see<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.689> just<00:03:17.930> spent

you make you see and you just spent

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.130 
you make you see and you just spent
1,500<00:03:19.250> bucks<00:03:19.459> on<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.790> deck<00:03:20.060> for<00:03:20.239> no<00:03:20.359> reason<00:03:20.840> so

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
1,500 bucks on a deck for no reason so

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.699 
1,500 bucks on a deck for no reason so
just<00:03:21.409> take<00:03:21.889> your<00:03:21.920> time<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.430> build<00:03:22.639> it<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:26.709> to
