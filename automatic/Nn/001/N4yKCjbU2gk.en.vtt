00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.720
 pablo aimar the review of the new pain attracts more 30 btk but it goes the 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.730
 devices 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.759
 I've been using you for a couple of weeks and I can't say it was the club 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.019
 really nice product 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.539
 Sir stable 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.070
 easy to operate 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.599
 nice big screen 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.599
 or the name stands out is the cork the navigation part 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.179
 that works very well close 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.880
 7 the chance a decent tap you think 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.250
 yes entering one from the rest is pretty easy 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.250
 that is my address in Amsterdam 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 search by roombeek zip code 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.520
 8 v 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.900
 the settle 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.610
 max and that one 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.660
 after the race in Amsterdam 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.930
 for a very stupid number one job 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.010
 all right 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.690
 as you see 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.140
 and leave fairly quickly 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.610
 confirm that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.610
 the destination 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 and that there is also a route calculation 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.780
 had points shortened after the route 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.270
 the attorney 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.940
 he goes rows like you could see 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.350
 I'm still super clear 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.590
 that the device has even more to lie 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.930
 the more 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.730
 blood makes the connection 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.730
 because there are all kinds of genes starting 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.030
 and of course the various euro sources 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.750
 can choose between real but now also state 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.750
 Of course, iPod controls were operating the CD 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.690
 hotels that have a dvdm 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.700
 but taste the series dexter 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.900
 Dutch language 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.900
 and I was pretty wrong 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:18.149
 until now 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.919
 He attaches we can our guests who leave a good fast 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.709
 bremen the weather is going to race 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.709
 pretty sharp 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.039
 people can also simply turn off one 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.909
 blood streaming audio too 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.459
 may already be that from the smart of 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:48.919
 he came ministry 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.919
 we started fm 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:01.239
 the name quite extensive and antique western 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.239
 with one after three sets 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.769
 peacock full 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.329
 I would have preferred a flat 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.329
 that a little foreigners 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.529
 wherever the screen comes one can also be tilted 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.759
 rightly so 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:30.899
 its a place of the 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:33.899
 dkv and 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.489

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.909
 k 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.689
