professional now let's see how I'm going
to<00:03:25.620> be<00:03:25.769> doable<00:03:26.100> in<00:03:26.370> windows<00:03:26.850> on<00:03:27.209> my<00:03:27.840> happy

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
to be doable in windows on my happy

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.720 
to be doable in windows on my happy
times<00:03:28.590> actually<00:03:28.860> didn't<00:03:29.280> get<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.489> do<00:03:29.610> that

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
times actually didn't get to do that

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.820 
times actually didn't get to do that
here<00:03:29.970> because<00:03:30.330> for<00:03:31.049> some<00:03:31.230> reason<00:03:31.260> we're

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
here because for some reason we're

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.320 
here because for some reason we're
letting<00:03:32.190> doable<00:03:32.580> something's<00:03:32.970> going<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.120> give

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
letting doable something's going to give

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.600 
letting doable something's going to give
me<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.510> different<00:03:33.930> hard<00:03:34.350> drive<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.980> install

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
me a different hard drive and install

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.310 
me a different hard drive and install
windows<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.269> there<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.720> I'm<00:03:36.840> having<00:03:37.200> one

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
windows on there so I'm having one

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.990 
windows on there so I'm having one
terabyte<00:03:37.769> for<00:03:38.010> Hector<00:03:38.310> touching<00:03:38.640> another<00:03:38.850> one

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
terabyte for Hector touching another one

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.880 
terabyte for Hector touching another one
to<00:03:39.330> everybody<00:03:39.630> from<00:03:40.080> windows<00:03:40.500> which<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.830> know

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
to everybody from windows which I know

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.759 
to everybody from windows which I know
it's<00:03:41.130> overkill<00:03:41.640> but<00:03:42.000> still<00:03:42.840> more<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.380> merrier

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
it's overkill but still more the merrier

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.410 
it's overkill but still more the merrier
I'm<00:03:44.190> going<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.430> have<00:03:44.580> windows<00:03:44.910> seven<00:03:44.940> ultimate

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
I'm going to have windows seven ultimate

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.690 
I'm going to have windows seven ultimate
and<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.110> saying<00:03:46.410> why<00:03:46.980> we're<00:03:47.310> not<00:03:47.340> save<00:03:47.580> it

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
and a saying why we're not save it

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.030 
and a saying why we're not save it
ultimately<00:03:48.060> better<00:03:48.239> because<00:03:48.750> if<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.769> build<00:03:49.980> a

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
ultimately better because if you build a

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.890 
ultimately better because if you build a
computer<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.820> want<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.150> as<00:03:51.269> much<00:03:51.390> ram<00:03:51.690> as

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
computer you want to have as much ram as

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.199 
computer you want to have as much ram as
possible<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.829> once<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.610> build<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.910> computer

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
possible so once you build a computer

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.569 
possible so once you build a computer
and<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:54.690> use<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.290> bella<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.890> use<00:03:56.130> 16

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
and you use the bella you use 16

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.490 
and you use the bella you use 16
gigabytes<00:03:56.970> around<00:03:57.360> if<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.079> have<00:03:58.230> Windows

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
gigabytes around if you have Windows

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.280 
gigabytes around if you have Windows
home<00:03:59.190> then<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.299> won't<00:04:00.510> be<00:04:00.630> able<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.900> use<00:04:01.110> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
home then you won't be able to use the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.199 
home then you won't be able to use the
16<00:04:01.620> gigabytes<00:04:02.040> around<00:04:02.310> because<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.610> it

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
16 gigabytes around because it it

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.940 
16 gigabytes around because it it
Olympics<00:04:03.630> into<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:03.959> think<00:04:04.230> four<00:04:04.530> gigabytes

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
Olympics into I think four gigabytes

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.920 
Olympics into I think four gigabytes
around<00:04:05.340> more<00:04:05.549> something<00:04:05.910> like<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.299> but<00:04:06.780> with

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
around more something like that but with

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.650 
around more something like that but with
windows<00:04:07.290> 7<00:04:07.890> ultimate<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.610> think<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.060> goes<00:04:09.360> all

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
windows 7 ultimate I think it goes all

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.870 
windows 7 ultimate I think it goes all
the<00:04:09.720> way<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:09.959> 100<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.799> something<00:04:11.070> gigabyte<00:04:11.610> so

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
the way to 100 and something gigabyte so

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.660 
the way to 100 and something gigabyte so
that's<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.600> difference<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.140> get<00:04:13.320> more

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
that's the difference you get more

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.879 
that's the difference you get more
limitations<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:16.079> get<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.530> do<00:04:16.650> more

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
limitations and you just get to do more

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.289 
limitations and you just get to do more
that<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.280> want<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:17.639> with<00:04:17.820> windows<00:04:18.090> 7

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
that you want to do with windows 7

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.849 
that you want to do with windows 7
ultimate<00:04:18.359> that's<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.320> main<00:04:19.470> reason<00:04:19.500> not

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
ultimate that's the main reason not

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.800 
ultimate that's the main reason not
having<00:04:20.190> windows<00:04:20.340> in<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.700> ultimate<00:04:21.120> concern

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
having windows in the ultimate concern

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.720 
having windows in the ultimate concern
when<00:04:22.079> we<00:04:22.200> upgrade<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.740> 32<00:04:23.100> gigabytes<00:04:23.520> where

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
when we upgrade to 32 gigabytes where

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.629 
when we upgrade to 32 gigabytes where
I'm<00:04:23.790> on<00:04:23.940> my<00:04:24.570> computer<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:25.320> imma<00:04:25.919> need<00:04:26.160> windows

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
I'm on my computer so imma need windows

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.879 
I'm on my computer so imma need windows
