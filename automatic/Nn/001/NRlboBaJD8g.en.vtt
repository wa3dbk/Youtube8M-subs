00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.009 
leaning into that concept of the chase
as<00:03:01.040> an<00:03:01.340> undercover<00:03:01.730> cop<00:03:01.820> you'll<00:03:02.630> actually<00:03:02.840> be

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
as an undercover cop you'll actually be

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.570 
as an undercover cop you'll actually be
trying<00:03:03.320> to<00:03:03.410> take<00:03:03.560> down<00:03:03.590> different<00:03:04.160> opponents

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
trying to take down different opponents

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.890 
trying to take down different opponents
that<00:03:04.730> are<00:03:04.790> on<00:03:05.000> your<00:03:05.120> way<00:03:05.180> you'll<00:03:05.480> be<00:03:05.510> getting<00:03:05.840> a

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
that are on your way you'll be getting a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.660 
that are on your way you'll be getting a
list<00:03:06.110> of<00:03:06.260> people<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.530> get<00:03:06.739> out<00:03:06.769> at<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.580> same

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
list of people to get out at the same

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.430 
list of people to get out at the same
time<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.570> cops<00:03:08.810> don't<00:03:09.019> know<00:03:09.080> who<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.410> are

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
time the cops don't know who you are

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.320 
time the cops don't know who you are
because<00:03:09.830> only<00:03:10.040> chase<00:03:10.580> as<00:03:10.760> your<00:03:10.910> handle<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.209> the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
because only chase as your handle is the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.400 
because only chase as your handle is the
only<00:03:11.510> person<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.080> knows<00:03:12.200> your<00:03:12.380> true

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
only person that knows your true

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.530 
only person that knows your true
identity<00:03:12.709> so<00:03:13.489> it<00:03:13.610> creates<00:03:13.910> this<00:03:14.000> really<00:03:14.120> cool

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
identity so it creates this really cool

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.570 
identity so it creates this really cool
three-way<00:03:15.050> aspect<00:03:15.530> of<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.709> chase<00:03:15.980> they<00:03:16.430> got

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
three-way aspect of the chase they got

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.370 
three-way aspect of the chase they got
cops<00:03:16.760> coming<00:03:17.150> after<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.600> you're<00:03:18.050> going<00:03:18.260> after

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
cops coming after you you're going after

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.170 
cops coming after you you're going after
different<00:03:18.860> ppl<00:03:19.160> makes<00:03:19.610> it<00:03:19.760> for<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> very

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
different ppl makes it for a very

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.180 
different ppl makes it for a very
confusing<00:03:20.660> element<00:03:21.110> in<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.260> game<00:03:21.440> but<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.950> lot

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
confusing element in the game but a lot

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.430 
confusing element in the game but a lot
of<00:03:22.220> gameplay<00:03:22.580> fun<00:03:22.850> drifting<00:03:23.540> won't<00:03:23.840> be<00:03:24.019> an

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
of gameplay fun drifting won't be an

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.860 
of gameplay fun drifting won't be an
actual<00:03:24.709> mode<00:03:24.980> in<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.250> game<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:26.000> think<00:03:26.600> a<00:03:26.690> lot<00:03:26.840> of

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
actual mode in the game I think a lot of

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.120 
actual mode in the game I think a lot of
what's<00:03:27.230> happening<00:03:27.560> with<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.800> drifting

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
what's happening with the drifting

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.830 
what's happening with the drifting
series<00:03:28.459> these<00:03:28.580> days<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:29.000> becoming<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.540> lot<00:03:29.690> more

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
series these days is becoming a lot more

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.449 
series these days is becoming a lot more
organized<00:03:30.350> so<00:03:30.500> you're<00:03:30.620> seeing<00:03:30.830> big<00:03:31.130> events

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
organized so you're seeing big events

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.490 
organized so you're seeing big events
like<00:03:31.519> formula<00:03:32.090> d<00:03:32.180> popping<00:03:32.630> up<00:03:32.780> that's<00:03:33.260> really

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
like formula d popping up that's really

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.380 
like formula d popping up that's really
