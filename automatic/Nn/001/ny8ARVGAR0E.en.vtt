00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
 Run was stick Day Getz and Sark 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.010
 Yes hi high 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.000
 We will continue to explain how to do the correct abdominal exercises today 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:19.450
 It is not so good for this lunch today- 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.290
 We will not raise the foot to just above from a state in which bending the knee 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:29.160
 It looks very easy if you only look at this 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:33.660
 I do not hear so much it is easy and do it in addition wrong way 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.020
 However, if I do it in the right way, there is a lot of publicity and I want to do it from now on 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.620
 I'm sorry 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:46.570
 There is a lot of exercise to use foot in support of abisu Station, but 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:49.490
 It's really easy if you just have your feet raised 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.750
 Common mistakes are 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:56.470
 While along that Ri Strip the waist 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.730
 I bend my waist and raise my legs 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:09.940
 I will eat Koshii 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:13.440
 The right way is to put a force on your abs and crush between the ground and your back 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.680
 From the state that put a force to return to crush 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.409
 Raise the leg 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.230
 I'm on the road 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.090
 At this time 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.920
 Don't open it between your back and the ground 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.280
 Press to squeeze 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.490
 We will repeat the action 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:39.979
 Of course you do not twist this omission not done in a state that contains the firm force on the abdominal muscles 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.979
 My waist is bent back 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.360
 I do not know what exercise 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.350
 Firmly put your strength in your abdominal muscles 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.360
 Between the ground and the back 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.720
 It was the power of the abdominal muscle 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.730
 I will go up from that state 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.730
 Then you will come to the lower abdomen 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:23.319
 It longer my own hands I really people who come along waist 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:26.610
 Please give round the back is raised above a little way while pressing 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.819
 Firmly in this state 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.790
 Ground and back 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.790
 Create a state of close contact and raise your feet 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.170
 The right way and roots wrong to do the way 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.440
 a Kofu is 100 times different 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.910
 I did it wrong and I just felt like I did it 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.660
 If you do it the right way you will be trained properly 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.350
 Please try to learn the right way 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.350
