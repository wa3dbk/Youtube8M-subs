00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
of the string that's going to give you

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.010 
of the string that's going to give you
different<00:02:49.950> sounds<00:02:50.520> okay<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.510> that's<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
different sounds okay so that's the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.450 
different sounds okay so that's the
right<00:02:52.230> hand<00:02:52.500> as<00:02:52.590> far<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:52.860> getting<00:02:53.370> your

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
right hand as far just getting your

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.910 
right hand as far just getting your
sound<00:02:53.820> we<00:02:54.210> talked<00:02:54.510> earlier<00:02:54.810> about<00:02:55.260> putting

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
sound we talked earlier about putting

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.670 
sound we talked earlier about putting
staccato<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.670> your<00:02:56.850> lines<00:02:57.440> right<00:02:58.440> hand

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
staccato in your lines right hand

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.290 
staccato in your lines right hand
staccato<00:02:58.980> means<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.400> just<00:02:59.580> put<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.910> pic<00:03:00.090> back

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
staccato means you just put the pic back

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.630 
staccato means you just put the pic back
on<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.600> string<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.250> when<00:03:02.250> you're<00:03:02.400> practicing

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
on the string and when you're practicing

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.640 
on the string and when you're practicing
it's<00:03:03.090> real<00:03:03.300> important<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.900> stress<00:03:04.350> both

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
it's real important to stress both

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.990 
it's real important to stress both
you're<00:03:04.920> down<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.370> you're<00:03:05.490> up<00:03:05.640> strokes

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
you're down and you're up strokes

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.310 
you're down and you're up strokes
gravity's<00:03:06.540> on<00:03:06.660> your<00:03:06.780> side<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.140> play<00:03:07.290> a

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
gravity's on your side and you play a

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.140 
gravity's on your side and you play a
Down<00:03:07.560> stroke<00:03:07.710> it's<00:03:08.010> easy<00:03:08.250> for<00:03:08.490> you<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.670> accent

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
Down stroke it's easy for you to accent

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.940 
Down stroke it's easy for you to accent
but<00:03:09.660> if<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.840> want<00:03:10.020> an<00:03:10.080> accent<00:03:10.440> an<00:03:10.500> upstroke

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
but if you want an accent an upstroke

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.840 
but if you want an accent an upstroke
you<00:03:11.340> got<00:03:11.490> a<00:03:11.520> 10<00:03:11.820> supplements<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:14.670> when<00:03:14.790> you

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
you got a 10 supplements so when you

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.460 
you got a 10 supplements so when you
practice<00:03:15.270> scalar<00:03:15.690> patterns<00:03:16.050> like<00:03:16.140> if<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.350> do

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
practice scalar patterns like if you do

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.540 
practice scalar patterns like if you do
16<00:03:16.950> s<00:03:17.010> 1<00:03:17.220> e<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.760> 2<00:03:17.850> e<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:20.100> typical

16 s 1 e and a 2 e and the typical

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.010 
16 s 1 e and a 2 e and the typical

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
picking scheme would be down up down up

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.960 
picking scheme would be down up down up
down<00:03:22.200> up<00:03:22.410> down<00:03:22.620> up<00:03:22.800> but<00:03:23.430> don't<00:03:23.610> forget<00:03:23.880> to

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
down up down up but don't forget to

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.460 
down up down up but don't forget to
practice<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.420> in<00:03:24.510> reverse<00:03:24.720> up<00:03:24.960> down<00:03:25.200> up<00:03:25.260> down

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
practice it in reverse up down up down

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.400 
practice it in reverse up down up down
up<00:03:25.770> down<00:03:28.820> again<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.880> go<00:03:30.000> back<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.180> Sean<00:03:30.510> Lane<00:03:30.780> he

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
up down again I go back to Sean Lane he

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.140 
up down again I go back to Sean Lane he
was<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> master<00:03:31.860> at<00:03:32.100> playing<00:03:32.220> starting<00:03:32.940> with<00:03:33.060> an

was a master at playing starting with an

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.700 
was a master at playing starting with an
upstroke<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.960> putting<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.560> tremendous

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
upstroke and putting a tremendous

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.110 
upstroke and putting a tremendous
accident<00:03:35.490> on<00:03:35.550> because<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.820> was<00:03:35.910> just<00:03:36.060> a

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
accident on because it was just a

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.150 
accident on because it was just a
rotation<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.870> hand<00:03:37.080> position<00:03:37.260> that

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
rotation of the hand position that

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.220 
rotation of the hand position that
bounces<00:03:38.460> out<00:03:38.970> your<00:03:39.150> right<00:03:39.330> hand<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.840> again

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
bounces out your right hand and again

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.220 
bounces out your right hand and again
the<00:03:40.770> wider<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.820> have<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> viewpoint<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:43.080> more

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
the wider you have a viewpoint the more

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.630 
the wider you have a viewpoint the more
you're<00:03:43.320> going<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.500> be<00:03:43.560> able<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.800> do<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.490> don't

palm in on the strings if I don't do
that<00:04:20.560> here<00:04:21.560> that's<00:04:21.620> not<00:04:21.889> recursive<00:04:23.289> work<00:04:24.289> on

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
that here that's not recursive work on

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.490 
that here that's not recursive work on
your<00:04:24.590> palm<00:04:24.800> slap<00:04:25.960> now<00:04:26.960> there<00:04:27.139> are<00:04:27.199> some<00:04:27.260> other

your palm slap now there are some other
things<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:27.919> can<00:04:28.100> do<00:04:28.280> we've<00:04:28.550> talked

things that you can do we've talked
about<00:04:29.949> muting<00:04:30.949> the<00:04:30.979> strings<00:04:31.100> with<00:04:31.669> the<00:04:31.789> left

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
about muting the strings with the left

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.490 
about muting the strings with the left
hand<00:04:32.300> how<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.780> would<00:04:33.020> come<00:04:33.199> in<00:04:33.229> with<00:04:33.350> the

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
hand how you would come in with the

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.490 
hand how you would come in with the
proper<00:04:33.830> angle<00:04:34.010> I'm<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:35.570> big<00:04:35.780> fan<00:04:36.020> of<00:04:36.050> muting

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
proper angle I'm a big fan of muting

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.020 
proper angle I'm a big fan of muting
whenever<00:04:36.740> possible<00:04:36.979> with<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.400> right<00:04:37.430> hand<00:04:37.880> it

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
whenever possible with the right hand it

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.400 
whenever possible with the right hand it
actually<00:04:38.330> is<00:04:38.389> an<00:04:38.479> offshoot<00:04:38.630> of<00:04:38.960> my<00:04:39.110> slide

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
actually is an offshoot of my slide

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.320 
actually is an offshoot of my slide
playing<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:39.860> taught<00:04:40.130> myself<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.490> play<00:04:40.550> slide<00:04:41.000> it

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
playing I taught myself to play slide it

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.990 
playing I taught myself to play slide it
was<00:04:41.449> a<00:04:41.479> necessity<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:42.080> block<00:04:42.350> strings<00:04:42.820> this<00:04:43.820> is

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
was a necessity to block strings this is

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.520 
was a necessity to block strings this is
what<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.210> call<00:04:44.449> an<00:04:44.570> insurance<00:04:44.990> policy<00:04:45.169> you

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
what I call an insurance policy you

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.469 
what I call an insurance policy you
can't<00:04:45.740> always<00:04:46.010> do<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.490> but<00:04:46.760> it's<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:46.940> great<00:04:47.270> way

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
can't always do it but it's a great way

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.689 
can't always do it but it's a great way
to<00:04:47.539> keep<00:04:47.840> things<00:04:48.169> tidy<00:04:48.500> I'll<00:04:49.039> go<00:04:49.340> through<00:04:49.580> this

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
to keep things tidy I'll go through this

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.310 
to keep things tidy I'll go through this
and<00:04:49.760> I've<00:04:49.940> talked<00:04:50.210> about<00:04:50.449> it<00:04:50.600> at<00:04:50.720> length<00:04:51.050> with

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
and I've talked about it at length with

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.779 
and I've talked about it at length with
all<00:04:51.530> my<00:04:51.680> videos<00:04:51.889> because<00:04:52.250> that's<00:04:52.550> an

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
all my videos because that's an

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.090 
all my videos because that's an
important<00:04:53.330> issue<00:04:53.449> if<00:04:53.750> you're<00:04:54.560> playing<00:04:54.770> a<00:04:54.949> note

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
important issue if you're playing a note

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.879 
important issue if you're playing a note
on<00:04:55.160> the<00:04:55.310> first<00:04:55.610> string<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:57.590> don't<00:04:57.740> want

on the first string and you don't want
any<00:04:58.039> noise<00:04:58.370> from<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.610> other<00:04:58.729> strings<00:04:59.060> you

any noise from the other strings you

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.210 
any noise from the other strings you

fingers on the heel back here on the 6th
5th<00:05:03.380> string<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:03.889> then<00:05:04.340> immediately<00:05:04.789> after

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
5th string and then immediately after

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.460 
5th string and then immediately after
you<00:05:05.120> strike<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:05.570> string<00:05:05.900> be<00:05:06.110> it<00:05:06.199> a<00:05:06.260> Down

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
you strike that string be it a Down

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.050 
you strike that string be it a Down
stroke<00:05:06.680> or<00:05:07.010> an<00:05:07.100> upstroke<00:05:07.490> you<00:05:07.760> want<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:07.940> get

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
stroke or an upstroke you want to get

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.850 
stroke or an upstroke you want to get
fast<00:05:08.300> at<00:05:08.479> this<00:05:08.660> you<00:05:08.900> would<00:05:09.050> whip<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.470> pic<00:05:09.680> in

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
fast at this you would whip the pic in

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.310 
fast at this you would whip the pic in
to<00:05:10.610> an<00:05:10.699> upstroke<00:05:11.120> position<00:05:11.630> against<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:11.990> next

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
to an upstroke position against the next

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.960 
to an upstroke position against the next
lowest<00:05:12.650> string<00:05:12.860> in<00:05:13.099> this<00:05:13.460> case<00:05:13.669> would<00:05:13.820> be<00:05:13.849> the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
lowest string in this case would be the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.120 
lowest string in this case would be the
second<00:05:14.330> string<00:05:14.570> you<00:05:15.169> then<00:05:15.320> relax<00:05:15.740> your<00:05:15.860> thumb

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
second string you then relax your thumb

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.159 
second string you then relax your thumb
joint<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:16.699> you<00:05:16.820> angle<00:05:17.360> so<00:05:17.870> that<00:05:17.900> you're<00:05:18.139> not

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
joint and you angle so that you're not

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.930 
joint and you angle so that you're not
you<00:05:18.740> know<00:05:18.770> can't<00:05:19.070> have<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.280> pic<00:05:19.490> angled<00:05:19.820> like

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
you know can't have the pic angled like

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.040 
you know can't have the pic angled like
that<00:05:20.120> because<00:05:20.300> if<00:05:20.479> you<00:05:20.570> were<00:05:20.660> bending<00:05:20.960> a

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
that because if you were bending a

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.350 
that because if you were bending a
string<00:05:21.410> you<00:05:22.130> might<00:05:22.160> bend<00:05:22.610> right<00:05:22.789> into<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.150> pic

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
string you might bend right into the pic

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.659 
string you might bend right into the pic
so<00:05:23.870> keep<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.260> pic<00:05:24.470> flat<00:05:24.830> or<00:05:25.099> a<00:05:25.130> very<00:05:25.370> slight

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
so keep the pic flat or a very slight

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.820 
so keep the pic flat or a very slight
angle<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.210> inclined<00:05:27.020> it<00:05:27.199> toward<00:05:27.470> your<00:05:27.620> face

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
angle and inclined it toward your face

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.800 
angle and inclined it toward your face
and<00:05:28.160> what<00:05:28.550> happens<00:05:28.880> is<00:05:29.000> you<00:05:29.120> have<00:05:29.330> all<00:05:29.539> the

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
and what happens is you have all the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.689 
and what happens is you have all the
strings<00:05:30.080> blocks<00:05:30.380> so<00:05:30.620> a<00:05:30.650> great<00:05:30.919> exercise<00:05:31.250> would

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
strings blocks so a great exercise would

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.700 
strings blocks so a great exercise would
be<00:05:31.849> to<00:05:31.970> practice<00:05:32.389> this<00:05:32.750> blocking<00:05:33.289> posture

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
be to practice this blocking posture

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.800 
be to practice this blocking posture
pick<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.580> first<00:05:34.789> string<00:05:35.150> and<00:05:35.389> come<00:05:35.599> back<00:05:35.750> in

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
pick the first string and come back in

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.550 
pick the first string and come back in
and<00:05:36.289> then<00:05:36.770> with<00:05:36.949> your<00:05:37.039> left<00:05:37.280> hand

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
and then with your left hand

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.010 
and then with your left hand
everything<00:05:39.400> should<00:05:39.520> be<00:05:39.580> muffled<00:05:40.000> except<00:05:40.870> that

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
everything should be muffled except that

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.320 
everything should be muffled except that
first<00:05:41.290> string<00:05:41.590> then<00:05:42.340> as<00:05:42.490> you<00:05:42.639> progress<00:05:42.820> down

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
first string then as you progress down

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.620 
first string then as you progress down
let's<00:05:43.810> say<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.020> play<00:05:44.290> on<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.530> second<00:05:44.919> string

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
let's say you play on the second string

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.820 
let's say you play on the second string
everything<00:05:46.630> just<00:05:46.720> moves<00:05:46.990> over<00:05:47.290> a<00:05:47.320> string<00:05:47.620> then

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
everything just moves over a string then

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.470 
everything just moves over a string then
you<00:05:47.919> start<00:05:48.160> coming<00:05:48.340> in<00:05:48.610> with<00:05:48.820> the<00:05:49.060> fingers<00:05:49.450> of

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
you start coming in with the fingers of

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.150 
you start coming in with the fingers of
the<00:05:49.660> right<00:05:49.690> hand<00:05:49.840> it<00:05:50.560> could<00:05:50.710> be<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:50.919> middle

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
the right hand it could be the middle

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.470 
the right hand it could be the middle
finger<00:05:51.520> or<00:05:51.639> it<00:05:51.700> could<00:05:51.820> be<00:05:51.850> the<00:05:51.940> ring<00:05:52.210> finger

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
finger or it could be the ring finger

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.110 
finger or it could be the ring finger
depends<00:05:52.990> what<00:05:53.110> you<00:05:53.230> want<00:05:53.380> to<00:05:53.440> do<00:05:53.669> this<00:05:54.669> way<00:05:54.940> I
