most fundamental thing is to make sure
that<00:00:11.019> your<00:00:11.260> wheels<00:00:11.500> are<00:00:11.860> properly<00:00:12.519> installed

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
that your wheels are properly installed

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.199 
that your wheels are properly installed
you<00:00:13.630> know<00:00:13.800> brakes<00:00:14.800> are<00:00:14.920> all<00:00:15.040> lined<00:00:15.280> up<00:00:15.519> enough

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
you know brakes are all lined up enough

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.490 
you know brakes are all lined up enough
air<00:00:16.360> pressure<00:00:16.390> all<00:00:16.779> the<00:00:16.869> other<00:00:16.990> sort<00:00:17.230> of<00:00:17.290> stuff

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
air pressure all the other sort of stuff

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.279 
air pressure all the other sort of stuff
I<00:00:17.740> think<00:00:18.460> one<00:00:19.240> thing<00:00:19.270> that<00:00:19.480> I've<00:00:19.570> seen<00:00:19.750> so<00:00:20.230> many

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
I think one thing that I've seen so many

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.810 
I think one thing that I've seen so many
times<00:00:20.650> with<00:00:20.890> all<00:00:20.980> sorts<00:00:21.130> of<00:00:21.250> people<00:00:21.400> riding

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
times with all sorts of people riding

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.849 
times with all sorts of people riding
bikes<00:00:21.850> is<00:00:22.210> that<00:00:22.869> they<00:00:23.380> don't<00:00:23.560> know<00:00:23.680> how<00:00:23.830> to

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
bikes is that they don't know how to

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.040 
bikes is that they don't know how to
properly<00:00:24.310> install<00:00:24.520> or<00:00:24.910> remove<00:00:25.000> a<00:00:25.240> wheel<00:00:25.420> so

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
properly install or remove a wheel so

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.320 
properly install or remove a wheel so
your<00:00:26.949> wheels<00:00:27.130> held<00:00:27.550> on<00:00:27.699> by<00:00:27.880> what's<00:00:28.150> called<00:00:28.210> a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
your wheels held on by what's called a

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.929 
your wheels held on by what's called a
quick-release<00:00:28.960> lever<00:00:29.260> so<00:00:29.740> it's<00:00:29.920> a<00:00:30.039> there's<00:00:30.880> a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
quick-release lever so it's a there's a

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.429 
quick-release lever so it's a there's a
little<00:00:31.029> cam<00:00:31.359> right<00:00:31.810> in<00:00:31.960> there<00:00:32.110> that<00:00:32.140> you<00:00:32.320> can

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
little cam right in there that you can

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.799 
little cam right in there that you can
see<00:00:32.529> it's<00:00:32.890> profiled<00:00:33.460> that<00:00:34.120> keeps<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.690> wheel

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
see it's profiled that keeps the wheel

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.290 
see it's profiled that keeps the wheel
on<00:00:35.020> so<00:00:35.950> it's<00:00:36.219> not<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.430> you<00:00:36.820> know<00:00:36.940> you<00:00:37.000> know<00:00:37.149> it's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
on so it's not a you know you know it's

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.880 
on so it's not a you know you know it's
not<00:00:37.390> a<00:00:37.450> wingnut<00:00:37.809> you<00:00:38.140> don't<00:00:38.290> just<00:00:38.440> turn<00:00:38.680> it

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
not a wingnut you don't just turn it

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.979 
not a wingnut you don't just turn it
turn<00:00:39.070> it<00:00:39.130> turn<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.460> until<00:00:39.730> it's<00:00:40.690> like<00:00:40.870> it's

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
turn it turn it until it's like it's

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.150 
turn it turn it until it's like it's
tight<00:00:41.140> because<00:00:41.290> that<00:00:41.410> doesn't<00:00:41.590> actually<00:00:41.829> hold

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
tight because that doesn't actually hold

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.459 
tight because that doesn't actually hold
it<00:00:42.250> as<00:00:42.340> tightly<00:00:42.670> or<00:00:43.000> securely<00:00:43.540> as<00:00:43.690> your<00:00:44.320> quick

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
it as tightly or securely as your quick

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.229 
it as tightly or securely as your quick
release<00:00:44.680> so<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.040> know<00:00:45.250> got<00:00:45.399> my<00:00:45.520> clothes<00:00:45.969> quick

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
release so you know got my clothes quick

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.170 
release so you know got my clothes quick
release<00:00:46.510> I<00:00:46.719> open<00:00:47.559> it<00:00:47.700> undo<00:00:48.700> it<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:48.879> little<00:00:49.000> bit

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
release I open it undo it a little bit

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.760 
release I open it undo it a little bit
to<00:00:49.300> clear<00:00:49.480> these<00:00:49.600> little<00:00:49.840> tabs<00:00:50.020> that<00:00:50.289> prevent

your wheel from falling out if you

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.619 
your wheel from falling out if you
somehow<00:00:52.149> forget<00:00:52.629> to<00:00:53.520> those<00:00:54.520> things<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:54.969> my

that our transport you need to know how

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.529 
that our transport you need to know how
to<00:00:59.829> take<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.100> wheel<00:01:00.250> off<00:01:00.430> to<00:01:00.789> change<00:01:01.300> a<00:01:01.390> flat

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
to take the wheel off to change a flat

brake put it on backwards it's not going
to<00:01:10.930> be<00:01:10.990> very<00:01:11.439> safe<00:01:12.250> so<00:01:13.080> drop<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.110> down<00:01:14.409> make

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
to be very safe so drop it down make

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.999 
to be very safe so drop it down make
sure<00:01:15.250> it<00:01:16.170> clears<00:01:17.170> in<00:01:17.439> there<00:01:17.560> with<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.799> disc

sure it clears in there with the disc
pads<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.689> want<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:19.960> rotate<00:01:20.170> your<00:01:20.799> quick

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
pads you want to rotate your quick

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.740 
pads you want to rotate your quick
release<00:01:21.280> until<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:22.030> start<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.509> get<00:01:22.600> some

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
release until you start to get some

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.410 
release until you start to get some
clamping<00:01:23.110> force<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.790> should<00:01:25.030> you<00:01:25.270> want

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
clamping force and you should you want

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.520 
clamping force and you should you want
to<00:01:25.509> have<00:01:25.600> your<00:01:25.689> quick<00:01:25.869> release<00:01:26.110> tight<00:01:26.320> enough

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
to have your quick release tight enough

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.080 
to have your quick release tight enough
so<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.830> takes<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.250> palm<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.520> your<00:01:27.700> hand<00:01:27.970> too

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
so it takes the palm of your hand too

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.789 
so it takes the palm of your hand too
close<00:01:28.299> if<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:29.049> can<00:01:29.170> just<00:01:29.200> close<00:01:29.439> it<00:01:29.500> with<00:01:29.680> your

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
close if you can just close it with your

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.200 
close if you can just close it with your
fingers<00:01:30.130> going<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.520> be<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.640> little<00:01:30.820> bit<00:01:31.000> too

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
fingers going to be a little bit too

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.260 
fingers going to be a little bit too
loose<00:01:31.420> so<00:01:32.229> that's<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.530> front<00:01:32.770> wheel<00:01:33.270> rear

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
loose so that's the front wheel rear

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
sometimes it's easier to do this if you

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.100
