the opportunity to import your character

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.090 
the opportunity to import your character
which<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.390> course<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.780> do<00:03:42.900> not<00:03:43.109> get<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.920> this

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
which of course you do not get in this

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.789 
which of course you do not get in this
version<00:03:44.459> which<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:44.790> very<00:03:45.600> disappointing<00:03:45.900> on

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
version which is very disappointing on

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.319 
version which is very disappointing on
what<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.340> think<00:03:47.579> would<00:03:47.730> have<00:03:47.850> been<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.000> better

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
what I think would have been a better

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.039 
what I think would have been a better
idea<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.709> um<00:03:49.980> wait<00:03:50.820> until<00:03:51.329> yay<00:03:51.690> got<00:03:51.930> the

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
idea is to um wait until yay got the

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.900 
idea is to um wait until yay got the
rights<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.530> mass<00:03:52.799> effect<00:03:53.160> 2<00:03:53.250> 1<00:03:53.430> because<00:03:53.790> I

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
rights to mass effect 2 1 because I

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.069 
rights to mass effect 2 1 because I
think<00:03:53.970> Mass<00:03:54.269> Effect<00:03:54.570> one<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.870> owned<00:03:55.049> by

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
think Mass Effect one is owned by

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.349 
think Mass Effect one is owned by
microsoft<00:03:55.440> right<00:03:56.040> now<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.400> if<00:03:56.850> they<00:03:57.000> could

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
microsoft right now and if they could

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.780 
microsoft right now and if they could
get<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.720> rights<00:03:57.900> release<00:03:58.769> mass<00:03:59.100> effects<00:03:59.400> one

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
get the rights release mass effects one

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.390 
get the rights release mass effects one
and<00:03:59.970> two<00:04:00.180> at<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.420> same<00:04:00.660> time<00:04:00.989> maybe<00:04:01.650> along

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
and two at the same time maybe along

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.640 
and two at the same time maybe along
with<00:04:02.579> three<00:04:03.030> once<00:04:03.359> three<00:04:03.810> comes<00:04:04.109> out<00:04:04.260> which<00:04:04.500> we

with three once three comes out which we

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.410 
with three once three comes out which we
all<00:04:04.829> know<00:04:04.859> will<00:04:05.340> come<00:04:05.549> out<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:05.850> like<00:04:05.880> one<00:04:06.269> or

all know will come out in like one or
two<00:04:06.480> years<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.079> then<00:04:07.140> just<00:04:08.100> release<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.400> as

two years and then just release that as

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.060 
two years and then just release that as
a<00:04:08.820> three<00:04:09.269> pack<00:04:09.480> for<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.810> ps3<00:04:10.109> because<00:04:10.859> that

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
a three pack for the ps3 because that

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
a three pack for the ps3 because that
would<00:04:11.250> have<00:04:11.370> been<00:04:11.549> a<00:04:11.609> much<00:04:11.700> better<00:04:12.060> experience

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
would have been a much better experience

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.690 
would have been a much better experience
because<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.720> what<00:04:12.870> ps3<00:04:13.230> users<00:04:13.470> can<00:04:13.859> do<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.130> you

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
because of what ps3 users can do is you

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.240 
because of what ps3 users can do is you
know<00:04:14.880> play<00:04:15.120> mass<00:04:15.359> effect<00:04:15.390> one<00:04:16.260> import<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
character than the mass effect 3

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.600 
character than the mass effect 3
playthrough<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.349> so<00:04:22.919> they<00:04:23.099> get<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.400> full

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
playthrough that so they get the full

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.040 
playthrough that so they get the full
experience<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.300> game<00:04:24.450> but<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.900> know

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
experience of the game but you know

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.730 
experience of the game but you know
they're<00:04:25.500> not<00:04:25.740> going<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.190> get<00:04:26.340> that

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
they're not going to get that

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.279 
they're not going to get that
um<00:04:27.240> because<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.509> fact<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.990> decide

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
um because of the fact that the decide

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.370 
um because of the fact that the decide
to<00:04:29.410> release<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.310> second<00:04:30.729> game<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:32.169> that's

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
to release the second game and so that's

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.700 
to release the second game and so that's
why<00:04:32.560> i<00:04:32.620> think<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:33.009> the<00:04:33.430> ps3<00:04:33.819> version<00:04:33.849> is<00:04:34.389> the

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
why i think that the ps3 version is the

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.230 
why i think that the ps3 version is the
inferior<00:04:35.710> version<00:04:36.099> does<00:04:36.430> that<00:04:36.639> mean<00:04:36.880> it's<00:04:37.090> a

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
inferior version does that mean it's a

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.050 
inferior version does that mean it's a
bad<00:04:37.599> game<00:04:38.080> am<00:04:38.319> I<00:04:38.470> saying<00:04:38.740> at<00:04:39.190> all<00:04:39.460> it's<00:04:39.669> a<00:04:39.789> bad

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060

Mass Effect 1 and so that's struggling

Mass Effect 1 and so that's struggling
my<00:05:08.139> thoughts<00:05:08.380> I<00:05:08.530> think<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:09.039> is<00:05:09.099> a<00:05:09.280> good<00:05:09.490> move<00:05:09.699> by

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
my thoughts I think it is a good move by

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.809 
my thoughts I think it is a good move by
EA<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.599> bioware<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.229> put<00:05:11.380> this<00:05:11.500> on<00:05:11.680> ps3<00:05:11.979> I<00:05:12.370> just

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
EA and bioware to put this on ps3 I just

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.430 
EA and bioware to put this on ps3 I just
think<00:05:13.000> that<00:05:13.150> maybe<00:05:13.330> they<00:05:13.930> could<00:05:14.139> have<00:05:14.229> waited

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
think that maybe they could have waited

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.159 
think that maybe they could have waited
until<00:05:14.650> they<00:05:15.220> got<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.550> rights<00:05:15.759> for<00:05:16.180> all<00:05:16.449> Mass

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
until they got the rights for all Mass

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.149 
until they got the rights for all Mass
Effect<00:05:17.530> one<00:05:17.830> which<00:05:18.220> um<00:05:19.770> I'm<00:05:20.770> not<00:05:20.919> sure<00:05:20.979> if

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
Effect one which um I'm not sure if

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.070 
Effect one which um I'm not sure if
they're<00:05:21.310> even<00:05:21.430> going<00:05:21.699> to<00:05:21.880> put<00:05:22.389> Matt<00:05:22.599> if<00:05:22.840> they

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
they're even going to put Matt if they

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.809 
they're even going to put Matt if they
even<00:05:23.199> plan<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.680> but<00:05:23.830> Mass<00:05:24.009> Effect<00:05:24.280> one<00:05:24.460> on<00:05:24.580> ps3

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
even plan to but Mass Effect one on ps3

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.430 
even plan to but Mass Effect one on ps3
or<00:05:25.090> they're<00:05:25.330> even<00:05:25.630> going<00:05:25.780> to<00:05:25.870> try<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.169> get<00:05:26.319> the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
or they're even going to try to get the

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.320 
or they're even going to try to get the
rights<00:05:26.710> but<00:05:27.610> I<00:05:27.699> think<00:05:27.909> that<00:05:27.940> would<00:05:28.150> have<00:05:28.270> been

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
rights but I think that would have been

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.210 
rights but I think that would have been
a<00:05:28.389> much<00:05:28.449> better<00:05:28.930> move<00:05:29.199> so<00:05:29.470> than<00:05:29.620> ps3<00:05:29.800> owners

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
a much better move so than ps3 owners

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.360 
a much better move so than ps3 owners
get<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.759> full<00:05:31.000> experience<00:05:31.180> of<00:05:32.130> mass<00:05:33.130> effect

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
get the full experience of mass effect

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.689 
get the full experience of mass effect
before<00:05:33.699> they<00:05:34.060> release<00:05:34.240> mass<00:05:34.630> effect<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:35.699> this

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
before they release mass effect to this

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.640 
before they release mass effect to this
to<00:05:37.419> me<00:05:37.539> out<00:05:37.690> it's<00:05:37.930> almost<00:05:38.110> like<00:05:38.349> releasing

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
to me out it's almost like releasing

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.540 
to me out it's almost like releasing
gears<00:05:39.099> of<00:05:39.310> war<00:05:39.520> two<00:05:39.789> on<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:41.320> 360<00:05:41.830> releasing

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
gears of war two on the 360 releasing

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.330 
gears of war two on the 360 releasing
Killzone<00:05:43.030> 3<00:05:43.060> on<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.840> 360<00:05:44.349> they<00:05:44.979> don't<00:05:45.219> have

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
Killzone 3 on the 360 they don't have

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.649 
Killzone 3 on the 360 they don't have
the<00:05:45.490> option<00:05:45.789> to<00:05:45.820> play<00:05:45.969> the<00:05:46.120> other<00:05:46.270> two<00:05:46.479> games

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
the option to play the other two games

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.290 
the option to play the other two games
so<00:05:46.840> why<00:05:47.050> release<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:48.099> third<00:05:48.460> or<00:05:48.669> second<00:05:49.120> game

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
so why release the third or second game

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.870 
so why release the third or second game
so<00:05:49.810> n<00:05:50.050> plus<00:05:50.340> with<00:05:51.340> this<00:05:51.490> game<00:05:51.669> there's

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880
