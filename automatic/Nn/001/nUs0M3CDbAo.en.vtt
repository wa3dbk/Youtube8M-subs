00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
purple and pink and maybe the blue as a

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.489 
purple and pink and maybe the blue as a
gradient<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.909> match<00:02:04.030> my<00:02:04.209> hair<00:02:04.389> so<00:02:05.079> i<00:02:05.350> don't

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.760 
at the top of the bottom it doesn't
really<00:02:50.210> matter<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.960> i'm<00:02:51.050> going<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.230> go<00:02:51.380> about

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
really matter and i'm going to go about

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.640 
really matter and i'm going to go about
this<00:02:52.520> far<00:02:53.180> over<00:02:53.480> with<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.960> lime<00:02:54.740> green<00:02:55.100> and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
this far over with the lime green and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.800 
this far over with the lime green and
you're<00:02:57.650> going<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:57.950> completely<00:02:58.820> color<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.780> your

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.680 
you're going to completely color in your
brows<00:03:00.140> since<00:03:00.590> obviously<00:03:01.300> this<00:03:02.300> isn't<00:03:02.480> the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
brows since obviously this isn't the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:14.680 
brows since obviously this isn't the
same<00:03:02.870> color<00:03:03.110> as<00:03:03.350> my<00:03:03.380> actual<00:03:03.860> eyebrows
