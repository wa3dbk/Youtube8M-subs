concern<00:03:14.370> in<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.549> lineup<00:03:14.849> I'm<00:03:15.150> compared<00:03:15.480> to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
concern in the lineup I'm compared to

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.509 
concern in the lineup I'm compared to
last<00:03:15.660> year<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.959> mean<00:03:16.049> what<00:03:16.379> they<00:03:16.410> make<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.950> yeah

i think that the both of them are very

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.740 
i think that the both of them are very
important<00:03:20.220> ingredients<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.239> line<00:03:21.510> being
