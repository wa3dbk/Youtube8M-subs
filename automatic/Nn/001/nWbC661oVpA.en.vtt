00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:05.460
 In June 2008, that was accurately launched into him by Florian Traxler 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.390
 called 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.580
 Over time, more and more teenagers came to train with flowers 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.759
 meanwhile, about five to six people regularly come along 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.249
 but what is Parkour? 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.569
 Parkour is a sport from France founded by Fund i GbR 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.019
 This one harvest the locomotion techniques actors help from his dad 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.409
 this in turn a harvest as in the Vietnam War 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.600
 like Liberation later made Le Parkour out of it 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.070
 The wind is Parkour is to get from Arne to B as fast as possible 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.970
 Consideration on walls railing good cars 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.180
 Parkour is not for show but for locomotion 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.870
 there is more to it than just simple climbing Florian Drexler Parkour 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.420
 is your own life and behind it is a very own philosophy 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.960
 the persons who perform this sport call themselves resigned 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.530
 the route only learns at Parkour again and again their limits and themselves 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.310
 know 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.110
 It is important that you do not overestimate yourself 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.280
 It is also important that you start with small exercises in the beginning and 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.700
 not immediately with big promotions 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.030
 Endurance Fitness and basic techniques play an important role in Parkour 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.930
 Many beginners confuse parcours with freezing hang 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.060
 the difference is the bike returning payer the look of the different 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.070
 Techniques are in the foreground and not the fast and effective locomotion 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.490
 Her concerns include Saltos Fixed WiMAX and acrobatic actions 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.780
 was good for the show and in movies
