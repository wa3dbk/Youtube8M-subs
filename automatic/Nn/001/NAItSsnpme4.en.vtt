00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
think that our motor sports teams and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.040 
think that our motor sports teams and
specifically<00:00:23.609> citroen<00:00:24.090> racing<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.660> leading

specifically citroen racing is leading
the<00:00:25.170> way<00:00:25.320> showing<00:00:26.279> what<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.730> can<00:00:26.880> achieve<00:00:27.000> when

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the way showing what we can achieve when

the way showing what we can achieve when
we<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.689> some<00:00:27.960> confidence<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.680> when<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.640> work

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
we have some confidence and when we work

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:46.650 
we have some confidence and when we work
as<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> team

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
is either good sound as well so i had to

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.430
