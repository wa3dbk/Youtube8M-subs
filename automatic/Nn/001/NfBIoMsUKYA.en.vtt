here<00:03:50.079> in<00:03:50.199> the<00:03:50.290> middle<00:03:50.790> let's<00:03:51.790> see<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.060> back

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
here in the middle let's see it back

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.979 
here in the middle let's see it back
there<00:03:52.269> in<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.660> back<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.680> is<00:03:53.949> the<00:03:54.959> instead<00:03:55.959> of

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
there in the back that is the instead of

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.960 
there in the back that is the instead of
the<00:03:56.139> antenna<00:03:56.500> wire<00:03:56.709> that<00:03:57.040> goes<00:03:57.220> back<00:03:57.489> to<00:03:57.790> the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
the antenna wire that goes back to the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.250 
the antenna wire that goes back to the
back<00:03:58.389> of<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.569> vehicle<00:03:58.799> this<00:03:59.799> is<00:03:59.859> the

back of the vehicle this is the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.759 
back of the vehicle this is the
connection<00:04:02.260> storing<00:04:02.829> the<00:04:02.949> fault<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:04.769> so

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
connection storing the fault and so

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.280 
connection storing the fault and so
basically<00:04:06.599> what<00:04:07.599> you're<00:04:07.810> going<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.019> want<00:04:08.229> to

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
basically what you're going to want to

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.039 
basically what you're going to want to
do<00:04:08.500> is<00:04:09.150> disconnect<00:04:10.150> this

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049
