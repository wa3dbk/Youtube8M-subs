00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.490 
the drivetrain and distribution of power
all-wheel-drive<00:00:18.900> distributes<00:00:19.900> the<00:00:20.020> power<00:00:20.230> to

front-wheel drive only distributes the

the power to the rear wheels traction

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.799 
the power to the rear wheels traction
and<00:00:35.710> therefore<00:00:36.160> control<00:00:36.610> is<00:00:36.910> directly

and therefore control is directly

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.750 
and therefore control is directly
related<00:00:38.230> to<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.470> amount<00:00:38.739> of<00:00:38.860> grip<00:00:39.190> your<00:00:39.489> tires

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.920 
has a maximum capacity and the level of
grip<00:00:45.010> is<00:00:45.250> dependent<00:00:45.940> on<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.210> coefficient<00:00:46.870> of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
grip is dependent on the coefficient of

control is reduced this means that when
