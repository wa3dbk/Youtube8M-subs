00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
was I dropped down a string same picking

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.509 
was I dropped down a string same picking
pattern<00:02:40.870> but<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.470> went<00:02:41.709> from<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:42.010> fifth<00:02:42.250> string

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
pattern but I went from the fifth string

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.970 
pattern but I went from the fifth string
to<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.819> sixth<00:02:43.120> string<00:02:43.299> so<00:02:44.170> here<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.470> am<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.920> my

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
to the sixth string so here I am with my

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:56.140 
to the sixth string so here I am with my
original

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.980 

from<00:02:56.299> like<00:02:56.510> 6:00

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.040 

actually<00:03:00.990> I'm<00:03:01.110> doing<00:03:01.140> six<00:03:02.750> index<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:03.959> the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
actually I'm doing six index on the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.650 
actually I'm doing six index on the
third<00:03:04.370> four<00:03:05.370> string<00:03:05.790> thumb

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
third four string thumb

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.320 
third four string thumb
and<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.500> first<00:03:08.920> string

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.120 

so<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.900> these<00:03:13.140> two<00:03:13.320> patterns<00:03:13.770> I'll<00:03:13.890> do<00:03:14.010> them

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
so I do these two patterns I'll do them

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.310 
so I do these two patterns I'll do them
open<00:03:14.660> we'll<00:03:15.660> put<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:15.930> little<00:03:16.170> piece<00:03:16.290> of

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
open we'll put this little piece of

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.540 
open we'll put this little piece of
paper<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.770> here<00:03:16.890> maybe<00:03:17.130> you'll<00:03:17.250> be<00:03:17.340> able<00:03:17.400> to

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
paper in here maybe you'll be able to

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
paper in here maybe you'll be able to
visualize<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.330> little<00:03:18.600> bit<00:03:18.690> better<00:03:20.150> so

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:33.370 

five<00:03:24.570> five<00:03:25.200> three

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:51.680 

other<00:03:34.190> pattern<00:03:34.730> I'm<00:03:35.060> doing<00:03:35.510> just<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.870> six

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:04:20.670 

see<00:03:52.690> if<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.870> keep<00:03:53.170> this<00:03:53.320> here

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.739
