00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.700
 get your everyone peter hour or grandma 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.839
 football quiz with a new one today 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.179
 commentary 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.099
 today is day 8 of my august 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.019
 marathon and today I have a mp5 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.579
 gameplay for you 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.199
 i fly guys i don't know where it 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.199
 is on but she only runs one 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.480
 I get a p90 game-play upload once 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.789
 directly and coming from Peter why 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.109
 you always use the p90 in you 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.220
 videos that is not fun to watch 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.019
 look 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.599
 in itself a logical response I use 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.159
 the p90 indeed a lot and the p90 such 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.230
 good weapon so I get a lot of good ones 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.090
 game place but I think it is in itself 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.399
 pretty odd at times 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.980
 happens when the two videos 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.989
 did not play with the p90 before that 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.329
 this specially for that one boy who 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.050
 like a weapon other than the p90 wanted 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.820
 see 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.070
 here's they have 5 gameplay it's one 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.620
 nice on and in these games I will explain 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.170
 how you can best use the mp5 and 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.940
 the mp5 is in my opinion and 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.559
 very much and by eat the weapon don't get 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.379
 wall around the weapon is really bad 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.239
 bad but it's not really that bad 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.880
 so people think a little less 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.070
 bad than what people think at 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.590
 the p5 pen is very simple it 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.170
 weapon is unbelievably strong of 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.910
 close by but unbelievably fast 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.890
 limp from afar 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.290
 as soon as someone is 30 meters away from you 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.300
 state you already need 5 bullets and 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.490
 that's almost double the three 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.950
 bullets you need to take it from 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.630
 close to kill it goes very fast 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.670
 that junk or it is only getting to 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.070
 speeds up when you receive a silencer 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.020
 and that is why I really do not leave it on 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.730
 to use a silent 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.170
 a bit yes a bit contradictory 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.490
 I can actually say because I 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.840
 use in this game play I use 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.130
 yourself the silencer 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.900
 but that's just because i actually 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.910
 you are a bit addicted to the 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.550
 We are silent about it that are up to it 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.200
 people get their backs and I think so 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.990
 personally very difficult to play 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.270
 without a silent, but if you were used to it 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.590
 regularly without silent they then play 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.930
 I would definitely recommend him without it 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.660
 silencer he is very strong i would 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.460
 try it if you have to you namely 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.930
 try to have its strengths yet 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.370
 to make it stronger 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.250
 and then I would actually go for rapid 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.690
 fire and then something from it 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.789
 perhaps externally the brand has fendt 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.460
 not a very large warehouse and in that 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.410
 In that case he is really a complete monster 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.540
 up close that are a bit mine 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.430
 recommended perks you really didn't like 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.130
 could be without a silent then I would 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.170
 can recommend to silencer and maybe 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.850
 also use a little range 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.620
 The left is a proficiency that 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.870
 actually the disadvantage of silencer one 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.880
 little bit and proficiency for that 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.440
 those who still don't know is 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.970
 actually a kind of purk for you 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.880
 weapon you can just set it at the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.010
 creator class and I believe it already 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.709
 Proficiency actually has a little bit 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.390
 The silencer disadvantage on that is one 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.520
 bit the solution if you were really there 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.380
 not at all without silent they can just 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.420
 like me I believe I also find myself 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.150
 frankly I would not use range 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.420
 know it can also be something that I like 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.680
 focus or I use kick does not help very much 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.750
 a lot of 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.920
 against or on this weapon despite this 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.080
 weapon quite a lot 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.910
 annoying recoil has been 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.280
 namely with a normal weapon like 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.190
 you actually have the mp 7th caesar 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.750
 fairly simple grain de rico 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.940
 if you ever go there just go straight to it 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.370
 upstairs only with this weapon is not that 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.080
 so it's hard to see because me too 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.570
 usually moving like me 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.400
 just shoot when I shoot and I stand still 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.739
 Then you can see very well that this weapon 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.840
 also very strong from left to right 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.400
 starts swabbing the moment you shoot 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.720
 that makes him a bit annoying because 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.860
 If you for example giving the 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.170
 chest 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.690
 someone is aiming and then suddenly turns on 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.709
 a few heads above a hand that it 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.390
 adjuster 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.799
 Is that pretty annoying you have to 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.510
 really from a fairly far distance 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.250
 shoot a name already 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.049
 and so you can do a little bullshit 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.940
 be by the game that the recoil 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.150
 just something goes wrong and and just something 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.890
 beside and that you miss a few kills 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.299
 yet why is an additional reason why 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.790
 you only get this weapon up close 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.410
 must use so use it alone 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.209
 but up close then that is a risk 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.790
 problem solved and then he is too 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.320
 really a complete monster 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.970
 I believe that I am almost standing a pear 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.940
 I think I get a dropshot here 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.600
 nice up so that I almost killed you 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.400
 and I think it comes here now 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.010
 little corner I'm red very stupid that is possible 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.720
 still wondering if random oh yes I was one more 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.190
 forcing a bit because the man was 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.630
 not very fast for the 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.510
 was with this weapon and I just didn't 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.050
 people from the distance could only lift 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.120
 but up close 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.050
 I hope you have understood that here 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.000
 are dying 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.830
 here I can also arm I hope 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.390
 you liked the video like that 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.840

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.390

 on this video what have been learned about it 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.220

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.600

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.490
 that you really do go to me sometime 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.560

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.140
 to give it a chance 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.970
 I'd say guys until tomorrow at the 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.810
