 today taking in the recipe then we go 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.060
 legally to take sores we have the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.460
 ingredients we have a package of 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.130
 two butter crackers 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.320
 tablespoons of melted butter a 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.290
 sugar spoon that's for the dough 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.690

 two or three natural yogurts a jar of 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.980
 condensed milk and three tablespoons of 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.710
 unflavored gelatin prepares the cover 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.180
 400 grams of red fruits no one has 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.949
 read frozen frozen the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.570
 equipment should be super fast 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.860
 you average sugar house and one 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.409
 spoonful than a large spoon 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.000
 gelatin without brown or white sugar 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.860
 You can choose any of the things 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.479
 with the dose with the habit see if you 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.650
 what memory in your case better because 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.650
 it has finer 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.240
 we have that this dessert is made between 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.560
 stage does not have oven I here have and 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.040
 here I have what are called cookies 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.710
 ground and processed in the juicer is 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.780
 the city well with more compact strokes 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.729
 until it is well ground 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.729
 the melted butter and we add it 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.280
 a spoonful of sugar already there we have 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.790
 we mix everything well and we have a 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.790
 mold 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.140
 the cops I think we already have a 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.110
 mold to which we put a paper 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.640
 plastic kitchen that to be able to paste 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.300
 how well we put a little water 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.490
 below and here we have the mix ready and 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.869
 we put down already our base of 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.700
 cookies exactly this base that is 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.950
 cookie base serves for all today that 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.950
 for any cake already and then with 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.190
 the back of the spoon we scattered 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.550
 there we have the first part ready and 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.770
 then in a bowl we have three yogurts 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.930
 natural that we are going to milk 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.930
 condensed is already here 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:50.540
 We need a teaspoon of Indian 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.730
 because here we have to mix it well 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.310
 then in a bowl with cold water 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.409
 we dissolve the gelatin that rich and this 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.659
 that is what is happening in the 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.379
 eye beds what do not miss 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.140
 that do not look 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.359
 ok in a bowl with water with cold water and 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.189
 fly over gelatin powder we arrived in 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.129
 form of rain and then we put it on 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.319
 bain-marie it's time to go back to the bathroom 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.629
 Mary and it has to stay that liquid 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.450
 transparent when as if the vein and the 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.189
 inta transparent liquid and it 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.260
 we add a mix of promotion 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.269
 important game loved but well 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.010
 then warm the yogurt or was 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.900
 Cold and I'm cold milk 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.840
 condensed is cold and the only thing that is 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.370
 warm is to read in the jelly in this 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.919
 point while we are doing 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.000
 that the base of cookies we could 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.099
 have put in the refrigerator a 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.840
 but it is not necessary is because 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.549
 true but if we put it how long 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.169
 on the clock while we prepare this 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.310
 because this minute standard follows 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:47.500
 because this position is being done by 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.960
 layers to greece we are ready to 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.710
 stir the source 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.500
 the gelatin grip all clear 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.320
 let's take him up Keep the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.350
 cookies our milk yogurt mix 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.120
 condensed and gelatin already provided in this 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.920
 we will have to take it to the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.540
 refrigerator or freezer so that 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.160
 any quickly 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.080
 huang ingeniadas which preferred was the 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.490
 refrigerator or freezer or intersport 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.750
 by stage then I was getting into 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.580
 freezer because if I did more 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.160
 fast though thing that in is when 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.200
 taylor not while preparing this the 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.290
 second of third stage although this 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.760
 bed is a bag of red fruits those 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.800
 that come frozen do one thing 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.330
 the third layer we solve after 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.650
 the commercial break because there we are 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.830
 with problems women first sebastiÃ¡n 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.340
 rock kitchen 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.340
