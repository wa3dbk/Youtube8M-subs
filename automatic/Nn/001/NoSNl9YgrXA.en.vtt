00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 as mother's day approaches we have 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.529
 thought of doing a craft so that 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.330
 the little ones in the house enjoy and I'll 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.550
 do it with them and start doing this 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.050
 rubber track eva let's teach step to 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.730
 step how to do them we hope that you 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.650
 like the materials to make the oil 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.260
 they are going to do as below to me in two 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.470
 colors and one size four glue 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.170
 instant scissors or cutter depending 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.359
 if you are going to do with children a rule and 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.460
 a pencil to mark the first thing 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.439
 let's do is going to be cut strips of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.720
 30 centimeters long and one centimeter 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.200
 of this wide I'm going to cut five 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.149
 strips in that same color we're going to do 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.329
 two circles of 9 centimeters 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.129
 diameter 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.170
 and we also cut 12 strips of 15 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.000
 centimeters long and 1 centimeter of 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.820
 wide then I 'm going to put everything down 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.479
 so you do not get lost we take the 12 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.339
 15 centimeters strips and we're going to 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.339
 distribute it in this circle 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.450
 you have to be careful with the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.450
 glue alone to smear a droplet 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.220
 here 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.360
 and we paste the strip 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.850
 we take the next strip 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.850
 in the next brand 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.230
 and the ma 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.850
 once we have made the cross 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.850
 among this we are going to put two strips 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.150
 once we've hit all we started 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.590
 to take a little dot and glue on each 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.210
 one of those that we take the other circle 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.720
 that we cut in 9 centimeters of 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.720
 diameter and we stick it on the other 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.110
 now we take the 30 strips 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.240
 centimeters we choose one of the strips 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.260
 short 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.620
 and we're going to stick it right on the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.010
 circle and in the middle of the other strip 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.010
 ah 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.790
 you see halfway and reach the circle 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.069
 once it is stuck we begin to 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.410
 knit you have to do it in shape 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.170
 alternative we will pass one above one 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.599
 below one above one below 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.830
 so that the first always remember 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:55.110
 which will be below 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.620
 it's worth more 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.290
 under 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.430
 above 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.430
 down and so 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.550
 once as it came to the end you know 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.519
 we have the same strip where we have 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.680
 started we take the next pink strip 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.810
 as I have done here and we paste in the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.510
 next strip is not the same is the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.610
 same in the next the next strip 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.620
 we would start on the third the 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.019
 we would start in this the fourth the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.019
 next and the fifth one again in this one 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:40.010
 once we have used all the 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:42.530
 basket we take 44 strip we would take him 2 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.859
 that are together and their opposite in this 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.299
 case would be this and we are going to paste it 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.299
 way we make the handle 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.560
 Now what I'm doing with the rest 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.040
 of strip and go cutting we left 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.040
 two centimeters 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.630
 Y 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.630
 in this case those that go ahead 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.100
 how would this be the glue 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.079
 backward 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.290
 this one that is behind we paste 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.540
 forward now we would only be left 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.820
 disguise a little this what we're going to 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.300
 do is cut a piece of day that I 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.300
 have left over 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.199
 let's do it as a little tie 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.160
 with a little glue here 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.770
 let's have the strip 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.970
 and now 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.370
 we can actively put in the center 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.250
 the other piece 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.180
 we cut a wide piece 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.800
 up here 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:46.069
 Then put glue on the strips and 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.069
 other 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:57.870
 and we unite down in this way 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.840
 what we would do is disguise 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.090
 where the handle hooks this would be the 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.590
 result an eva rubber basket and it's 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.090
 great for the kids in the house to 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.220
 mother's day and you can fill it with 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.930
 flowers or candy we hope that there 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.930
 liked and we see in the blog a kiss
