a guide to you also so basically it's

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.339

the<00:02:51.280> same<00:02:51.430> as<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.090> religion<00:02:52.599> state<00:02:52.989> what<00:02:53.230> I'm

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
the same as the religion state what I'm

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.860 
the same as the religion state what I'm
finding<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:54.130> everything<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.239> about<00:02:55.389> love

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
finding that everything is about love

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.190 
finding that everything is about love
and<00:02:56.169> non-violence<00:02:56.620> end<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.519> we<00:02:58.359> go<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.630> higher

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
and non-violence end and we go to higher

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.289 
and non-violence end and we go to higher
levels<00:02:59.230> when<00:02:59.919> we<00:03:00.040> die<00:03:00.220> now<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.760> think<00:03:01.120> that

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
levels when we die now I think that

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.930 
levels when we die now I think that
sometimes<00:03:01.480> we<00:03:01.930> have<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.049> come<00:03:02.380> back<00:03:02.410> here

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
sometimes we have to come back here

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.120 
sometimes we have to come back here
until<00:03:03.940> we<00:03:04.030> get<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.299> right<00:03:04.859> once<00:03:05.859> we<00:03:06.010> are

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
until we get it right once we are

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.190 
until we get it right once we are
masters<00:03:06.549> or<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:07.030> when<00:03:07.510> we're<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:08.019> that

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
was able to teach about metaphysics and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.520 
was able to teach about metaphysics and
spirituality<00:04:08.879> and<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.450> didn't<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.989> use<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.500> for

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
spirituality and I didn't I use it for

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.569 
spirituality and I didn't I use it for
my<00:04:10.739> own<00:04:10.890> game<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.989> then<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.160> Catholic<00:04:14.160> lifetime

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
my own game and then a Catholic lifetime

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.279 
my own game and then a Catholic lifetime
I<00:04:14.610> was<00:04:14.849> starting<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.299> teach<00:04:15.629> about<00:04:15.989> as<00:04:16.260> a

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
I was starting to teach about as a

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.340 
I was starting to teach about as a
priest<00:04:17.660> reincarnation<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:19.049> these<00:04:19.199> were

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
priest reincarnation and these were

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.650 
priest reincarnation and these were
heresies<00:04:19.889> and<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.160> was<00:04:20.370> killed<00:04:21.000> for<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.299> and

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
heresies and I was killed for that and

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.870 
heresies and I was killed for that and
this<00:04:22.289> time<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.560> think<00:04:23.010> I'm<00:04:23.250> trying<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.669> balance

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
this time I think I'm trying to balance

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.570 
this time I think I'm trying to balance
those<00:04:24.419> two<00:04:24.479> get<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.229> right<00:04:25.470> I'm<00:04:26.130> not<00:04:26.310> getting

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
those two get it right I'm not getting

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.230 
those two get it right I'm not getting
killed<00:04:26.850> right<00:04:28.310> hopefully<00:04:29.310> doing<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:30.030> through

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
killed right hopefully doing it through

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.659 
killed right hopefully doing it through
science<00:04:30.720> like<00:04:31.080> psychiatrists<00:04:32.039> in<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.370> sense

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
science like psychiatrists in a sense

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.930 
science like psychiatrists in a sense
were<00:04:32.880> like<00:04:33.590> priests<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.889> the<00:04:35.039> 20th<00:04:35.520> century<00:04:35.580> a

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
were like priests in the 20th century a

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.760 
were like priests in the 20th century a
little<00:04:36.180> bit<00:04:36.360> now<00:04:36.660> I'm<00:04:36.780> not<00:04:36.930> in<00:04:37.080> religion<00:04:37.590> but

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
little bit now I'm not in religion but

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.450 
little bit now I'm not in religion but
it's<00:04:37.950> science<00:04:38.479> so<00:04:39.479> I<00:04:39.510> think<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.770> that<00:04:41.070> I'm

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
it's science so I think that that I'm

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.219 
it's science so I think that that I'm
trying<00:04:41.729> to<00:04:41.910> get<00:04:42.060> it<00:04:42.210> right<00:04:42.389> but<00:04:42.780> mostly<00:04:43.139> I

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
trying to get it right but mostly I

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.430 
trying to get it right but mostly I
think<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.680> myself<00:04:43.889> as<00:04:44.340> incredibly<00:04:45.440> blessed

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440
