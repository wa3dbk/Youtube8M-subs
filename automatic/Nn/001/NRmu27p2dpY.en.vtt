with the 35 a to side and the elders and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.380 
with the 35 a to side and the elders and
he's<00:03:54.750> actually<00:03:55.050> out<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.530> packs<00:03:56.130> now<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.760> can

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
he's actually out of packs now so I can

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.150 
he's actually out of packs now so I can
see<00:03:57.570> his<00:03:57.660> prize<00:03:57.840> going<00:03:58.200> up<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.440> little<00:03:58.680> bit<00:03:58.890> but

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
see his prize going up a little bit but

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.750 
see his prize going up a little bit but
then<00:03:59.280> again<00:03:59.430> there's<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.450> lot<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:00.870> Elga<00:04:01.230> sins<00:04:01.440> in

then again there's a lot of Elga sins in

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.640 
then again there's a lot of Elga sins in
ultimate<00:04:02.760> team<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.209> guess<00:04:03.450> he<00:04:03.989> won't<00:04:04.200> go

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
ultimate team so I guess he won't go

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.140 
ultimate team so I guess he won't go
that<00:04:04.860> much<00:04:05.070> I'm<00:04:05.280> price<00:04:05.580> because<00:04:05.880> he's<00:04:06.000> not

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
that much I'm price because he's not

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.810 
that much I'm price because he's not
that<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.570> still<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.560> player<00:04:07.890> compared<00:04:08.370> to

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
that and still a player compared to

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.449 
that and still a player compared to
other<00:04:09.030> players<00:04:09.360> in<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.840> game<00:04:09.870> so<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.620> my<00:04:11.190> team

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
other players in the game so I my team

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.970 
other players in the game so I my team
going<00:04:11.670> up<00:04:11.970> 12<00:04:12.660> free<00:04:12.900> cake<00:04:13.140> horns<00:04:13.470> but<00:04:13.650> apart

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
going up 12 free cake horns but apart

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.860 
going up 12 free cake horns but apart
from<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.310> think<00:04:14.610> his<00:04:14.970> first<00:04:15.480> will<00:04:15.720> be

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
from that I think his first will be

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.530 
from that I think his first will be
quite<00:04:16.260> as<00:04:16.470> stable<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.190> as<00:04:17.700> a<00:04:17.730> GI<00:04:17.970> get<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.419> game

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
quite as stable and as a GI get the game

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.270 
quite as stable and as a GI get the game
started<00:04:18.570> with<00:04:18.870> Valentino<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.769> end<00:04:19.919> up<00:04:19.980> losing

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
started with Valentino I end up losing

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.740 
started with Valentino I end up losing
possession<00:04:20.519> but<00:04:20.760> he<00:04:20.850> gets<00:04:21.060> onto<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.510> ball

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
possession but he gets onto the ball

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.570 
possession but he gets onto the ball
again<00:04:21.960> a<00:04:22.020> few<00:04:22.229> minutes<00:04:22.410> later<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.950> look<00:04:23.400> at

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
again a few minutes later and look at

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.920 
again a few minutes later and look at
this<00:04:23.669> nice<00:04:23.910> time<00:04:24.150> he<00:04:24.240> gets<00:04:24.419> past<00:04:24.600> four

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
this nice time he gets past four

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.510 
this nice time he gets past four
defenders<00:04:25.350> he<00:04:25.470> takes<00:04:25.770> on<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:25.979> fifth

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
defenders he takes on a fifth

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.460 
defenders he takes on a fifth
and<00:04:26.610> then<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.150> has<00:04:27.270> been<00:04:27.300> offered<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.110> finish

it<00:04:51.090> was<00:04:51.180> his<00:04:51.360> only<00:04:51.389> shot<00:04:51.690> on<00:04:51.990> target<00:04:52.229> i<00:04:52.409> might

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
it was his only shot on target i might

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.589 
it was his only shot on target i might
be<00:04:52.830> wrong<00:04:52.860> but<00:04:53.069> he<00:04:53.639> won't<00:04:53.819> make<00:04:53.970> it<00:04:54.090> 2-1<00:04:54.449> but

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
be wrong but he won't make it 2-1 but

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.839 
be wrong but he won't make it 2-1 but
way<00:04:54.840> too<00:04:54.870> late<00:04:55.379> and<00:04:55.560> that<00:04:55.620> means<00:04:55.740> i<00:04:56.159> am<00:04:56.460> through

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849

compared<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:10.830> supply<00:06:11.190> but<00:06:11.729> if<00:06:11.849> we<00:06:11.880> go<00:06:12.060> one

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
compared to the supply but if we go one

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:13.610 
compared to the supply but if we go one
week<00:06:12.569> ahead<00:06:12.690> in<00:06:12.900> time<00:06:13.050> where<00:06:13.229> there's<00:06:13.380> no<00:06:13.590> a

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
week ahead in time where there's no a

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.499 
week ahead in time where there's no a
team<00:06:14.039> of<00:06:14.190> the<00:06:14.279> year<00:06:14.310> players<00:06:14.669> it<00:06:14.940> will<00:06:15.360> like

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
team of the year players it will like

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.600 
team of the year players it will like
saturate<00:06:16.110> to<00:06:16.500> a<00:06:16.529> better<00:06:16.800> point<00:06:17.310> where

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
saturate to a better point where

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.689 
saturate to a better point where
basically<00:06:18.569> the<00:06:18.719> supply<00:06:19.319> is<00:06:19.620> a<00:06:20.279> whale<00:06:20.580> or

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
basically the supply is a whale or

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.459 
basically the supply is a whale or

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990
