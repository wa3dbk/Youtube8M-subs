one<00:00:24.000> thing<00:00:24.270> that<00:00:24.570> I've<00:00:24.840> read<00:00:25.110> is<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.470> you

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:25.620 
one thing that I've read is that you

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.320 
one thing that I've read is that you
should<00:00:25.860> soak<00:00:26.310> them<00:00:26.520> in<00:00:26.610> a<00:00:26.670> little<00:00:26.910> bit<00:00:27.030> salt

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
should soak them in a little bit salt

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.350 
should soak them in a little bit salt
water<00:00:27.540> solution<00:00:27.980> ten<00:00:28.980> parts<00:00:29.280> water<00:00:29.370> one<00:00:29.850> part

water solution ten parts water one part
salt<00:00:30.870> for<00:00:31.770> about<00:00:31.860> ten<00:00:32.640> or<00:00:32.669> fifteen<00:00:33.090> minutes<00:00:33.890> to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
salt for about ten or fifteen minutes to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.479 
salt for about ten or fifteen minutes to
help<00:00:35.430> disinfect<00:00:35.820> them<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:37.100> then<00:00:38.100> after<00:00:38.340> that

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
help disinfect them and then after that

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.010 
help disinfect them and then after that
you<00:00:38.730> want<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.970> read<00:00:39.180> some<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.480> some<00:00:39.660> clean

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
you want to read some in some clean

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.369 
you want to read some in some clean
water<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:41.280> probably<00:00:41.580> didn't<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.000> for

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
water and probably didn't do that for

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.220 
water and probably didn't do that for
yes<00:00:43.379> about<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.650> half-hour<00:00:44.900> another<00:00:45.900> thing<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
yes about a half-hour another thing I

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.430 
yes about a half-hour another thing I
read<00:00:46.699> I<00:00:47.699> didn't<00:00:48.629> see<00:00:48.750> anywhere<00:00:48.960> else<00:00:49.110> except

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
read I didn't see anywhere else except

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.560 
read I didn't see anywhere else except
for<00:00:49.470> one<00:00:49.680> source<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.220> if<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.210> peel<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
for one source is that if you peel the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.260 
for one source is that if you peel the
outer<00:00:51.720> layer<00:00:51.809> off<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:53.309> they<00:00:53.520> terminate<00:00:54.059> much

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
outer layer off that they terminate much

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.350 
outer layer off that they terminate much
easier<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.420> this<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.540> some<00:00:57.720> of<00:00:57.810> the<00:00:57.870> skin

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.970 

and<00:01:00.450> that's<00:01:00.990> the<00:01:01.110> seed<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.680> looks<00:01:01.800> like

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and that's the seed what it looks like

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.350 
and that's the seed what it looks like
after<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.370> filled<00:01:02.580> out<00:01:02.700> earlier<00:01:03.000> off<00:01:03.210> I'm

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
after you filled out earlier off I'm

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.600 
after you filled out earlier off I'm
going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> try<00:01:03.720> if<00:01:03.810> you<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.980> if<00:01:05.489> you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
going to try if you like that and if you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.330 
going to try if you like that and if you
would<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:07.130> see<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
would just get on and see what the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.700 
would just get on and see what the
success<00:01:08.730> rate<00:01:08.940> is<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:10.410> two<00:01:10.590> different

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
success rate is the two different

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
success rate is the two different
methods

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
methods

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.120 
methods
so<00:01:12.990> right<00:01:13.260> now<00:01:13.410> they've<00:01:13.590> been<00:01:13.710> soaking<00:01:13.920> for

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
so right now they've been soaking for

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.130 
so right now they've been soaking for
about<00:01:14.340> 15<00:01:15.120> minutes<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.540> let<00:01:15.750> us<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> little

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
about 15 minutes and let us up a little

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.390 
about 15 minutes and let us up a little
bit<00:01:16.380> longer<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.610> I'll<00:01:17.790> show<00:01:18.030> hop<00:01:18.240> plant<00:01:18.450> them

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.500 

for<00:01:24.400> your<00:01:24.490> growing<00:01:24.700> medium<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:26.680> best<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.220> use

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
for your growing medium is best to use

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.560 
for your growing medium is best to use
one<00:01:28.510> part<00:01:28.810> peat<00:01:29.590> moss<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.160> one<00:01:30.820> part<00:01:31.120> perlite

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
one part peat moss and one part perlite

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.150 
one part peat moss and one part perlite
and<00:01:34.050> if<00:01:35.050> they<00:01:35.230> start<00:01:35.440> out<00:01:35.500> best<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:35.920> about<00:01:36.130> a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
and if they start out best in about a

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.890 
and if they start out best in about a
three<00:01:36.430> or<00:01:36.460> four<00:01:36.790> inch<00:01:37.110> plastic<00:01:38.110> pot<00:01:39.870> but<00:01:40.870> you

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
three or four inch plastic pot but you

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.120 
three or four inch plastic pot but you
want<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.230> cover<00:01:41.410> with<00:01:41.740> plastic

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.010 

until<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.790> terminates

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.480 

because<00:01:51.020> peat<00:01:51.289> moss<00:01:51.469> and<00:01:51.710> perlite<00:01:51.770> mixture<00:01:52.430> is

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
because peat moss and perlite mixture is

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.609 
because peat moss and perlite mixture is
pretty<00:01:52.759> dry<00:01:52.969> when<00:01:53.149> it<00:01:53.240> starts<00:01:53.509> out<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:53.960> I'm

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
pretty dry when it starts out so I'm

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.660 
pretty dry when it starts out so I'm
gonna<00:01:54.770> go<00:01:54.860> ahead<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.039> wet<00:01:55.219> it<00:01:55.340> down<00:01:55.490> with<00:01:55.640> some

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
gonna go ahead and wet it down with some

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.770 
gonna go ahead and wet it down with some
filter<00:01:56.149> water<00:01:57.250> for<00:01:58.250> our<00:01:58.310> planted<00:01:58.670> seeds

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.120 

I've<00:02:02.780> already<00:02:02.990> planted<00:02:03.289> three<00:02:03.560> season<00:02:03.979> here

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
I've already planted three season here

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.319 
I've already planted three season here
but<00:02:04.250> I'm<00:02:04.310> gonna<00:02:04.429> go<00:02:04.549> ahead<00:02:04.579> and<00:02:04.729> plant<00:02:05.060> a

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
but I'm gonna go ahead and plant a

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.630 
but I'm gonna go ahead and plant a
fourth<00:02:06.200> one<00:02:06.409> side<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:06.740> see<00:02:06.890> how<00:02:07.039> I<00:02:07.069> did<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.460> I

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
fourth one side you see how I did it I

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.110 
fourth one side you see how I did it I
just<00:02:08.149> put<00:02:08.330> up<00:02:08.479> about<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.200> quarter<00:02:09.440> inch<00:02:09.709> hole

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
just put up about a quarter inch hole

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.170 
just put up about a quarter inch hole
there<00:02:11.120> with<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.360> typical<00:02:11.810> pencil<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:14.030> is

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
there with a typical pencil and this is

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.550 
there with a typical pencil and this is
the<00:02:14.269> seed<00:02:14.480> after<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.780> pulled<00:02:15.049> the<00:02:15.110> outer<00:02:15.260> shell

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
the seed after I pulled the outer shell

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.240 
the seed after I pulled the outer shell
off<00:02:15.739> it's<00:02:16.580> going<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.790> drop<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.060> down<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.360> there

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
off it's going to drop it down in there
