supposed<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:59.100> that's<00:00:59.280> why<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.579> see<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
supposed to do and that's why you see a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.799 
supposed to do and that's why you see a
lot<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.969> people<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.300> they're<00:01:00.449> trying<00:01:00.600> new

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
lot of people when they're trying new

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.020 
lot of people when they're trying new
things<00:01:01.280> their<00:01:02.280> game<00:01:02.430> actually<00:01:02.579> gets<00:01:02.850> worse

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
things their game actually gets worse

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.460 
things their game actually gets worse
and<00:01:03.270> that's<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.660> how<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> should<00:01:03.960> work<00:01:04.140> right

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
and that's not how it should work right

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.920 
and that's not how it should work right
when<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.339> trying<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.640> get<00:01:05.729> better<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.659> you
