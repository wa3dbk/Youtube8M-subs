00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello, I'm 15 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.480
 It's a special day that the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.530
 launch of our 63 ct turbine 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.900
 machine of 65 thousand lots one machine with 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.170
 capacity to generate power for 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.689
 a city with 300 thousand inhabitants 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.939
 always an international technology where 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.250
 puts it globally among the most 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.220
 important companies and development 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.180
 our country 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.970
 is that the equipment that thin of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.670
 size and doctor for the country 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.800
 She is going to be shipped to Guatemala. 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.929
 today you talk about which 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.979
 how much of the products sold 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:53.589
 by genius are exported in which you 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.989
 talk about this scenario and the 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.179
 market is below that of 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.699
 could here in the country 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.769
 does this actually demonstrate the ability 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.899
 of Brazilian industries 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.780
 that they have a demand and a 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.340
 capacity much higher than demand 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.009
 current situation of our country 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.899
 For that, I would not really just say pgm with 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.149
 all capital goods enterprises 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.000
 today are actually being supported and 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.299
 sustained not by the productive chain 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.700
 our Brazilian national and yes in 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.369
 We are not seeking our 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.459
 survival in European countries in 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.670
 our Central American countries in the 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:35.319
 true Brazil partners where this 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.770
 demand is actually with a 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:43.530
 higher growth which unfortunately 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.740
 country is going through this phase is difficult 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.780
 is integration linked to planning 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.440
 energy balance of which actually 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.170
 hopefully in the near future the mec 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.070
 actually be the target of the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.800
 interactive and influence of our 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.490
 government where we can actually 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.130
 have the pleasure of Brazilians who are 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.190
 to install machines of this type. 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.730
 of this complexity of our country 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.870
 today the company exports more than 60% 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.840
 your ability 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.230
 where we would like somehow 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.930
 contributes 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.300
 I sent with this export, however, 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.970
 also grow internally in our 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.980
 country will actually be a summary of the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.800
 our interview in which, in fact 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.080
 It demonstrates a clear and objective way 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.569
 the country is much more 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.130
 technological point of view in relation to 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.860
 opportunities that the country 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.860
 for now offering the country today 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.240
 our because we would have the possibility 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.800
 of having home public policies was 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.040
 adopted in an effective way, we can have 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.170
 many more turbines per boiler being 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.610
 installed across the country 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.490
 I know you talked a little bit about the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.920
 pt tries the biomass for the generation of 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.110
 energy we have the country 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.480
 the power of energy generation through 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.450
 biomass it has to be in fact 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.180
 in a very sustainable way 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.620
 because the turbines the boilers 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.450
 thermal power stations 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.010
 in addition to actually having an impact 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.680
 in the productive chain 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.420
 that is to increase our productivity 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.940
 within our industries 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.490
 thermoelectric plant actually guarantees 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.640
 continuity of sustainability and 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.280
 generation of jobs because biomass 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.350
 it is renewed every year through 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.290
 plants through the bagasse through the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.620
 biomass waste left where all 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.860
 the most developed countries in fact 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.190
 today they actually take advantage of 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.560
 firewood taken from urban trees to 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.510
 which can in fact general energy 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.150
 biomass or brazil 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.580
 the territorial extension sustained by 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.880
 sugar mills have an availability 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.310
 biomass has a capacity of 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.680
 extension and generation through 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.349
 biomass 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.680
 calculable vis-Ã -vis visions 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:14.140
 of our strategic planning linked to 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.410
 discharge to the energy balance 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.810
 this is a prime factor as the fruit 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.419
 the goalkeeper 's viability 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.949
 because once you generate energy you do 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.400
 with which the alcohol is in some way 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.380
 more competitive without having to 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.900
 imminent increase in gasoline to 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.940
 save the sector is not this is not true 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.440
 we want but the most important 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.030
 highlight that through biomass 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.860
 coupled to hydroelectric plant in 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.919
 production of such alcohol chains and 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.479
 sugar brings a lot of sustainability 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.270
 significant for the sector 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.130
 study of fruit and defending it in 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.990
 Truth besides generating employment brings 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.430
 sustainability without impact on our 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.490
 inflation 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:01.289
 if you were to talk about what to expect 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.060
 can we have next year 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.470
 the new little one maybe even more 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.140
 the capacity of even greater 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.070
 produced by the party on 30 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.800
 June 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.440
 the expectation of next year in the area of 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.900
 GM has technological capability 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.240
 manufacture and develop from 20 to 150,000 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.160
 hors this machine because it is ours 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.200
 Release of 65 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.270
 this actually shows once again 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.700
 that we are prepared to be able to 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.610
 meet our country on any 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.130
 demand linked to this productive chain 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.760
 the expectation for next year in 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.830
 truth is a situation that we can be 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.330
 representing industry as potential 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.790
 and ability to meet 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.740
 but we do need a policy 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.180
 that you look at this and that you dislike 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.180
 ability to continue this process
