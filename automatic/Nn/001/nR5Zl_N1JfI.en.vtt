00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.880 
here for the meat I'm going to stick it
in<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.950> middle<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.460> chicken<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:26.680> way<00:02:26.740> I

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
in the middle of the chicken this way I

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.710 
in the middle of the chicken this way I
can<00:02:27.100> monitor<00:02:27.990> how<00:02:32.880> how<00:02:33.880> things<00:02:34.150> are<00:02:34.330> smoking

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
can monitor how how things are smoking

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:47.119 
can monitor how how things are smoking
you<00:02:34.810> know

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.709 

let's<00:02:47.640> make<00:02:47.849> sure<00:02:47.879> it's<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.299> middle<00:02:48.359> part

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
let's make sure it's in the middle part

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:56.599 
let's make sure it's in the middle part
of<00:02:48.749> the<00:02:48.840> chicken<00:02:49.140> which<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.409> is<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.920> then<00:02:56.459> in

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
of the chicken which it is and then in

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.890 
of the chicken which it is and then in
addition<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.999> that<00:02:57.180> what<00:02:57.389> I'm<00:02:57.480> going<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.629> do<00:02:57.780> is

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
addition to that what I'm going to do is

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.429 
addition to that what I'm going to do is
install<00:02:58.200> an<00:02:58.349> ambient<00:02:59.060> thermometer<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.260> can

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
install an ambient thermometer so I can

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.110 
install an ambient thermometer so I can
monitor<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.889> ambient<00:03:02.430> temperature<00:03:02.549> that's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
monitor the ambient temperature that's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.479 
monitor the ambient temperature that's
the<00:03:03.209> temperature<00:03:03.540> inside<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.900> smoker<00:03:04.489> why

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
the temperature inside the smoker why

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.399 
the temperature inside the smoker why
everything<00:03:05.969> smokes<00:03:06.299> so<00:03:06.870> that's<00:03:07.019> how<00:03:07.139> to<00:03:07.170> meat

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
everything smokes so that's how to meat

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.679 
everything smokes so that's how to meat
thermometer<00:03:07.889> that's<00:03:08.159> a<00:03:08.310> meat<00:03:08.459> thermometer

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
thermometer that's a meat thermometer

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.819 
thermometer that's a meat thermometer
that's<00:03:09.689> the<00:03:09.810> ambient<00:03:10.109> longer<00:03:10.409> now<00:03:10.530> our<00:03:10.650> next

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
that's the ambient longer now our next

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:16.539 
that's the ambient longer now our next
step<00:03:11.209> we're<00:03:12.209> going<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.359> just<00:03:12.510> put<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.719> lid<00:03:12.900> on

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.500 

something<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.639> wanted<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:17.939> point<00:03:18.120> out<00:03:18.299> that<00:03:18.329> I

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
something I wanted to point out that I

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.750 
something I wanted to point out that I
pointed<00:03:18.780> out<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:19.019> previous<00:03:19.139> videos<00:03:19.680> there's<00:03:20.579> a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
pointed out in previous videos there's a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.179 
pointed out in previous videos there's a
there<00:03:21.389> supposed<00:03:21.689> to<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.930> gap<00:03:22.169> there<00:03:22.469> this

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:23.189 
there supposed to be a gap there this

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.119 
there supposed to be a gap there this
this<00:03:23.700> smoker<00:03:24.439> doesn't<00:03:25.439> have<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> chimney<00:03:25.919> on

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
this smoker doesn't have a chimney on

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.250 
this smoker doesn't have a chimney on
the<00:03:26.219> top<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.609> just<00:03:26.760> let's<00:03:26.939> move<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.049> smoke

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
the top it just let's move it a smoke

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.050 
the top it just let's move it a smoke
out<00:03:28.379> around<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.739> sides<00:03:28.949> so<00:03:29.250> we're<00:03:29.879> going<00:03:29.969> to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
out around the sides so we're going to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.600 
out around the sides so we're going to
get<00:03:30.150> our<00:03:30.269> wood<00:03:30.480> chips

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.970 

and<00:03:36.120> these<00:03:36.270> are<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.540> wood<00:03:36.690> chips<00:03:36.960> that<00:03:37.050> I<00:03:37.260> have

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
and these are the wood chips that I have

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.310 
and these are the wood chips that I have
been<00:03:38.490> soaking<00:03:38.760> actually<00:03:39.750> they've<00:03:39.870> soaked<00:03:40.140> for

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
you want to do with this just get a good

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.140 
you want to do with this just get a good
good<00:04:04.980> layer<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.250> wood<00:04:05.550> chips<00:04:05.580> these<00:04:06.000> are

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
good layer of wood chips these are

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.350 
good layer of wood chips these are
mesquite<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:07.250> think<00:04:08.250> mesquite<00:04:08.610> goes<00:04:08.850> best<00:04:09.120> for

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
mesquite I think mesquite goes best for

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.700 
mesquite I think mesquite goes best for
chicken<00:04:09.690> that's<00:04:09.840> just<00:04:10.050> my<00:04:10.200> opinion

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
chicken that's just my opinion

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.680 
chicken that's just my opinion
thicker<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.130> good<00:04:11.280> too<00:04:11.490> but<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:12.000> really<00:04:12.420> like

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
thicker is good too but I really like

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.039 
thicker is good too but I really like
mesquite<00:04:13.080> with<00:04:13.260> chicken<00:04:14.480> put<00:04:15.480> these<00:04:15.690> in<00:04:15.870> there

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
mesquite with chicken put these in there

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.280 
mesquite with chicken put these in there
make<00:04:16.260> sure<00:04:16.290> I<00:04:16.440> don't<00:04:16.560> waste<00:04:16.830> any<00:04:17.010> of<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.190> wood

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
make sure I don't waste any of that wood

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.900 
make sure I don't waste any of that wood
and<00:04:19.970> then<00:04:21.530> just<00:04:22.530> kind<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.830> level<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:23.340> out<00:04:23.580> so
