00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the Western approach somewhere so there

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.499

Bo<00:05:31.240> but<00:05:31.810> I<00:05:31.840> wouldn't<00:05:32.260> use<00:05:32.380> it<00:05:32.410> myself<00:05:32.670> mostly

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
Bo but I wouldn't use it myself mostly

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.670 
Bo but I wouldn't use it myself mostly
due<00:05:33.790> to<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.970> fact<00:05:34.180> that<00:05:34.360> I'm<00:05:34.540> a<00:05:34.570> warrior<00:05:34.990> but

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
due to the fact that I'm a warrior but

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.350 
due to the fact that I'm a warrior but
if<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:35.860> had<00:05:35.980> to<00:05:36.040> choose<00:05:36.190> this<00:05:36.610> yeah<00:05:37.030> would

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
if I had to choose this yeah would

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.790 
if I had to choose this yeah would
probably<00:05:37.750> end<00:05:37.840> up<00:05:37.960> picking<00:05:38.140> this<00:05:38.380> over<00:05:38.650> my

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
probably end up picking this over my

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.730 
probably end up picking this over my
current<00:05:39.160> beau<00:05:40.050> mostly<00:05:41.050> due<00:05:41.170> to<00:05:41.200> the<00:05:41.380> fact<00:05:41.560> that

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
current beau mostly due to the fact that

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.320 
current beau mostly due to the fact that
the<00:05:41.890> boat<00:05:42.190> that<00:05:42.370> I<00:05:42.430> currently<00:05:42.700> have<00:05:42.970> equipped

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
the boat that I currently have equipped

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.410 
the boat that I currently have equipped
for<00:05:43.570> Sarah<00:05:43.810> does<00:05:44.080> not<00:05:44.350> have<00:05:44.760> any<00:05:45.760> type<00:05:46.150> of<00:05:48.420> what

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
for Sarah does not have any type of what

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.510 
for Sarah does not have any type of what
do<00:05:49.480> they<00:05:49.570> called<00:05:49.780> runes<00:05:50.170> or<00:05:50.560> rips<00:05:51.040> or<00:05:51.250> anything

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
do they called runes or rips or anything

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.150 
do they called runes or rips or anything
