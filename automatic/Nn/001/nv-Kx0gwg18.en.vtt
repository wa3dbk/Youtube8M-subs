problems with the corners I can do
everything<00:00:20.290> fine<00:00:20.560> but<00:00:20.740> as<00:00:20.860> you<00:00:20.920> see<00:00:21.070> I<00:00:21.100> have

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
lots of corners in this area here which

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.109 
lots of corners in this area here which
drive<00:00:23.619> me<00:00:23.770> a<00:00:23.800> little<00:00:24.040> bit<00:00:24.189> crazy<00:00:24.460> so<00:00:24.820> I<00:00:24.849> had<00:00:25.029> to

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
drive me a little bit crazy so I had to

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.429 
drive me a little bit crazy so I had to
come<00:00:25.270> up<00:00:25.360> with<00:00:25.480> something<00:00:25.869> to<00:00:26.020> make<00:00:26.140> it<00:00:26.170> easy

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
come up with something to make it easy

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.180 
come up with something to make it easy
if<00:00:27.310> I<00:00:27.490> remember<00:00:27.760> a<00:00:27.790> professional<00:00:28.950> he<00:00:29.950> can<00:00:30.099> do

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
if I remember a professional he can do

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.859 
if I remember a professional he can do
this<00:00:30.310> in<00:00:30.880> no<00:00:31.090> time<00:00:31.300> he<00:00:31.420> knows<00:00:31.570> what<00:00:31.720> he's<00:00:31.840> doing

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869

he<00:00:32.199> does<00:00:32.349> it<00:00:32.470> every<00:00:32.680> day<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.540> corner<00:00:35.199> will

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
he does it every day so the corner will

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.420 
he does it every day so the corner will
give<00:00:35.440> me<00:00:35.500> a<00:00:35.559> lot<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.680> trouble<00:00:35.860> so<00:00:36.160> I<00:00:36.220> had<00:00:36.340> to

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.729 
give me a lot of trouble so I had to
invent<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:37.059> little<00:00:37.270> tool<00:00:37.540> I<00:00:37.840> just<00:00:38.440> make<00:00:38.559> show

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:39.720 
invent a little tool I just make show
you<00:00:38.800> what<00:00:38.949> it<00:00:39.040> is<00:00:39.160> I'm<00:00:39.280> not<00:00:39.370> going<00:00:39.520> to<00:00:39.580> take<00:00:39.699> it

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
apart I've already put together but it's

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.439 
apart I've already put together but it's
so<00:00:42.280> simple<00:00:42.519> and<00:00:42.790> I<00:00:42.820> can<00:00:43.000> show<00:00:43.150> you<00:00:43.210> how<00:00:43.330> it

works so here it is here it's a simple

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.590 
works so here it is here it's a simple
little<00:00:45.910> thing<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.680> made<00:00:47.680> with<00:00:47.830> scrap<00:00:48.100> wood<00:00:48.600> you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
little thing I made with scrap wood you

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.329 
little thing I made with scrap wood you
can<00:00:49.750> tell<00:00:49.930> it's<00:00:50.140> a<00:00:50.229> 2<00:00:50.379> by<00:00:50.559> 2<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.390> I'm<00:00:52.690> not<00:00:52.900> sure

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
can tell it's a 2 by 2 and I'm not sure

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.799 
can tell it's a 2 by 2 and I'm not sure
it's<00:00:54.339> a<00:00:54.489> little<00:00:54.729> piece<00:00:54.820> of<00:00:55.000> oak<00:00:55.180> I<00:00:55.330> have<00:00:55.510> here

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809

so<00:00:56.710> basically<00:00:56.979> I<00:00:57.070> just<00:00:57.220> screwed<00:00:57.460> that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
so basically I just screwed that

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.369 
so basically I just screwed that
together<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:58.420> give<00:00:58.570> them<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.750> bit<00:00:58.930> of<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:59.140> mesh

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
together to give them a bit of a mesh

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.649 
together to give them a bit of a mesh
that<00:00:59.589> I've<00:00:59.739> locked<00:00:59.920> I'll<00:01:00.820> try<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.210> packaging

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
that I've locked I'll try the packaging

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.060 
that I've locked I'll try the packaging
on<00:01:01.809> that<00:01:01.960> now<00:01:02.199> the<00:01:02.260> trick<00:01:02.589> to<00:01:02.620> this<00:01:02.769> is<00:01:02.830> you

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.770 
for putting on these different mission
I<00:01:42.340> guess<00:01:43.179> handheld<00:01:44.549> items<00:01:45.549> to<00:01:45.759> sand<00:01:46.600> down

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
I guess handheld items to sand down

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.819 
I guess handheld items to sand down
instead<00:01:47.079> of<00:01:47.140> sandpaper

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
instead of sandpaper

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.090 
instead of sandpaper
they<00:01:48.759> work<00:01:48.909> pretty<00:01:49.119> well<00:01:49.210> I<00:01:49.630> also<00:01:49.929> had<00:01:50.229> bought

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
they work pretty well I also had bought

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.399 
they work pretty well I also had bought
a<00:01:51.130> more<00:01:51.549> finer<00:01:52.119> grit<00:01:52.539> which<00:01:52.899> I<00:01:53.049> could<00:01:53.200> put<00:01:53.380> on

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
a more finer grit which I could put on

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.410 
a more finer grit which I could put on
this<00:01:53.649> piece<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.490> wood<00:01:54.609> later<00:01:54.820> on<00:01:54.999> what<00:01:55.119> I<00:01:55.210> need

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
this piece of wood later on what I need

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.499 
this piece of wood later on what I need
just<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:55.990> do<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> final<00:01:56.939> bit<00:01:57.939> of<00:01:58.030> work<00:01:58.149> with

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
just to do a final bit of work with

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.899 
just to do a final bit of work with
so<00:01:58.659> these<00:01:59.109> aren't<00:01:59.350> expensive<00:01:59.829> and<00:01:59.979> it's

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
so these aren't expensive and it's

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.520 
so these aren't expensive and it's
better<00:02:01.329> than<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.600> sandpaper<00:02:02.109> because<00:02:02.200> it's

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
better than the sandpaper because it's

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.899 
better than the sandpaper because it's
actually<00:02:03.009> that's<00:02:03.819> the<00:02:05.340> mud<00:02:06.340> come<00:02:06.640> through

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
actually that's the mud come through

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.249 
actually that's the mud come through
when<00:02:07.060> you're<00:02:07.210> sanding<00:02:07.689> it<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:07.899> let<00:02:08.080> me<00:02:08.110> show

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
when you're sanding it so let me show

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.749 
when you're sanding it so let me show
you<00:02:08.380> how<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.710> works<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.130> what<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.340> did<00:02:09.580> with<00:02:09.729> it

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
you how it works and what I did with it

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.600 
you how it works and what I did with it
so<00:02:10.000> far<00:02:10.270> I<00:02:10.539> have<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.350> lot<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.620> corners<00:02:12.160> here<00:02:12.490> in

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
so far I have a lot of corners here in

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.270 
so far I have a lot of corners here in
summer

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
summer

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.790 
summer
short<00:02:13.730> summer<00:02:14.300> long<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:15.319> basically<00:02:15.620> what<00:02:15.770> I

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
short summer long so basically what I

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.120 
short summer long so basically what I
did<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.760> can<00:02:16.940> see<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.330> piece<00:02:17.630> here<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.230> take

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
did you can see this piece here I take

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:37.260 
did you can see this piece here I take
it<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:20.319> run<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.470> long

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.400 

so<00:02:38.270> what<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.480> does<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.840> gives<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.200> nice

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
so what it does it gives you a nice

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.260 
so what it does it gives you a nice
corner<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.220> still<00:02:41.180> put<00:02:41.390> some<00:02:41.570> more<00:02:41.780> mud

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
corner I still put some more mud

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.550 
corner I still put some more mud
all<00:02:44.270> right<00:02:44.540> hand<00:02:44.780> it's<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.050> little<00:02:45.380> bit<00:02:45.470> of

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
all right hand it's a little bit of

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.900 
all right hand it's a little bit of
trouble<00:02:45.740> getting<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.220> pressure<00:02:46.490> on<00:02:46.700> my

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
trouble getting the pressure on my

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.020 
trouble getting the pressure on my
needle<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:47.590> basically<00:02:48.590> that's<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.460> do<00:02:49.640> this

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
needle so basically that's it I do this

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.450 
needle so basically that's it I do this
on<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.360> angle<00:02:50.660> like<00:02:50.780> this<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:51.020> bit<00:02:51.290> as<00:02:51.440> well<00:02:51.680> is

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
on the angle like this a bit as well is

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.380 
on the angle like this a bit as well is
that<00:02:52.640> we're<00:02:52.820> getting<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:56.740> mesh<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:59.090> that's

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
that we're getting the mesh and that's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.420 
that we're getting the mesh and that's
it<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.780> then<00:02:59.900> to<00:02:59.990> do<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.140> top<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.800> would<00:03:01.220> just

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
it and then to do the top I would just

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.780 
it and then to do the top I would just
go<00:03:01.580> like<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.890> takes<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:07.520> not<00:03:07.640> really

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
go like this it takes it it's not really

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.550 
go like this it takes it it's not really
big<00:03:08.000> major<00:03:08.240> job<00:03:08.660> at<00:03:08.900> least<00:03:09.110> I'm<00:03:09.230> going<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.440> get
