00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
it DC to DC converter this is where I

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.109 
it DC to DC converter this is where I
got<00:00:16.830> them<00:00:16.949> from<00:00:17.180> Mouser<00:00:19.250> this<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.520> size<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
them right here this is the 40 amp that

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.859 
them right here this is the 40 amp that
I'm<00:00:24.630> using<00:00:24.840> now<00:00:25.760> this<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> 60<00:00:27.449> amp<00:00:27.660> that's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
I'm using now this is the 60 amp that's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.419 
I'm using now this is the 60 amp that's
going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.650> case<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:29.279> this

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
going to go in this case with this

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.040 
going to go in this case with this
heatsink<00:00:30.260> yes<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> massive<00:00:31.949> heatsink

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
heatsink yes it is a massive heatsink

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.119 
heatsink yes it is a massive heatsink
the<00:00:34.050> cooler<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.559> stays<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.160> more<00:00:36.860> stable<00:00:37.860> it

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the cooler it stays the more stable it

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.220 
the cooler it stays the more stable it
is<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:39.000> will<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> fan<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
is it will have a fan on it and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.389 
is it will have a fan on it and
everything<00:00:40.440> else<00:00:40.829> when<00:00:41.160> I'm<00:00:41.280> done<00:00:43.100> now<00:00:44.100> let<00:00:44.280> me

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
everything else when I'm done now let me

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.290 
everything else when I'm done now let me
zoom<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> little<00:00:45.120> bit<00:00:46.370> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> new<00:00:47.910> 60

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
zoom in a little bit this is the new 60

00:00:48.300 --> 00:01:00.799 
zoom in a little bit this is the new 60
amp<00:00:58.160> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.340> pretty<00:00:59.670> much<00:00:59.730> guess<00:01:00.239> how<00:01:00.449> small

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
amp you can pretty much guess how small

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.070 
amp you can pretty much guess how small
it<00:01:01.050> is

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
it is

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.060

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
there's lined up there you go that's the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.090 
there's lined up there you go that's the
60<00:01:08.610> amp<00:01:08.820> version<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.750> version<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.619> use<00:01:13.799> right

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
60 amp version the version I use right

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.690 
60 amp version the version I use right
now<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.939> 40<00:01:15.450> amp<00:01:22.009> which<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.430> one

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
now is the 40 amp which is this one

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.160 
now is the 40 amp which is this one
right<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:25.040> remove<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:27.140> before<00:01:28.140> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
right here I remove this before I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.499 
right here I remove this before I
install<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.729> that's<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.030> mounted<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.479> a

install it that's to be mounted on a
motherboard<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.200> way<00:01:32.750> okay<00:01:34.640> this<00:01:35.640> is

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
motherboard that way okay this is

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
another 60 amp and two more 60 amps in

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:50.210 
another 60 amp and two more 60 amps in
here<00:01:42.380> this<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.890> another<00:01:44.820> 40<00:01:45.360> amp<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:48.740> have<00:01:49.740> uses

here this is another 40 amp I have uses
for<00:01:50.460> all<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.850> them

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.550 

you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.030> find<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.479> specs<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.170> how<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> hook

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you can find the specs and how to hook

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.249 
you can find the specs and how to hook
them<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.890> online<00:01:56.299> once<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> numbers

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.230 

which<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.500> part<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:03.140> let's<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:05.240> there's

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
which is part of this let's see there's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:20.630 
which is part of this let's see there's
the<00:02:06.509> actual<00:02:06.899> chip<00:02:12.200> information<00:02:19.340> I've<00:02:20.340> got<00:02:20.550> it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
the actual chip information I've got it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.729 
the actual chip information I've got it
on<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.790> tripod<00:02:21.209> how<00:02:21.810> far<00:02:22.080> it's<00:02:22.260> clear<00:02:22.650> enough

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.690 

anyway<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:29.930> will<00:02:30.930> list<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.709> comments<00:02:32.549> on

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
anyway I will list it in the comments on

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.800 
anyway I will list it in the comments on
this<00:02:32.970> unit<00:02:33.920> on<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.190> video<00:02:35.580> when<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.620> do<00:02:37.620> it

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.820 

these<00:02:42.810> are<00:02:42.989> made<00:02:43.110> by<00:02:43.140> two<00:02:43.349> different

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
these are made by two different

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.370 
these are made by two different
companies<00:02:47.510> hence<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.780> reason<00:02:48.989> they're<00:02:49.349> not

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
companies hence the reason they're not

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.089 
companies hence the reason they're not
exactly<00:02:50.130> identical<00:02:54.560> when<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.650> comes<00:02:55.890> to

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
exactly identical when it comes to

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:08.190 
exactly identical when it comes to
different<00:02:56.370> features<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:57.150> them

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.600 

I<00:03:09.000> will<00:03:10.000> list<00:03:10.410> everything<00:03:11.410> at<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.040> end<00:03:12.069> of<00:03:12.519> the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
I will list everything at the end of the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.089 
I will list everything at the end of the
at<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.000> bottom<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> video<00:03:14.019> okay

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
at the bottom of the video okay

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.879 
at the bottom of the video okay
bye<00:03:15.670> now
