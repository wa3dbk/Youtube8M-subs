Blaster Omni one thing that went wrong

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.310 
Blaster Omni one thing that went wrong
with<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.180> USB<00:00:24.810> connection<00:00:25.170> on

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
with this is that the USB connection on

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.550 
with this is that the USB connection on
the<00:00:25.470> back<00:00:25.500> went<00:00:26.369> bad<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.260> you<00:00:28.260> would<00:00:28.380> end<00:00:28.500> up

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
the back went bad so you would end up

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.200 
the back went bad so you would end up
having<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.890> loose<00:00:29.039> connection<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.789> would<00:00:30.090> not

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
having a loose connection and would not

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.350 
having a loose connection and would not
connect<00:00:30.599> properly<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.669> pretty<00:00:33.210> good

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
connect properly it this was pretty good

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.840 
connect properly it this was pretty good
for<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.660> while<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:33.870> once<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.950> got<00:00:35.100> this

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850

performs better than the Omni in my my
experience<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.379> don't<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> best

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
not distorted it's much more clear when

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.420

headphones<00:01:19.530> right<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.659> can

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
headphones right here if you have I can

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.200 
headphones right here if you have I can
only<00:01:22.770> imagine<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.369> it'll<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.820> when<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
only imagine what it'll be like when you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.789 
only imagine what it'll be like when you
have<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> couple<00:01:24.600> hundred<00:01:24.780> dollar<00:01:25.020> headphones

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
have a couple hundred dollar headphones

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.070 
have a couple hundred dollar headphones
and<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> plugged<00:01:27.270> into<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.689> here

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
and you have it plugged into this here

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.749 
and you have it plugged into this here
because<00:01:28.500> even<00:01:28.950> though<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.340> an<00:01:29.430> external

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
because even though it's an external

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.149 
because even though it's an external
hard<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.240> come<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.659> hard<00:01:30.900> drug<00:01:31.020> external<00:01:31.920> sound

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
hard to come a hard drug external sound

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.450 
hard to come a hard drug external sound
card<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.900> really<00:01:34.259> good<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.860> components<00:01:35.369> on

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
card it is really good the components on

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.450 
card it is really good the components on
here<00:01:35.700> or<00:01:35.850> high<00:01:35.970> quality<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.570> think<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.500> much

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
here or high quality I think it's much

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.319 
here or high quality I think it's much
more<00:01:38.570> well<00:01:39.570> made<00:01:39.840> than<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.530> omni<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.430> think

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
more well made than the omni is I think

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.200 
more well made than the omni is I think
this<00:01:42.479> kind<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.930> has<00:01:43.079> more<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.939> maybe<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.030> little

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
this kind of has more of maybe a little

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.620 
this kind of has more of maybe a little
bit<00:01:45.360> better<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> software<00:01:46.970> it's<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
bit better of the software it's the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.560 
bit better of the software it's the
software<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.350> more<00:01:49.649> clean<00:01:49.979> because

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
software on this as more clean because

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.999 
software on this as more clean because
when<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.600> go<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> open<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.329> my<00:01:54.329> computer<00:01:54.720> here

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
when I go to open up on my computer here

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.740 
when I go to open up on my computer here
it's<00:01:56.009> very<00:01:56.159> basic<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.759> probably<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.540> have

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
it's very basic you probably if you have

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.800 
it's very basic you probably if you have
a<00:01:57.990> sound<00:01:58.320> blaster<00:01:58.909> already<00:01:59.909> or<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.240> have<00:02:00.479> one<00:02:00.659> in

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
a sound blaster already or I have one in

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.190 
a sound blaster already or I have one in
the<00:02:00.899> past<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:02.100> looks<00:02:02.369> familiar<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
the past you this looks familiar to you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.580 
the past you this looks familiar to you
but<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.500> change

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
but you can change

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.240 
but you can change
basic<00:02:06.430> things<00:02:06.610> in<00:02:06.729> here<00:02:06.909> SBX<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.800> equalizer

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
basic things in here SBX the equalizer

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.970 
basic things in here SBX the equalizer
mixer<00:02:09.700> are<00:02:10.420> not<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.750> mixer<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.770> then<00:02:11.860> the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
mixer are not the mixer and then the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.120 
mixer are not the mixer and then the
equalizer<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:14.530> all<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:15.340> anyway

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
equalizer and just all that anyway

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.770 
equalizer and just all that anyway
nothing<00:02:18.130> real<00:02:18.250> fancy<00:02:18.630> but<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:22.390> going<00:02:22.569> over

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
nothing real fancy but but going over

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.509 
nothing real fancy but but going over
the<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:25.480> card<00:02:25.870> itself<00:02:26.200> here<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:27.340> have<00:02:27.370> a

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
the the card itself here is you have a

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.430 
the the card itself here is you have a
dial<00:02:27.849> on<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.150> left<00:02:28.330> side<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.750> then<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.110> light

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
dial on the left side and then a light

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.920 
dial on the left side and then a light
show<00:02:29.920> that's<00:02:30.099> on<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:31.540> ended<00:02:31.690> up<00:02:31.780> getting

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
show that's on and I ended up getting

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.430 
show that's on and I ended up getting
from<00:02:32.349> Radio<00:02:33.280> Shack<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.519> an<00:02:33.880> adapter<00:02:34.440> that's

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
from Radio Shack a an adapter that's

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.690 
from Radio Shack a an adapter that's
quarter-inch<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:37.470> 3.5<00:02:38.470> millimeter<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.519> can

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
quarter-inch to 3.5 millimeter so I can

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.059 
quarter-inch to 3.5 millimeter so I can
plug<00:02:39.910> these<00:02:40.200> other<00:02:41.200> these<00:02:41.830> headphones

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
plug these other these headphones

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.150 
plug these other these headphones
Logitech<00:02:42.790> headphones<00:02:43.150> into<00:02:43.330> here<00:02:43.600> since<00:02:44.500> this

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
Logitech headphones into here since this

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.820 
Logitech headphones into here since this
is<00:02:45.220> way<00:02:45.549> too<00:02:45.610> big<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.330> it's<00:02:46.810> more<00:02:47.470> for<00:02:47.650> high

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
is way too big and it's more for high

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.750 
is way too big and it's more for high
quality<00:02:47.970> headphones<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:51.190> think<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.670> already

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
quality headphones and I think I already

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.380 
quality headphones and I think I already
said<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:52.569> it's<00:02:52.870> all<00:02:53.110> gold-plated<00:02:54.390> so

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
said this but it's all gold-plated so

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.500 
said this but it's all gold-plated so
that's<00:02:55.930> going<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.170> ensure<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.860> quality

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
that's going to ensure that the quality

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.120 
that's going to ensure that the quality
the<00:02:58.510> transferring<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.410> audio<00:02:59.680> signal<00:02:59.890> is

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
the transferring of the audio signal is

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.860 
the transferring of the audio signal is
going<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.519> be<00:03:00.610> really<00:03:00.849> good<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:02.069> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
going to be really good and the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.380 
going to be really good and the
signal-to-noise<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:05.880> 114<00:03:06.880> dB

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
signal-to-noise is 114 dB

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.220 
signal-to-noise is 114 dB
and<00:03:08.519> it's<00:03:09.519> very<00:03:09.670> good<00:03:09.850> for<00:03:09.910> that<00:03:10.780> external

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
and it's very good for that external

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.410 
and it's very good for that external

and many discs players so everything is

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.160 
and many discs players so everything is
very<00:03:43.959> easily<00:03:44.200> accessible<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.730> just<00:03:46.170> it's

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
very easily accessible and I just it's

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.319 
very easily accessible and I just it's
very<00:03:47.410> kind<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.859> similar<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.430> way<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.609> the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
very kind of similar in a way to the

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.470 
very kind of similar in a way to the
Omni<00:03:50.579> much<00:03:51.579> revenue<00:03:51.819> you<00:03:51.940> were<00:03:52.090> looking<00:03:52.359> at

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
Omni much revenue you were looking at

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.470 
Omni much revenue you were looking at
the<00:03:52.569> Omni<00:03:52.840> before<00:03:53.139> and<00:03:53.380> I<00:03:54.060> mainly<00:03:55.060> just<00:03:55.299> use

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
the Omni before and I mainly just use

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.860 
the Omni before and I mainly just use
this<00:03:55.600> for<00:03:55.810> video<00:03:56.049> games<00:03:56.609> so<00:03:57.609> I<00:03:57.639> can<00:03:58.090> hear<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.750> lot

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
this for video games so I can hear a lot

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.030 
this for video games so I can hear a lot
better<00:03:59.049> which<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.410> does<00:03:59.590> make<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.829> big

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
better which it does make a big

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.770 
better which it does make a big
difference<00:04:00.069> between<00:04:00.489> integrated<00:04:01.359> and<00:04:01.540> then

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
difference between integrated and then

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.030 
difference between integrated and then
even<00:04:02.470> slightly<00:04:02.829> better<00:04:03.430> than<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:04.090> Omni<00:04:04.480> I

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
even slightly better than the Omni I

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.020 
even slightly better than the Omni I
would<00:04:06.040> go<00:04:06.220> ahead<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.579> buy<00:04:06.670> this<00:04:06.730> product<00:04:07.319> they

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
would go ahead and buy this product they

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.069 
would go ahead and buy this product they
creative<00:04:10.030> definitely<00:04:10.480> did<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.720> really<00:04:10.900> good

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
creative definitely did a really good

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.440 
creative definitely did a really good
job<00:04:11.139> with<00:04:11.319> this<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.880> don't<00:04:12.880> think<00:04:13.000> they<00:04:13.209> really

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
job with this I don't think they really

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.580 
job with this I don't think they really
messed<00:04:13.629> up<00:04:13.810> at<00:04:14.049> all

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
messed up at all

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.349 
messed up at all
and<00:04:15.950> like<00:04:16.609> I<00:04:16.700> said<00:04:16.760> I<00:04:16.880> have<00:04:17.000> this<00:04:17.090> for<00:04:17.299> about

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
and like I said I have this for about

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.569 
and like I said I have this for about
three<00:04:17.540> months<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:18.019> is<00:04:18.169> still<00:04:18.350> running<00:04:19.310> really

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
three months and is still running really

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.510 
three months and is still running really
well<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:20.139> no<00:04:21.139> issues<00:04:21.410> at<00:04:21.440> all<00:04:21.650> have<00:04:22.400> any

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
well and no issues at all have any

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.290 
well and no issues at all have any
questions<00:04:22.910> let<00:04:23.030> me<00:04:23.060> know

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
questions let me know

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.360 
questions let me know
one<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.230> thing<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.590> that<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.830> cable<00:04:25.010> is

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
one of the thing is that the cable is

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.890 
one of the thing is that the cable is
six<00:04:26.240> feet<00:04:26.389> long
