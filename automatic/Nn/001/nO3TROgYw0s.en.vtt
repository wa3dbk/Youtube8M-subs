00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
gonna go rogue and that it would be so

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.720 
gonna go rogue and that it would be so
cool<00:02:28.960> if<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:29.470> went<00:02:29.680> against<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.100> UNSC

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730

because<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.240> would<00:02:31.330> break<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:31.930> many<00:02:32.140> rules

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
because that would break so many rules

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.760 
because that would break so many rules
like<00:02:33.420> Master<00:02:34.420> Chief<00:02:34.630> going<00:02:34.870> against<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.260> UNSC
