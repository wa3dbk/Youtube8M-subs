00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
pipe is just sitting there now we're

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.720 
pipe is just sitting there now we're
going<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.290> work<00:02:42.439> on<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.739> back<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.189> take<00:02:43.579> the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
going to work on the back to take the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.869 
going to work on the back to take the
back<00:02:43.909> to<00:02:44.120> boats<00:02:44.359> off<00:02:44.599> and<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:46.459> whole<00:02:46.639> pipe

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
back to boats off and the whole pipe

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.990 
back to boats off and the whole pipe
should<00:02:47.120> come<00:02:47.269> off<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:48.099> stuck<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.219> o2<00:02:49.579> sensor

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
should come off I stuck the o2 sensor

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.610 
should come off I stuck the o2 sensor
there<00:02:50.180> behind<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.780> transmission<00:02:51.409> lines

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
there behind the transmission lines

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.059 
there behind the transmission lines
hopefully<00:02:52.989> hopefully<00:02:53.989> it'll<00:02:54.349> be<00:02:54.499> okay<00:02:54.530> there

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
hopefully hopefully it'll be okay there

okay<00:05:27.970> I<00:05:30.479> already<00:05:31.479> thought<00:05:31.720> I<00:05:31.930> already<00:05:32.139> plugged

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
okay I already thought I already plugged

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.020 
okay I already thought I already plugged
the<00:05:32.740> sensor<00:05:33.220> in<00:05:35.370> yeah<00:05:36.370> I<00:05:36.400> already<00:05:36.639> plugged

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
the sensor in yeah I already plugged

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.379 
the sensor in yeah I already plugged
plug<00:05:37.690> just<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:38.699> electrical<00:05:39.699> connection<00:05:40.240> in

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
plug just the electrical connection in

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.350 
plug just the electrical connection in
before<00:05:40.990> I<00:05:41.020> put<00:05:41.530> the<00:05:41.680> pipe<00:05:41.889> on<00:05:42.160> I<00:05:42.430> just<00:05:43.120> let<00:05:43.270> it

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
before I put the pipe on I just let it

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.730 
before I put the pipe on I just let it
hang<00:05:43.570> there<00:05:43.599> don't<00:05:44.139> want<00:05:44.259> this<00:05:44.410> is<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.590> one

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
hang there don't want this is the one

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.439 
hang there don't want this is the one
that<00:05:44.919> I<00:05:44.979> missed<00:05:45.570> but<00:05:47.460> so<00:05:48.460> I'm<00:05:48.820> going<00:05:49.060> to<00:05:49.090> screw

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.290 

and<00:05:56.290> then<00:05:56.500> we'll<00:05:56.650> do<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.950> other<00:05:56.980> sensor<00:05:57.640> up<00:05:57.970> up

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
and then we'll do the other sensor up up

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.470 
and then we'll do the other sensor up up
on<00:05:58.480> the<00:05:59.020> other<00:05:59.140> side
