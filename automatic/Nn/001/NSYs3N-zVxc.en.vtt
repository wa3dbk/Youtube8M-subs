 gamestation we press the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.410
 agents and they are already copying the others 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.240
 the files will take a little while 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.220
 are copied for example here in the first 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.080
 is that I'm installing it but I trust 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.760
 at the source that where I got like 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.240
 you can see there is the country version 1.1 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.570
 point 3 the file and index gamepad of 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.250
 will be installing the game in my case 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.870
 I'm going to put a pause on what they create 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.530
 the files do not worry right now 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.330
 we come back 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.750
 and good and we are back and once 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.270
 which is that it is already finished happening 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.650
 to find something like that for the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.080
 contract of meaning is refined we are going 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.240
 to give accepted and how can you see if I'm 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.770
 installing some files me to the visual 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.840
 studio 2010 are the files that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.869
 we need to run the game well 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.119
 are the visual microsoft files are 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.729
 common reach but we do rain what 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.190
 I had installed but we're going to have it 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.720
 install but do not worry it did not take long 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.430
 very much in fact no more wait like 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.280
 approximately two between two or three 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.350
 minutes and we can wait a bit see 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.780
 that this is installed or if we can not 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.350
 pause I think I'm going to pause 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.350
 still waiting a bit 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.790
 and well and we're back I did all the 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.230
 previous record activities themselves have 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.719
 installed correctly and we can give to 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.090
 accept as you can see says it already follows 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:39.120
 team for world I did it finish 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.370
 installation round scope sharqat those who 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.349
 you can see here the start appeared 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.439
 fast first card if you 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.049
 they need and that contains ok ok then 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.719
 let's give it here and say steven kirk to 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.579
 play or that we invite the steam installed 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.629
 to play online that is, yes, we 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.280
 we want to play the servers online 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.260
 we have to have the steam is created 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.900
 fortunately, I have it here 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.250
 I have my steam and they believe in the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.260
 official page is tim only go to 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.049
 google and they write sting says before 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.049
 run before running the game 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.629
 start steam and see what you want 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.890
 install destined to maite says exquisite 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.010
 system in this case and then with that 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.200
 not because I already have the steam and then it 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.750
 ends and percent we are at 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.970
 initials team 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.760
 let's say it does not take long or that 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.230
 Typical update of steam good 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.910
 we wait a little bit in what I'm 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.470
 install this thing 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.300
 and good and we are back as you can 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.820
 see here is my account then of sting and 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.770
 Well, we're all good for me to be 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.060
 initial estimate I want to assume so 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.740
 we're going to the first card we're going to 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.210
 run 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.650
 let's see what happens hopefully and functions 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.050
 it did not work I guarantee it not 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.590
 when I would be doing this tutorial 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:57.129
 we wait for them to load 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.160
 as the first card here we have the game 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:03.070
 and then we see that if it works 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.290
 is fully full or is installed 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.150

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.960
 well let's ask first of all what 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:42.630
 start 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.890
 As you can see, it is already 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.890

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.090

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.139

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.480
 that carry 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:10.300
 but there may be no problem 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.830
