00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.820
 this time we are going to explain to you how it is the grind of cali 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.840
 to begin with, we must explain that coffee beans are better 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.839
 why 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.839
 they have less time of degradation 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 in this way the sales 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.169
 for this question 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.810
 that we buy in grain 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.630
 can last longer 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.770
 stored in conditions while I do not have an age and that of quique not 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.949
 be exposed 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.300
 to other environmental interests 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.190
 coffee beans can last up to three months compared to ground coffee 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.580
 what do you have with which to consume 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.770
 within a maximum period of one week 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.250
 to grind exhaust there are various techniques 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.450
 i various products that tells us what can be demolished in mortar 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.250
 how can 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.170
 back in a scioli office 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.950
 the basic process of a coffee mill 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.150
 is that it has 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.860
 Cog wheels through which the coffee bean passes 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.660
 it is also dying in a rather 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.020
 there are also two electric models 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.050
 however these are not recommended because hot in the summer of coffee and 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.300
 reduce their lifespan 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.070
 to grind coffee in mill 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.360
 oo manual 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.710
 what we have to do 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.150
 answer 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.220
 chunata fiscal equity 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.220
 appropriate these dates 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
 it's about the compartment 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.220
 this coffee beans 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.309
 cajaol jars 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.309
 with airtight seal 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.789
 jessica spagnoletti 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.789
 that retains its flavor functions 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.699
 after the goal the coffee and tea had a manual you have to follow it 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:03:00.099
 this is because many times the poster can be with some other shell 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.429
 with grains in serious condition 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:04.569
 then what are we going to do 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.179
 is that we're going to pass 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:07.909
 it moved 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.279
 a colander 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:13.279
 let's continue 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:16.559
 in this way the detail that remains 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.449
 In the container 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:19.869
 It's a coffee 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:23.289
 belgrano much smaller 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:26.289
 therefore without more intense flavor 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.549
 so as not to waste coffee 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.049
 you can also do a second very well da 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.139
 but they will be the ones that have already been a thick are very robust 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.399
 so they are wasted 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:47.729
 coffee bean and you can take advantage of the entire helmet 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.209
 Toasted greater toasted greater intensity of taste 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:57.059
 then when we have a mixture of dark grains like in this case 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.369
 with a small amount of deposit we have about 2 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:04.759
 spoonfuls 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.729
 two operas for each liter of water 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:10.909
 it will be OK 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.909
 We can appreciate 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.909
 the thickest grain is left on the server 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:23.210
 like the grain 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.479
 Thinner thinner 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.479
 our respect goes 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.540
 let's discuss the time we have finished doing our paper and 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.539
 air separate the larger particles 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.169
 what we are going to do is that we are going to save 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.710
 in a recipient 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.330
 with airtight lid 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.669
 with can be a pleasant 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.999
 I take you silver 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:48.840
 op a glass jar 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.849
 it is important that they are clean 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.849
 and that they had not had any other type of content inside 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:55.460
 why 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.840
 the smell goals in favor of her of that product 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.350
 it can affect 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.499
 in the roma moza by the nasa 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:05.710
 what are we going to do 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.379
 is that with a spoon 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.180
 let's go to russia 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.430
 about 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.680
 your spokespersons 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.669
 the coffee does not move much 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.960
 so that neither 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.500
 that exceeds a lot of contact with the oxygen in the environment since this happens 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 make present in the marker 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.719
 we appreciate at first 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.719
 current and endo and conserving coffee 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.900
 Honduran to the minutes 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.430
 They can last cool 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.199
 up to 15 days if saved 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.020
