00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
damage right now let's say you're

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.240 
damage right now let's say you're
killing<00:02:39.750> an<00:02:39.840> elementalist<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.590> blast<00:02:40.860> furnace

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
and that thing needs to die if that's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.710 
and that thing needs to die if that's
the<00:02:43.739> case<00:02:43.920> go<00:02:44.580> ahead<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.150> spend<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.690> extra

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
the case go ahead and spend that extra

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.680 
the case go ahead and spend that extra
fury<00:02:46.350> on<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.950> third<00:02:47.280> or<00:02:47.519> fourth<00:02:48.090> demon<00:02:48.480> bolt

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
fury on that third or fourth demon bolt

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.080 
fury on that third or fourth demon bolt
having<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.680> extra<00:02:49.890> burst<00:02:50.370> damage<00:02:50.640> right

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
having that extra burst damage right

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.390 
having that extra burst damage right
then<00:02:51.390> even<00:02:52.050> though<00:02:52.170> its<00:02:52.350> fury<00:02:52.620> inefficient

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
then even though its fury inefficient

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.750 
then even though its fury inefficient
will<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.239> more<00:02:54.630> than<00:02:55.070> having<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.250> more

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
will be more than having a more

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.360 
will be more than having a more
efficient<00:02:57.269> fury<00:02:57.840> casting<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.560> not<00:02:59.069> having

efficient fury casting and not having

efficient fury casting and not having
that<00:02:59.519> elementalist<00:03:00.120> I'm<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.560> going

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
that elementalist I'm so this is going

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.740 
that elementalist I'm so this is going
to<00:03:01.769> have<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.130> cause<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.640> think<00:03:02.910> do<00:03:03.480> i<00:03:03.540> need

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
to have to cause you to think do i need

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.630

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
this target to die right now do i need

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.670 
this target to die right now do i need
this<00:03:05.790> damage<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:06.510> burst<00:03:06.840> front<00:03:07.260> loaded<00:03:07.500> right

this damage and burst front loaded right

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.790 
this damage and burst front loaded right
now<00:03:07.860> if<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.850> do<00:03:09.150> then<00:03:09.750> definitely<00:03:10.200> cast<00:03:10.560> that

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
now if you do then definitely cast that

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.699 
now if you do then definitely cast that
third<00:03:11.069> demon<00:03:11.459> bolt<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.569> if<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.810> don't<00:03:13.080> just
