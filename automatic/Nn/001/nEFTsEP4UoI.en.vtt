sorry
and<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.770> would<00:00:52.949> simply<00:00:53.760> create<00:00:54.649> blocks<00:00:56.120> that

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and we would simply create blocks that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.069 
and we would simply create blocks that
look<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.329> since<00:01:00.329> most<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.750> us<00:01:00.870> have

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
look like this and since most of us have

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.330 
look like this and since most of us have
created<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.620> maybe<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.280> first

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
created or maybe this is your first

created or maybe this is your first
quilt<00:01:03.180> project<00:01:03.300> that'd<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.750> great<00:01:03.989> way<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
quilt project that'd be great way to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.750 
quilt project that'd be great way to
start<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.519> would<00:01:05.700> simply<00:01:06.020> join<00:01:07.020> blocks<00:01:07.760> with

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
start you would simply join blocks with

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.460 
start you would simply join blocks with
a<00:01:08.790> quarter<00:01:09.150> inch<00:01:09.180> seam<00:01:10.909> like<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.570> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
a quarter inch seam like this and you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.740 
a quarter inch seam like this and you
would<00:01:13.650> stitch<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.310> quarter<00:01:14.670> inch<00:01:14.790> seam<00:01:15.240> here

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
would stitch a quarter inch seam here

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.530 
would stitch a quarter inch seam here
and<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.799> which<00:01:16.979> would<00:01:17.340> then<00:01:17.790> create<00:01:18.060> two

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and here which would then create two

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.969 
and here which would then create two
rows<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.729> you'll<00:01:20.729> join<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.270> rows<00:01:21.450> together

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
rows and you'll join the rows together

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.749 
rows and you'll join the rows together
to<00:01:22.979> come<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.909> four<00:01:24.570> patch<00:01:24.780> block<00:01:25.400> now<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
to come up with a four patch block now a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.210 
to come up with a four patch block now a
four<00:01:27.299> patch<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:28.229> easy<00:01:28.259> block<00:01:28.979> to

four patch is a really easy block to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.880 
four patch is a really easy block to
create<00:01:29.549> some<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.960> you'll<00:01:31.680> notice

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
have a block now that looks like this

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.250 
have a block now that looks like this
and<00:03:05.579> you<00:03:06.049> can<00:03:07.049> see<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.829> back<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.989> seam

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
and you can see on the back the seam

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.569 
and you can see on the back the seam
allowances<00:03:10.620> are<00:03:10.680> pressed<00:03:11.040> towards<00:03:11.400> the

allowances are pressed towards the

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.059 
allowances are pressed towards the
center<00:03:12.000> now<00:03:12.840> since<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.349> just<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.799> short

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
center now since this is just a short

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.330 
center now since this is just a short
expanse<00:03:14.700> you'll<00:03:15.450> want<00:03:15.719> to<00:03:15.840> make<00:03:16.049> sure<00:03:16.340> that

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
expanse you'll want to make sure that

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.879 
expanse you'll want to make sure that
your<00:03:17.790> seam<00:03:18.120> allowance<00:03:18.629> is<00:03:18.810> here<00:03:19.169> match<00:03:19.409> up<00:03:19.709> and

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
your seam allowance is here match up and

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.509 
your seam allowance is here match up and
jump<00:03:20.069> across<00:03:20.930> because<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.079> want<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.519> the

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
jump across because you want that the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.069 
jump across because you want that the
color<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:24.120> look<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.569> it's<00:03:24.780> just<00:03:24.840> been

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
color to look like it's just been

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.349 
color to look like it's just been
spliced<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.859> not<00:03:26.010> shifted<00:03:26.579> so<00:03:27.120> make<00:03:27.329> sure

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
spliced and not shifted so make sure

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.689 
spliced and not shifted so make sure
that<00:03:27.540> your<00:03:27.810> pieces<00:03:28.079> are<00:03:28.349> cut<00:03:28.500> accurately<00:03:28.709> they

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
that your pieces are cut accurately they

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.149 
that your pieces are cut accurately they
fit<00:03:29.970> into<00:03:30.180> end<00:03:30.449> and<00:03:30.689> then<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.109> this<00:03:31.349> lines<00:03:31.889> up

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
fit into end and then that this lines up

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.890 
fit into end and then that this lines up
it's<00:03:32.729> a<00:03:32.790> great<00:03:33.090> way<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.299> practice<00:03:33.870> that

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
it's a great way to practice that

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.879 
it's a great way to practice that
accurate<00:03:34.590> quarter<00:03:34.889> inch<00:03:35.040> seam<00:03:35.310> allowance

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
accurate quarter inch seam allowance

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.490 
accurate quarter inch seam allowance
okay<00:03:37.889> now<00:03:38.599> if<00:03:39.599> you<00:03:39.750> look<00:03:39.989> at<00:03:40.109> our<00:03:40.169> blocks

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
okay now if you look at our blocks

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.679 
okay now if you look at our blocks
there's<00:03:41.250> one<00:03:41.579> more<00:03:41.790> cut<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.150> have<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.540> make

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
there's one more cut you have to make

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.280 
there's one more cut you have to make
and<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.889> is<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.819> go<00:03:45.419> straight<00:03:45.810> down<00:03:45.989> along

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
and that is to go straight down along

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.509 
and that is to go straight down along
here<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.650> we're<00:03:46.769> going<00:03:46.859> to<00:03:46.919> rotate<00:03:47.099> that

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
here and we're going to rotate that

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.939 
here and we're going to rotate that
again<00:03:47.879> so<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.269> can<00:03:48.509> cut<00:03:49.199> in<00:03:49.379> a<00:03:49.470> safe<00:03:49.709> manner

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
again so that I can cut in a safe manner

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:55.039 
again so that I can cut in a safe manner
and<00:03:52.340> you're<00:03:53.340> going<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.609> make<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.819> five<00:03:54.359> inch<00:03:54.659> cut

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
and you're going to make a five inch cut

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.569 
and you're going to make a five inch cut
again<00:03:55.759> along<00:03:56.759> this<00:03:57.449> side<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.169> block<00:03:58.579> now

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
again along this side of the block now

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.830 
again along this side of the block now
once<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.879> get<00:04:00.000> really<00:04:00.239> good<00:04:00.389> at<00:04:00.449> these<00:04:00.720> you

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
once you get really good at these you

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.199 
once you get really good at these you
might<00:04:01.049> go<00:04:01.530> through<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:01.889> make<00:04:02.040> four<00:04:03.000> or<00:04:03.060> five

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
might go through and make four or five

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.749 
might go through and make four or five
blocks<00:04:03.479> and<00:04:03.750> stack<00:04:04.199> them<00:04:04.379> up<00:04:04.530> but<00:04:05.370> depends<00:04:05.729> on

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:05.759 
blocks and stack them up but depends on

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.390 
blocks and stack them up but depends on
how<00:04:05.909> comfortable<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:06.689> are<00:04:06.720> cutting<00:04:07.349> through

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
how comfortable you are cutting through

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.569 
how comfortable you are cutting through
because<00:04:08.400> sometimes<00:04:08.430> when<00:04:09.030> we<00:04:09.120> cut<00:04:10.579> multiple

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
because sometimes when we cut multiple

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.699 
because sometimes when we cut multiple
blocks<00:04:11.759> we<00:04:11.909> can<00:04:12.030> make<00:04:12.209> multiple<00:04:12.709> multiple

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
blocks we can make multiple multiple

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.080 
blocks we can make multiple multiple
mistakes<00:04:13.919> or<00:04:14.340> really<00:04:14.549> quickly<00:04:14.909> but<00:04:16.250> just<00:04:17.250> keep

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
mistakes or really quickly but just keep

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.819 
mistakes or really quickly but just keep
our<00:04:18.269> wits<00:04:18.359> about<00:04:18.539> us<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:19.049> five<00:04:19.289> inch<00:04:19.530> mark

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
our wits about us the five inch mark

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.029 
our wits about us the five inch mark
we've<00:04:20.459> spliced<00:04:21.060> here<00:04:21.449> we're<00:04:21.959> going<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.349> insert

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
we've spliced here we're going to insert

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.200 
we've spliced here we're going to insert
the<00:04:23.099> next<00:04:23.490> white<00:04:24.000> strip

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
the next white strip

it's always good for us to go back and
just<00:05:52.310> double-check<00:05:52.940> our<00:05:53.090> accuracy<00:05:53.540> as<00:05:53.780> we<00:05:53.900> go

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
just double-check our accuracy as we go

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.420

along<00:05:54.640> some<00:05:55.640> of<00:05:55.760> our<00:05:55.850> patterns<00:05:57.130> accuracy<00:05:58.130> is

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
along some of our patterns accuracy is

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.270 
along some of our patterns accuracy is
you<00:05:59.060> know<00:05:59.120> close<00:05:59.720> counts<00:06:00.230> but<00:06:00.860> when<00:06:01.130> we're

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
you know close counts but when we're

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.520 
you know close counts but when we're
working<00:06:01.760> with<00:06:01.880> a<00:06:01.910> lot<00:06:02.150> of<00:06:02.260> really<00:06:03.260> strong

just quickly use a finger press and get
it<00:06:22.610> to<00:06:22.700> lay<00:06:22.820> flat<00:06:23.060> now<00:06:23.540> the<00:06:24.050> idea<00:06:24.350> is<00:06:24.440> that<00:06:24.710> I

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
it to lay flat now the idea is that I

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.370 
it to lay flat now the idea is that I
want<00:06:24.980> this<00:06:25.250> line<00:06:25.550> to<00:06:25.580> be<00:06:26.240> perfectly<00:06:26.690> lined<00:06:27.110> up

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
want this line to be perfectly lined up

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.580 
want this line to be perfectly lined up
so<00:06:27.860> it<00:06:27.980> looks<00:06:28.160> continuous<00:06:28.940> through<00:06:29.240> so<00:06:30.230> when<00:06:30.560> I

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
so it looks continuous through so when I

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.410 
so it looks continuous through so when I
lay<00:06:30.980> this<00:06:31.250> on<00:06:31.460> top<00:06:32.770> you'll<00:06:33.770> notice<00:06:34.420> that

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.420 
lay this on top you'll notice that

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.970 
lay this on top you'll notice that
there's<00:06:35.690> a<00:06:35.750> little<00:06:35.930> way<00:06:36.200> for<00:06:36.470> you<00:06:36.590> to<00:06:36.740> keep

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
there's a little way for you to keep

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.190 
there's a little way for you to keep
that<00:06:37.040> accurate<00:06:37.730> you<00:06:38.240> notice<00:06:38.570> that<00:06:38.720> these<00:06:38.900> seam

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
that accurate you notice that these seam

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.100 
that accurate you notice that these seam
allowances<00:06:39.800> lay<00:06:40.490> right<00:06:40.790> on<00:06:40.820> top<00:06:41.360> like<00:06:42.020> a

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
allowances lay right on top like a

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.940 
allowances lay right on top like a
channel<00:06:43.120> across<00:06:44.120> the<00:06:44.390> block<00:06:44.600> so<00:06:45.380> if<00:06:45.560> those<00:06:45.740> are

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
channel across the block so if those are

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.830 
channel across the block so if those are
matched<00:06:46.250> up<00:06:46.520> there<00:06:46.910> then<00:06:47.480> they're<00:06:47.660> going<00:06:47.780> to

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
matched up there then they're going to

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.480 
matched up there then they're going to
be<00:06:47.960> contingent<00:06:48.440> you<00:06:48.500> feel<00:06:48.919> that<00:06:49.190> with<00:06:49.370> your

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
be contingent you feel that with your

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.940 
be contingent you feel that with your
fingernail<00:06:49.910> all<00:06:50.510> the<00:06:50.690> way<00:06:50.780> across<00:06:50.930> put<00:06:51.830> two

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
fingernail all the way across put two

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.700 
fingernail all the way across put two
pins<00:06:52.160> in<00:06:52.370> there<00:06:52.580> hold<00:06:53.240> it<00:06:53.330> in<00:06:53.450> place

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
pins in there hold it in place

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.130 
pins in there hold it in place
seam<00:06:54.710> and<00:06:54.950> when<00:06:55.100> you<00:06:55.160> open<00:06:55.520> up<00:06:55.780> you're<00:06:56.780> going

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
seam and when you open up you're going

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.980 
seam and when you open up you're going
to<00:06:57.320> have<00:06:57.500> a<00:06:57.800> perfect<00:06:58.790> intersection<00:07:00.700> of<00:07:01.990> these

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
to have a perfect intersection of these

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.840 
to have a perfect intersection of these
lines<00:07:03.320> that<00:07:03.650> will<00:07:04.070> weave<00:07:04.280> all<00:07:04.610> the<00:07:04.730> way

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
lines that will weave all the way

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.260 
lines that will weave all the way
through<00:07:05.030> your<00:07:05.150> quilt<00:07:06.040> now<00:07:07.040> you<00:07:08.030> go<00:07:08.240> through

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
through your quilt now you go through

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.800 
through your quilt now you go through
and<00:07:08.690> make<00:07:08.900> 20<00:07:09.680> blocks<00:07:09.980> like<00:07:10.400> this<00:07:10.669> to<00:07:11.540> complete

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
and make 20 blocks like this to complete

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.350 
and make 20 blocks like this to complete
the<00:07:11.990> quilt<00:07:12.230> it's<00:07:12.710> four<00:07:13.040> crossed<00:07:13.430> and<00:07:13.790> five

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
the quilt it's four crossed and five

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.110 
the quilt it's four crossed and five
down<00:07:14.680> now<00:07:15.680> and<00:07:16.070> you<00:07:16.340> look<00:07:16.550> at<00:07:16.730> it<00:07:16.910> you'll

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
down now and you look at it you'll

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.930 
down now and you look at it you'll
notice<00:07:17.360> that<00:07:17.720> not<00:07:17.870> all<00:07:17.930> the<00:07:18.350> blocks<00:07:18.940> this

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
notice that not all the blocks this

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.810 
notice that not all the blocks this
would<00:07:20.150> be<00:07:20.300> the<00:07:20.540> top<00:07:20.930> of<00:07:21.250> the<00:07:22.250> block<00:07:22.490> that<00:07:22.730> you

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:22.820 
would be the top of the block that you

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.720 
would be the top of the block that you
would<00:07:23.000> create<00:07:23.800> but<00:07:24.800> not<00:07:24.950> all<00:07:25.100> the<00:07:25.310> lines<00:07:25.520> are

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:25.730 
would create but not all the lines are

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.110 
would create but not all the lines are
in<00:07:25.820> the<00:07:25.850> top<00:07:26.860> left-hand<00:07:27.860> corner<00:07:28.120> sometimes

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 
in the top left-hand corner sometimes

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.270 
in the top left-hand corner sometimes
they're<00:07:29.480> rotated<00:07:30.050> to<00:07:30.380> create<00:07:30.650> this<00:07:30.770> overall

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 
they're rotated to create this overall

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.550 
they're rotated to create this overall
effect<00:07:31.730> and<00:07:32.060> so<00:07:32.600> you're<00:07:32.750> going<00:07:32.930> to<00:07:33.020> want<00:07:33.380> to

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 
effect and so you're going to want to

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.920 
effect and so you're going to want to
make<00:07:34.430> sure<00:07:34.490> that<00:07:35.000> when<00:07:35.180> you<00:07:35.330> get<00:07:35.480> done<00:07:35.660> laying

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
make sure that when you get done laying

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.150 
make sure that when you get done laying
out<00:07:36.110> your<00:07:36.230> quilt<00:07:36.410> before<00:07:36.680> you<00:07:36.770> put<00:07:36.919> the<00:07:37.010> rows

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.160 
out your quilt before you put the rows

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.550 
out your quilt before you put the rows
together<00:07:37.400> and<00:07:37.850> join<00:07:38.600> rows<00:07:38.840> that<00:07:39.290> you<00:07:39.350> have

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 
together and join rows that you have

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.210 
together and join rows that you have
them<00:07:39.770> all<00:07:40.190> intersecting<00:07:41.120> properly<00:07:42.100> if<00:07:43.100> you

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.220 
them all intersecting properly if you

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.450 
them all intersecting properly if you
would<00:07:43.460> like<00:07:43.610> more<00:07:43.940> on<00:07:44.210> the<00:07:45.310> technique<00:07:46.310> of

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460 
would like more on the technique of
