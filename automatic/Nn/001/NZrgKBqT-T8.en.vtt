00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.370 
positioning techniques that can accent
that<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.490> make<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.670> even<00:00:23.850> more<00:00:24.090> effective<00:00:24.380> so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
a little bit just a little bit of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.250 
a little bit just a little bit of
pressure<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.510> will<00:00:51.780> help<00:00:51.960> stabilize

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
pressure there it will help stabilize

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
pressure there it will help stabilize
your<00:00:52.649> bike<00:00:52.800> keep<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.340> upright<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.149> much

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
your bike keep you upright and it's much

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.720 
your bike keep you upright and it's much
easier<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.780> control<00:00:55.140> now<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> things

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
easier to control now one of the things

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.160 
easier to control now one of the things
to<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:56.879> careful<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.600> obviously<00:00:57.989> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
to be careful with on this obviously is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.930 
to be careful with on this obviously is
not<00:00:58.289> applying<00:00:58.559> too<00:00:58.859> much<00:00:58.890> pressure<00:00:59.070> that's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
not applying too much pressure that's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.340 
not applying too much pressure that's
going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> cause<00:01:00.359> your<00:01:00.539> rear<00:01:00.719> tire<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> skid

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
going to cause your rear tire to skid

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.290 
going to cause your rear tire to skid
lockup<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.129> then<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.760> some<00:01:02.940> problems

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
lockup and then you have some problems

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.609 
lockup and then you have some problems
with<00:01:03.390> your<00:01:03.420> handling<00:01:03.780> obviously<00:01:04.229> throws<00:01:04.500> you

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
with your handling obviously throws you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.380 
with your handling obviously throws you
off<00:01:04.799> another<00:01:05.460> thing<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> keep<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.060> mind<00:01:06.119> when

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
off another thing to keep in mind when

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.149 
off another thing to keep in mind when
you're<00:01:06.510> doing<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.799> where<00:01:07.979> we're

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you're doing this is this is where we're

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.100 
you're doing this is this is where we're
using<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.880> rear<00:01:09.180> brake<00:01:09.450> we're<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.840> really

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
using the rear brake we're not really

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.840 
using the rear brake we're not really
using<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> front<00:01:10.799> brake<00:01:10.979> especially<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
using the front brake especially in a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.850 
using the front brake especially in a
sharp<00:01:12.150> jabbing<00:01:12.510> motion<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.380> last<00:01:13.590> thing<00:01:13.770> we

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
sharp jabbing motion the last thing we

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.649 
sharp jabbing motion the last thing we
want<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> bike<00:01:14.939> unsettled

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and starting to dive so really be

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.370 
and starting to dive so really be
careful<00:01:17.759> with<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.780> use<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.140> rear

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
careful with that and just use that rear

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.039 
careful with that and just use that rear
brake<00:01:19.650> predominantly<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:21.060> you're<00:01:21.900> doing

this you can either do this as you're

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.700 
this you can either do this as you're
coming<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> stop<00:01:24.689> sign<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.960> example<00:01:25.320> if

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
coming up to a stop sign for example if

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.929 
coming up to a stop sign for example if
you<00:01:25.799> don't<00:01:25.950> want<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.130> put<00:01:26.250> your<00:01:26.369> foot<00:01:26.549> down<00:01:26.700> or

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you don't want to put your foot down or

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.640 
you don't want to put your foot down or
if<00:01:27.540> you're<00:01:27.780> cruising<00:01:28.080> through<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> parking<00:01:28.590> lot

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
if you're cruising through a parking lot

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.899 
if you're cruising through a parking lot
like<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.369> need<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> make<00:01:29.729> these

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
like this and you need to make these

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.780 
like this and you need to make these
slow<00:01:30.210> maneuvers<00:01:30.750> throughout<00:01:31.350> traffic<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
slow maneuvers throughout traffic the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.560 
slow maneuvers throughout traffic the
other<00:01:32.909> thing<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.150> we're<00:01:33.299> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> talk

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
other thing that we're going to talk

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
other thing that we're going to talk
about<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.110> body<00:01:34.380> positioning<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.280> brake

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
about is your body positioning the brake

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
about is your body positioning the brake
technique<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.060> fantastic<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.930> use<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
technique is fantastic I use it all the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
technique is fantastic I use it all the
time<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> off-road<00:01:38.159> world<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.970> same

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
time in the off-road world and the same

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.210 
time in the off-road world and the same
thing<00:01:39.390> goes<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.229> body<00:01:40.470> positioning<00:01:41.070> in

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
thing goes for the body positioning in

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.620 
thing goes for the body positioning in
the<00:01:41.850> sense<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.240> you're<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the sense that you're going to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.600 
the sense that you're going to
counterbalance<00:01:43.049> your<00:01:43.500> motorcycle<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.310> we

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
counterbalance your motorcycle if we

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.460 
counterbalance your motorcycle if we
stay<00:01:44.820> upright<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.329> our<00:01:45.479> bike<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.170> lean

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
stay upright on our bike and we lean

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.319 
stay upright on our bike and we lean
with<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.100> normally<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.790> speed<00:01:48.180> when

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
with it as we normally do at speed when

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.179 
with it as we normally do at speed when
we<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.570> momentum<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.740> we're<00:01:50.070> actually

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
we have momentum then we're actually

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.469 
we have momentum then we're actually
going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.640> problems<00:01:51.000> at<00:01:51.119> those<00:01:51.270> lower

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
going to have problems at those lower

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.969 
going to have problems at those lower
speeds<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> bike<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.290> obviously<00:01:52.649> wants<00:01:52.950> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
speeds the bike just obviously wants to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.249 
speeds the bike just obviously wants to
tip<00:01:53.250> over<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:55.020> take<00:01:55.200> our

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
tip over so what we do is we take our

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.780 
tip over so what we do is we take our
body<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:55.920> offset<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.579> from<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
body and we offset it from the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.459 
body and we offset it from the
motorcycle<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.509> counterbalance<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
motorcycle we counterbalance it and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.719 
motorcycle we counterbalance it and
while<00:01:58.829> you're<00:01:58.979> doing<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.340> you're<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.549> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
while you're doing this you're going to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.670 
while you're doing this you're going to
find<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.210> your<00:02:00.479> weight<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.229> positioned<00:02:01.649> on

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
find that your weight is positioned on

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.440 
find that your weight is positioned on
the<00:02:01.740> outside<00:02:02.219> edge<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> seat<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.090> you're

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the outside edge of the seat and you're

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.730 
the outside edge of the seat and you're
also<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.020> putting<00:02:04.320> pressure<00:02:04.590> down

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
also going to be putting pressure down

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.350 
also going to be putting pressure down
on<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.070> outside<00:02:05.520> foot<00:02:05.850> pegs<00:02:06.090> called

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
on the outside foot pegs called

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.270 
on the outside foot pegs called
weighting<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> outside<00:02:07.110> peg<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.099> you're

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
weighting the outside peg so as you're

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.589 
weighting the outside peg so as you're
doing<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.670> technique<00:02:09.119> what<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.420> really

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
doing this technique what you really

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.119 
doing this technique what you really
want<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:09.989> cognizant<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.830> paying

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
want to be cognizant of and be paying

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.650 
want to be cognizant of and be paying
attention<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.180> you're<00:02:12.330> looking

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
attention to is that you're looking

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
attention to is that you're looking
where<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.900> want<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.290> go

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
where you want to go

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.280 
where you want to go
slow<00:02:14.370> speeds<00:02:14.760> tight<00:02:15.329> maneuvers<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.900> very<00:02:16.110> easy

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
slow speeds tight maneuvers is very easy

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.839 
slow speeds tight maneuvers is very easy
to<00:02:16.349> get<00:02:16.530> tunnel<00:02:16.799> vision<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.189> start<00:02:17.579> looking

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
to get tunnel vision and start looking

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.520 
to get tunnel vision and start looking
straight<00:02:18.060> down<00:02:18.090> on<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.420> front<00:02:18.659> wheel<00:02:18.810> keep<00:02:19.379> in

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
straight down on a front wheel keep in

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.380 
straight down on a front wheel keep in
mind<00:02:19.739> your<00:02:20.129> body<00:02:20.400> your<00:02:20.579> bike<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.150> going<00:02:21.299> to

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
mind your body your bike is going to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.759 
mind your body your bike is going to
follow<00:02:21.569> your<00:02:21.870> head<00:02:21.989> so<00:02:22.200> look<00:02:22.349> where<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.620> want

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
follow your head so look where you want

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:23.839 
follow your head so look where you want
to<00:02:22.860> go<00:02:22.980> while<00:02:23.189> you're<00:02:23.280> doing<00:02:23.730> these

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
to go while you're doing these

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.520 
to go while you're doing these
techniques<00:02:24.030> as<00:02:24.360> well<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.840> it'll<00:02:25.230> help<00:02:25.349> make

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
techniques as well and it'll help make

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.110 
techniques as well and it'll help make
sure<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.129> smooth<00:02:26.370> exit<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.970> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
sure that you have a smooth exit of the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.300 
sure that you have a smooth exit of the
turn<00:02:27.329> put<00:02:27.989> all<00:02:28.110> these<00:02:28.260> things<00:02:28.560> together<00:02:28.739> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
turn put all these things together the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.559 
turn put all these things together the
counter<00:02:29.640> balancing<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.180> brake

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
counter balancing and the brake

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.729 
counter balancing and the brake
technique<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.109> now<00:02:31.379> you're<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> be

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
technique and now you're going to be

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.199 
technique and now you're going to be
much<00:02:32.040> more<00:02:32.280> comfortable<00:02:32.700> at<00:02:32.849> slower<00:02:33.090> speeds

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
much more comfortable at slower speeds

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.059 
much more comfortable at slower speeds
you'll<00:02:33.900> look<00:02:34.079> like<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.319> stud<00:02:34.650> because<00:02:34.829> you

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
you'll look like a stud because you

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.050 
you'll look like a stud because you
don't<00:02:35.220> ever<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.579> put<00:02:35.730> your<00:02:35.849> feet<00:02:36.030> down

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
don't ever have to put your feet down

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.059 
don't ever have to put your feet down
out<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.480> traffic<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.260> that's<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.530> handy<00:02:37.799> tip<00:02:37.920> to

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
out in traffic and that's a handy tip to
