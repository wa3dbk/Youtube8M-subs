would build a house but with big tall
60-foot<00:01:42.390> sidewalls<00:01:43.490> 2x8<00:01:44.490> walls<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> lot

60-foot sidewalls 2x8 walls with a lot

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.149 
60-foot sidewalls 2x8 walls with a lot
of<00:01:45.509> insulation<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.320> I'm<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> get<00:01:46.799> our<00:01:46.950> 9

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
of insulation and I'm so you get our 9

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.090 
of insulation and I'm so you get our 9
our<00:01:47.579> 19<00:01:48.119> insulation<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.229> drywalled<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
our 19 insulation then drywalled and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.440 
our 19 insulation then drywalled and
then<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:52.220> CDX<00:01:53.220> plywood<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.820> all<00:01:53.970> shield<00:01:54.270> over

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
then the CDX plywood is all shield over

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.810 
then the CDX plywood is all shield over
the<00:01:54.570> outside<00:01:54.930> that's<00:01:55.200> more<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.070> look<00:01:56.549> but

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the outside that's more for a look but

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.550 
the outside that's more for a look but
it<00:01:56.969> also<00:01:57.450> helps<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.170> insulation<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.189> well<00:01:59.369> so

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
it also helps with insulation as well so

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.130 
it also helps with insulation as well so
anyway<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:01.950> it
