that

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.560 
that
yeah<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.890> infield<00:01:00.250> meant<00:01:00.460> obviously<00:01:01.120> I<00:01:01.180> put<00:01:01.390> I

holes<00:01:03.789> in<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.030> glove<00:01:04.239> there<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:04.689> a<00:01:05.379> little

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
holes in the glove there and a little

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.320 
holes in the glove there and a little

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
bit shallower of a pocket obviously it's

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.750 
bit shallower of a pocket obviously it's
a<00:01:07.390> shorter<00:01:07.750> glove<00:01:08.049> this<00:01:08.320> is<00:01:08.409> an<00:01:08.500> 11<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:08.979> 3/4<00:01:09.490> so
