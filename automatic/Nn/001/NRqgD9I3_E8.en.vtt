00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 in the previous video we saw how to calculate 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.080
 the time it takes to take off this 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.889
 plane to 380 taking as data the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.120
 takeoff speed and acceleration 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.910
 now in what I did what I wanted 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.480
 I know how long the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.039
 track so that this plane can take off 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.779
 what is a very important question if 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.850
 you want to build a track that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.660
 allow at least this kind of 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.660
 380 aircraft can take off what will be 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.660
 the minimum length for this good track 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.660
 we know that the displacement 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.700
 is the multiplication or good is going to be the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.879
 result of multiplying the speed 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.680
 for the time but in this case our 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.230
 speed is not constant our 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.019
 speed is changing this during the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.550
 time then we could not use this 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:59.350
 data directly however we 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:02.190
 we have this acceleration but this 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.520
 acceleration has the peculiarity of 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.649
 which is constant 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.149
 and when we have an acceleration 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:15.130
 constant if and only if we have 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.500
 constant acceleration then we can 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.759
 find or calculate something called 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.759
 average speed 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.899
 then how do we calculate the speed 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.259
 average our average speed that 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:36.600
 is still a vector is going to be equal to 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:39.380
 the average of my final speed 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.380
 less 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.740
 my initial speed and good as they are 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.930
 two elements or two quantities because the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.570
 average of these two is going to be divided 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.760
 are you going to split this operation this 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.800
 result between two then my 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.470
 average speed 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.410
 I have to good the final speed of the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.460
 we found around here at 78 meters by 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.200
 second 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.289
 78 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.230
 meters per second 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.930
 - my initial speed good, we start 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.870
 from the understanding that is that they are from 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.590
 zero since it's stopped then 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.670
 minus zero between two so my 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:30.190
 average speed of 78 between 2 results 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:33.190
 be 39 meters per second 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.770
 so now with this data of the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.310
 average speed 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.880
 I can multiply it 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.880
 with 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.300
 the change in time and so then 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.850
 I can calculate the displacement 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.940
 if we want to see this or understand it from 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.930
 another way we're going to see a way a 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.510
 little more graphic let's graph here 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.459
 the speed with respect to time this 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:09.700
 is my axis must of time forgiveness this 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.340
 is my speed axis and if I have a 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.319
 constant acceleration this I'm going to have 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.269
 this graphic more or less 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.650
 in this way it's going to be an acceleration 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.560
 constant so it's going to increase 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.049
 so more or less in this angle this is 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.220
 a straight line although my pulse is not what 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:32.120
 better this morning then if I have 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:36.980
 that this start from scratch and here my 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.880
 takeoff time is 78 seconds in 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.430
 this point is when my plane has the 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.860
 enough speed to take off and 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.330
 let's see what also since 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.890
 and the speed 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.320
 if I start from scratch and reached my 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.110
 takeoff speed is 78 meters 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.210
 per second 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.770
 well here you will also reach in this 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.630
 point and from here on, they had 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:10.000
 already des takes off the ground 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:12.760
 if I will calculate the area under this curve 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.650
 if I will calculate this area it will result 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.320
 that this area will be equal to the 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.930
 distance that needs to be traveled to 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.410
 that this plane can take off 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.289
 in another video we will see what is the 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.530
 why of this graph at least give them 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:32.710
 a slightly more general idea East 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:37.120
 good because the area under the curve of the 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:40.129
 acceleration this is acceleration 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.110
 it will be equal to the distance 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.449
 when I'm working with the 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.069
 average speed that we remember good 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.259
 we calculate the average speed is the 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.999
 half or the middle point between me 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:53.080
 initial speed and my final speed 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:56.169
 which is more or less here 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.250
 if I use this average speed this 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:03.759
 data until this time is necessary to 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.000
 takeoff if I calculate the area under 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.670
 this curve 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.610
 or under this speed line 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.740
 average will be exactly the same 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.770
 the same area as the one that is 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.510
 with this acceleration from a speed 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.460
 that is changing from zero to the 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.170
 final speed and that's why good 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.970
 this average speed helps me 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.400
 calculate the displacement or the 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.080
 distance now returning the numbers 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.169
 we have to then what 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.590
 I have my scroll that is equal to my 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:38.830
 the average speed calculated just 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:44.759
 39 meters on second the 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.759
 displacement in time he calculated it to 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.699
 78 seconds and I take out my calculator I do 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.699
 my operations 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:08.880
 39 x 78 and this gives me equal to 3 thousand 42 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:14.430
 here I write then my displacement 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.000
 is equal to 3 thousand 42 here these seconds 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.120
 they go 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.280
 I have meters left so the distance 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.390
 so that it is good can take off the 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:29.970
 track must measure more than 3000 meters 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:32.630
 which is more than 3 kilometers for this 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.630
 plane can 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.310
 balls so you can take off what 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.310
 I find really fascinating
