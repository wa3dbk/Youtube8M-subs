00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.440
 hello people today I have here 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.230
 such an interesting package is similar to what 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.660
 then to bat but to beat and is not it 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.640
 did not finally come softboxes 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.630
 let's open and see 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.710
 and test what we have so open 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.030
 very neatly in order not to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.070
 mow up to 600 box 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:36.610
 and then God forbid we will cut it tear 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:43.170
 everything will be very sad option for scotch 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:47.890
 and tied up well he literally got 2 not 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.050
 open before me in 25 days on 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.829
 the last stage he got lost somewhere in 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:01:00.540
 Orenburg 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:01:07.530
 I was very much taken to heart 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.530
 that we are a century for harm 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.159
 2004 I burst 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:47.020
 yes and a bet on the glued second 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:50.119
 package two packages wife packing you 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.340
 unpacking until no killing began 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.869
 hope I hope not just never flew 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.869
 the code did not bite 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.110
 the color of this channel is generally sick for me 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:08.770
 The topic now seems to be reading 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.770
 better but i want to bring this matter to 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.430
 wonderful exactly 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.430
 steve so this 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:38.750
 Here is such a wonderful case 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.750
 people scar tiles on protection here such 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:52.310
 open our box here what is it here 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.910
 most likely yes it goes with us 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:05.780
 the scatterer you wear it 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:07.860
 on the box here is our mount here with us 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.220
 on / off button 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.890
 the only thing we have is a fork 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.280
 But I have adapters in this problem 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.370
 not be large if it is absolutely up 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.620
 dopilivat can be cut and done 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:30.260
 our European outlet that always and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.260
 everywhere it could have been like a softbox 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.130
 looks disassembled i am now 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.760
 a bit later and show a single video 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.030
 Now I will show what I bought 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.639
 adapters 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.280
 some time ago I bought such here 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:47.120
 adapters too with china and let's 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.120
 show for what 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.139
 tex 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.889
 here they are with us here is an adapter 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:05.730
 this case is inserted with us 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:09.470
 and fears cooler winding here 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.470
 that's all 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:21.470
 with an emphasis that it went and let's 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.840
 on steeper well, that's something like this 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.479
 everything should be fixed now 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.650
 can be screwed here but for good 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:33.770
 here we are if you see we have not reached 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:38.360
 the end you need to press harder 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.370
 so that our mount spun here 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.650
 here it is here on this side they 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:51.370
 here in this god why does not me go 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:54.139
 there is a little bit narrower seat 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.370
 he is literally a bit of a principle 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:04.330
 bang i think it's time with a gavel and she 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.330
 will pass so here's an adapter and 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:14.330
 here is our big softbox 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.639
 put it on a tripod done 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.120
 normal fixing something u spun 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:24.289
 so here you see all the court with a tripod 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.159
 even though he doesnâ€™t film anything 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.550
 falls down 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:33.349
 and I keep holding here too 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.110
 hold out well and all we have as they say 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.960
 everything is fine with us straight to granite but 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.650
 the light should be normal 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:46.930
 dachshu deploy like this 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.080
 looks from the inside this ring 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.500
 tensioner 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.509
 when it is inserted there and the softbox 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.389
 our lay out lay out inform 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.389
 Hurray perfectly straight with respect to inclusion 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:07.719
 this is how the light shines enough 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.459
 smooth my softbox that collected 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:13.929
 wednesday was a bunch and this is enough beach 

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:18.080
 you can still hurt our lens 

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:21.439
 here we have our scattered dress 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.770
 easy enough and just out of 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:28.819
 This thing is bent and here you can 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:33.800
 put it on the sticks and so were now 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:37.699
 colors well here and so evenly almost 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:40.029
 but everything dissipates such a softbox 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:44.499
 buy see the link below below the video 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:44.499
 I am very more than satisfied
