00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
would end up a little bit on the dry

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.390 
would end up a little bit on the dry
side<00:02:34.780> because<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.530> did<00:02:35.769> have<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.190> use<00:02:36.220> a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
side because I did have to use a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.559 
side because I did have to use a
clarifying<00:02:36.790> shampoo<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.989> my<00:02:38.620> hair<00:02:38.860> prior<00:02:39.220> to

installing the treatment and I just felt

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.030 
installing the treatment and I just felt
that<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.269> clarifying<00:02:43.780> shampoo<00:02:44.440> had<00:02:44.650> my<00:02:44.830> hair

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
that the clarifying shampoo had my hair

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.250 
that the clarifying shampoo had my hair
extremely<00:02:45.459> drop<00:02:45.910> dry<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.660> put<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> deep
