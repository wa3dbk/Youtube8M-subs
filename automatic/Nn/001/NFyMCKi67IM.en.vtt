00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.670
 Hello everyone and welcome again to 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:11.120
 blog agronomÃ­a because to give class 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.860
 this is the so-called pizza trap 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.100
 consists of a glass that is filled with 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.430
 Water 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.340
 and it serves to capture the insects that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.730
 they are on the ground and it's jobs 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.930
 this trap is used 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.750
 basically for the study of 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:34.190
 biodiversity or studies on what types 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.640
 of insects may have 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.940
 to a certain place 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.290
 now for the specific case of this 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:49.059
 photo is for a study of biodiversity 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.360
 in different productive sites of the 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.530
 agronomy 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.800
 in organic vineyards versus vineyards 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.820
 conventional 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:06.369
 the application that has this trap in 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:09.940
 the in the world of gastronomy itself and 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:13.630
 does not have a 100% practical application is 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.880
 say that the companies hands but if 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.940
 could be used for some study in the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.759
 if there is a pest that you have 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.090
 notion that comes from the ground and up 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.090
 than to the plants in which 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.140
 necessary to use this type of traps to 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.930
 be able to detect them and do 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.110
 not only a monitoring but a 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.360
 effective control 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.780
 it could also end up being used as 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.510
 control in organic ports but 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.510
 you have to do there is a hand balance of 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.270
 work life 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.200
 economic damage of the insect the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.620
 construction of this trap is very 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.060
 simple is a step that can be of a 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.110
 liter to 800 ml which in which 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.900
 filled with water 3 water has to have 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:11.710
 detergent to break the tension 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:15.190
 superficial and well the insects and second 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.990
 salt to prevent the advance of the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.690
 decomposition since in bacteria 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.190
 in salty medium they do not grow so 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.340
 efficiently 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.610
 and so it is possible to keep the insects 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.880
 since these types of traps are left 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.240
 many days 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.620
 then a quantity of water is poured 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:42.290
 with this type of detergent mixture and 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.290
 of that the amount will depend 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.299
 of the time it is going to leave and that's what 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.799
 will be directly related to 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:54.010
 the objectives of the trial and second is going to 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.800
 depend on the characteristics 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.930
 climatic 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.960
 of the place is to say if there is a greater 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.390
 temperature is going to have a higher 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.780
 water evaporation and what you have to 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:12.220
 avoid is that this evaporation exists 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.800
 because when evaporating all the liquid that 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.780
 they give the insects stuck and it is impossible 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.170
 not only recognize more in the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.100
 laboratory but it extracts the sample 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.100
 efficiently 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.160
 as I said the amount of time that 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.480
 it is left to depend on the trial once 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:36.770
 placed the water 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:40.070
 cover with a roof that can be seen here 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.670
 and good depending on the clinic as 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.550
 had pointed out it's going to be the time of the 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.090
 of the museum at the moment it goes to 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.180
 gather 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.530
 and we are going to have 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.950
 three situations generates 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.069
 the first is that it goes in insects and 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.850
 there is a lot of water the second 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.330
 is that there are many insects and 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.630
 the third mushroom that there are insects and 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.580
 there is no water then for example in this 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.920
 In particular, what is done is 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.010
 add water 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.739
 that they take off is an insect and so 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.230
 be able to extract the samples on the way 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.010
 once the insects stop 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:30.580
 dissolved in the water it proceeds to empty 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.440
 a strainer getting what you see 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.810
 here 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.330
 once this happened 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.110
 place the dead in a bag and 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.569
 mark for further analysis in the 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.119
 laboratory 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.659
 after it has been done in extreme 

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:52.149
 fill again with water depending 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:53.580
 as I said about the amount of day that 

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:58.199
 is going to leave 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:01.560
 in the trap and in the conditions 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:04.000
 climatic and closes again 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.940
 again 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.820
 in the next video that we're going to see 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.910
 then all those 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.800
 processes but 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.470
 in the particular case of the video when 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.440
 We were dismantling the trial 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.120
 it was not done in the last process that is 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.540
 fill again with water 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.540
 but the most important part as 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.050
 long ago you can see it without 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.050
 no prize 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.480
 sometimes he takes out the roof 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.300
 in this case it has the beginning not so 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:52.240
 so much is expected 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.240
 that were made liquid with the colander 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.230
 sometimes you have to throw in hamas 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.820
 of water for 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.820
 close the whole world 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.510
 and there he is going 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.940
 that the trap should be refilled 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.630
 with that same white liquid with what 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:23.710
 will continue 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:28.380
 closing with the cover of the frame 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.380
 and that we see in the next video
