00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
all my water cooling parts in and have

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.350 
all my water cooling parts in and have
time<00:00:28.880> to<00:00:29.119> do<00:00:29.360> it<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.020> now<00:00:30.350> that<00:00:30.740> time<00:00:31.400> has<00:00:31.699> come

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
time to do it so now that time has come

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.619 
time to do it so now that time has come
so<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:32.989> case<00:00:33.170> is<00:00:33.230> a<00:00:33.410> fractal<00:00:33.949> design<00:00:34.129> node<00:00:34.699> 804

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
so the case is a fractal design node 804

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.549 
so the case is a fractal design node 804
case<00:00:35.929> it<00:00:36.230> is<00:00:36.800> a<00:00:36.829> great<00:00:37.370> micro<00:00:38.089> ATX<00:00:38.329> case<00:00:38.870> inside

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:48.609 
sure to check them out now when I first
built<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.450> computer<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:47.990> had<00:01:48.170> every<00:01:48.590> intention

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
built the computer I had every intention

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.429 
built the computer I had every intention
on<00:01:49.399> it<00:01:49.700> being<00:01:49.969> a<00:01:50.119> water-cooled<00:01:50.659> build<00:01:50.960> the

on it being a water-cooled build the

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.560 
on it being a water-cooled build the
only<00:01:51.799> reason<00:01:52.189> why<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.369> wasn't<00:01:52.789> a<00:01:53.090> water<00:01:53.299> code

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
only reason why it wasn't a water code

only reason why it wasn't a water code
build<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.049> turned<00:01:54.560> into<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.890> air<00:01:55.100> code<00:01:55.369> build

a<00:02:34.270> little<00:02:34.360> bit<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.810> challenge<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.290> know<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.560> can

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
a little bit of a challenge I know I can

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.979 
a little bit of a challenge I know I can
do<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:35.950> though<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.520> i<00:02:37.270> will<00:02:37.480> be<00:02:37.510> doing<00:02:37.720> some

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.190 
scratched up i'm in it's ridiculous so
i'm<00:02:45.430> going<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.730> be<00:02:45.849> cutting<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:46.569> off<00:02:46.959> and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
i'm going to be cutting this off and

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.890 
i'm going to be cutting this off and
then<00:02:47.350> replacing<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.400> with<00:02:48.459> cass<00:02:49.030> clear

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
then replacing this with cass clear

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.780 
then replacing this with cass clear
acrylic<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.739> i'm<00:02:51.130> going<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.430> cut<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.610> window

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
acrylic and i'm going to cut a window

out in the back panel here to show off
where<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.220> reservoir<00:02:54.760> will<00:02:54.940> be<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.600> think

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
where the reservoir will be and I think

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.080 
where the reservoir will be and I think
of<00:02:56.110> going<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.470> do<00:02:56.890> another<00:02:57.310> window<00:02:57.730> here<00:02:57.970> in

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
of going to do another window here in

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.150 
of going to do another window here in
the<00:02:58.209> front<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.690> show<00:02:58.900> off<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.110> SSDs<00:02:59.680> I'm<00:02:59.920> not<00:03:00.130> a

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
the front to show off the SSDs I'm not a

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.059 
the front to show off the SSDs I'm not a
hundred<00:03:00.580> percent<00:03:00.819> sure<00:03:01.180> about<00:03:01.569> that<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.140> I

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
hundred percent sure about that and I

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.559 
hundred percent sure about that and I
will<00:03:03.190> be<00:03:03.519> doing<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.910> little<00:03:04.090> bit<00:03:04.269> of<00:03:04.330> case

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
will be doing a little bit of case

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.539 
will be doing a little bit of case
modding<00:03:04.930> inside<00:03:05.319> I<00:03:05.650> will<00:03:05.890> be<00:03:06.040> doing<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.340> little
