 hello friends welcome to my channel 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.150
 iphone school today I want to teach you with 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.280
 this video tutorial to use the 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.829
 voice notes application is generally 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.449
 an application that we usually use but 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.279
 the truth is that it is very useful in addition 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.830
 comes integrated into your device 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.330
 on your iphone as on your ipad as you 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.860
 I say is quite useful because if not 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.350
 you have time to write or you can not 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.550
 Voice notes is the ideal application for 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.120
 Do not forget anything of what 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.670
 have during the day to be able to have 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.079
 a voice note on your device what 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.079
 first thing you have to do is go to 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.329
 voice notes and click on the application 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.800
 On the next screen you will see a 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.350
 red circle as you can see here in the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.179
 lower part in which when 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.519
 pulses can start talking and 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:49.870
 from there it goes how you're going to see it's going 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.530
 to go recording your voice in the note we are going to 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.800
 do a test 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.660
 I'm talking and my 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.120
 voice note my note is being recorded 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.989
 voice on my iphone when I want to finish 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.500
 what I do is click here down on ok 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.090
 ok I have my voice note 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.100
 Obviously this application is 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.649
 quite complete because in addition you 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.399
 allows you to name each of 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:19.640
 your notes in this case I'm going to put the 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.510
 video for example 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.270
 to my note 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.870
 when I already have the name put pulse 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.120
 in save 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.900
 I have it saved as you can see 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.880
 here I have my video note 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.520
 you can save as many voice notes as 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.860
 you want the only drawback is that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.350
 your device let's say the hard drive of 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.050
 your device will fill it very much 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.120
 and maybe you're occupying a space that 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.760
 could you use it for another kind of 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.680
 applications then the ideal would be that 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.890
 when you had time you will arrive home or 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.890
 I know when you would like to transfer 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.850
 all those voice notes to your pc for 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.080
 Do you connect your device to your pc or 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.970
 take while dwarfs 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.800
 once inside iTunes and there 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.110
 recognized your device how can you 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.380
 see here I have mine you go to the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.890
 music tab and makes the option 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.110
 include voice notes if you look at the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.420
 left side is already included 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.150
 as a kind of folder in which 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.220
 you have your voice notes like noah 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.240
 synchronized only I only get the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.910
 first but if I take and now I give 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.340
 sync up 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.210
 in a little while the voice note will be passed 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:42.170
 that I just did to my pc and power 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.480
 well free space on my iphone 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.690
 let's wait for all to be copied 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.420
 the items to be finalized 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.599
 synchronization and you see as here in notes 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.030
 voice and I have what I have done if 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.890
 what I want is to delete the voice note 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.440
 because I say good, it's been a while since 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.160
 I have many and I do not want to have it in 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.150
 the pc is easy to mark unmark the one 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.720
 you do not want to leave marked 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.200
 you leave the one you want to delete marked 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.569
 to edit and tell him to delete you appears 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.980
 a window in which he says insurance 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.079
 that you want to delete the voice notes 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.090
 selected from the list as only 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.540
 has selected the one that for example I 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.670
 I just did you tell him to eliminate and already 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.150
 is ready and has already been removed from your pc 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.609
 from now on your iphone or your 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.920
 ipad you can erase the voice notes and 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.109
 As I said before, you can use that 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.260
 space for anything else that 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:44.560
 you prefer to have in your device good 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.409
