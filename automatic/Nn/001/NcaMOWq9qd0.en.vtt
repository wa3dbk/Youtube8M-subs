every<00:00:01.499> once<00:00:01.680> in<00:00:01.800> a<00:00:01.890> while<00:00:01.949> you<00:00:02.490> will<00:00:02.909> need<00:00:03.419> to

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
every once in a while you will need to

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.710 
every once in a while you will need to
know<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.470> angle<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:05.070> a<00:00:05.370> set<00:00:05.760> of<00:00:05.940> stairs<00:00:06.270> and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
know the angle of a set of stairs and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.530 
know the angle of a set of stairs and
believe<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.500> or<00:00:07.560> not<00:00:07.740> I've<00:00:08.010> got<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.610> simple<00:00:09.330> and

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
believe it or not I've got a simple and

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.890 
believe it or not I've got a simple and
easy<00:00:09.870> way<00:00:10.049> to<00:00:10.589> give<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.639> angle<00:00:12.360> for

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
easy way to give you that angle for

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.049 
easy way to give you that angle for
rough<00:00:13.230> framing<00:00:13.799> obviously<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.610> wouldn't<00:00:14.940> be

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
rough framing obviously this wouldn't be

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.480 
rough framing obviously this wouldn't be
for<00:00:15.419> precision<00:00:16.320> work<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:16.920> should<00:00:17.160> be<00:00:17.190> close

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
for precision work but should be close

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.280 
for precision work but should be close
enough<00:00:17.700> for<00:00:17.880> rough<00:00:18.210> framing<00:00:19.670> simply<00:00:20.670> lay<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
enough for rough framing simply lay a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.010 
enough for rough framing simply lay a
2x4<00:00:22.290> on<00:00:22.530> top<00:00:23.040> of<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.730> treads<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.390> risers<00:00:24.540> at

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
2x4 on top of the treads and risers at

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.050 
2x4 on top of the treads and risers at
an<00:00:25.170> angle<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.120> here<00:00:27.120> here<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.600> have<00:00:27.870> a<00:00:28.110> level

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
an angle and here here I have a level

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.970 
an angle and here here I have a level
gable<00:00:30.060> stud<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.690> should<00:00:31.110> say<00:00:31.290> a<00:00:31.320> plumb<00:00:31.590> gable

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
gable stud I should say a plumb gable

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.529 
gable stud I should say a plumb gable
stud<00:00:32.510> horizontally<00:00:33.510> no<00:00:34.050> vertically<00:00:34.829> yes<00:00:35.539> if

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
stud horizontally no vertically yes if

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.049 
stud horizontally no vertically yes if
you<00:00:36.749> don't<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.679> gable<00:00:38.249> stud<00:00:38.460> simply<00:00:38.850> use<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
you don't have a gable stud simply use a

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.229 
you don't have a gable stud simply use a
level<00:00:39.510> lay<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.350> 2x4<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.159> top<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:43.879> stairs<00:00:44.879> at

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
level lay a 2x4 on top of the stairs at

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.509 
level lay a 2x4 on top of the stairs at
an<00:00:45.420> angle<00:00:45.839> the<00:00:46.109> angle<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.559> need<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.100> put<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
an angle the angle you need is put the

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.639 
an angle the angle you need is put the
level<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.999> place<00:00:48.329> get<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.289> where<00:00:49.469> it's

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
level in place get it to where it's

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.229 
level in place get it to where it's
perfectly<00:00:50.190> plumb<00:00:51.079> vertically<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.319> and<00:00:52.379> down

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
perfectly plumb vertically up and down

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.259 
perfectly plumb vertically up and down
make<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.269> mark<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:57.319> 2x4<00:00:58.319> and<00:00:58.940> then<00:00:59.940> of

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
make a mark on the 2x4 and then of

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.790 
make a mark on the 2x4 and then of
course<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> easy<00:01:01.229> part

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
course this is the easy part

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.319 
course this is the easy part
grab<00:01:02.249> a<00:01:02.550> speed<00:01:02.940> square<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:04.969> set<00:01:05.969> it<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
grab a speed square and set it up to

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.859 
grab a speed square and set it up to
where<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.350> actually<00:01:08.310> figure<00:01:09.299> out<00:01:09.329> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
where you can actually figure out the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.429 
where you can actually figure out the
angle<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.219> the<00:01:11.340> picture<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:12.170> just<00:01:13.170> line

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
angle as in the picture here just line

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.109 
angle as in the picture here just line
it<00:01:13.469> up<00:01:13.740> when<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> lined<00:01:14.549> up<00:01:14.759> look

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it up when you have it lined up look

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.819 
it up when you have it lined up look
over<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.409> angle<00:01:17.570> dimensions<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.899> see

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
over to the angle dimensions and see

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.770 
over to the angle dimensions and see
what<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.189> angle<00:01:20.579> is<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.000> believe<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.509> one

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
what the angle is and I believe this one

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.770 
what the angle is and I believe this one
here<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.320> about<00:01:22.789> 33<00:01:23.789> degrees<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.479> again<00:01:24.689> I'm

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
here is about 33 degrees and again I'm

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.420 
here is about 33 degrees and again I'm
just<00:01:24.840> throwing<00:01:25.079> up<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.500> almost<00:01:25.799> looks<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.189> I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
just throwing up it almost looks like I

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.109 
just throwing up it almost looks like I
don't<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:28.460> speed<00:01:29.460> square<00:01:29.789> in<00:01:29.969> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
don't have the speed square in the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.029 
don't have the speed square in the
correct<00:01:30.450> position<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.170> actually<00:01:31.530> looks<00:01:31.799> like

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
correct position it actually looks like

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.620 
correct position it actually looks like
I<00:01:32.399> think<00:01:32.549> I'm<00:01:32.820> pretty<00:01:33.000> sure<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.390> speed

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
I think I'm pretty sure this speed

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.230 
I think I'm pretty sure this speed
square<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.020> actually<00:01:34.229> broken<00:01:34.710> at<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> end<00:01:35.520> but

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
square is actually broken at the end but

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.200 
square is actually broken at the end but
you<00:01:37.140> should<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.859> it<00:01:38.369> should<00:01:38.759> provide<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you should get it should provide you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.499 
you should get it should provide you
with<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> pretty<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.310> example<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.299> you

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
with a pretty good example of what you

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.620 
with a pretty good example of what you
need<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.850> again<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.149> use<00:01:45.179> math

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
need to do and again you can use math

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.240 
need to do and again you can use math
you<00:01:45.929> can<00:01:46.079> look<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.320> charts<00:01:46.710> even<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.070> back

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you can look at charts even in the back

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.819 
you can look at charts even in the back
of<00:01:47.399> my<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.850> my<00:01:48.030> books<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.780> stair<00:01:49.259> building<00:01:49.710> I

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
of my in my books on stair building I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.520 
of my in my books on stair building I
have<00:01:50.039> a<00:01:50.070> bunch<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.490> charts<00:01:51.049> where<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.289> put

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
have a bunch of charts where if you put

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.969 
have a bunch of charts where if you put
in<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:53.280> tread<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> riser<00:01:55.109> height<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
in the tread and the riser height the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.870 
in the tread and the riser height the
tread<00:01:56.280> width<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.939> hyzer<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:58.140> riser

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.200 
tread width and the hyzer the riser
height<00:01:59.880> believe<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.020> has<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:02.179> degrees<00:02:03.179> in

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
height believe it has the degrees in

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.969 
height believe it has the degrees in
there<00:02:03.689> also<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.289> if<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.469> don't<00:02:04.619> want<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.859> buy
