00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.970
 Good day to all and today I 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.480
 I would like to tell you about my macbook 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.230
 air 2013 release and his 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.260
 predecessors of 2012 release in what 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.660
 their differences are seemingly inconspicuous 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.210
 arise inside the outer more strongly 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.210
 let's watch movies and nuts 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.570
 but 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.280
 now let's talk about the battery he 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.400
 located almost the entire back 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.570
 the surface of the macbook and now makes 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.840
 7150 milliamps and we increased the volume by 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.770
 450 milamps and I want to tell you 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.879
 quite noticeable but the main difference 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:57.410
 its 2013 page handling is 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:00.980
 time 9 hours in 2012 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.680
 won at 14:00 suspended last 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.130
 operating systems family are very happy that 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.780
 the moment that they do not increase the thickness 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.259
 may should increase 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.070
 battery it stayed completely so 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.310
 they were just for me 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.450
 legs and increased the cost of the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.760
 battery new macbook air 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.310
 at night wi-fi module last 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.440
 generation why it was done it 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.890
 I want to say that a lot 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.340
 it's a lot of vivid example of that 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.150
 need to think about the future and now soon 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.240
 Internet itself is increasing approximately 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.220
 six seven times which is very good but we 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.990
 know that our leadership rights are in our 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.760
 the country can not yet be what 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.420
 maximum 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.660
 internet community I have 150 megabits 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.850
 transmission speeds but about 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.650
 issued on working days 6070 is the maximum 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.800
 mother's charge to me and is 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.850
 the main 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.520
 which means it has become a little less but now 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.119
 video chip and processor combined one 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.120
 chips and 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.540
 this way when using the new 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.230
 chip have a kind of chip that is exactly 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.120
 metalcore and again my macbook then we 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.170
 reduced by 25 percent mine 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.990
 consumption and power increases by 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:31.370
 78 percent depending on 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.860
 use with this we have frequency 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.180
 the processor itself has been reduced by about 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.510
 to 1 and 3 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.570
 end perry hard drive namely by 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.500
 six days here set behind from 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:51.110
 samsung companies with no and if this 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:54.350
 the student himself sets the disk instead of the former 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.390
 save up holy you connector msata all 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.920
 these 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.720
 visions significantly increased 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.940
 reading performance and speed 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.220
 same operating system itself also 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.540
 inward he is good and external thief of what 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.569
 trying to download or download a lot 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.740
 The touchpad itself has also been changed. 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.440
 now uses new thin sections 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.800
 to better read your 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.459
 touch and touch itself when pressed 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.480
 so those who want to change 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.610
 touchpad 2012 2013 and you have it 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.250
 it turns out just because he just does not 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.790
 will work so if you choose 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.790
 between 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.810
 I advise you to take 2013 with your ears 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.650
 the only change in appearance that I am 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.020
 had seen 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:48.840
 No in 2012 and 2013 this is a microphone 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.230
 skype which has two renji holes 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.540
 there was one malik hole and a mesh 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.900
 protective but it looked like dun it 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.140
 God basically play the screen itself too 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.220
 did not change therefore particular returns from 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.570
 you can not wait for him 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.240
 he stayed the same as 2012 I was waiting 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.190
 personally retina but they didn't deliver it 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.130
 so you have to be content with 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.530
 such programs are not the biggest 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:22.260
 2012 was a good resolution 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:26.880
 so he noticed that you 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.930
 bad talk I will not but 2013 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.300
 turned out to be a lie and 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.610
 inside changes 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.819
 were colossal intact remained 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.129
 just walk and speakers 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.870
 but on this I say goodbye to you all
