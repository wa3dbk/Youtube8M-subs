have to do too many snips well video
snips<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:36.800> our<00:00:37.800> event<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> spin<00:00:38.640> attack<00:00:38.760> in

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
snips and our event is spin attack in

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.160 
snips and our event is spin attack in
the<00:00:39.300> inferno<00:00:39.870> volcano<00:00:41.809> basically<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.870> spin

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the inferno volcano basically you spin

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.369 
the inferno volcano basically you spin
and<00:00:43.500> try<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.550> ram<00:00:45.180> people<00:00:45.570> outside<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and try to ram people outside of the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.680 
and try to ram people outside of the
dome<00:00:47.030> like<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.110> battle<00:00:49.110> tops<00:00:50.390> this<00:00:51.390> will

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
dome like a battle tops this will

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.840 
dome like a battle tops this will
actually<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.559> second<00:00:53.010> spin<00:00:53.250> event<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
actually be the second spin event in the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.750 
actually be the second spin event in the
game<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.770> actually<00:00:55.920> easier<00:00:56.489> than<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
game and it's actually easier than the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.610 
game and it's actually easier than the
first<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:58.910> first<00:00:59.910> tip<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.960> charge<00:01:01.379> your

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
first one first tip is to charge your

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.830 
first one first tip is to charge your
attack<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.730> keep<00:01:02.940> oh<00:01:03.210> wait<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.690> doing

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
attack and to keep oh wait and doing

attack and to keep oh wait and doing
this<00:01:04.080> full<00:01:04.610> because<00:01:05.610> even<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.570> goes

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
this full because even there it goes

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.859 
this full because even there it goes
from<00:01:07.080> red<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.860> yellow<00:01:08.119> into<00:01:09.119> white<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.659> full

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
from red to yellow into white for full

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.620 
from red to yellow into white for full
power

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
power

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.209 
power
although<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:12.229> don't<00:01:12.439> actually<00:01:12.890> know<00:01:13.159> this

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
although you don't actually know this

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:19.149 
although you don't actually know this
into<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:14.860> second<00:01:15.860> is<00:01:16.180> in<00:01:17.180> this<00:01:17.619> event<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:19.130> are

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
into a second is in this event you are

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.609 
into a second is in this event you are
able<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.700> gain<00:01:19.880> points<00:01:20.149> by<00:01:20.600> dying<00:01:21.289> or

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
able to gain points by dying or

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.010 
able to gain points by dying or
releasing<00:01:22.399> your<00:01:22.490> spin<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.570> even<00:01:23.899> though<00:01:23.930> I

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
releasing your spin so even though I

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.709 
releasing your spin so even though I
fell<00:01:24.289> into<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.619> crater<00:01:24.890> I<00:01:25.220> got<00:01:25.700> bonuses<00:01:26.509> for

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
fell into the crater I got bonuses for

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.300 
fell into the crater I got bonuses for
it<00:01:29.020> second<00:01:30.020> is<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.289> be<00:01:30.439> opportunity<00:01:31.069> and<00:01:31.189> have

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
it second is to be opportunity and have

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.270 
it second is to be opportunity and have
to<00:01:31.460> struggle<00:01:31.729> against<00:01:32.149> enemies<00:01:32.569> like<00:01:32.600> so

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
to struggle against enemies like so

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.440 
to struggle against enemies like so
basically<00:01:34.280> is<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.460> let<00:01:34.610> them<00:01:34.789> attack

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
basically is to let them attack

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.950 
basically is to let them attack
themselves<00:01:36.409> swear<00:01:36.860> round<00:01:37.159> take<00:01:37.549> them<00:01:40.960> and

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
themselves swear round take them and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.839 
themselves swear round take them and
avoid<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.560> geysers<00:01:42.979> cuz<00:01:43.189> now<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.340> just<00:01:43.700> lost

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:43.849 
avoid the geysers cuz now I just lost

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:50.919 
avoid the geysers cuz now I just lost
about<00:01:44.030> five<00:01:44.390> seconds<00:01:47.950> there<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.039> go<00:01:49.189> see<00:01:49.929> just

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
about five seconds there you go see just

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.460 
about five seconds there you go see just
swept<00:01:51.649> around<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:52.130> edge<00:01:52.280> and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.750 

also<00:01:57.470> when<00:01:57.650> they're<00:01:57.800> in<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:57.979> cluster<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.430> can

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
also when they're in the cluster you can

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.760 
also when they're in the cluster you can
do<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.030> large<00:01:59.450> spin<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.020> get<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.229> whole<00:02:00.440> bunch<00:02:00.470> of

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
do a large spin and get a whole bunch of

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.560 
do a large spin and get a whole bunch of
them<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.159> could<00:02:02.090> do<00:02:02.210> better<00:02:02.390> but<00:02:04.270> this<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.390> not<00:02:05.510> a

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
them I could do better but this is not a

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.380 
them I could do better but this is not a
very<00:02:05.780> critical<00:02:06.110> stage<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.770> worry<00:02:06.950> about<00:02:07.390> if

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
very critical stage to worry about if

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.240 
very critical stage to worry about if
you<00:02:08.539> can<00:02:08.660> get<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.899> first<00:02:09.170> minitek<00:02:09.679> very<00:02:10.039> well

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
you can get the first minitek very well

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.380 
you can get the first minitek very well
this<00:02:10.550> one<00:02:10.759> just<00:02:10.910> cakewalk<00:02:12.550> yes<00:02:16.240> what<00:02:17.240> do<00:02:17.360> we

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
this one just cakewalk yes what do we

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.360 
this one just cakewalk yes what do we
get<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:19.090> mental<00:02:20.090> potion<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:21.770> until<00:02:22.010> next<00:02:22.070> time

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
get a mental potion so until next time

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.510 
get a mental potion so until next time
I'm<00:02:23.000> tiro<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.870> have<00:02:24.410> fun<00:02:24.620> gaming<00:02:25.360> see<00:02:26.360> ya
