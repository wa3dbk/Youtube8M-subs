Carly Lisa here with Achilles Mazda
today<00:00:02.790> I<00:00:03.000> want<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.330> talk<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.629> you<00:00:03.720> about<00:00:03.810> the

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
today I want to talk to you about the

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.960 
today I want to talk to you about the
2014<00:00:05.009> Mazda<00:00:05.910> 3<00:00:06.330> GT<00:00:06.839> model<00:00:07.230> front<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.189> there's

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
2014 Mazda 3 GT model front and there's

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.940 
2014 Mazda 3 GT model front and there's
some<00:00:09.150> really<00:00:09.389> cool<00:00:09.690> things<00:00:09.960> about<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.590> I

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
some really cool things about it that I

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.299 
some really cool things about it that I
want<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.429> share<00:00:11.610> with<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:12.019> the<00:00:13.019> first<00:00:14.009> thing

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
want to share with you the first thing

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.820 
want to share with you the first thing
that<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:15.150> can't<00:00:15.480> notice<00:00:15.929> by<00:00:16.199> looking<00:00:16.379> at<00:00:16.680> this

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
that you can't notice by looking at this

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.550 
that you can't notice by looking at this
thing<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.699> active<00:00:18.330> grille<00:00:18.690> shutters<00:00:18.750> if

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
thing is the active grille shutters if

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.310 
thing is the active grille shutters if
you<00:00:19.830> do<00:00:19.980> some<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.789> know<00:00:20.820> googling<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.080> it

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
you do some you know googling on it

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.660 
you do some you know googling on it
you'll<00:00:22.590> kind<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.070> little<00:00:23.460> bit<00:00:23.580> of

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
you'll kind of get a little bit of

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.429 
you'll kind of get a little bit of
information<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.019> doesn't<00:00:25.260> show<00:00:25.410> you

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
information but it doesn't show you

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.250 
information but it doesn't show you
exactly<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.580> they<00:00:26.760> are<00:00:26.789> or<00:00:27.359> exactly<00:00:28.080> what

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
exactly what they are or exactly what

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.450 
exactly what they are or exactly what
they<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.550> so<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.090> grille<00:00:30.359> here<00:00:30.779> down<00:00:31.380> here

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
they do so in the grille here down here

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.069 
they do so in the grille here down here
has<00:00:32.460> little<00:00:32.730> shutters<00:00:33.120> kind<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> blind

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
has little shutters kind of like a blind

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.139 
has little shutters kind of like a blind
right<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.250> depending<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> engine

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
right so depending on the engine

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.049 
right so depending on the engine
temperature<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:38.100> speed<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> vehicle

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
temperature and the speed of the vehicle

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.530 
temperature and the speed of the vehicle
they<00:00:39.480> would<00:00:39.629> close<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.890> reduce<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
they would close to reduce the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.220 
they would close to reduce the
aerodynamic<00:00:42.540> drag

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
aerodynamic drag

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.279 
aerodynamic drag
now<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.950> Mazda<00:00:44.489> 3<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> Mazda<00:00:45.600> 3<00:00:45.629> Sport

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
now the Mazda 3 and the Mazda 3 Sport

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.220 
now the Mazda 3 and the Mazda 3 Sport
are<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.680> most<00:00:46.980> aerodynamic<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.629> its<00:00:48.809> class

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
are the most aerodynamic in its class

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.459 
are the most aerodynamic in its class
with<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.649> drag<00:00:49.980> coefficient<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.760> 0.26<00:00:51.379> for<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
with a drag coefficient of 0.26 for the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.090 
with a drag coefficient of 0.26 for the
sedan<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.980> point<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:54.059> 8<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> sport<00:00:55.920> model

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
sedan and point to 8 for the sport model

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.639 
sedan and point to 8 for the sport model
so<00:00:56.850> by<00:00:57.059> having<00:00:57.390> these<00:00:57.510> shutters<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:57.989> close

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
so by having these shutters that close

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.010 
so by having these shutters that close
and<00:00:59.070> reduces<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> wind<00:01:00.180> resistance<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
and reduces the wind resistance and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.599 
and reduces the wind resistance and
allows<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.440> car<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.770> pass<00:01:01.980> through<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> air

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
allows your car to pass through the air

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.390 
allows your car to pass through the air
more<00:01:02.910> smoothly<00:01:03.439> thus<00:01:04.439> improving<00:01:05.129> fuel

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
more smoothly thus improving fuel

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
more smoothly thus improving fuel
economy<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.900> awesome<00:01:07.110> thing<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
economy so a really awesome thing to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.719 
economy so a really awesome thing to
have<00:01:08.659> now<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> did<00:01:10.049> some<00:01:10.229> research<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.860> all<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
have now I did some research on all the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.300 
have now I did some research on all the
models<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> category<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.799> did<00:01:14.010> find

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
models in the category and I did find

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.030 
models in the category and I did find
all<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.820> stats<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.570> prove<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
all the stats to prove that it is the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.340 
all the stats to prove that it is the
most<00:01:17.189> aerodynamic<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.509> only<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.080> couldn't

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
most aerodynamic the only one I couldn't

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.679 
most aerodynamic the only one I couldn't
find<00:01:19.650> was<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> Civic<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.820> if<00:01:21.119> anyone<00:01:21.659> out

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
find was the Civic so if anyone out

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.289 
find was the Civic so if anyone out
there<00:01:21.900> knows<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.710> aerodynamic<00:01:23.640> drag<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
there knows the aerodynamic drag of the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.929 
there knows the aerodynamic drag of the
Civic<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.200> would<00:01:25.799> love<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.189> know<00:01:26.310> please<00:01:26.640> post

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
Civic I would love to know please post

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999 
Civic I would love to know please post
in<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.270> comments<00:01:27.869> section<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.619> source

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
in the comments section with your source

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.590 
in the comments section with your source
cuz<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.490> was<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.729> only<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> couldn't

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
cuz that was the only one I couldn't

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.870 
cuz that was the only one I couldn't
find<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.280> could<00:01:32.340> tell<00:01:32.670> it's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
find and it from what I could tell it's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.840 
find and it from what I could tell it's
somewhere<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> upwards<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.079> 0.3

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
somewhere in the upwards of 0.3

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.429 
somewhere in the upwards of 0.3
something<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.180> if<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:36.930> what<00:01:37.110> let<00:01:37.409> me

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
something so if you know what let me

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.130 
something so if you know what let me
know<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.040> had<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.729> click<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.090> page<00:01:39.299> 2<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> Google

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
know I had to click on page 2 of Google

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.920 
know I had to click on page 2 of Google
and<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.500> still<00:01:40.770> couldn't<00:01:40.950> find<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.720> if<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and I still couldn't find it so if you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.120 
and I still couldn't find it so if you
know<00:01:43.049> that'd<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.320> great<00:01:43.560> post<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
know that'd be great post in the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.100 
know that'd be great post in the
comments<00:01:44.579> section<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.329> back<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.540> our<00:01:45.840> car

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
comments section so back to our car

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.920 
comments section so back to our car
let's<00:01:46.560> take<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> look<00:01:47.040> down<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
let's take a look down here at the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.179 
let's take a look down here at the
active<00:01:49.439> grille<00:01:49.740> shutters<00:01:51.439> so<00:01:52.439> down<00:01:52.799> in

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
active grille shutters so down in

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.359 
active grille shutters so down in
through<00:01:53.490> here<00:01:54.770> okay<00:01:55.770> there's<00:01:56.040> little

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
through here okay there's little
