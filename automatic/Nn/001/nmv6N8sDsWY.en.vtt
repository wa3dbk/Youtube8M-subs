00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
the first one I'm gonna go over a smart

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.470

casting<00:00:13.290> which<00:00:13.650> hopefully<00:00:14.299> pretty<00:00:15.299> much

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
casting which hopefully pretty much

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.390 
casting which hopefully pretty much
everyone<00:00:15.839> knows<00:00:15.870> about<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.500> very<00:00:16.770> commonly

used<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.420> talked<00:00:18.660> about<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.619> think<00:00:19.920> I'll

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
used and talked about but I think I'll

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.490 
used and talked about but I think I'll
just<00:00:20.070> go<00:00:20.340> over<00:00:20.369> anyway

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
your key bindings you change from cast

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.049 
your key bindings you change from cast
spells<00:00:30.260> to<00:00:31.260> or<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.640> smart<00:00:32.850> cast

the wall because of it
that's<00:02:04.260> something<00:02:04.560> else<00:02:04.980> is<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.790> attack<00:02:06.120> move

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
that's something else is the attack move

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.980 
that's something else is the attack move
so<00:02:07.350> normally<00:02:08.100> we'd<00:02:08.490> press<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:09.570> shows<00:02:09.810> you

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
so normally we'd press a it shows you

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
poor Fiddlesticks but oh maybe not

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.980 
poor Fiddlesticks but oh maybe not
I<00:02:19.980> got<00:02:20.160> away<00:02:20.370> what<00:02:20.520> do<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.670> know<00:02:20.990> anyway

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
I got away what do you know anyway

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.810 
I got away what do you know anyway
another<00:02:22.470> way<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.680> found<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.980> do<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.340> which<00:02:23.670> is

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
another way I found to do this which is

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.910 
another way I found to do this which is
set<00:02:24.000> by<00:02:24.030> default<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.320> should<00:02:25.530> work<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:25.860> you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
set by default so it should work for you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.870 
set by default so it should work for you
immediately<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:27.810> instead<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.530> pressing<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:29.010> you

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
immediately is instead of pressing a you

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.040 
immediately is instead of pressing a you
can<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.240> hold<00:02:30.390> shift<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.470> right<00:02:31.620> click<00:02:33.050> see

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
can just hold shift and right click see

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.080 
can just hold shift and right click see
how<00:02:34.320> I'm<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:34.580> right-clicking<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.880> he's

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
how I'm just right-clicking and he's

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.530 
how I'm just right-clicking and he's
doing<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.600> attack<00:02:36.900> command<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:39.420> that's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
doing the attack command so that's

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.500 
doing the attack command so that's
pretty<00:02:39.750> useful<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.520> preset<00:02:42.300> by

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
pretty useful and that is preset by

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.720 
pretty useful and that is preset by
default<00:02:43.010> now<00:02:44.010> that's<00:02:44.160> something<00:02:44.459> else<00:02:44.610> that's

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
default now that's something else that's

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.090 
default now that's something else that's
very<00:02:44.970> useful<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.350> come<00:02:46.620> under<00:02:46.890> key

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
borderless I like to use borderless

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.339 
borderless I like to use borderless
because<00:04:00.909> that<00:04:01.090> allows<00:04:01.269> me<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.659> alt-tab<00:04:02.019> very

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349
