meal in and how fast it actually went so

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.860 
meal in and how fast it actually went so
distance<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.300> wheel<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> be

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
distance with this wheel is going to be

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.549 
distance with this wheel is going to be
great<00:00:43.969> yeah<00:00:44.969> that's<00:00:45.270> big<00:00:45.870> bonus<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.469> this

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
great yeah that's big bonus in this

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.310 
great yeah that's big bonus in this
wheel's<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.039> core<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:48.320> cameras

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
wheel's the core and all that cameras

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.959 
wheel's the core and all that cameras
moving<00:00:49.500> cuz<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> swing<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.789> you're

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
moving cuz it's on a swing if you're

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:59.410 
moving cuz it's on a swing if you're
wondering<00:00:51.559> ok<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.210> slide<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.050> wheel

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.770 

decently<00:01:00.620> buttery<00:01:01.910> not<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.300> though<00:01:03.480> I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
decently buttery not really though I

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.560 
decently buttery not really though I
phony<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.650> only<00:01:05.490> ever<00:01:05.640> used<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.120> wheel<00:01:06.390> when<00:01:06.540> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
phony I only ever used this wheel when I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.020 
phony I only ever used this wheel when I
was<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.780> New<00:01:06.920> like<00:01:07.920> don't<00:01:08.190> even<00:01:08.310> think<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.790> think

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
was in New like don't even think I think

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.790 
was in New like don't even think I think
I<00:01:09.120> totally<00:01:09.630> did<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> couple<00:01:10.050> of<00:01:10.230> standings<00:01:10.680> on

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
I totally did a couple of standings on

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.160 
I totally did a couple of standings on
this<00:01:11.010> wheel<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.090> was<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.270> doing<00:01:12.630> colman

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
this wheel so I was just doing colman

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.930 
this wheel so I was just doing colman
colman<00:01:13.200> grad<00:01:13.740> stalefish<00:01:14.480> toe<00:01:15.480> side<00:01:15.720> push<00:01:16.140> ups

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
colman grad stalefish toe side push ups

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.330 
colman grad stalefish toe side push ups
stuff<00:01:17.940> like<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.690> free<00:01:19.200> drifts<00:01:19.590> stuff

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
stuff like that like free drifts stuff

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.600 
stuff like that like free drifts stuff
like<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.050> it<00:01:22.050> was<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:23.550> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
like that and it was it's a it's a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.520 
like that and it was it's a it's a
pretty<00:01:23.940> buttery<00:01:24.390> wheel<00:01:25.940> it's<00:01:26.940> decent<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.810> like

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
pretty buttery wheel it's decent I like

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.440 
pretty buttery wheel it's decent I like
it<00:01:28.680> more<00:01:28.800> than<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.010> center<00:01:29.790> set<00:01:29.970> free<00:01:30.180> rides

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it more than the center set free rides

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.480 
it more than the center set free rides
definitely<00:01:33.200> not<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.470> much<00:01:34.590> chatter<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
definitely not really much chatter to it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.290 
definitely not really much chatter to it
it's<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.910> nice<00:01:37.520> we're<00:01:38.520> learning<00:01:38.760> it<00:01:39.150> might

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
it's really nice we're learning it might

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.460 
it's really nice we're learning it might
not<00:01:39.450> be<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.720> best<00:01:39.930> because<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.260> don't<00:01:40.410> know

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
not be the best because I don't know

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.560 
not be the best because I don't know
breaking<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.100> find<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> breaking<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.150> school

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
breaking I find the breaking this school

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.870 
breaking I find the breaking this school
out<00:01:42.750> into<00:01:43.050> slots<00:01:43.380> harder<00:01:44.160> than<00:01:44.369> some<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.850> my

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
out into slots harder than some of my

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.120 
out into slots harder than some of my
other<00:01:45.000> wheels<00:01:45.410> so<00:01:46.410> it<00:01:46.440> might<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.650> be<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.920> best

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
other wheels so it might not be the best

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.160 
other wheels so it might not be the best
food<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.460> learning<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.660> if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> want<00:01:49.110> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
food for learning but if you want a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
food for learning but if you want a
distance<00:01:49.619> wheel<00:01:49.830> is<00:01:50.040> definitely<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> great

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
distance wheel is definitely be a great

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.480 
distance wheel is definitely be a great
choice<00:01:51.330> because<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.960> super<00:01:52.830> fast<00:01:53.220> roll

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
choice because it's super fast roll

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.270 
choice because it's super fast roll
speed<00:01:53.760> slide<00:01:54.660> is<00:01:54.810> decently<00:01:55.200> buttery<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.010> can

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
speed slide is decently buttery you can

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.050 
speed slide is decently buttery you can
you<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.330> this<00:01:57.479> wheel<00:01:57.690> and<00:01:59.060> downhill

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
you can do it on this wheel and downhill

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.180 
you can do it on this wheel and downhill
definitely<00:02:00.600> not<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:01.650> even<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.009> go

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
definitely not not even going to go

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.070 
definitely not not even going to go
there<00:02:02.220> this<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.970> not<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.179> downhill<00:02:03.479> wheel<00:02:03.810> at

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
there this is not a downhill wheel at

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.790 
there this is not a downhill wheel at
all<00:02:05.119> don't<00:02:06.119> do<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.770> yeah<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.550> wheel<00:02:08.759> was<00:02:09.800> 50

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
all don't do it yeah this wheel was 50

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.280 
all don't do it yeah this wheel was 50
