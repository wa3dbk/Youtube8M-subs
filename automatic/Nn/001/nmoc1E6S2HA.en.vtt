00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
is Bethenny that I've gathered and

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.789 
is Bethenny that I've gathered and
pickled<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.779> probably<00:00:07.200> growing<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.649> new

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
pickled and is probably growing a new

yard just beneath your feet Bethenny is
a<00:00:10.349> weed<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.010> has<00:00:11.160> these<00:00:11.370> little<00:00:11.580> tubers

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
a weed and it has these little tubers

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.379 
a weed and it has these little tubers
and<00:00:12.360> these<00:00:13.139> are<00:00:13.290> one<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.440> my<00:00:13.559> favorite<00:00:14.460> wild

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
and these are one of my favorite wild

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.370 
and these are one of my favorite wild
foods<00:00:15.809> it's<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> little<00:00:17.250> root<00:00:18.170> but<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.260> has

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
foods it's just a little root but it has

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.859 
foods it's just a little root but it has
the<00:00:19.500> most<00:00:19.619> perfect<00:00:20.220> texture<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.240> crunch<00:00:21.570> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
the most perfect texture the crunch a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.220 
the most perfect texture the crunch a
little<00:00:22.859> bit<00:00:23.160> softer<00:00:23.519> than<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.670> carrot<00:00:24.199> but<00:00:25.199> a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
little bit softer than a carrot but a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.060 
little bit softer than a carrot but a
little<00:00:25.439> bit<00:00:25.619> harder<00:00:26.010> than<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.490> pickle<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:28.680> so

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
little bit harder than a pickle and so

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.980 
little bit harder than a pickle and so
good<00:00:29.640> now<00:00:30.240> I'm<00:00:30.330> not<00:00:30.480> gonna<00:00:30.570> show<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.750> how<00:00:30.929> to

lots<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.610> videos<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.969> show<00:00:33.360> how<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.570> do<00:00:33.780> that

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
lots of videos that show how to do that

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.010 
lots of videos that show how to do that
and<00:00:34.350> I'm<00:00:35.010> not<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.340> good<00:00:35.550> at<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.870> but<00:00:36.870> I'm

going to show you how to find them how

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
going to show you how to find them how
to<00:00:38.370> identify<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.840> get

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
to identify what it is and how to get

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.350 
to identify what it is and how to get
them<00:00:40.410> alright<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.309> your<00:00:41.430> first<00:00:41.640> task<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
them alright so your first task is to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.990 
them alright so your first task is to
find<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.960> actual<00:00:43.290> plant<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
find the actual plant and so this is it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.650 
find the actual plant and so this is it
right<00:00:45.210> here

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
right here

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.779 
right here
you'll<00:00:46.200> notice<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.649> has<00:00:46.680> kind<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.039> long<00:00:47.250> leaves

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
you'll notice it has kind of long leaves

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.540 
you'll notice it has kind of long leaves
and<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.690> very<00:00:48.870> veiny<00:00:49.260> each<00:00:49.530> each<00:00:50.070> leaf<00:00:50.370> has

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and it's very veiny each each leaf has

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.310 
and it's very veiny each each leaf has
lots<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.879> veins<00:00:51.090> through<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.989> long

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
lots of veins through it and the long

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.770 
lots of veins through it and the long
and<00:00:52.590> narrow<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.699> what's<00:00:54.000> really<00:00:54.149> important

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
and narrow but what's really important

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.049 
and narrow but what's really important
is<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.199> notice<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.620> they<00:00:55.800> alternate<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.910> we

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
is to notice that they alternate so we

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.250 
is to notice that they alternate so we
have<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> pair<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> leaves<00:00:57.750> coming<00:00:58.020> out<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
have a pair of leaves coming out this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.139 
have a pair of leaves coming out this
way<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.649> pair<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.250> leaves<00:00:59.430> coming<00:00:59.699> off<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.940> way

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
way a pair of leaves coming off this way

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.000 
way a pair of leaves coming off this way
and<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.690> pair<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> leaves<00:01:01.260> coming<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.829> way

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and a pair of leaves coming out this way

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.889 
and a pair of leaves coming out this way
and<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:02.789> another<00:01:02.820> pair<00:01:03.329> coming<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.809> the

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
seem to like well-drained soil so this

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.370 
seem to like well-drained soil so this
this<00:02:16.760> sand<00:02:17.090> right<00:02:17.269> here<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.840> course<00:02:17.900> very

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
this sand right here is of course very

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.620 
this sand right here is of course very
well-drained<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.190> it's<00:02:19.670> nice<00:02:19.849> and<00:02:20.060> soft<00:02:20.269> and

easy<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.110> break<00:02:21.319> through<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.489> that's<00:02:22.670> good<00:02:22.910> for

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
too big this one isn't too big but

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.710 
too big this one isn't too big but
they'll<00:02:43.430> get<00:02:43.520> quite<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.790> bit<00:02:43.970> bigger<00:02:44.270> than<00:02:44.450> this

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
they'll get quite a bit bigger than this

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.200 
they'll get quite a bit bigger than this
one<00:02:44.980> they<00:02:45.980> start<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.310> get<00:02:46.400> hard<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
one they start to get hard and the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.060 
one they start to get hard and the
texture<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:47.930> isn't<00:02:48.410> as<00:02:48.530> good<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:48.980> they'll

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
texture just isn't as good and they'll

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.470 
texture just isn't as good and they'll
turn<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.310> little<00:02:49.490> bit<00:02:49.670> kind<00:02:49.910> of<00:02:49.940> off-white<00:02:50.420> or

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.960 
turn a little bit kind of off-white or
brownish<00:02:50.990> color<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.520> that<00:02:52.850> means

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
brownish color and so that that means

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.490 
brownish color and so that that means
you<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.480> wait<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.720> little<00:02:53.900> bit<00:02:54.020> too<00:02:54.200> late<00:02:54.380> in

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
cook with these don't have much flavour

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.600 
cook with these don't have much flavour
themselves<00:03:02.840> however<00:03:03.320> they<00:03:03.590> tend<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.980> soak<00:03:04.370> up

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
themselves however they tend to soak up
