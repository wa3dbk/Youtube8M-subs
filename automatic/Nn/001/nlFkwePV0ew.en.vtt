offensive rebounds at his transition
threes<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:13.490> think<00:00:15.500> yeah<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.680> mean<00:00:16.770> like<00:00:17.160> if

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
threes and I think yeah I mean like if

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.529 
threes and I think yeah I mean like if
you<00:00:17.400> look<00:00:17.550> at<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.699> difference<00:00:18.000> between<00:00:18.060> today

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
you look at the difference between today

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.150 
you look at the difference between today
in<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> previous<00:00:19.199> two<00:00:19.470> games<00:00:19.500> i<00:00:19.890> would<00:00:20.010> say

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
in the previous two games i would say

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.769 
in the previous two games i would say
that<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.970> didn't<00:00:21.180> get<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.359> stops<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
that we didn't get the stops to the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.630 
that we didn't get the stops to the
rebounds<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.350> did<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.189> previous<00:00:23.310> two

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
rebounds that we did in a previous two

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.070 
rebounds that we did in a previous two
games<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.029> that's<00:00:24.180> why<00:00:24.330> there's<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.600> margin

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
games and that's why there's a margin

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.939 
games and that's why there's a margin
okc<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.369> battling<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.990> last<00:00:28.410> spot<00:00:28.590> or

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
but you know we felt like it was a

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.210 
but you know we felt like it was a
winnable<00:03:22.910> game

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.340

I<00:05:01.700> mean<00:05:01.940> like<00:05:02.150> if<00:05:02.330> you<00:05:02.419> look<00:05:02.570> at<00:05:02.660> the

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
I mean like if you look at the

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.210 
I mean like if you look at the
difference<00:05:03.020> between<00:05:03.080> today<00:05:03.530> in<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.860> previous

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
difference between today in the previous

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.219 
difference between today in the previous
two<00:05:04.460> games<00:05:04.490> i<00:05:04.880> would<00:05:05.000> say<00:05:05.150> that<00:05:05.180> we<00:05:05.960> didn't<00:05:06.169> get

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
two games i would say that we didn't get

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.200 
two games i would say that we didn't get
to<00:05:06.290> stop<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.770> rebounds<00:05:07.130> that<00:05:07.250> we<00:05:07.370> did<00:05:08.000> in<00:05:08.150> a

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
to stop to the rebounds that we did in a

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.310 
to stop to the rebounds that we did in a
previous<00:05:08.330> two<00:05:08.660> games<00:05:08.690> and<00:05:09.020> that's<00:05:09.140> why

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
previous two games and that's why

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.640 
previous two games and that's why
there's<00:05:09.530> a<00:05:09.620> margin<00:05:10.100> okc<00:05:11.060> is<00:05:11.380> battling<00:05:12.380> for

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
there's a margin okc is battling for

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.440 
there's a margin okc is battling for
that<00:05:12.979> last<00:05:13.430> spot<00:05:13.610> or<00:05:13.970> at<00:05:14.060> least<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.240> try<00:05:14.390> to

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
that last spot or at least to try to

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.940 
that last spot or at least to try to
move<00:05:14.600> up<00:05:14.840> they<00:05:14.990> didn't<00:05:15.200> have<00:05:15.290> their<00:05:15.410> stars<00:05:15.710> did

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950
