what<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.360> say<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> time<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.930> mean<00:01:25.170> what<00:01:25.350> he

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
what we say all the time I mean what he

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.920 
what we say all the time I mean what he
does<00:01:25.740> 10<00:01:26.130> yards<00:01:26.400> away<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:27.030> also<00:01:27.180> affect<00:01:27.659> what

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
does 10 yards away can also affect what

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.050 
does 10 yards away can also affect what
it<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.350> happens<00:01:28.770> 10<00:01:29.340> more<00:01:29.520> yards<00:01:29.700> down<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
it what happens 10 more yards down the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.760 
it what happens 10 more yards down the
field<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:30.990> that's<00:01:31.140> very<00:01:31.200> important

something I didn't I didn't think was

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.969 
something I didn't I didn't think was
paralleled<00:02:06.240> by<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.420> lot<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.470> year's<00:02:07.710> class

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
paralleled by a lot in this year's class

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.130 
paralleled by a lot in this year's class
and<00:02:08.369> quite<00:02:08.880> honestly<00:02:08.910> over<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.450> number<00:02:09.989> of

and quite honestly over a number of
classes<00:02:10.440> i<00:02:10.679> think<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.970> full<00:02:12.300> picture<00:02:12.510> here<00:02:13.050> is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
classes i think the full picture here is

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.050 
classes i think the full picture here is
something<00:02:14.130> that's<00:02:14.220> very<00:02:14.310> impressive<00:02:14.670> let's

something that's very impressive let's

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.759 
something that's very impressive let's

we<00:04:24.550> can<00:04:24.700> continue<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.150> build<00:04:25.330> this<00:04:25.480> last<00:04:26.020> then

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
we can continue to build this last then

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.660 
we can continue to build this last then
when<00:04:26.470> people<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:26.980> I<00:04:27.040> know<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.310> first<00:04:27.490> round

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
when people and I know the first round

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.220 
when people and I know the first round
just<00:04:27.910> seems<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.270> be<00:04:28.330> its<00:04:28.450> own<00:04:28.570> separate<00:04:28.900> entity

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
just seems to be its own separate entity

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.410 
just seems to be its own separate entity
people<00:04:29.500> will<00:04:29.620> grade<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.040> draft<00:04:30.550> before<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.300> guy

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
people will grade a draft before a guy

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.940 
people will grade a draft before a guy
plays<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.870> down<00:04:31.990> based<00:04:32.290> upon<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.620> first<00:04:32.740> round

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
plays it down based upon the first round

plays it down based upon the first round
pick<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.430> draft<00:04:34.060> class<00:04:34.270> is<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.540> class<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:35.380> do

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
pick a draft class is a class you do

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.230 
pick a draft class is a class you do
this<00:04:35.830> therefore<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:36.430> don't<00:04:36.610> have<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:36.940> do<00:04:37.060> this

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
this therefore I don't have to do this

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.730 
this therefore I don't have to do this
in<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.510> second<00:04:37.900> third<00:04:38.080> or<00:04:38.170> fourth<00:04:38.470> round

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
in the second third or fourth round

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.260 
in the second third or fourth round
isn't<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.430> really<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.850> way<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.060> the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
isn't that really the way that the

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.820 
isn't that really the way that the
general<00:04:40.570> manager<00:04:40.930> has<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.230> think<00:04:41.380> what's<00:04:41.650> my

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
general manager has to think what's my

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.130 
general manager has to think what's my
combination<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.640> players<00:04:42.940> at<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.690> end<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:43.990> the

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
combination of players at the end of the

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.630 
combination of players at the end of the
third<00:04:44.350> day<00:04:44.380> not<00:04:44.890> just<00:04:45.070> at<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.340> end<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
third day not just at the end of the

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.130 
third day not just at the end of the
first<00:04:45.850> day<00:04:45.940> we<00:04:46.450> talk<00:04:46.630> about<00:04:46.780> that<00:04:46.870> all<00:04:46.990> the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
first day we talk about that all the

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.930 
first day we talk about that all the
time<00:04:47.260> did<00:04:47.770> this<00:04:47.950> again<00:04:48.520> we've<00:04:48.730> mentioned

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
time did this again we've mentioned

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.270 
time did this again we've mentioned
chess<00:04:49.300> match<00:04:49.570> this<00:04:50.170> is<00:04:50.350> a<00:04:50.380> part<00:04:50.680> of<00:04:50.800> it<00:04:50.980> I<00:04:51.070> guess

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
chess match this is a part of it I guess

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.590 
chess match this is a part of it I guess
you<00:04:51.400> could<00:04:51.430> call<00:04:51.700> it<00:04:51.760> part<00:04:52.060> of<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.360> chess

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
you could call it part of the chess

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.240 
you could call it part of the chess
match<00:04:52.630> because<00:04:53.170> it<00:04:53.470> is<00:04:53.590> about<00:04:53.890> making<00:04:54.100> sure

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
match because it is about making sure

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.010 
match because it is about making sure
that<00:04:54.550> you<00:04:54.640> have<00:04:54.880> all<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.510> pieces<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:55.870> fit

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
that you have all the pieces that fit

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.050 
that you have all the pieces that fit
into<00:04:56.320> place<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.800> you<00:04:57.250> have<00:04:57.520> to<00:04:57.670> have<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:57.790> really

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
into place and you have to have a really

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.310 
into place and you have to have a really
good<00:04:58.240> understanding<00:04:58.300> of<00:04:58.840> what's<00:04:59.080> in<00:04:59.230> the

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
good understanding of what's in the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.810 
good understanding of what's in the
draft<00:04:59.560> and<00:04:59.740> what<00:04:59.950> may<00:05:00.100> be<00:05:00.160> there<00:05:00.430> in<00:05:00.520> certain

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
draft and what may be there in certain

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.430 
draft and what may be there in certain
rounds<00:05:01.060> that<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.240> pick<00:05:01.480> there<00:05:02.020> may<00:05:02.140> be<00:05:02.170> some

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
rounds that you pick there may be some

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.350 
rounds that you pick there may be some
very<00:05:02.650> good<00:05:02.830> players<00:05:02.980> at<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.460> top<00:05:03.700> of<00:05:03.730> a<00:05:04.000> round

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
very good players at the top of a round

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.640 
very good players at the top of a round
and<00:05:04.570> a<00:05:04.600> half<00:05:04.780> in<00:05:04.960> front<00:05:05.200> of<00:05:05.290> you<00:05:05.350> that<00:05:05.530> you're

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
and a half in front of you that you're

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.409 
and a half in front of you that you're
not<00:05:05.740> going<00:05:05.890> to<00:05:05.950> get<00:05:06.010> a<00:05:06.070> chance<00:05:06.340> to<00:05:06.460> touch<00:05:06.640> you

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
not going to get a chance to touch you

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.000 
not going to get a chance to touch you
have<00:05:07.570> to<00:05:07.690> be<00:05:07.780> projecting<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.350> see<00:05:08.530> what<00:05:08.770> may<00:05:08.980> be

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
have to be projecting to see what may be

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.100 
have to be projecting to see what may be
there<00:05:09.340> for<00:05:09.520> you<00:05:09.669> you<00:05:09.940> know<00:05:10.360> around<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:10.990> half

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
there for you you know around and a half

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.140 
there for you you know around and a half
later<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:11.680> think<00:05:11.980> that's<00:05:12.130> up<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.610> the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
later and I think that's up to the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.270 
later and I think that's up to the
scouting<00:05:13.570> staff<00:05:13.810> in<00:05:14.380> general<00:05:14.800> manager<00:05:15.100> head

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
scouting staff in general manager head

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.159 
scouting staff in general manager head
coach<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.760> truly<00:05:16.210> hone<00:05:16.390> in<00:05:16.570> on<00:05:16.690> that<00:05:16.900> and<00:05:17.140> I

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
coach to truly hone in on that and I

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.930 
coach to truly hone in on that and I
think<00:05:17.410> this<00:05:17.620> step<00:05:17.890> does<00:05:18.100> a<00:05:18.130> heck<00:05:18.580> of<00:05:18.669> a<00:05:18.760> job

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
think this step does a heck of a job

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.520 
think this step does a heck of a job
last<00:05:19.390> night<00:05:19.510> what<00:05:19.720> it<00:05:19.810> ended<00:05:20.020> you<00:05:20.140> got<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.380> guy

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
last night what it ended you got the guy

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.110 
last night what it ended you got the guy
you<00:05:20.590> wanted<00:05:21.010> I<00:05:21.160> know<00:05:21.220> you<00:05:21.370> have<00:05:21.550> visions<00:05:21.940> of

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
you wanted I know you have visions of
