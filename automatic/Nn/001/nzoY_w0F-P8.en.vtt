getting<00:00:33.750> lockdown<00:00:34.699> brings<00:00:35.699> up<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> Unison

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
getting lockdown brings up the Unison

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.750 
getting lockdown brings up the Unison
playing<00:00:36.720> everything<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.739> me<00:00:38.100> start<00:00:38.370> mixing<00:00:38.489> in

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
playing everything in me start mixing in

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
playing everything in me start mixing in
armonk<00:00:39.329> harmonies<00:00:39.720> and<00:00:39.750> different<00:00:40.530> melodies

and counter melodies going on into music
so<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.290> really<00:00:43.409> crucial<00:00:43.909> to<00:00:45.409> get<00:00:46.409> that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
so it's really crucial to get that

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.619 
so it's really crucial to get that
tuning<00:00:46.890> lockdown<00:00:47.220> especially<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.269> fast<00:00:48.480> as

tuning lockdown especially as fast as

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.130 
tuning lockdown especially as fast as
possible<00:00:48.659> because<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.320> changes<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.100> rapidly

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
possible because it changes so rapidly

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.079 
possible because it changes so rapidly

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you really have to be able to get around

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.880 
you really have to be able to get around
fast<00:00:56.400> and<00:00:56.699> accurately<00:00:57.769> especially<00:00:58.769> when

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
fast and accurately especially when

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.439 
fast and accurately especially when
you're<00:00:59.040> doing<00:00:59.339> the<00:00:59.489> drones<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.089> tune<00:01:00.269> of<00:01:00.360> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
you're doing the drones the tune of the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.539 
you're doing the drones the tune of the
drone<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.290> kind<00:01:01.409> of<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:02.189> provides

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549 
drone because that kind of that provides

nice little umbrella over the sound kind

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.560 
nice little umbrella over the sound kind
of<00:01:11.220> liked<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> refer<00:01:11.759> to<00:01:11.880> it

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.380 

and<00:01:18.080> we<00:01:18.170> use<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.610> peterson<00:01:19.610> strobe<00:01:19.850> tuner<00:01:20.060> a

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
and we use the peterson strobe tuner a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.710 
and we use the peterson strobe tuner a
strobe<00:01:21.380> will<00:01:21.500> clip<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:22.159> we<00:01:22.220> use<00:01:22.460> its<00:01:23.450> really

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
strobe will clip that we use its really

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.350 
strobe will clip that we use its really
accurate<00:01:24.110> it's<00:01:24.229> able<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.610> view<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.670> see<00:01:26.210> if

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
accurate it's able to view the see if

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.630 
accurate it's able to view the see if
it's<00:01:26.510> you<00:01:26.810> do<00:01:27.010> sharper<00:01:28.010> bladder<00:01:28.280> very

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
it's you do sharper bladder very

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.890 
it's you do sharper bladder very
accurately<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.090> got<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.360> tell<00:01:29.510> people<00:01:29.840> are

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
accurately you got to tell people are

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.480 
accurately you got to tell people are
willing<00:01:30.020> unsteadily<00:01:30.619> because<00:01:31.220> it's<00:01:31.369> still

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
willing unsteadily because it's still

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.670 
willing unsteadily because it's still
accurate<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.970> can<00:01:32.030> see<00:01:32.330> it<00:01:32.450> all<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:33.530> it's

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
accurate you can see it all so it's

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.320 
accurate you can see it all so it's
really<00:01:33.830> convenient<00:01:34.190> to<00:01:34.430> distributing<00:01:34.970> drones

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
really convenient to distributing drones

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.060 
really convenient to distributing drones
because<00:01:35.540> if<00:01:35.990> it's<00:01:36.140> scrolling<00:01:36.500> down<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:36.890> move

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
because if it's scrolling down you move

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.740 
because if it's scrolling down you move
the<00:01:37.250> drone<00:01:37.430> top<00:01:37.700> down<00:01:37.940> let's<00:01:38.300> go<00:01:38.450> on<00:01:38.600> off<00:01:38.720> you

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
the drone top down let's go on off you

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.900 
the drone top down let's go on off you
move<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.050> up<00:01:39.170> suits<00:01:39.410> great<00:01:40.040> mapping<00:01:40.490> mentally

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
move it up suits great mapping mentally

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.940 
move it up suits great mapping mentally
so<00:01:41.210> let's<00:01:41.390> just<00:01:41.540> do<00:01:41.930> what<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.170> says<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.619> can<00:01:42.740> go

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
so let's just do what it says you can go

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.910 
so let's just do what it says you can go
really<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.460> also<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.119> rate<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.570> was<00:01:44.690> just<00:01:44.920> you

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
really and also the rate it was just you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.430 
really and also the rate it was just you
know<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.130> strobe<00:01:46.430> is<00:01:46.580> going<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.509> know<00:01:47.660> okay<00:01:48.410> I

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
know the strobe is going you know okay I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.690 
know the strobe is going you know okay I
got<00:01:48.619> a<00:01:48.650> long<00:01:48.740> way<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:48.950> go<00:01:49.070> like<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.369> just<00:01:49.400> really

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
got a long way to go like it just really

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.310 
got a long way to go like it just really
cranky<00:01:50.000> really<00:01:50.180> fast<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:50.869> really<00:01:51.050> speeds

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
cranky really fast so it really speeds

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.810 
cranky really fast so it really speeds
up<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.530> process<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:52.100> set<00:01:52.220> up<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.430> little<00:01:52.700> meal

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
up the process to set up a little meal

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.090 
up the process to set up a little meal
