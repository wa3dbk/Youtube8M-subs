00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.289
 wow wow wow welcome let's see 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.439
 with the intervention that I tell you that in 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.950
 this game I know there are snipers 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.119
 and I'm interested in having a 30 make a 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.440
 intervention because it is that it is more 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.530
 difficult with more networks 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.930
 one watch God that I came to drop me 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.930
 I'm going from the fuck game 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.740
 the fired already 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.060
 well this is level 1 of the game 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.120
 earlier that from what I see now takes 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.600
 another class that are not the kikos so 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.600
 there are no guys 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.699
 is lost is lost the poor 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.009
 what's going on here that they're going to kill all the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.009
 who killed me 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.490
 so many with barrett 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.960
 do not 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.400
 what one has behind but has 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.360
 preferred not to check it because I've heard 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.360
 a throwing knife 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.090
 do not 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.840
 i 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.650
 one 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.660
 is that he had the jug and did not know what 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.150
 do 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.580
 skiles gala secondary because they had 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.870
 harvey had a streak so this after the 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.150
 change to the neighborhood I do not want to kill the 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.750
 true 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.050
 mike mister michael who killed him not 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.050
 go dead 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.569
 Well, if he killed him, he dies 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.569
 wasted in texas 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.320
 good 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.260
 is the fact that today most verte 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.260
 of times without bullets 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.620
 fuck 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.180
 OK 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.180
 they closed me 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.849
 no no 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.360
 the repetition looks like months 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.360
 highlighting 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.290
 I see myself looking up 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.290
 ice 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.240
 some gilmar that I know really is flippant 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.240
 the number of brands that we go 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.950
 that is also very good 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.440
 at level 3 he killed me 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.590
 one 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.180
 when 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.759
 37 the truth is not bad 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.430
