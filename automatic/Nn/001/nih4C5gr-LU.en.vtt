and<00:00:46.379> now<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:46.829> pull<00:00:47.489> off<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.910> hammer

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and now here we go pull off and hammer

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:57.830 
and now here we go pull off and hammer
on<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> index<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:50.989> minor

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.800

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
I'll put the ringing down with index

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.000 
I'll put the ringing down with index
up<00:01:02.020> with<00:01:02.200> index

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
up with index

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:15.560 
up with index
yes

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
here like a D shape without the index

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:35.880 
here like a D shape without the index
yes<00:02:28.489> -<00:02:29.489> like<00:02:29.640> that

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890
