00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.900 
would have to arrest him using force as
it<00:03:30.989> turns<00:03:31.200> out<00:03:31.440> he'd<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.859> know<00:03:31.889> just<00:03:32.250> gave<00:03:32.730> up

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
it turns out he'd you know just gave up

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.360 
it turns out he'd you know just gave up
peacefully<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:34.109> we<00:03:34.200> didn't<00:03:34.470> know<00:03:34.590> how<00:03:34.859> any<00:03:35.280> of

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
peacefully but we didn't know how any of

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.849 
peacefully but we didn't know how any of
this<00:03:35.549> would<00:03:35.790> unfold<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.690> guess<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.829> know

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
this would unfold so I guess you know

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.550 
this would unfold so I guess you know
would<00:03:38.099> have<00:03:38.190> been<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.310> tightrope<00:03:38.730> walk<00:03:38.940> between

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
would have been a tightrope walk between

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.610 
would have been a tightrope walk between
interviewer<00:03:41.000> quasi<00:03:42.000> negotiator<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.169> and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
interviewer quasi negotiator and and

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.559 
interviewer quasi negotiator and and
certainly<00:03:43.950> friend<00:03:44.370> at<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.880> same<00:03:45.090> time<00:03:45.329> it

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
certainly friend at the same time it

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.509 
certainly friend at the same time it
would<00:03:45.840> have<00:03:45.900> been<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.620> old-time<00:03:46.980> strangers

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
would have been the old-time strangers

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.280 
would have been the old-time strangers
but<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.819> never<00:03:47.970> happened<00:03:48.359> how<00:03:48.720> weird<00:03:49.049> was<00:03:49.230> it

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
but it never happened how weird was it

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.879 
but it never happened how weird was it
to<00:03:49.590> seem<00:03:50.040> in<00:03:50.190> prison<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.959> was<00:03:52.139> pretty<00:03:52.410> strange

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
to seem in prison it was pretty strange

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.390 
to seem in prison it was pretty strange
uh<00:03:53.340> that's<00:03:54.180> an<00:03:54.329> understatement<00:03:54.750> uh<00:03:55.400> they

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
uh that's an understatement uh they

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.490 
uh that's an understatement uh they
brought<00:03:56.669> him<00:03:56.849> around<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.239> corner<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.870> he

brought him around a corner and he

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.170 
brought him around a corner and he
looked<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:58.889> me<00:03:59.010> at<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.430> point<00:03:59.700> like<00:03:59.760> he<00:03:59.940> lost

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180

smart guy if I was going to do something

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.720 
smart guy if I was going to do something
like<00:04:40.230> this<00:04:40.470> would<00:04:40.980> I<00:04:41.010> be<00:04:41.220> dumb<00:04:41.430> enough<00:04:41.670> to

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
like this would I be dumb enough to

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.340 
like this would I be dumb enough to
leave<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.090> glove<00:04:42.390> behind<00:04:42.600> but<00:04:42.960> I'd<00:04:43.080> be<00:04:43.170> dumb

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
leave a glove behind but I'd be dumb

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.260 
leave a glove behind but I'd be dumb
enough<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.590> do<00:04:43.800> this<00:04:43.950> this<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.250> this<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:45.090> what

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
enough to do this this and this and what

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.600 
enough to do this this and this and what
I'm<00:04:45.390> thinking<00:04:45.750> is<00:04:45.930> look<00:04:46.350> once<00:04:47.130> somebody

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
I'm thinking is look once somebody

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.760 
I'm thinking is look once somebody
murders<00:04:48.540> two<00:04:48.750> people<00:04:49.110> if<00:04:49.260> in<00:04:49.380> fact<00:04:49.590> that's

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
murders two people if in fact that's

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.070 
murders two people if in fact that's
what<00:04:49.980> happened<00:04:50.010> then<00:04:51.000> all<00:04:51.180> bets<00:04:51.210> are<00:04:51.660> off<00:04:51.720> in

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
what happened then all bets are off in

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.750 
what happened then all bets are off in
terms<00:04:52.290> of<00:04:52.470> what<00:04:52.530> your<00:04:52.770> normal<00:04:52.980> pattern<00:04:53.400> of

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
terms of what your normal pattern of

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.060 
terms of what your normal pattern of
behavior<00:04:54.210> would<00:04:54.360> be<00:04:54.420> and<00:04:55.140> I<00:04:55.260> remember<00:04:55.680> to

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
behavior would be and I remember to

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.120 
behavior would be and I remember to
everything<00:04:56.640> he<00:04:56.790> said<00:04:57.060> I<00:04:57.330> simply<00:04:58.170> said<00:04:58.410> well

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
everything he said I simply said well

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.100 
everything he said I simply said well
you'll<00:04:59.490> have<00:04:59.640> a<00:04:59.700> chance<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.330> tell<00:05:00.540> your<00:05:00.750> story

in court your side will come out soon
enough<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.440> thought<00:05:04.590> that<00:05:04.770> was<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:04.950> only

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
enough I thought that was the only

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.550 
enough I thought that was the only
reasonable<00:05:05.790> thing<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.120> say<00:05:06.450> under<00:05:07.440> those

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
reasonable thing to say under those

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.170 
reasonable thing to say under those
circumstances<00:05:07.770> do<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.580> think<00:05:08.730> he<00:05:08.790> did<00:05:08.940> it

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
circumstances do you think he did it

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.050 
circumstances do you think he did it
sure<00:05:10.490> yeah<00:05:11.490> I<00:05:11.520> don't<00:05:11.670> think<00:05:11.850> there's<00:05:11.970> any

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
sure yeah I don't think there's any

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.600 
sure yeah I don't think there's any
doubt<00:05:12.210> about<00:05:12.360> it
