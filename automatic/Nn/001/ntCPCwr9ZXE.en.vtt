show and we've got our new independent
rear<00:00:08.069> suspension<00:00:08.220> we<00:00:09.030> brought<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.360> here<00:00:09.480> to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
rear suspension we brought it here to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.890 
rear suspension we brought it here to
put<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.990> new<00:00:10.110> products<00:00:10.590> display<00:00:14.900> and

of the race cars that today a solid axle

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.340 
of the race cars that today a solid axle
is<00:00:20.640> really<00:00:21.480> thing<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.840> past

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
is really thing of the past

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.560 
is really thing of the past
people<00:00:22.680> go<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.859> great<00:00:23.070> lengths<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.570> engineer

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
people go to great lengths to engineer

people go to great lengths to engineer
front<00:00:24.869> suspensions<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.769> never<00:00:26.460> really<00:00:26.730> get

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
front suspensions and never really get

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.359 
front suspensions and never really get
into<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.119> rear<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.660> what<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.439> did<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.800> design

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
into the rear so what we did is design

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.510 
into the rear so what we did is design
our<00:00:29.580> own<00:00:29.609> geometry<00:00:30.359> uses<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.439> c6<00:00:31.949> spindle<00:00:32.430> in

our own geometry uses a c6 spindle in
the<00:00:32.610> back<00:00:32.790> several<00:00:33.719> options<00:00:34.079> were<00:00:34.200> considered

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
the back several options were considered

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.010 
the back several options were considered
including<00:00:35.610> using<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.120> complete<00:00:36.570> Corvette

a stock Corvette independent rear
suspension<00:00:50.520> simply<00:00:51.520> wasn't<00:00:51.730> optimal<00:00:52.330> to<00:00:52.660> use

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
suspension simply wasn't optimal to use

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.070 
suspension simply wasn't optimal to use
under<00:00:53.110> 60s<00:00:53.650> and<00:00:54.190> 70s<00:00:54.629> classic<00:00:55.629> American

Muscle<00:00:56.379> biggest<00:00:57.040> thing<00:00:57.160> about<00:00:57.280> this

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
Muscle biggest thing about this

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.650 
Muscle biggest thing about this
independent<00:00:58.000> rear<00:00:58.150> is<00:00:58.239> that<00:00:58.390> it's<00:00:58.510> actually

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
independent rear is that it's actually

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.869 
independent rear is that it's actually
the<00:00:58.900> only<00:00:59.019> one<00:00:59.230> that's<00:00:59.440> available<00:01:00.160> currently

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
the only one that's available currently

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.729 
the only one that's available currently
that<00:01:01.090> uses<00:01:01.330> a<00:01:01.420> true<00:01:01.660> upper<00:01:02.019> and<00:01:02.170> lower<00:01:02.290> control

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
that uses a true upper and lower control

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.090 
that uses a true upper and lower control
arm<00:01:03.040> so<00:01:03.580> it's<00:01:03.760> really<00:01:04.300> not<00:01:04.540> like<00:01:04.750> your<00:01:04.930> typical

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
arm so it's really not like your typical

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.859 
arm so it's really not like your typical

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
independent rear suspension is being

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.130 
independent rear suspension is being
able<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.899> optimize<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.229> roll<00:01:29.410> center

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
able to optimize the roll center

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.500 
able to optimize the roll center
with<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> solid<00:01:31.980> axle<00:01:32.370> rear<00:01:32.490> end<00:01:32.760> we<00:01:33.330> actually

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
with the solid axle rear end we actually

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.210 
with the solid axle rear end we actually
kind<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.990> coupled<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> performance

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
kind of coupled it with the performance

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.670 
kind of coupled it with the performance
of<00:01:35.610> our<00:01:35.730> independent<00:01:36.480> front<00:01:36.690> suspension<00:01:36.810> so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
of our independent front suspension so

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 
of our independent front suspension so
things<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> camber<00:01:39.300> gains<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
things like the camber gains the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.360 
things like the camber gains the
negative<00:01:40.170> camber<00:01:40.380> gains<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.890> rear<00:01:41.160> and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
negative camber gains on the rear and

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.040 
negative camber gains on the rear and
the<00:01:41.460> camber<00:01:41.820> curves<00:01:42.090> are<00:01:42.300> very<00:01:42.510> similar<00:01:42.870> to

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
the camber curves are very similar to

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.990 
the camber curves are very similar to
the<00:01:43.260> front<00:01:43.470> suspension<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.700> went<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the front suspension and we went to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.140 
the front suspension and we went to
great<00:01:45.240> lengths<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.630> match<00:01:46.440> that<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:47.150> roll

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
great lengths to match that the roll

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.210 
great lengths to match that the roll
center<00:01:48.360> location<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.200> works<00:01:49.710> real<00:01:49.950> well<00:01:49.979> with

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
center location it works real well with

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.590 
center location it works real well with
where<00:01:50.520> we've<00:01:50.700> got<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> positioned<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.510> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
where we've got it positioned in the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.469 
where we've got it positioned in the
front<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.190> makes<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:54.060> really

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
front so it really makes for a really

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.719 
front so it really makes for a really
balanced<00:01:54.990> package<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.280> couple<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
balanced package if you if you couple it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.330 
balanced package if you if you couple it
with<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.030> front<00:01:57.270> suspension<00:01:57.530> it's<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.710> 58<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
with the front suspension it's a 58 and
