00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
going to get a square make it bigger

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.779 
going to get a square make it bigger
going<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.660> make<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.020> some<00:00:16.320> type<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.890> darkest

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.360 
bigger a darkish blue going to get
another<00:00:32.669> multiplication<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:34.950> boarder

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
another multiplication to like boarder

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.040 
another multiplication to like boarder
it<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.180> make<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> red

and you're gonna get a major-general the
rank<00:00:44.990> make<00:00:45.990> it<00:00:46.140> bigger<00:00:47.780> make<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.050> sort<00:00:49.620> of

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
rank make it bigger make that sort of

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.690 
rank make it bigger make that sort of
dark<00:00:50.010> blue

and that's how to make your Superman

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.930 
and that's how to make your Superman
emblem<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:48.050> know<00:03:48.740> it's<00:03:49.160> probably<00:03:49.400> not<00:03:49.640> that

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
emblem I know it's probably not that

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.120 
emblem I know it's probably not that
good<00:03:50.150> but<00:03:50.360> if<00:03:50.600> you<00:03:51.140> take<00:03:51.350> your<00:03:51.560> time<00:03:51.770> with<00:03:52.100> it

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
good but if you take your time with it

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.400 
good but if you take your time with it
you<00:03:52.700> will<00:03:53.000> probably<00:03:53.510> be<00:03:53.750> able<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.960> make<00:03:54.200> it

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
you will probably be able to make it

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.830 
you will probably be able to make it
really<00:03:54.740> good<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:56.030> yeah

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
really good so yeah

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.820 
really good so yeah
