lightweight<00:04:01.139> a<00:04:01.829> little<00:04:02.340> infrared<00:04:02.760> port<00:04:03.120> there

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
lightweight a little infrared port there

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.690 
lightweight a little infrared port there
we<00:04:04.200> have<00:04:04.410> two<00:04:04.709> controller<00:04:05.100> ports<00:04:05.489> which

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
we have two controller ports which

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.759 
we have two controller ports which
supposedly<00:04:06.299> you<00:04:06.359> can<00:04:06.540> plug<00:04:06.810> actual

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
supposedly you can plug actual

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.759 
supposedly you can plug actual
accessories<00:04:08.549> from<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.150> Atari<00:04:09.650> into<00:04:10.650> the

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
accessories from the Atari into the

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.830 
accessories from the Atari into the
device<00:04:11.040> which<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.310> pretty<00:04:11.609> cool<00:04:11.850> in<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.690> back

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
device which is pretty cool in the back

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.690 
device which is pretty cool in the back
we<00:04:13.019> have<00:04:13.049> the<00:04:13.200> AC<00:04:13.380> power<00:04:13.799> adapter<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.549> then

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
we have the AC power adapter and then

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.590 
we have the AC power adapter and then
here<00:04:15.180> we<00:04:15.329> have<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.930> actual<00:04:16.410> AV<00:04:17.039> mono<00:04:17.639> stereo

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
here we have the actual AV mono stereo

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.000 
here we have the actual AV mono stereo
and<00:04:19.169> audio<00:04:20.070> earth<00:04:20.340> stereo<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:20.970> video<00:04:21.409> and<00:04:22.409> so

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
start and then we have the left and

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.050 
start and then we have the left and
right<00:04:38.200> difficulty<00:04:39.200> and<00:04:39.550> then<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.730> select

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
guitar which is really really cool so

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.170 
guitar which is really really cool so
nice<00:04:50.180> easy<00:04:50.660> small<00:04:51.290> device<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:52.070> we'll<00:04:52.790> get<00:04:52.940> to

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
nice easy small device and we'll get to

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.320 
nice easy small device and we'll get to
all<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.720> details<00:04:54.110> in<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.410> four<00:04:54.590> of<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:54.860> later

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
all the details in the four of you later

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.090 
all the details in the four of you later
but<00:04:56.330> that's<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.720> console<00:04:57.140> I'm<00:04:57.740> go<00:04:57.890> ahead<00:04:58.010> and

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
but that's the console I'm go ahead and

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.560 
but that's the console I'm go ahead and
set<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:58.400> back<00:04:58.580> down<00:04:58.730> in<00:04:58.910> there<00:04:59.060> and<00:04:59.270> then<00:04:59.450> of

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
set that back down in there and then of

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.200 
set that back down in there and then of
course<00:04:59.840> we<00:05:00.080> have<00:05:00.320> next<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.220> controller<00:05:01.850> so<00:05:02.000> I

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
course we have next the controller so I

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.730 
course we have next the controller so I
don't<00:05:02.360> know<00:05:02.450> how<00:05:02.570> hard<00:05:02.840> these<00:05:02.990> are<00:05:03.230> to<00:05:03.440> get<00:05:03.620> out

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
don't know how hard these are to get out

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.630 
don't know how hard these are to get out
of<00:05:03.890> here<00:05:04.010> wanna<00:05:04.790> make<00:05:05.000> sure<00:05:05.180> I'm<00:05:05.270> careful

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
of here wanna make sure I'm careful

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.130 
of here wanna make sure I'm careful
there<00:05:07.640> we<00:05:07.760> are<00:05:07.880> wireless<00:05:08.390> controllers<00:05:08.960> now

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
there we are wireless controllers now

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.020 
there we are wireless controllers now
these<00:05:09.320> actually<00:05:09.830> look<00:05:10.220> like<00:05:10.250> real<00:05:10.640> Atari

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
these actually look like real Atari

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.820 
these actually look like real Atari
controllers<00:05:11.570> which<00:05:11.720> are<00:05:11.840> cool<00:05:12.080> we<00:05:12.530> actually

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
controllers which are cool we actually

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.080 
controllers which are cool we actually
have<00:05:13.480> the<00:05:14.480> infrared<00:05:15.140> ports<00:05:15.620> there<00:05:16.130> to

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
have the infrared ports there to

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.510 
have the infrared ports there to
communicate<00:05:17.630> the<00:05:18.050> battery<00:05:18.590> packs<00:05:18.890> there<00:05:19.280> and

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
communicate the battery packs there and

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.310 
communicate the battery packs there and
then<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.210> actual<00:05:20.540> controllers<00:05:21.110> which

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
then the actual controllers which

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.980 
then the actual controllers which
actually<00:05:21.770> feel<00:05:22.100> really<00:05:22.700> really<00:05:22.850> good<00:05:23.150> nice

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
actually feel really really good nice

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.350 
actually feel really really good nice
big<00:05:24.410> thick<00:05:24.740> red<00:05:25.040> button<00:05:25.400> there<00:05:25.580> as<00:05:25.790> I<00:05:25.940> remember

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
big thick red button there as I remember

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.720 
big thick red button there as I remember
on<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.660> Atari<00:05:27.020> and<00:05:27.740> yeah<00:05:28.100> these<00:05:28.310> actually

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
on the Atari and yeah these actually

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.820 
on the Atari and yeah these actually
feel<00:05:29.000> like<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.450> real<00:05:29.630> Atari<00:05:30.110> controller<00:05:30.260> so

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
feel like the real Atari controller so

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.500 
feel like the real Atari controller so
it's<00:05:30.980> cool<00:05:31.220> that<00:05:31.250> for<00:05:31.700> the<00:05:31.850> 40th<00:05:32.300> anniversary

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
it's cool that for the 40th anniversary

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
obviously I'll be pulling some things

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.790 
obviously I'll be pulling some things
from<00:05:37.880> my<00:05:37.970> retro<00:05:38.390> collection<00:05:38.840> and<00:05:39.110> plugging<00:05:39.650> in

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
from my retro collection and plugging in

from my retro collection and plugging in
a<00:05:39.980> real<00:05:40.190> Atari<00:05:40.580> controller<00:05:40.780> but<00:05:41.780> for<00:05:41.960> now<00:05:42.050> this

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
a real Atari controller but for now this

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.930 
a real Atari controller but for now this
is<00:05:42.320> really<00:05:42.620> really<00:05:42.710> cool<00:05:43.070> I'm<00:05:43.220> excited<00:05:43.340> to<00:05:43.760> see

is really really cool I'm excited to see
how<00:05:44.150> these<00:05:44.360> work<00:05:44.740> that's<00:05:45.740> pretty<00:05:46.040> much

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
how these work that's pretty much

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.000 
how these work that's pretty much
everything<00:05:46.790> that<00:05:46.820> is<00:05:47.390> in<00:05:47.720> the<00:05:47.870> box<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.830> two

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
everything that is in the box the two
