film<00:01:24.900> yet<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.229> isn't<00:01:25.500> yet<00:01:25.650> goodbye<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.549> one

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
film yet this isn't yet goodbye the one

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.890 
film yet this isn't yet goodbye the one
he<00:01:26.759> meant<00:01:26.909> by<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.060> was<00:01:27.330> he<00:01:27.479> actually<00:01:27.630> reached

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
he meant by that was he actually reached

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.840 
he meant by that was he actually reached
out<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.259> Antoine<00:01:28.590> Winfield<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.250> sounds<00:01:29.729> as

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
out to Antoine Winfield and it sounds as

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.179 
out to Antoine Winfield and it sounds as
if<00:01:29.990> Antoine<00:01:30.990> has<00:01:31.259> gone<00:01:31.560> through<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> cooling

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
if Antoine has gone through the cooling

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.340 
if Antoine has gone through the cooling
off<00:01:32.460> period<00:01:32.970> after<00:01:33.720> his<00:01:33.810> release<00:01:33.930> from<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
off period after his release from the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.140 
off period after his release from the
Vikings<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.920> was<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.189> expected<00:01:35.729> by<00:01:35.820> him<00:01:36.030> or

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
Vikings that was not expected by him or

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.469 
Vikings that was not expected by him or
his<00:01:36.270> agent<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.750> Tuesday<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.829> seems<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.369> if

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
his agent on Tuesday it seems as if

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.330 
his agent on Tuesday it seems as if
maybe<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.600> little<00:01:39.900> bit<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> time<00:01:40.380> has<00:01:40.950> healed

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
maybe a little bit of time has healed

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.280 
maybe a little bit of time has healed
things<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:42.000> where<00:01:42.390> Antoine<00:01:42.780> Winfield<00:01:42.930> might

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
things here where Antoine Winfield might

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.039 
things here where Antoine Winfield might
be<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> little<00:01:43.770> bit<00:01:43.950> more<00:01:44.070> accepting<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
be a little bit more accepting of the

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.850 
be a little bit more accepting of the
possibility<00:01:46.049> at<00:01:46.140> least<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.439> coming<00:01:46.649> back<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
possibility at least of coming back to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.350 
possibility at least of coming back to

willing to put something on the table
that's<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> draw<00:01:58.619> Antoine<00:01:58.920> Winfield<00:01:59.070> in

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
that's going to draw Antoine Winfield in

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.950 
that's going to draw Antoine Winfield in
and<00:01:59.549> make<00:01:59.640> him<00:01:59.790> overlook<00:02:00.270> everything<00:02:00.509> else

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
and make him overlook everything else

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.389 
and make him overlook everything else
and<00:02:01.200> believe<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.920> Vikings<00:02:02.219> are<00:02:02.310> his

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399

doors not closed even though even when

doors not closed even though even when
we<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.739> guys<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.190> EJ<00:02:11.459> Henderson

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
we know it is guys like EJ Henderson

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.850 
we know it is guys like EJ Henderson
even<00:02:12.120> he<00:02:12.780> said<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.110> door<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.290> not<00:02:13.500> closed

even he said the door is not closed

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.590 
even he said the door is not closed
in<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.160> case<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.970> really<00:02:15.060> appears<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
in this case it really appears that the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.030 
in this case it really appears that the
door<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.780> not<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.320> Leslie<00:02:16.620> Frazier<00:02:16.860> is

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
door is not and the Leslie Frazier is

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800 
door is not and the Leslie Frazier is
attempting<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.550> keep<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.270> open<00:02:18.330> because<00:02:18.600> I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
attempting to keep it open because I

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.420 
attempting to keep it open because I
don't<00:02:19.020> think<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.770> much<00:02:19.950> as<00:02:20.040> they<00:02:20.130> talked<00:02:20.370> about

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
don't think as much as they talked about

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.490 
don't think as much as they talked about
the<00:02:20.580> possibility<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:21.330> dumping<00:02:22.170> Antoine

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
the possibility of dumping Antoine

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.720 
the possibility of dumping Antoine
Winfield<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.980> don't<00:02:23.160> think<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.460> Leslie

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
Winfield I don't think that Leslie

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.010 
Winfield I don't think that Leslie
really<00:02:24.030> believed<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.630> was<00:02:24.690> going<00:02:24.900> to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
really believed that it was going to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.990 
really believed that it was going to
come<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.500> even<00:02:26.220> when<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.430> numbers<00:02:26.730> rose

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
come to that even when the numbers rose

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.580 
come to that even when the numbers rose
with<00:02:27.570> Phil<00:02:27.780> Loadholt<00:02:27.990> talk<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.410> him<00:02:28.500> about

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
with Phil Loadholt talk to him about

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.750 
with Phil Loadholt talk to him about
that<00:02:28.710> I'll<00:02:29.010> stuck<00:02:29.220> mole<00:02:29.400> at<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.580> middle

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
that I'll stuck mole at the middle

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.790 
that I'll stuck mole at the middle
linebacker<00:02:29.910> situation<00:02:30.810> did<00:02:31.110> not<00:02:31.140> get<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
linebacker situation did not get the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.080 
linebacker situation did not get the
sense<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.100> Brian<00:02:32.490> Urlacher<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
sense that Brian Urlacher is a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
sense that Brian Urlacher is a
possibility<00:02:33.510> by<00:02:34.110> any<00:02:34.320> stretch<00:02:34.530> they<00:02:34.800> would

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
possibility by any stretch they would

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.920 
possibility by any stretch they would
like<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.100> draft<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.880> middle<00:02:36.390> linebacker<00:02:36.540> and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
like to draft a middle linebacker and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.270 
like to draft a middle linebacker and
