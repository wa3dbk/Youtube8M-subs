00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.110
 We are going to talk about this super fight 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:20.330
 between the canelo and mayweather that so much 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.599
 expectation has generated among all the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.520
 hobby I think it has the potential to 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.710
 be the biggest fight of the past 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.280
 years maybe of the last decades not 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.390
 has has the potential 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:38.350
 and only because the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.920
 saul canelo álvarez obviously 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 Floyd Mayweather is the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.480
 reigning superstar 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.270
 boxing that is 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.780
 that has been captivating so many 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:58.000
 not for many years but you need two 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.699
 participants to create a mega event 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.989
 and obviously the pseudo canelo álvarez is 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.759
 one is a character a fighter who 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.619
 attracts a lot of people I think we can 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.310
 consider that cinnamon is a phenomenon 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.560
 of boxing because he became an idol 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.869
 quickly one thing that does not 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.430
 maybe there is one each generation not 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.620
 exactly yes 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:27.580
 there is one every twenty thirty years 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:32.200
 to say in boxing was July Caesar 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.030
 chávez what is a moral nun and an oscar 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.730
 From the pot 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.580
 this and now we have saúl canelo 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.530
 Alvarez 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.100
 and the good thing about all this is that it's 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.520
 young man is just beginning his 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.980
 career and it is already very advanced already it is 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.520
 world champion already has the attention of 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.189
 world 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.579
 and is facing the best pound for 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.789
 pound 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.039
 floyd mayweather september 14 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.960
 remembering your fight with mayweather that 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.600
 it's still the record of 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.720
 pay-per-view this fight 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.090
 maybe surpasses 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.140
 how do you feel about that as 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.510
 you have given the baton to canelo 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.930
 clear, look, obviously, look at the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.030
 people ask me if the canelo 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.680
 Álvarez is going to be next July Caesar 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.620
 Chávez or the next Oscar de la Hoya 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.469
 for me personally and I'm not 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.239
 speaking for July Cesar Chavez or 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.370
 any other great champion who has 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.180
 left mexico but for me 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.430
 the canelo álvarez has 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.120
 the potential to overcome 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.099
 the records that any other Mexican 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.129
 any other Mexican fighter has 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.129
 accomplished 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.720
 for his discipline for his character 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.940
 for talent it's obviously very 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.990
 important but because of his maturity 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.650
 and her age is this young lady is starting 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.410
 but he is already a very advanced fighter not 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.200
 mentally spiritually physically 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.190
 this is a fighter 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.190
 special 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.209
 on the other hand manuel that at 36 years 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.849
 begins to lose a little the boxer to 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.000
 Sometimes boxers endure many 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.310
 years but suddenly from one fight to another 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.660
 goes down in the libel dramatically in the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.530
 boxing history 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:46.060
 in the history of boxing always comes 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.970
 that young man where the champion 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.020
 world 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.170
 that has been established by many 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.260
 years you have to pass the torch to 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.230
 that to that young man next 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:06.879
 world champion the next idol 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:10.450
 for example Julio Cesar Chavez 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:13.959
 people say that he passed the cake to me not 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.150
 to say it in the fight that night in 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.160
 June 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.950
 I believe that 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.840
 every boxer has his time 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.820
 every boxer has his moment where 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.450
 they achieve 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.650
 be world champions manage to win 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.969
 money 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.770
 there is one there is a little window where 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:42.930
 they have 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.870
 for saying 10 years 15 years for to 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.470
 achieve 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.800
 and write your own story for me the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.490
 time is the cinnamon now is the time 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.490
 of the road
