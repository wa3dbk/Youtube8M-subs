00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 two 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.740
 hello that such friends welcome to 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.009
 peru.com greets your friend and server 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.720
 oscar salvador service director 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.329
 peru font good today we are going to 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.300
 talk a little about how 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.340
 the telephone exchanges that work 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.050
 are the telephone exchanges for what 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.329
 they serve us and well how can we 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.009
 implement them in our business in 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.670
 our company to improve the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.280
 productivity of our company well 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.500
 how to have better communication 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.100
 always be better communicated but 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.070
 for them we will understand the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.499
 main basics of a 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.780
 telephone exchange how it is made 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:55.050
 For this we are going to analyze the following 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.739
 slide well we have a central 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.659
 telephone is a private team that 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.120
 allows you to manage phone calls 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.040
 internal in a company and sharing 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.130
 this forms the access lines to the network 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.260
 public among several users for 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.290
 allow those to perform and receive 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.470
 calls from and to the outside of 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.190
 some way is a way that acts 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.420
 as a branch of the public network 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:27.630
 from the phone in this way we 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:31.620
 we will be able to have call lines 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.360
 ok entrances and telephone annexes 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.910
 who are going to answer those calls 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.850
 telephone so the annexes go 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.890
 to be able to make phone calls to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.270
 outside and the telephone exchange goes to 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.400
 be in the middle and it's the one that's going to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.010
 manage the flow of incoming calls 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.860
 and outgoing we're going to see that a central 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.780
 telephone are composed of trunk lines and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.140
 annexes in the next slide we're going 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.540
 to explain 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.050
 and this does not 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.170
 the annexes is the union of several 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.290
 phones that allow communication between 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.690
 yes in unlimited form and that they share 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.479
 the trunk telephone lines is 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.250
 say the annexes are located the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.560
 we are going to look for to locate in the diagram in 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.120
 the left side ok the central 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.430
 phone is we're looking for 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.730
 example this is a telephone exchange 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.380
 physical ok the annexes are located here 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.980
 on the left side and the annexes are 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.110
 communicate with each other as well the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.770
 numbers of annexes that are usually 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.410
 100 101 can be thousand thousand 1 but the 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:40.360
 annexes are communicated unlimitedly or 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:44.500
 be dialing 101-102 directly 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.080
 communicate with each other and in this way 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.120
 establishes communication however 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.640
 so that these annexes to call is 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.440
 outside and receive calls as it 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.480
 you need the control panel to be connected to 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.459
 trunk lines and that are the lines 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.440
 trunks on the next slide what 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.500
 let's 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.870
 the trunk roads is a link that 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.500
 interconnects to external calls from 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.960
 a telephone exchange are the lines of 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.150
 our telephone operator that good if 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.330
 we use analog telephony can be 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.990
 some analogous lines that connect to 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.710
 the ports 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.050
 efe x0 of the telephone exchange these 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.100
 analogous lines are good he the known 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.319
 copper pair that is used 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.420
 as in the lines 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.909
 that our telephone operator gives us 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.459
 but we also have other options for 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.920
 connect our telephone exchange to 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.230
 digital trunks or ports in 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.140
 one 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.480
 we also have the ip trunks that are 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.760
 like those that provide but font our 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.269
 telephone exchange has to be capable 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.040
 to support good communication and pp 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:59.260
 so that you can settle down to a 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.740
 communication through internet 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.300
 it should be noted that these trunks 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.590
 telephone that can admit a 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:14.210
 telephone exchange have to be 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.730
 compatible with the card or the central 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.200
 telephone not in itself so you can 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.740
 establish this communication 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.630
 well basically basically that's how it works 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.280
 telephone exchange has lines 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.860
 incoming calls where calls are received 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.810
 in the trunk lines in this case and in the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.810
 Trunks is where the numbering is given 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.710
 telephone is a telephone exchange by 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.930
 middle of the trunk has access to a 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.520
 fixed number no or when someone 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.380
 call a telephone exchange that 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.080
 call comes through the trunk that can 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.810
 to be against a similar channel a trunk 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.420
 digital by means of one or an ip trunk 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.460
 and well the flame the call enters from 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.640
 this form the central the central 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.640
 telephone 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.000
 good the telephone exchange manages 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:07.509
 this incoming call and then communicates 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.150
 that call to the corresponding annex 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:13.060
 in the same way when the call of 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.360
 an annex will go to the network 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.120
 public telephone as the central 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.699
 telephone has the power and authority 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.500
 to address that call let it out 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.669
 or not leaving the exit between the advantages 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.160
 and benefits that the centrals have 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.919
 good telephone is the administration 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.710
 of the call to be able to have a better 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.880
 control of telephone calls 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.820
 within the company perform 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.760
 recordings called monitoring 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.580
 of the calls and therefore good 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.820
 can have better communication 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:50.320
 within our business in such a way 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:52.240
 that we can have more control over 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.710
 the flow of calls that we are 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.020
 making sure we do not lose calls 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.699
 telephone is to know that our 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.849
