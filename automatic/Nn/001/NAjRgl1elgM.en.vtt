00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.220 
you what the effect of shutter speed has
on<00:00:03.929> flash<00:00:04.470> photography

horrible<00:00:14.660> lights<00:00:15.020> which<00:00:15.230> are<00:00:15.410> in<00:00:15.650> here<00:00:16.010> just

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
horrible lights which are in here just

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.850 
horrible lights which are in here just
now<00:00:16.370> to<00:00:16.910> light<00:00:17.060> the<00:00:17.180> room<00:00:17.360> if<00:00:17.810> I<00:00:18.320> were<00:00:18.590> to<00:00:18.740> take

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
now to light the room if I were to take

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.500 
now to light the room if I were to take
a<00:00:18.920> photo<00:00:19.190> at<00:00:19.460> a<00:00:19.490> normal<00:00:19.910> speed<00:00:19.940> let's<00:00:20.360> see<00:00:20.480> a

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
a photo at a normal speed let's see a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.260 
a photo at a normal speed let's see a
sixtieth<00:00:21.110> of<00:00:21.200> a<00:00:21.320> second<00:00:21.710> if<00:00:22.640> we<00:00:22.700> look<00:00:23.000> at<00:00:23.180> the

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
sixtieth of a second if we look at the

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.509 
sixtieth of a second if we look at the
top<00:00:23.480> of<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:23.780> camera<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.590> cameras<00:00:24.980> tell<00:00:25.220> me<00:00:25.369> it

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
top of the camera the cameras tell me it

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.779 
top of the camera the cameras tell me it
wants<00:00:25.849> to<00:00:26.210> shoot<00:00:26.449> that<00:00:26.599> F<00:00:26.779> 2.8<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:27.890> a<00:00:28.070> 6<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.699> a

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
wants to shoot that F 2.8 and a 6 of a

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.700 
wants to shoot that F 2.8 and a 6 of a
second<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:29.630> if<00:00:29.869> it<00:00:29.990> takes<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:30.259> photo<00:00:30.439> like

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
second and if it takes the photo like

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.640 
second and if it takes the photo like
that<00:00:31.060> that<00:00:32.060> will<00:00:32.210> give<00:00:32.360> you<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.780> roughly

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
that that will give you a roughly

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.290 
that that will give you a roughly
correct<00:00:34.010> exposure<00:00:34.820> for<00:00:35.450> this<00:00:36.320> room<00:00:37.300> however

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
correct exposure for this room however

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.180 
correct exposure for this room however
if<00:00:38.510> we're<00:00:38.660> wanting<00:00:38.960> to<00:00:39.050> use<00:00:39.140> flash<00:00:39.440> whenever

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
if we're wanting to use flash whenever

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.549 
if we're wanting to use flash whenever
we<00:00:40.280> pop<00:00:40.489> that<00:00:40.520> up<00:00:40.840> instantly<00:00:41.840> it<00:00:42.170> becomes<00:00:42.440> a

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
we pop that up instantly it becomes a

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.610 
we pop that up instantly it becomes a
sixtieth<00:00:43.070> of<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:43.309> second<00:00:44.050> so<00:00:45.050> let's<00:00:45.200> play

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
sixtieth of a second so let's play

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.020 
sixtieth of a second so let's play
around<00:00:45.649> in<00:00:46.070> manual<00:00:46.610> mode<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:48.550> we<00:00:49.550> can<00:00:49.730> change

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
around in manual mode and we can change

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.729 
around in manual mode and we can change
the<00:00:50.300> shutter<00:00:50.480> speed<00:00:50.690> as<00:00:50.989> much<00:00:51.260> as<00:00:51.440> we<00:00:51.530> want

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
the shutter speed as much as we want

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.189 
the shutter speed as much as we want
what<00:00:52.640> I've<00:00:52.730> done<00:00:52.910> is<00:00:53.149> in<00:00:53.390> manual<00:00:53.719> mode<00:00:53.809> I've

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
what I've done is in manual mode I've

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.889 
what I've done is in manual mode I've
changed<00:00:54.710> it<00:00:54.770> still<00:00:54.980> it's<00:00:55.280> at<00:00:55.550> f11<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:56.570> as<00:00:56.780> you

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
changed it still it's at f11 so as you

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.599 
changed it still it's at f11 so as you
can<00:00:56.989> see<00:00:57.050> here<00:00:57.440> this<00:00:57.559> is<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.890> exposure<00:00:58.250> meter

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
can see here this is the exposure meter

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.450 
can see here this is the exposure meter
here<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.210> it's<00:00:59.570> way<00:00:59.930> off<00:01:00.289> down<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:01.219> right

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
here and it's way off down to the right

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.490 
here and it's way off down to the right
saying<00:01:01.940> that<00:01:02.120> it's<00:01:02.269> totally<00:01:02.480> underexposed

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
saying that it's totally underexposed

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.200 
saying that it's totally underexposed
if<00:01:04.010> we<00:01:04.100> were<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.309> take<00:01:04.460> a<00:01:04.489> photo<00:01:04.730> of<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:04.940> just

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
if we were to take a photo of that just

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.230 
if we were to take a photo of that just
now<00:01:05.360> I<00:01:05.600> just<00:01:06.260> can<00:01:06.560> see<00:01:06.710> there's<00:01:07.700> nothing

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
now I just can see there's nothing

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.180 
now I just can see there's nothing
coming<00:01:08.570> up<00:01:08.660> it's<00:01:08.810> totally<00:01:09.020> dark<00:01:09.410> we<00:01:10.070> would

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
coming up it's totally dark we would

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.830 
coming up it's totally dark we would
have<00:01:10.370> to<00:01:10.460> take<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.700> photo<00:01:10.940> all<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.510> way<00:01:11.600> down

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
have to take the photo all the way down

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.810 
have to take the photo all the way down
to<00:01:13.240> so<00:01:14.240> we're<00:01:14.450> at<00:01:14.540> half<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:14.960> second<00:01:15.380> there<00:01:15.820> one

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
to so we're at half a second there one

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.050 
to so we're at half a second there one
second<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.750> two<00:01:18.350> second<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:19.189> now<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.490> three

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
second a two second and now a three

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.149 
second a two second and now a three
second<00:01:20.479> that's<00:01:20.689> going<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:21.710> be<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:21.920> correct

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
second that's going to be the correct

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.609 
second that's going to be the correct
set<00:01:22.430> length<00:01:22.759> of<00:01:22.970> exposure<00:01:23.060> for<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.140> size<00:01:24.439> of

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
set length of exposure for the size of

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.179 
set length of exposure for the size of
the<00:01:24.710> after<00:01:25.070> being<00:01:25.369> f11<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:27.380> there<00:01:27.650> it's<00:01:27.799> come

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
the after being f11 and there it's come

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.910 
the after being f11 and there it's come
pretty<00:01:29.180> much<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.659> right<00:01:29.840> brightness<00:01:30.290> however

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
pretty much the right brightness however

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.120 
pretty much the right brightness however
the<00:01:31.009> white<00:01:31.130> balance<00:01:31.340> isn't<00:01:32.240> correct<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.619> if<00:01:33.950> we

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
the white balance isn't correct so if we

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.609 
the white balance isn't correct so if we
using<00:01:34.400> flash<00:01:34.820> up<00:01:35.210> there<00:01:35.600> you've<00:01:36.140> got<00:01:36.259> remember

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
using flash up there you've got remember

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.130 
using flash up there you've got remember
flash<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.220> very<00:01:37.640> very<00:01:37.970> quick<00:01:38.210> flash<00:01:38.780> from<00:01:39.079> a

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
flash is very very quick flash from a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.569 
flash is very very quick flash from a
speed<00:01:39.530> light<00:01:39.740> will<00:01:40.130> be<00:01:40.340> maybe<00:01:40.820> a<00:01:41.240> 1<00:01:42.189> mm<00:01:43.189> of<00:01:43.399> a

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
speed light will be maybe a 1 mm of a

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.420 
speed light will be maybe a 1 mm of a
second<00:01:43.970> maybe<00:01:44.540> a<00:01:44.689> 3000<00:01:45.500> or<00:01:45.680> if<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.189> are

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
second maybe a 3000 or if you are

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.330 
second maybe a 3000 or if you are
bringing<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.119> power<00:01:47.360> down<00:01:47.689> to<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:48.040> 1/16<00:01:49.040> of<00:01:49.220> a

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
bringing the power down to a 1/16 of a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.139 
bringing the power down to a 1/16 of a
power<00:01:49.549> or<00:01:49.909> an<00:01:50.649> 30<00:01:51.649> tooth<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.430> a<00:01:52.640> power<00:01:52.820> then

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
power or an 30 tooth of a power then

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.789 
power or an 30 tooth of a power then
it's<00:01:53.299> usually<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:54.020> flash<00:01:54.290> is<00:01:54.469> coming<00:01:54.500> out

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
it's usually the flash is coming out

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.999 
it's usually the flash is coming out
very<00:01:55.159> very<00:01:55.340> very<00:01:55.759> quickly<00:01:56.060> maybe<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:57.170> hundred

thousandth<00:01:59.000> of<00:01:59.149> a<00:01:59.360> second<00:01:59.719> it's<00:02:00.049> very

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
thousandth of a second it's very

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.929 
thousandth of a second it's very
difficult<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.829> tell<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.100> how<00:02:01.280> how<00:02:01.549> quick<00:02:01.820> it

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
difficult to tell you how how quick it

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.910 
difficult to tell you how how quick it
is<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:02.600> it's<00:02:02.719> faster<00:02:03.229> than<00:02:03.439> your<00:02:03.710> shutter

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
is but it's faster than your shutter

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.700 
is but it's faster than your shutter
speed<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:05.090> in<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:05.869> place<00:02:06.110> what<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.409> can<00:02:06.590> do

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
speed and in this place what you can do

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.100 
speed and in this place what you can do
is<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.189> can<00:02:07.399> have<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.909> long-term<00:02:08.450> speed<00:02:08.869> or<00:02:09.050> a

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
is you can have a long-term speed or a

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.170 
is you can have a long-term speed or a
short<00:02:09.530> searcher<00:02:09.770> speed<00:02:10.039> but<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.820> will<00:02:10.910> make<00:02:11.120> no

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
short searcher speed but it will make no

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.490 
short searcher speed but it will make no
effect<00:02:11.780> because<00:02:11.960> it's<00:02:12.260> always<00:02:12.470> going<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.310> be

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
effect because it's always going to be

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
effect because it's always going to be
fairly<00:02:15.500> underexposed<00:02:16.070> unless<00:02:16.220> you're<00:02:16.370> doing

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
fairly underexposed unless you're doing

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.430 
fairly underexposed unless you're doing
it<00:02:16.580> for<00:02:16.670> three<00:02:17.000> seconds<00:02:17.600> but<00:02:18.050> if<00:02:18.110> you're<00:02:18.230> doing

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
it for three seconds but if you're doing

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.160 
it for three seconds but if you're doing
like<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.590> portrait<00:02:19.360> you'd<00:02:20.360> usually<00:02:20.660> have<00:02:21.020> it

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
okay and as you see that's how the photo

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.699 
okay and as you see that's how the photo
comes<00:02:46.340> out<00:02:46.550> it's<00:02:46.880> fairly<00:02:47.480> well<00:02:47.690> exposed<00:02:48.140> and

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
comes out it's fairly well exposed and

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.260 
comes out it's fairly well exposed and
normally<00:02:49.280> if<00:02:49.400> you're<00:02:49.520> doing<00:02:49.700> any<00:02:49.940> sort<00:02:50.180> of

normal<00:02:50.660> photography<00:02:51.050> if<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.319> slow<00:02:52.130> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
normal photography if you slow the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.160 
normal photography if you slow the
shutter<00:02:52.610> speed<00:02:52.730> then<00:02:53.330> it<00:02:53.510> should<00:02:53.630> become<00:02:53.750> more

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
shutter speed then it should become more

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.290 
shutter speed then it should become more
exposed<00:02:54.770> but<00:02:55.010> because<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.520> aperture<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.240> the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
overall brightness in here is so low

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.970 
overall brightness in here is so low
that<00:02:59.840> slowing<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.320> shutter<00:03:00.500> speed<00:03:00.650> unless

that slowing the shutter speed unless

that slowing the shutter speed unless
you<00:03:01.130> do<00:03:01.250> into<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.490> stupidly<00:03:02.360> slow<00:03:02.959> speed<00:03:03.440> will

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
you do into a stupidly slow speed will

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.250 
you do into a stupidly slow speed will
have<00:03:04.459> no<00:03:04.730> effect<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.420> let's<00:03:05.450> say<00:03:05.750> we<00:03:05.840> tick<00:03:06.080> it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
have no effect so let's say we tick it

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.300 
have no effect so let's say we tick it
down<00:03:07.090> only<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.360> thirtieth<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.440> second<00:03:09.830> st.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
down only to thirtieth of a second st.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:18.520 
down only to thirtieth of a second st.
Paul<00:03:10.520> -<00:03:10.610> this<00:03:10.730> time<00:03:16.540> okay<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.780> as<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.200> can<00:03:18.320> see

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
Paul - this time okay and as you can see

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.160 
Paul - this time okay and as you can see
there's<00:03:18.860> absolutely<00:03:19.670> no<00:03:20.180> difference<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:20.959> the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
there's absolutely no difference in the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.310 
there's absolutely no difference in the
actual<00:03:21.350> exposure<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:22.640> you're<00:03:22.760> getting

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
actual exposure that you're getting

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.070 
actual exposure that you're getting
whatsoever<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:24.800> changing<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.459> from<00:03:25.550> a<00:03:25.700> 250<00:03:26.510> all

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
whatsoever so changing it from a 250 all

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.560 
whatsoever so changing it from a 250 all
the<00:03:27.290> way<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.470> thirtieth<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.430> second<00:03:28.820> has<00:03:29.300> had

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
the way to thirtieth of a second has had

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.620 
the way to thirtieth of a second has had
no<00:03:29.900> effect<00:03:30.290> on<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:31.040> flash<00:03:31.340> exposure<00:03:31.640> even

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
no effect on the flash exposure even

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.020 
no effect on the flash exposure even
let's<00:03:33.350> take<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.620> even<00:03:33.739> slower<00:03:34.190> so<00:03:34.820> we're<00:03:34.940> doing

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
let's take it even slower so we're doing

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.130 
let's take it even slower so we're doing
it<00:03:35.239> at<00:03:35.500> half<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.769> second<00:03:37.310> let's<00:03:38.269> see<00:03:38.360> this<00:03:38.480> exact

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.360 

so<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.200> can<00:03:42.380> hear<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.800> shutter<00:03:43.070> is<00:03:43.160> open

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
so you can hear it the shutter is open

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.140 
so you can hear it the shutter is open
for<00:03:43.640> a<00:03:43.700> lot<00:03:43.850> longer<00:03:44.030> there<00:03:45.430> but<00:03:46.430> still<00:03:46.820> it's

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
for a lot longer there but still it's

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.000 
for a lot longer there but still it's
pretty<00:03:47.450> dark<00:03:47.840> in<00:03:47.989> here<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.350> all<00:03:48.799> you're

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
pretty dark in here and all you're

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.130 
pretty dark in here and all you're
getting<00:03:49.400> now<00:03:49.610> is<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:50.180> little<00:03:50.600> bit<00:03:50.720> more<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:51.019> the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
getting now is a little bit more of the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.920 
getting now is a little bit more of the
orange<00:03:51.650> from<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.280> lights<00:03:52.670> in<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.329> room<00:03:53.360> from

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
orange from the lights in the room from

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.229 
orange from the lights in the room from
there<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.470> there<00:03:55.220> but<00:03:55.459> overall<00:03:55.760> exposure

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
there and there but overall exposure

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.449 
there and there but overall exposure
really<00:03:56.510> hasn't<00:03:56.989> changed<00:03:57.260> that<00:03:57.320> much<00:03:57.440> okay<00:03:58.400> so

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
really hasn't changed that much okay so

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.920 
really hasn't changed that much okay so
hope<00:03:58.700> that<00:03:58.730> kind<00:03:58.940> of<00:03:59.000> explains<00:03:59.239> if<00:03:59.540> you<00:03:59.780> are

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
hope that kind of explains if you are

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.449 
hope that kind of explains if you are
shooting<00:04:00.200> with<00:04:00.470> flash<00:04:00.769> photography

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
shooting with flash photography

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.520 
shooting with flash photography
the<00:04:01.940> shutter<00:04:02.269> speed<00:04:02.510> doesn't<00:04:03.019> matter<00:04:03.170> if

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
the shutter speed doesn't matter if

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.920 
the shutter speed doesn't matter if
you've<00:04:03.860> got<00:04:04.070> special<00:04:04.400> fancy<00:04:04.970> flashes<00:04:05.750> like

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
you've got special fancy flashes like

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.580 
you've got special fancy flashes like
the<00:04:06.079> Nocona

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
the Nocona

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.340 
the Nocona
speed<00:04:07.489> lights<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:08.120> can<00:04:08.450> go<00:04:08.690> faster<00:04:09.110> than<00:04:09.260> the

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
speed lights you can go faster than the

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.940 
speed lights you can go faster than the
sync<00:04:09.560> speed

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
sync speed

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.039 
sync speed
but<00:04:10.459> then<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.910> takes<00:04:11.239> out<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.420> lot<00:04:11.660> of<00:04:11.840> power

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
but then that takes out a lot of power

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.830 
but then that takes out a lot of power
from<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.530> flash<00:04:12.769> so<00:04:13.459> just<00:04:13.940> normal<00:04:14.360> studio

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
from the flash so just normal studio

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.690 
from the flash so just normal studio
photography<00:04:15.350> for<00:04:15.500> example<00:04:15.920> doesn't<00:04:16.430> really

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
photography for example doesn't really

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.069 
photography for example doesn't really
matter<00:04:16.940> what<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.419> do<00:04:17.540> for<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.750> shutter<00:04:17.930> speed

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
matter what you do for the shutter speed

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.080 
matter what you do for the shutter speed
because<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.799> shutter<00:04:19.130> speed<00:04:19.340> doesn't<00:04:19.910> have

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
because the shutter speed doesn't have

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.810 
because the shutter speed doesn't have
any<00:04:20.390> effect<00:04:20.810> on<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.350> flash<00:04:21.650> exposure<00:04:21.950> shutter

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
any effect on the flash exposure shutter

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.580 
any effect on the flash exposure shutter
speed<00:04:23.090> is<00:04:23.240> used<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.660> control<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.020> ambient

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
speed is used to control the ambient

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.830 
speed is used to control the ambient
light<00:04:24.770> which<00:04:25.370> is<00:04:25.550> these<00:04:25.940> lights<00:04:26.240> here<00:04:26.479> the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
light which is these lights here the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.420 
light which is these lights here the
tungsten<00:04:27.440> lights<00:04:27.680> or<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:27.890> incandescent

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
tungsten lights or the incandescent

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.150 
tungsten lights or the incandescent
lights<00:04:29.060> that<00:04:29.240> they<00:04:29.330> might<00:04:29.510> use<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.380> call<00:04:30.979> it

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
lights that they might use to call it

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.010 
lights that they might use to call it
this<00:04:31.370> type<00:04:31.640> of<00:04:31.760> lighting<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.270> is<00:04:32.630> mainly<00:04:32.870> the

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
this type of lighting and is mainly the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.130 
this type of lighting and is mainly the
aperture<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.830> is<00:04:33.979> used<00:04:34.190> control<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:35.330> flash

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
aperture that is used control the flash

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.990 
aperture that is used control the flash
or<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.740> amount<00:04:37.039> of<00:04:37.130> flash<00:04:37.340> light<00:04:37.640> that<00:04:37.820> comes

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
or the amount of flash light that comes

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.600 
or the amount of flash light that comes
back<00:04:38.270> into<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:39.080> camera<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:40.070> all<00:04:40.190> that<00:04:40.340> helps

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
back into the camera so all that helps

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.740 
back into the camera so all that helps
if<00:04:40.700> you've<00:04:40.789> got<00:04:40.880> any<00:04:40.970> questions<00:04:41.030> down<00:04:41.510> below

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
if you've got any questions down below

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.480 
if you've got any questions down below
and<00:04:42.080> I'll<00:04:42.260> try<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.470> explain<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:42.919> in<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.160> next

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
and I'll try and explain it in the next

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.180 
and I'll try and explain it in the next
video<00:04:43.760> Cheers
