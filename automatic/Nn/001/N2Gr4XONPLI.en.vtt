gesso full string and then and use this
kind<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.620> emotion<00:00:57.130> here<00:00:58.200> and<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.760> develop

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
kind of emotion here and to develop

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.429 
kind of emotion here and to develop
quite<00:01:02.890> a<00:01:02.950> bit<00:01:03.160> of<00:01:03.250> texture<00:01:04.140> which<00:01:05.140> adds

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
quite a bit of texture which adds

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:15.310 
quite a bit of texture which adds
interest<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:06.189> the<00:01:06.520> finish<00:01:06.850> painting

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.730 

and<00:01:15.980> this<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.280> just<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.720> one<00:01:17.720> coat<00:01:18.050> of<00:01:18.080> course

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
and this is just a one coat of course

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.880 
and this is just a one coat of course
this<00:01:18.950> canvas<00:01:19.330> came<00:01:20.330> with<00:01:20.659> two<00:01:21.050> coats<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.500> gesso

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
this canvas came with two coats of gesso

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.780 
this canvas came with two coats of gesso
but<00:01:22.100> it's<00:01:22.270> real<00:01:23.270> thin<00:01:23.890> in<00:01:24.890> its<00:01:25.100> fine<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.670> know

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
but it's real thin in its fine you know

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.660 
but it's real thin in its fine you know
if<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.090> don't<00:01:26.270> mind<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.600> canvas<00:01:27.020> texture<00:01:27.670> and

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
if you don't mind the canvas texture and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.030 
if you don't mind the canvas texture and
sometimes<00:01:29.600> i<00:01:29.810> do<00:01:29.869> just<00:01:30.260> paint<00:01:30.500> on<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.800> back

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
sometimes i do just paint on the back

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.780 
sometimes i do just paint on the back
way<00:01:31.450> but<00:01:32.470> doing<00:01:33.470> this<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:34.070> end<00:01:34.220> up<00:01:34.369> with<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.580> lot

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
way but doing this you end up with a lot

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.370 
way but doing this you end up with a lot
of<00:01:34.940> interesting<00:01:36.520> random<00:01:37.520> texture<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.960> helps

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
of interesting random texture that helps

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.330 
of interesting random texture that helps
you<00:01:41.020> build<00:01:42.020> texture<00:01:42.650> when<00:01:42.920> you're<00:01:43.100> actually

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
you build texture when you're actually

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.330 
you build texture when you're actually
painting<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:47.240> paint<00:01:47.479> can<00:01:47.690> be<00:01:48.070> drug<00:01:49.070> over

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
painting so the paint can be drug over

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.330 
painting so the paint can be drug over
the<00:01:49.460> high<00:01:49.670> spots<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:51.759> give<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.789> broken<00:01:53.240> effect

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.749 

it<00:01:58.340> doesn't<00:01:58.670> take<00:01:58.820> very<00:01:58.850> long<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:01.460> can<00:02:01.610> also

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
it doesn't take very long you can also

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.450 
it doesn't take very long you can also
add<00:02:02.380> different<00:02:03.380> kinds<00:02:03.740> of<00:02:03.800> powders<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:04.310> can

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
add different kinds of powders you can

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.810 
add different kinds of powders you can
add<00:02:04.610> plaster<00:02:05.600> parents<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.140> this<00:02:06.430> order<00:02:07.430> marble

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
add plaster parents to this order marble

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.470 
add plaster parents to this order marble
dust<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:10.670> can<00:02:11.000> get<00:02:11.450> even<00:02:11.720> more<00:02:11.980> texture

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
dust you can get even more texture

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.940 
dust you can get even more texture
although<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.690> jesser<00:02:15.290> works<00:02:15.530> pretty<00:02:15.830> good

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
although this jesser works pretty good

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.560 
although this jesser works pretty good
at<00:02:16.400> extra<00:02:16.820> thick<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:18.230> trick<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:20.269> then<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.510> do

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
at extra thick you trick so then I do

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.000 
at extra thick you trick so then I do
the<00:02:20.840> edges

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.869 

and<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:29.470> don't<00:02:29.680> usually<00:02:29.890> end<00:02:30.250> up<00:02:30.370> with<00:02:30.610> cripes

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
and the don't usually end up with cripes

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.780 
and the don't usually end up with cripes
much<00:02:31.180> texture<00:02:31.659> on<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.959> edges<00:02:32.319> but<00:02:32.790> that's

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
much texture on the edges but that's

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:45.390 
much texture on the edges but that's
okay

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.509 

this<00:02:46.329> is<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.510> gallery<00:02:47.019> wrap<00:02:47.200> canvas

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
this is a gallery wrap canvas

00:02:47.519 --> 00:03:01.880 
this is a gallery wrap canvas
three-quarters<00:02:48.519> of<00:02:48.579> an<00:02:48.790> inch<00:02:48.879> thick
