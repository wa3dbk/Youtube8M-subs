I'll be right back all right it doesn't
matter<00:05:43.939> about<00:05:44.179> being<00:05:44.719> hydrated<00:05:45.020> up<00:05:45.800> they<00:05:46.189> go

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:46.399 
matter about being hydrated up they go

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.899 
matter about being hydrated up they go
since<00:05:46.729> I<00:05:46.939> record<00:05:47.360> it<00:05:47.509> goes<00:05:47.719> hydrated<00:05:48.349> and<00:05:48.529> okay

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
since I record it goes hydrated and okay

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.639 
since I record it goes hydrated and okay
so<00:05:49.909> now<00:05:50.059> if<00:05:50.179> you<00:05:50.300> walk<00:05:50.509> over<00:05:50.959> it<00:05:51.110> it<00:05:51.409> won't

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:51.649 
so now if you walk over it it won't

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:55.269 
so now if you walk over it it won't
break<00:05:51.919> which<00:05:52.610> is<00:05:52.819> pretty<00:05:52.999> good<00:05:54.099> unless<00:05:55.099> you

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:55.279 
break which is pretty good unless you

00:05:55.279 --> 00:06:00.249 
break which is pretty good unless you
jump<00:05:55.550> on<00:05:55.699> it<00:05:56.800> there<00:05:57.800> we<00:05:57.889> go<00:05:58.539> now<00:05:59.539> let's<00:05:59.749> see<00:06:00.020> if
