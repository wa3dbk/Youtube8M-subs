00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.200 
vagabond - unfortunately the D light
strobes<00:00:16.049> had<00:00:16.410> overheating<00:00:17.250> issues<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.940> I

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
strobes had overheating issues so I

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.400 
strobes had overheating issues so I
returned<00:00:19.109> them<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.500> instead<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.800> got<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:21.420> x<00:00:21.570> RI

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
returned them and instead I got the x RI

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.130 
returned them and instead I got the x RI

both of them using just one vagabond
alright<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.400> our<00:01:08.520> testing<00:01:08.850> room<00:01:09.890> first<00:01:10.890> i

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
alright so it's our testing room first i

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.120 
alright so it's our testing room first i
turn<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.369> vaca<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.299> set<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> fast

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
turn on both my am VXR on units I'm

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.010 
turn on both my am VXR on units I'm
gonna<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.680> using<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:24.420> time<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> be

gonna be using this time I'm going to be

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.960 
gonna be using this time I'm going to be
using<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.350> elinchrom<00:01:25.790> transmitter<00:01:26.790> as

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
using the elinchrom transmitter as

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.020 
using the elinchrom transmitter as
opposed<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.020> RF<00:01:28.229> six<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:28.590> twos<00:01:28.880> just<00:01:29.880> like

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
opposed to the RF six all twos just like

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.100 
opposed to the RF six all twos just like
it<00:01:30.210> set<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.860> flash<00:01:32.130> power<00:01:32.430> remotely<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.960> right

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
it set the flash power remotely so right

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.450 
it set the flash power remotely so right
now<00:01:34.200> set<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> lowest<00:01:35.869> alright<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.290> aspire

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:54.270 

okay<00:01:42.049> step<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.079> stop<00:01:51.170> another<00:01:52.170> one

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
okay step one stop another one

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.570 
okay step one stop another one
okay<00:01:55.280> I'll<00:01:55.400> just<00:01:55.910> happen<00:01:56.270> there<00:01:58.480> okay<00:02:00.580> one

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
okay I'll just happen there okay one

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.080 
okay I'll just happen there okay one
went<00:02:02.060> up<00:02:02.710> one<00:02:03.710> one<00:02:03.890> up<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.130> 10th<00:02:04.370> Gilliland

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
went up one one up the 10th Gilliland

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.410 
went up one one up the 10th Gilliland
didn't<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:06.800> I<00:02:07.040> also<00:02:07.190> noticed<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.670> they

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
didn't and I also noticed that they

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.210 
didn't and I also noticed that they
didn't<00:02:11.200> recycle<00:02:12.200> at<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.620> same<00:02:12.770> time<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.040> don't

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
didn't recycle at the same time I don't

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.220 
didn't recycle at the same time I don't
know<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.640> have<00:02:14.240> to<00:02:14.360> find<00:02:14.540> out<00:02:14.630> what<00:02:15.050> that's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
know I have to find out what that's

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.920 
know I have to find out what that's
about

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.180 

okay<00:02:20.930> they<00:02:21.050> seem<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.320> recycle<00:02:21.800> at<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.010> same

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
okay they seem to recycle at the same

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.920 
okay they seem to recycle at the same
time<00:02:24.430> another<00:02:25.430> stop<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:28.790> half<00:02:29.300> power<00:02:29.690> I

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
time another stop is that half power I

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.410 
time another stop is that half power I
believe<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:34.100> recycle<00:02:34.489> time<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.760> not<00:02:34.850> bad<00:02:35.060> I

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
believe the recycle time is not bad I

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.920 
believe the recycle time is not bad I
don't<00:02:35.959> see<00:02:36.050> myself<00:02:36.170> shooting<00:02:36.620> full<00:02:37.010> power<00:02:37.930> you

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
don't see myself shooting full power you

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.449 
don't see myself shooting full power you
know<00:02:39.020> with<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.290> one<00:02:39.530> pack<00:02:39.739> so<00:02:41.980> I'm<00:02:42.980> ventually

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
know with just one pack so I'm ventually

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.960 
know with just one pack so I'm ventually
going<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.820> do<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.510> do<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.080> yourself<00:02:45.170> from<00:02:45.970> power

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
going to do it do it yourself from power

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.330 
going to do it do it yourself from power
pack<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:48.620> never<00:02:48.800> could<00:02:48.950> happen<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.310> just

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
pack so this never could happen but just

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.970 
pack so this never could happen but just
to<00:02:49.550> show<00:02:49.760> that<00:02:50.140> two<00:02:51.140> of<00:02:51.260> them<00:02:51.410> will<00:02:51.590> work<00:02:51.739> with

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
to show that two of them will work with

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.820 
to show that two of them will work with
one<00:02:52.190> back<00:02:52.970> one<00:02:53.180> -<00:02:53.450> there's<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.410> full<00:02:54.620> power<00:02:57.970> so

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
one back one - there's a full power so

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.940 
one back one - there's a full power so
it's<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:00.890> little<00:03:01.160> bit<00:03:01.340> over<00:03:01.640> two<00:03:01.790> seconds<00:03:02.180> one

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
it's a little bit over two seconds one

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.840 
it's a little bit over two seconds one
two<00:03:04.330> almost<00:03:05.330> three<00:03:05.660> seconds<00:03:06.140> actually<00:03:06.850> so

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
two almost three seconds actually so

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.699 
two almost three seconds actually so
it's<00:03:07.940> not<00:03:08.030> too<00:03:08.180> bad<00:03:08.390> considering<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.470> fact

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
it's not too bad considering the fact

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.680 
it's not too bad considering the fact
that<00:03:09.799> these<00:03:09.980> two<00:03:10.040> strobes<00:03:10.940> are<00:03:11.150> digital<00:03:11.570> and

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
that these two strobes are digital and

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.840 
that these two strobes are digital and
are<00:03:12.230> multi-voltage<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:15.340> lot<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.430> people<00:03:16.670> say

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
are multi-voltage a lot of people say

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.460 
are multi-voltage a lot of people say
that<00:03:16.880> they<00:03:17.390> won't<00:03:17.570> work<00:03:17.690> well<00:03:18.049> with<00:03:18.260> power

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
that they won't work well with power

3<00:03:27.590> hundreds<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.130> believe<00:03:28.370> 3<00:03:28.610> 300<00:03:29.060> are<00:03:29.180> exes<00:03:29.570> and

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
3 hundreds I believe 3 300 are exes and

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.229 
3 hundreds I believe 3 300 are exes and
they<00:03:30.560> work<00:03:30.709> fine<00:03:30.920> that<00:03:31.190> told<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.670> 900<00:03:32.090> watts

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
they work fine that told the 900 watts

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.729 
they work fine that told the 900 watts
this<00:03:32.420> is<00:03:32.570> totaling<00:03:32.900> up<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.049> 1000<00:03:33.680> watts<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:34.299> I

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
this is totaling up to 1000 watts and I

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.550 
this is totaling up to 1000 watts and I
don't<00:03:36.739> know<00:03:36.860> if<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.010> can<00:03:37.130> hear<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.549> Vagabond

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
inverter the RPM goes up it ramps up

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.310 
inverter the RPM goes up it ramps up
trying<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:56.090> keep<00:03:56.390> up<00:03:56.570> I<00:03:56.720> guess<00:03:56.870> with<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.049> surge

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
trying to keep up I guess with the surge

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.650 
trying to keep up I guess with the surge
and<00:03:57.829> the<00:03:58.280> senses<00:03:58.579> recycle<00:03:59.090> it<00:03:59.209> goes<00:03:59.299> back<00:03:59.510> down

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
and the senses recycle it goes back down

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.580 
and the senses recycle it goes back down
again<00:03:59.959> it<00:04:00.410> goes<00:04:00.530> back<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.739> normal

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.560 

see<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.710> fan<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.280> fan<00:04:06.460> kind<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.910> had<00:04:07.300> to<00:04:07.420> keep

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
see the fan the fan kind of had to keep

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.150 
see the fan the fan kind of had to keep
up<00:04:07.690> there<00:04:07.900> but<00:04:08.140> it's<00:04:08.470> fine<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.680> guess<00:04:08.950> that's

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
up there but it's fine I guess that's

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.180 
up there but it's fine I guess that's
what<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.340> has<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.490> do<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:11.260> there<00:04:11.740> you<00:04:11.830> have<00:04:11.860> it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
what it has to do so there you have it

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.449 
what it has to do so there you have it
full<00:04:12.790> power<00:04:14.490> firing<00:04:15.490> just<00:04:15.640> fine<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:17.370> don't<00:04:18.370> know

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
full power firing just fine I don't know

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.710 
full power firing just fine I don't know
what<00:04:18.550> happened<00:04:18.850> earlier<00:04:18.910> me<00:04:19.180> because<00:04:19.510> I<00:04:19.540> have

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
what happened earlier me because I have

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.370 
what happened earlier me because I have
the<00:04:19.750> two<00:04:19.989> units<00:04:20.290> too<00:04:20.410> close<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.800> each<00:04:20.890> other<00:04:22.380> if

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
the two units too close to each other if

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.330 
the two units too close to each other if
you<00:04:23.500> notice<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:24.250> fired<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.120> then<00:04:26.340> one

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
you notice I fired it and then one

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.970 
you notice I fired it and then one
recycles<00:04:27.850> first<00:04:28.090> one<00:04:28.750> finished<00:04:28.990> recycling

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
recycles first one finished recycling

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.380 
recycles first one finished recycling
first<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.400> other<00:04:30.520> one<00:04:30.640> followed<00:04:31.000> and

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
first and the other one followed and

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.130 
first and the other one followed and
then<00:04:32.170> when<00:04:32.320> I'm<00:04:32.410> um<00:04:33.660> when<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:34.690> powered<00:04:35.020> up<00:04:35.110> the

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
then when I'm um when I powered up the

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.940 
then when I'm um when I powered up the
strobes<00:04:35.620> again<00:04:36.870> one<00:04:37.870> went<00:04:38.140> up<00:04:38.320> a<00:04:38.500> tenth<00:04:38.710> of<00:04:38.800> an

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
strobes again one went up a tenth of an

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.270 
strobes again one went up a tenth of an
egg<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.550> tenth<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:41.770> other<00:04:41.860> one<00:04:42.040> stayed

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
egg a tenth and the other one stayed

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.380 
egg a tenth and the other one stayed
behind<00:04:42.460> I<00:04:44.490> guess<00:04:45.490> because<00:04:45.790> I<00:04:46.000> put<00:04:46.210> them<00:04:46.270> too

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
behind I guess because I put them too

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.260 
behind I guess because I put them too
close<00:04:46.420> together<00:04:46.950> but<00:04:47.950> there<00:04:48.880> you<00:04:48.940> have<00:04:49.000> it

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
close together but there you have it

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.990 
close together but there you have it
seems<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.720> be<00:04:49.810> working<00:04:50.110> fine<00:04:50.340> um<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.910> next

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
seems to be working fine um the next

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.020 
seems to be working fine um the next
video<00:04:52.330> I'll<00:04:52.390> post<00:04:52.630> I'll<00:04:52.960> use<00:04:53.170> um<00:04:53.700> hopefully<00:04:54.700> by

video I'll post I'll use um hopefully by

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.570 
video I'll post I'll use um hopefully by
then<00:04:55.210> my<00:04:55.420> the<00:04:56.380> my<00:04:56.980> new<00:04:57.190> arm

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
then my the my new arm

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.140 
then my the my new arm

I believe I ordered a 12 volt 21 amp um
scooter<00:05:06.100> battery<00:05:07.020> hopefully<00:05:08.020> they<00:05:08.140> come<00:05:08.320> in

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
scooter battery hopefully they come in

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.770 
scooter battery hopefully they come in
and<00:05:08.740> I<00:05:08.890> can<00:05:09.100> set<00:05:09.310> up<00:05:09.340> you<00:05:10.150> know<00:05:10.270> one<00:05:10.540> of<00:05:10.570> those

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
and I can set up you know one of those

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.350 
and I can set up you know one of those
do-it-yourself<00:05:11.230> power<00:05:11.950> packs<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.490> we'll<00:05:13.150> see

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
do-it-yourself power packs and we'll see

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.050 
do-it-yourself power packs and we'll see
which<00:05:13.860> performs<00:05:14.860> better<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.370> Vagabond<00:05:15.970> which

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
which performs better the Vagabond which

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.840 
which performs better the Vagabond which
is<00:05:16.210> a<00:05:16.240> 300<00:05:16.780> watt<00:05:16.960> inverter<00:05:17.080> or<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:18.130> samalex<00:05:18.520> I

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
is a 300 watt inverter or the samalex I

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:25.110 
is a 300 watt inverter or the samalex I
believe<00:05:19.750> it's<00:05:21.030> PFT<00:05:22.030> 60s<00:05:23.310> 12a<00:05:24.310> or<00:05:24.610> something

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
believe it's PFT 60s 12a or something

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.470 
believe it's PFT 60s 12a or something
it's<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:25.870> 600<00:05:26.320> Watts<00:05:26.730> so<00:05:27.730> we'll<00:05:28.180> see<00:05:28.330> how<00:05:28.420> that

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
it's a 600 Watts so we'll see how that

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.850 
it's a 600 Watts so we'll see how that
does<00:05:28.870> but<00:05:29.790> the<00:05:30.790> 500px<00:05:31.420> are<00:05:31.660> ice<00:05:31.780> they<00:05:32.680> work

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
does but the 500px are ice they work

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.630 
does but the 500px are ice they work
fine<00:05:33.100> with<00:05:33.130> them<00:05:33.580> for<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.210> back<00:05:34.330> one<00:05:34.570> -
