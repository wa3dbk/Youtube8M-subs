00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
America for about the same price it's

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.520

about<00:04:20.810> 40<00:04:21.739> 45<00:04:22.340> pounds<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:23.000> think<00:04:23.260> you<00:04:24.260> get<00:04:24.440> it

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
about 40 45 pounds I think you get it

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.350 
about 40 45 pounds I think you get it
from<00:04:24.620> markets<00:04:25.100> it's<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.520> exploding<00:04:26.150> one<00:04:26.240> so

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
from markets it's the exploding one so

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.390 
from markets it's the exploding one so
it's<00:04:26.480> not<00:04:26.570> an<00:04:26.660> action<00:04:26.930> replay<00:04:27.139> it's<00:04:27.830> exploded

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
it's not an action replay it's exploded

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.680 
it's not an action replay it's exploded
exploded<00:04:28.820> it's<00:04:28.940> still<00:04:29.150> pretty<00:04:29.330> good<00:04:29.630> I

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
exploded it's still pretty good I

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.629 
exploded it's still pretty good I
remember<00:04:30.139> using<00:04:30.320> actually<00:04:31.190> I<00:04:31.220> don't<00:04:31.310> think<00:04:31.490> I

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
remember using actually I don't think I

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.330 
remember using actually I don't think I
haven't<00:04:31.910> used<00:04:32.060> expert<00:04:32.510> or<00:04:32.630> cheats<00:04:32.900> but<00:04:33.800> they

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
haven't used expert or cheats but they

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.070 
haven't used expert or cheats but they
would<00:04:34.550> be<00:04:34.580> like<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:34.910> step<00:04:35.210> up<00:04:35.360> from<00:04:35.510> this<00:04:35.810> I

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
would be like a step up from this I

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.379 
would be like a step up from this I
think<00:04:36.680> because<00:04:36.950> it's<00:04:37.130> they're<00:04:37.730> still<00:04:38.030> selling

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
think because it's they're still selling

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.780 
think because it's they're still selling
yet<00:04:38.600> it's<00:04:38.960> not<00:04:39.139> used<00:04:39.590> this<00:04:39.800> brand<00:04:40.070> new<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:40.669> they

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
yet it's not used this brand new so they

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.690 
yet it's not used this brand new so they
should<00:04:41.000> have<00:04:41.150> cut<00:04:41.389> some<00:04:41.600> kind<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:42.139> like

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
should have cut some kind of like

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.010 
should have cut some kind of like
updates<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:44.060> stuff<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.480> that<00:04:44.600> so<00:04:44.720> if<00:04:44.840> any

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
updates and stuff of that so if any

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.200 
updates and stuff of that so if any
actually<00:04:45.440> I<00:04:45.590> just<00:04:45.919> want<00:04:46.160> to<00:04:46.220> ask<00:04:46.370> any<00:04:46.820> you<00:04:47.030> guys

I'm<00:05:04.250> gonna<00:05:04.400> try<00:05:04.639> on<00:05:04.700> my<00:05:04.880> Dell<00:05:05.090> computer

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
I'm gonna try on my Dell computer

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.930 
I'm gonna try on my Dell computer
because<00:05:05.840> that's<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.860> only<00:05:06.979> Windows<00:05:07.550> 7<00:05:07.820> or<00:05:07.910> the

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
because that's the only Windows 7 or the

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.150 
because that's the only Windows 7 or the
piece<00:05:08.240> you<00:05:08.510> have<00:05:08.570> apart<00:05:09.500> from<00:05:09.560> like<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:09.860> laptop

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
piece you have apart from like a laptop

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.860 
piece you have apart from like a laptop
but<00:05:10.550> that's<00:05:10.729> I'm<00:05:10.970> not<00:05:11.000> bothered<00:05:11.419> to<00:05:11.450> bring

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
but that's I'm not bothered to bring

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.480 
but that's I'm not bothered to bring
that<00:05:12.620> up<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:13.010> seriously<00:05:14.979> didn't<00:05:15.979> break<00:05:16.190> I<00:05:16.400> just

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
that up I seriously didn't break I just

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.700 
that up I seriously didn't break I just
drop<00:05:16.880> I<00:05:17.150> just<00:05:17.600> dropped<00:05:17.870> the

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
drop I just dropped the

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.980 
drop I just dropped the
thing<00:05:18.950> so<00:05:19.580> it<00:05:19.880> has<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.090> switch<00:05:20.479> up<00:05:20.660> here<00:05:20.840> and

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
thing so it has a switch up here and

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.110 
thing so it has a switch up here and
basically<00:05:21.500> what<00:05:22.010> it<00:05:22.130> does<00:05:22.340> is<00:05:22.550> you<00:05:22.580> have<00:05:22.880> your

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
basically what it does is you have your

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.060 
basically what it does is you have your
game<00:05:23.300> plugged<00:05:23.660> in<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.140> when<00:05:24.740> you<00:05:24.830> have<00:05:24.950> to

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
game plugged in and when you have to

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.980 
game plugged in and when you have to
switch<00:05:25.340> on<00:05:25.490> one<00:05:25.700> side<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:26.510> this<00:05:26.870> is<00:05:26.930> on<00:05:28.570> your<00:05:29.570> I

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
switch on one side so this is on your I

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.930 
switch on one side so this is on your I
cannot<00:05:30.830> figure<00:05:31.010> this<00:05:31.130> out<00:05:31.340> I'm<00:05:31.669> gonna<00:05:31.820> say

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
cannot figure this out I'm gonna say
