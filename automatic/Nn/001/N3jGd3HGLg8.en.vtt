00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
ordinary hug out to the side is

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.570 
ordinary hug out to the side is
virtually<00:00:13.559> impossible

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
virtually impossible

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.939 
virtually impossible
I<00:00:15.199> can't<00:00:16.199> straighten<00:00:16.560> oil<00:00:16.980> otherwise<00:00:17.460> all<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.330 

yes<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.260> still<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> slight<00:00:28.890> tremor<00:00:29.369> but

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
yes I still have a slight tremor but

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:40.030 
yes I still have a slight tremor but
voila

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:50.319 

you

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.770 

so<00:00:51.320> this<00:00:51.530> is<00:00:51.649> how<00:00:51.829> I<00:00:51.860> use<00:00:52.280> hands<00:00:52.670> steady<00:00:53.120> by

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
so this is how I use hands steady by

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.729 
so this is how I use hands steady by
using<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:55.309> handle<00:00:55.879> at<00:00:56.059> an<00:00:56.329> angle<00:00:56.809> you<00:00:57.170> can

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
using the handle at an angle you can

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.560 
using the handle at an angle you can
take<00:00:57.949> it<00:00:58.160> to<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.640> top<00:00:59.649> top<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:04.190> then<00:01:05.180> I<00:01:05.330> can

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
take it to the top top and then I can

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:19.460 
take it to the top top and then I can
carry<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.290> pump<00:01:06.680> into<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.250> other<00:01:07.490> room

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.039 
things that I find that the cup helps
with<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.250> I'm<00:03:15.459> all<00:03:15.640> so<00:03:16.180> diagnosed<00:03:16.780> with<00:03:17.019> a

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
with is that I'm all so diagnosed with a

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.660 
with is that I'm all so diagnosed with a
head<00:03:17.350> tremor<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.570> when<00:03:19.570> drinking<00:03:20.370> for<00:03:21.370> some

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
head tremor and when drinking for some

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.949 
head tremor and when drinking for some
reason<00:03:22.239> rather<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:23.070> affects<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.280> head<00:03:24.519> tremor

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
reason rather it affects a head tremor

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.020 
reason rather it affects a head tremor
so<00:03:25.959> with<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.440> hand<00:03:26.650> steady<00:03:27.040> carp<00:03:27.459> this<00:03:27.850> is

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
so with the hand steady carp this is

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.730 
so with the hand steady carp this is
also<00:03:28.419> beneficial

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.250
