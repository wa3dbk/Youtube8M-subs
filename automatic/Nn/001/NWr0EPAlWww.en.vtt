00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.900
 good to everyone commenting greetings very 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.390
 good from whom I want a new 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.490
 tutorial I'm in a tutorial of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.130
 how to download the brawn or this game 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.230
 what 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.440
 has played some youtubers already a little 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.200
 more or less important 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.640
 and that is quite interesting to see and 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.330
 of playing since you can see in 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.540
 cooperative and I 'm very interested in doing 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.550
 a tutorial of this so the first thing 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.960
 what we have to do is go to the link that 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.680
 I will leave you below in the description that 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.260
 It's mega Iran and I have downloaded the 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.280
 two things are two links when I already 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.680
 have downloaded will go where they have it 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.950
 I left it on the desk 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:04.089
 and we give right click to the first 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:07.359
 file that is what is called the round 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.840
 they will have to have the wing bar too 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.840
 works 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:16.630
 we give you right click extract here as 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:19.820
 always in most of your real 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.120
 this game can also be played online 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.979
 it was so precious it does not matter and that's what 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.510
 that I was very interested in this and I think 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.310
 that is most likely going to record 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.510
 on my channel 26 for now 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.880
 our robot upload my channel 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.890
 tutorials that I hope 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.229
 good when it has been extracted we will extract 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.430
 the next part or the crack that is 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.469
 to play online 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.600
 we give in extract in the drum if it is 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.750
 possible so that a folder is created there 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.850
 because they are separate files and it's a lot 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.009
 You better believe in a folder 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.439
 we give the third option with the three 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.259
 books now we go to the folder of 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.000
 download and good where they do not have 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.660
 I'm so cool 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.660
 we go 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.070
 brawn and paste here the folders 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.640
 you are not going to leave those things or 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.600
 they give you to copy and replace or here in 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.240
 this action for all conflicts 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.780
 who want to enter and they are going to 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.780
 stay like this 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.120
 now we open steam 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:30.260
 they will have to open steam they will open 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.480
 this land only there and open the body 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.810
 they are not going to observe and I have here the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.810
 fire 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.590
 and can enter anyone 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.710
 look for example right now I entered a 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.760
 lobby 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.760
 it's from a person 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.720
 wind 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.720
 i 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.360
 so that 's the whole tutorial for today 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.620
