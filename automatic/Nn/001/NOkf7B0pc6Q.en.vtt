just<00:00:39.660> makes<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.020> stronger<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> front<00:00:41.010> ends

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
just makes it stronger in the front ends

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.940 
just makes it stronger in the front ends
it's<00:00:42.270> kind<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.510> hard<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> explain<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.800> it

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it's kind of hard to explain but so it

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.470 
it's kind of hard to explain but so it
kind<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.190> did<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> picture<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.300> can

this chapter now when they went to 2012
they<00:03:03.000> also<00:03:03.180> went<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.950> new<00:03:04.950> design<00:03:05.579> for<00:03:05.850> the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
they also went to a new design for the

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.500 
they also went to a new design for the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
chain case they went away from the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.030 
chain case they went away from the
gearcase<00:03:09.510> design<00:03:10.140> they<00:03:10.590> went<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:10.950> the

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
wide on top so you have a narrower spot

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.820 
wide on top so you have a narrower spot
on<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.880> top<00:05:01.300> of<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.630> chassis<00:05:01.900> when<00:05:02.680> you're

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.500 
on the top of the chassis when you're
riding<00:05:03.010> so<00:05:03.340> your<00:05:03.460> legs<00:05:03.760> are<00:05:03.940> closer<00:05:04.240> together
