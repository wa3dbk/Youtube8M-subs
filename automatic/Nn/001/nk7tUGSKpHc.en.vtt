00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:06.580
 in the discoveries are organs and robotics in this new tutorial grabs photos 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.839
 prints. it 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:10.819
 talk the ways 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:11.880
 cutter 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.549
 little milk 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.549
 pharmacy detail among population 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:18.720
 distance 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.900
 this is our doing the original we decide to make a cutout by cutting 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.550
 for example 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.999
 Inventory of these flowers intervention only presence 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.999
 what we can do we can activate the cutter tool 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
 I advise you to use this method 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.650
 frame the whole image in this way we will have the populations of the file that 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.690
 generally they are the same proportions as print formats 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.850
 after which you place yourself on one of the corners 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 in this case I place myself with the mouse on the corner 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.110
 in the lower right you will see that the mouse is transformed and becomes the form 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.220
 of these two slanted darts 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.830
 attention now don't hold the shift key 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.710
 click on the handle and begin to drag 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.070
 as you can see by holding down the shift key and dragging it to me 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.120
 drag the population is maintained 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.930
 in my image 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.250
 ok i'm up here 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.250
 then I click inside my firecracker 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.860
 fan and I move 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.190
 my fan, as they prefer to place here, for example 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.480
 I decide to insert 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.700
 A little about yourself 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.750
 of articular life information of this adorable caserta position wii 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.450
 nell'angolino 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.160
 bottom right 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.200
 I always hold the shift key and move a little over the roof 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.250
 we have created our selection unit 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.080
 keeping the proportions of our file to confirm carving do 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.080
 Click here at the top of the sign 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.499
 there is only one covering to keep in mind during this work 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.649
 and now we'll see 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:15.289
 my cut by clicking on another symbol 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.620
 and see what this image from the image size looks like 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:28.219
 it is from a 3000 file for 2000 pixels first among the 6 megapixels 6 million pixels 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.979
 via the print resolution of 240 pixels per inch that the presumption 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:34.769
 of my printing machine 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.769
 mold a 23 30 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.459
 when I'm going to do my hobby Italy 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.519
 be careful because 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.519
 really 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.449
 when I with firm 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.319
 bxr of this file will no longer be 3000 for 2000 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.959
 the fact that size 38 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.249
 a good part of the 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.509
 images taken this image here 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.999
 now it is 1900 30 per 1002 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:14.459
 that 240 pixels per inch no longer allows me to print Mon 23 30 as 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.169
 first but be careful I will print 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.169
 maintaining the quality of the file. 13 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.670
 at most cooked to print a 15 for 22 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.999
 but not 23 34 because cutting out I went to remove the pics 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.409
 in the next tutorial we will see how 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.129
 find the print size 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.609
 maximum to carry out 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.489
 good job and see you soon from daniele robotti
