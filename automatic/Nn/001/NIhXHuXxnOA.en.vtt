00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.680

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.800
 Intro of the channel well 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.140
 let's start with the shooter tutorial and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.140
 it will be about how to install a map to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.450
 me craft 0.10 point 5 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.280
 many people think that this is very 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.770
 complicated but it really is not the most 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.470
 easy of the world so simple is not so 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.120
 complicated and the first thing that has to 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.620
 do is have a decompressed 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.730
 files I in this case I have the pse 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.730

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.730

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.110
 once it is open 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.720

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.850
 all right 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.570
 since they do not have and since they have it 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.390

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.780
