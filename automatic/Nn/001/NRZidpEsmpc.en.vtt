00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.890
 with the planetside 2 I have from mr 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.950
 strache demands but already 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:18.179
 knowledge and time 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:20.429
 stalking is very complete with tasting 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.429
 hot secret tip though on free-to-play 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:26.670
 but really reaches the first game 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.890
 really really interested 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.900
 if my spanier determine whether 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.140
 Imagine that up to 64 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.140
 square kilometer I think I was great 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.090
 big cards, so to speak 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.350
 on the two teams against each other 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.079
 fight and that 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.340
 really bad so really really big 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.990
 really bad 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.210
 the traders are always very much of it 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.220
 Unfortunately, it's not the big time 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.350
 to deal with it massively 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.390
 For example, you also appreciate the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.480
 Graphics can be a bit of something 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.520
 you can already see it 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.410
 huge buildings in addition to the graphics 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:11.080
 not so definitely prettier than 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.080
 For example, look around the house 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.740
 first there and now whet in action 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.100
 he did not just shoot 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.750
 who such a standard work can you 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.580
 somewhere buy cars and so a 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.259
 fucked already bought airplane 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.750
 but then I flew in somewhere 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.800
 because the mouse control was invested 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.360
 and then I can not do that at all 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.440
 bypass 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.490
 of course he is here so lackmann 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.070
 I think 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.120
 so 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.100
 Of course you do not go here now 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.380
 especially coordinated before 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.810
 I'll just look like that 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.090
 feels like play and that is crazy 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.130
 Shoot faster 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.070
 feels good shooter where that is 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.929
 feels less good but you have to 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.020
 also so board has three factions 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.500
 this game and over time 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.730
 depending on how you treat others 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.730
 bettels participates and 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.130
 he had just told loudly 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.060
 In any case, you can also do such a thing 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.000
 bit son to determine global war 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.500
 so 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.230
 hold bases or something 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.830
 horak 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.830
 fallen 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.209
 So it's the game because of it 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.370
 it in the usual one is that you do 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.260
 definitely should remember so i will 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.569
 In any case, look at it if it is 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.709
 outside is big shit is now 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.690
 however , it had two and a half minutes 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:50.010
 has to wait and the motto 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.950
 I am awesome weeks I can handle mine 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.190
 ladder should I can close the looks 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.450
 a little bit 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:02.480
 are you gay ? 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:04.910
 why else multiplayer shooter of the time 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.870
 I think that can be a city game 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.620
 So the first previews of it from 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.000
 newspapers then a bit 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.560
 could also play longer with 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.690
 Developer support the type of 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.160
 just at planetside 2 booth sat the 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.640
 man pretty much sitting on the bench 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.530
 but the teenies were all in there 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.780
 highest notes praise us for sparkle and 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.360
 when it comes to free to play so then 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.130
 so there's something paid to win or 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.630
 he wants to so that one says 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.100
 content that you buy it was quasi 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.450
 only faster but in principle they come 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.500
 all games had unlock 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.230
 just tell it to, but it looks 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.760
 honest which developer of one 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.440
 multiplayer shooter will be at the beginning 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.569
 go and say yes we have pager 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.700
 So I'm always so very 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.860
 be careful we are just seeing 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.510
 you can buy weapons, let's go 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.769
 are currently in the store is still no 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.960
 currency in it but more are weapons 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.020
 able to buy 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.550
 or instantly can usually attract 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.020
 the experts are the ones you can do right away 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.890
 he can theoretically unlock as well 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.890
 about level 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.670
 is always a question some games 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.780
 do not do any in personal matters either 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.170
 Great fan of I would rather have one 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.410
 normal horny game and then for and 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.490
 all the same but well now where we 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.590
 a lot of 3d effects very meanwhile packs 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.639
 sold where everything switched automatically 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:33.169
 Well, I just look 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:33.169
 somehow not tried again 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.009
 I can definitely buy you there 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:48.630
 munich here we go 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.920
 Horhausen 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.520
 somehow I collected before 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.520
 leads to 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.050
 I just really fully looked for no 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.289
 I have no idea how it happened here 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.550
 Spielberg says 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.550
 rather numbered fliers 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.380
 here so vettel 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.920
 problem is that I'm still pure 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.920
 I am healthy 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.450
 well so it can be heldt bridge 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.540
 not the best presentation of the game 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.910
 I have to admit 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.780
 but i would have that i believe it 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.620
 does 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.620
 I can say
