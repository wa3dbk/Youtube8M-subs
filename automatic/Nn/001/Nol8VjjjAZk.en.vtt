the<00:00:20.550> box<00:00:21.230> welcome<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.789> have<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.910> cut<00:00:24.150> them<00:00:25.189> have

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the box welcome in have to cut them have

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.209 
the box welcome in have to cut them have
to<00:00:26.310> cut<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> little<00:00:26.670> piece<00:00:26.820> off<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:31.219> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
to cut a little piece off of a the the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.080 
to cut a little piece off of a the the
grommet<00:00:33.290> fitting<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.410> there<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.340> part<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
grommet fitting in there so part in the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.979 
grommet fitting in there so part in the
engine<00:00:36.450> bay<00:00:37.280> where<00:00:38.280> has<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.730> has<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> little

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
engine bay where has the has a little

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.500 
engine bay where has the has a little
plug<00:00:41.120> this<00:00:42.120> goes<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.629> top<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:44.510> like

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
plug this goes on top like this like

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.180 
plug this goes on top like this like
that<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.050> that's<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.980> part<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> plug<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
that and that's a part of a plug so it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
that and that's a part of a plug so it
provided<00:00:50.520> they<00:00:50.850> provided<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.329> grommet<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.899> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
provided they provided a grommet with it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
provided they provided a grommet with it
so<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> cut<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.860> place<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> grameen

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
so I cut out this place so the grameen

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.439 
so I cut out this place so the grameen
can<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:55.199> plug<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.559> need<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> look<00:00:56.449> more

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
can go in that plug I need to look more

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:07.730 
can go in that plug I need to look more
like<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> om<00:00:58.530> fit<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.640> guys<00:00:59.820> know

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.890 

all<00:01:08.190> right<00:01:08.310> I'm<00:01:08.940> not<00:01:08.970> sure<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.510> guys<00:01:09.659> could

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
all right I'm not sure if you guys could

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.890 
all right I'm not sure if you guys could
see<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:11.450> that's<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.720> right<00:01:12.869> there

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
see it there that's it right there

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.320 
see it there that's it right there
that's<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.619> grommet<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.130> middle<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.640> cut

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that's the grommet in the middle I cut

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200 
that's the grommet in the middle I cut
it<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.510> so<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.750> could<00:01:15.869> fit<00:01:15.900> correctly<00:01:17.210> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it all so it could fit correctly the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:27.139 
it all so it could fit correctly the
vacuum<00:01:18.600> line<00:01:20.030> here<00:01:23.150> so<00:01:25.820> installed<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.970> Ross

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
vacuum line here so installed the Ross

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:34.310 
vacuum line here so installed the Ross
pod<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:33.180> we're<00:01:33.450> gonna<00:01:33.570> start<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.080> for<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
pod and we're gonna start it up for the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:59.420 
pod and we're gonna start it up for the
first<00:01:34.500> time<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.100> if<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.340> gauge<00:01:35.550> works

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.880 

as<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.120> guys<00:02:00.300> see<00:02:00.720> according<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.710> is

as you guys see according to this is
doing<00:02:02.130> -15<00:02:02.790> vacuum<00:02:03.770> see<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:04.860> good

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520
