in 1947 in July that there's plenty of
time<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.190> have<00:02:52.340> shot<00:02:52.700> down<00:02:52.940> that<00:02:53.360> then<00:02:53.570> the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
time to have shot down that then the

went over and went and walked the end of
the<00:03:02.000> craft<00:03:02.300> evidently<00:03:02.930> one<00:03:03.350> of<00:03:03.560> them<00:03:03.770> was<00:03:04.040> out

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
the craft evidently one of them was out

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.190 
the craft evidently one of them was out
walking<00:03:04.430> around<00:03:04.750> because<00:03:05.750> there<00:03:05.990> were<00:03:06.110> only

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
walking around because there were only

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.440 
walking around because there were only
three<00:03:06.680> when<00:03:06.920> he<00:03:06.980> was<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.490> three<00:03:07.940> aliens<00:03:08.270> at

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
three when he was in three aliens at

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.150 
three when he was in three aliens at
that<00:03:08.570> time<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:08.990> he<00:03:09.050> walked<00:03:09.590> in<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:09.980> they<00:03:10.100> were

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
that time and he walked in and they were

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.210 
that time and he walked in and they were
all<00:03:10.370> four<00:03:11.060> feet<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.600> under<00:03:11.990> but<00:03:12.590> he<00:03:12.740> could<00:03:12.920> see

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
all four feet and under but he could see

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.950 
all four feet and under but he could see
through<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:13.700> walls<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.270> graph<00:03:14.540> from<00:03:14.750> the
