okay<00:00:02.669> I<00:00:02.700> thought<00:00:03.179> I'd<00:00:03.330> show<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:04.020> demo<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:04.710> my

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
okay I thought I'd show a demo of my

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.270 
okay I thought I'd show a demo of my
muga<00:00:05.549> food<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:05.970> mirth<00:00:06.210> pedal<00:00:06.980> there<00:00:07.980> doesn't

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
muga food and mirth pedal there doesn't

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.400 
muga food and mirth pedal there doesn't
seem<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.519> be<00:00:08.610> many<00:00:08.820> good<00:00:09.059> demos<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:10.080> pedal

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
seem to be many good demos of that pedal

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.280 
seem to be many good demos of that pedal
with<00:00:10.710> guitar<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.370> YouTube<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.269> there's<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.990> few

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
with guitar on YouTube and there's a few

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.560 
with guitar on YouTube and there's a few
recorded<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.099> handheld<00:00:14.820> cameras<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.420> stuff

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
recorded on handheld cameras and stuff

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.710 
recorded on handheld cameras and stuff
like<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.870> but<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:17.400> way<00:00:17.490> I've<00:00:17.609> got<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.000> amps

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
like that but the way I've got the amps

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.040 
like that but the way I've got the amps
miked<00:00:18.960> up<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.470> stuff<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.820> much<00:00:21.689> better

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
miked up and stuff it's a much better

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:32.299 
miked up and stuff it's a much better
representation<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.250> how<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.519> sounds<00:00:31.160> the<00:00:32.160> way

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
representation of how it sounds the way

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.479 
representation of how it sounds the way
I<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.669> set<00:00:32.969> up<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:36.780> mix<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.489> quite

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
I have it set up is the mix is quite

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.330 
I have it set up is the mix is quite
quite<00:00:38.969> high<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.989> filters<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.710> take<00:00:40.980> over

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
quite high so the filters do take over

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.170 
quite high so the filters do take over
the<00:00:41.430> original<00:00:41.610> guitar<00:00:42.149> signal<00:00:43.879> but<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> don't

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the original guitar signal but I don't

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.010 
the original guitar signal but I don't
have<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.570> sort<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.559> choppy<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> steppy<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.020> have

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
have it sort of choppy and steppy I have

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.170 
have it sort of choppy and steppy I have
it<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.800> envelope<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.309> set<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> more

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it so the envelope is set to a more

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.450 
it so the envelope is set to a more
smooth<00:00:51.690> transition<00:00:52.379> between<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.800> filters<00:00:53.219> so

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
smooth transition between the filters so

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.720 
smooth transition between the filters so
it's<00:00:53.699> more<00:00:53.850> like<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> phaser<00:00:55.340> but<00:00:56.340> obviously

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it's more like a phaser but obviously

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.529 
it's more like a phaser but obviously
it's<00:00:57.329> cycling<00:00:57.629> through<00:00:58.430> frequencies<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.820> sort

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it's cycling through frequencies in sort

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:30.030 
it's cycling through frequencies in sort
of<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> strange<00:01:00.899> order<00:01:05.270> here<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.390> is

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.740 

what<00:01:31.040> that<00:01:31.220> would<00:01:31.370> sound<00:01:31.850> like<00:01:32.090> if<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.390> turn<00:01:32.630> the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
what that would sound like if I turn the

00:01:32.750 --> 00:02:16.630 
what that would sound like if I turn the
envelope<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.890> reason<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.220> don't<00:02:16.430> use<00:02:16.610> that

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
envelope the reason I don't use that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.360 
envelope the reason I don't use that
sound<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.480> because<00:02:18.110> obviously<00:02:18.410> it's<00:02:18.920> cycling

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
sound is because obviously it's cycling

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.670 
sound is because obviously it's cycling
through<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.880> certain<00:02:20.690> speed<00:02:21.020> which<00:02:21.050> is<00:02:21.320> set

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
through a certain speed which is set

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.460 
through a certain speed which is set
from<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.980> speed<00:02:22.220> knob<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.750> as<00:02:23.870> most<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.320> you

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
from the speed knob but as most of you

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.900 
from the speed knob but as most of you
who<00:02:24.650> have<00:02:24.739> played<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.980> drums<00:02:25.580> would<00:02:25.730> know

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
who have played the drums would know

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.360 
who have played the drums would know
that<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.390> drummer<00:02:26.989> keeping<00:02:27.709> in<00:02:27.800> time<00:02:28.010> with<00:02:28.070> an

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
that a drummer keeping in time with an

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.190 
that a drummer keeping in time with an
effects<00:02:28.700> pedal<00:02:28.760> it's<00:02:29.450> probably<00:02:29.870> not<00:02:30.020> going<00:02:30.140> to

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
effects pedal it's probably not going to

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.510 
effects pedal it's probably not going to
happen<00:02:30.320> because<00:02:30.709> then<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.070> know<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.310> can't

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
happen because then you know you can't

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.070 
happen because then you know you can't
make<00:02:31.670> eye<00:02:31.790> contact<00:02:32.209> with<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.390> pedal<00:02:32.690> can<00:02:32.840> you

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.560 

so<00:02:36.080> if<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.320> listen<00:02:36.650> I'll<00:02:37.239> cycle<00:02:38.239> up<00:02:38.330> through

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
so if you listen I'll cycle up through

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.370 
so if you listen I'll cycle up through
the<00:02:38.690> envelope<00:02:39.640> range<00:02:40.640> from<00:02:41.630> where<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.110> now

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
the envelope range from where it is now

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.130 
the envelope range from where it is now
and<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:43.100> all<00:02:43.280> kind<00:02:43.610> of<00:02:43.700> starts<00:02:44.209> smoothing<00:02:45.020> out

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
and it all kind of starts smoothing out

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.170 
and it all kind of starts smoothing out
and<00:02:45.410> then<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.070> and<00:02:46.370> then<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.580> kind<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.820> does<00:02:47.030> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and then it and then it kind of does the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.970 
and then it and then it kind of does the
opposite<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.540> how<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:47.900> now<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:48.560> it's<00:02:48.739> kind

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
opposite of how it is now so it's kind

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.360 
opposite of how it is now so it's kind
of<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.250> chopping<00:02:49.820> but<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:51.080> sounds<00:02:51.680> almost

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
of like chopping but it sounds almost

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.370 
of like chopping but it sounds almost
backwards<00:02:52.820> because<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:53.510> fading<00:02:53.959> into<00:02:54.170> the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
backwards because it's fading into the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:04.150 
backwards because it's fading into the
frequencies<00:02:54.950> rather<00:02:55.280> than<00:02:55.459> out<00:02:55.610> of<00:02:55.640> them<00:03:02.950> as<00:03:03.950> I

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
frequencies rather than out of them as I

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.100 
frequencies rather than out of them as I
use<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.489> freeze<00:03:05.000> pedal<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.540> demonstrate<00:03:05.959> this

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
use the freeze pedal to demonstrate this

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.540 
use the freeze pedal to demonstrate this
because<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.410> can<00:03:06.620> get<00:03:06.769> that<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:07.040> hold<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.310> chord

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
because I can get that to hold a chord

00:03:07.550 --> 00:04:06.120 
because I can get that to hold a chord
while<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:07.880> adjust<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.630> map

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.920 

obviously<00:04:07.130> that's<00:04:07.310> on<00:04:07.550> just<00:04:08.030> one<00:04:08.360> of<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.720> many

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
obviously that's on just one of the many

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.080 
obviously that's on just one of the many
patterns<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:09.830> I'll<00:04:10.430> show<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:10.760> how<00:04:10.940> it<00:04:11.030> sounds

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
patterns and I'll show you how it sounds

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.520 
patterns and I'll show you how it sounds
with<00:04:11.420> a<00:04:11.480> different<00:04:11.780> pattern<00:04:11.960> just<00:04:12.230> to<00:04:12.380> give

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
with a different pattern just to give

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.500 
with a different pattern just to give
you<00:04:12.620> an<00:04:12.680> example<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:14.210> limitless

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
you an example of the limitless

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:52.260 
you an example of the limitless
possibilities

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.020 

you<00:04:53.270> can<00:04:53.450> also<00:04:53.630> just<00:04:54.110> use<00:04:54.350> it<00:04:54.800> for<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.670> filters

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
you can also just use it for the filters

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.150 
you can also just use it for the filters
on<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.570> without<00:04:56.960> actually<00:04:57.710> cycling

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
on it and without actually cycling

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.620 
on it and without actually cycling
through<00:04:58.340> them<00:04:58.580> so<00:04:58.790> you<00:04:58.850> can<00:04:59.060> just<00:04:59.210> use<00:04:59.330> it<00:04:59.510> as

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
through them so you can just use it as

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.500 
through them so you can just use it as
like<00:04:59.810> an<00:04:59.990> EQ<00:05:00.490> well<00:05:01.490> quite<00:05:01.670> an<00:05:01.760> extremely<00:05:02.270> cube

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
like an EQ well quite an extremely cube

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.480 
like an EQ well quite an extremely cube
but<00:05:02.900> it<00:05:03.020> can<00:05:03.290> be<00:05:03.410> definitely<00:05:03.590> useful<00:05:04.250> for

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
but it can be definitely useful for

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:12.250 
but it can be definitely useful for
making<00:05:04.850> car<00:05:05.390> sounds<00:05:05.420> and<00:05:05.900> stuff<00:05:06.080> like<00:05:06.170> that<00:05:11.260> so

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
making car sounds and stuff like that so

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.700 
making car sounds and stuff like that so
you<00:05:12.320> have<00:05:12.560> your<00:05:12.680> eight<00:05:12.830> frequency<00:05:13.780> sliders
