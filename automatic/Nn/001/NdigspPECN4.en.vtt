00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.570
 earlier terrex today atlas the 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.059
 construction equipment manufacturer from ganderkesee 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.719
 has the wheel loader production from terrex 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.700
 accepted 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.669
 The kink handlebars come under the 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.619
 traditional names kÃ¤lble on the market that 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.710
 current wheel loader program includes four 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.980
 models with scoops from 16 to 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.930
 3,1 cubic meters of engines at 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.000
 These vehicles are used 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.649
 this is once the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.650
 perkins 4 4-liter with 74 5 kw 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.420
 which is used in the 160 at the 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.360
 We have the other three models 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 Cummins machines are 6.4 liters 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.000
 machine with 119 kw in it 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.400
 ventilation system is in these stores 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.370
 Next we pull the cooled one 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.130
 clean air behind the cabin and 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.780
 lead them backwards from the back 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.989
 means we have none 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.000
 Difficulties that dust and and 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.200
 other things in the ventilation system 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.479
 can get into it 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.659
 the armament system as such becomes 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.869
 then according to demand-controlled the 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.429
 means only if the ventilation required 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.380
 then the whole thing turns off 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.240
 accordingly , this affects 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.060
 the diesel consumption from we use 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.189
 at the high power store 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.600
 Computer system on the bigger machines 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.340
 this system allows the driver a lot 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.249
 sensitive area to work 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.670
 it is very close to a ls system and 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:39.079
 we also have the opportunity 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.810
 So saving energy is this fuel 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.609
 to save and the whole machine 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.700
 works very economically 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.079
 our main customer is the company terex with 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.319
 white her classic terrex 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.929
 furthermore, we still have the color 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.249
 blue as color for the kegler atlas 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.289
 leveraged appliances 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:59.179
 Of course the orange is too 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.859
 possible and all other ral 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.859
 shades are available 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.780
