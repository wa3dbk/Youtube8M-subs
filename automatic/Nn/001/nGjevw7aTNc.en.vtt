00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello where is the new design here 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.629
 I have a video for you about one 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.799
 airbrush design and explain step 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.050
 step by step what I did there 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.509
 First I start with the magnetics 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.309
 airbrush colors white and only spray 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.199
 in front the corner slightly 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.510
 So I do not do that much color 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.980
 because otherwise the whole situation is yes 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.109
 full 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.080
 Then I go with the make-up color 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:30.240
 purple on top of the other corner and 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.890
 do not wear light purple too 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.380
 a lot of color at once because otherwise 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.180
 the color swims on the nail and you 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.290
 Can not have a nice design you can 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.290
 to do everything again from the beginning 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 after knowing this and purple 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.660
 then you have applied the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.059
 black color of magnetic or halt 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.870
 another airbrush color and takes the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.690
 stencil it was 4065 from lenz he was 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.239
 melting point com and namely this 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.339
 leopards who are that there and carry 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.930
 yourself and take the template now alex 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.490
 the neatly on the market on it 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.700
 so that the design is everywhere, too 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.740
 and drink the template from the Sun 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.030
 just nowhere where the template is off 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.840
 that the color is not under me 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.840
 template is running 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.299
 Now I take that black and wear it 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.979
 is even on so they too 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.110
 not the color too much in one place 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.549
 is because then you will see that 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.140
 not really that great so you can see 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.829
 if you did not spray properly 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.490
 and even the sides evenly 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.929
 Give a little bit a bit more 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.319
 spray less than too much 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:47.929
 I worked the nail with the 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.600
 uv carbon lacquer by josephine in the 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.429
 color neon pink and then have four 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.470
 minutes to harden and have the 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.509
 Nail roughened and grown on the 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.080
 nail I'm doing the airbrush now 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.450
 design 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.579
 after we removed the template 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.310
 and sprayed the black finished 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.890
 you take from josephine the first 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.009
 edition studioline sealing skill 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.739
 and liberally seal the needle now 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.489
 Of course not too fat but one too 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.590
 not too thin 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.510
 So I think he will know what 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.970
 I mean we can not of course 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.160
 forget the nail on the front of the coat too 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.829
 so that the seal does not open 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.829
 or the nature nail also not from the 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:30.019
 gel replaces if you have the nail then 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:34.510
 completely sealed and also 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:39.290
 shrouded as I do now by 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:43.220
 right on the nail then he will for 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.840
 cured for four minutes and then becomes 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.880
 of course cleaned and that looks 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.109
 then look like this and the finished result 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.150
 you have here 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.470
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.470
 bye bye
