00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.930
 if the theology of prosperity is lost through this discourse 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.660
 you as pastors to said bank 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.980
 they have denounced these pastors that you know have that speech 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.950
 and that they use it to get rich 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.339
 That is a very good question 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.549
 about ten years ago we started locke 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.600
 what I would call a crusade against weightlifting prosperity 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.600
 pointing out the great evils that cause 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.519
 among them a distortion of the gospel message 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.760
 among them a materialist image of the church that people thought 

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:39.429
 pass in front of a Christian church 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.949
 I get in there because they're going to take out every last penny for up to two years 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.090
 and they are announcing it from citizens 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.440
 of a guti and here I speak because it is important to underline this your thanks to 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.180
 God, this space is given to me 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.480
 there is a huge 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.690
 a majority of men and women who are pastors 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.219
 not 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.139
 I think we're critical of this and we'll do it 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:05.489
 we have denounced it in the instances to which we belong 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.390
 the federation aidan shaw angelica acosta says 11 h 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.250
 this is a question that I do not hide that frustrates me 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.750
 because in one and who directed that the one of those who direct 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.479
 but I really believe that 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.390
 the Costa Rican evangelical alliance we would have more to do 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.030
 regarding this serious problem that has distorted the gospel of Christ 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 and the face of laws where necessary because yesterday 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.730
 just the story asked was suffering now anyone can put 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.020
 a church 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.170
 even one and studied 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.329
 someone who says pointed for god is a mystery to know that they are aware 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 because the ones that press the most for this kind of people 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.590
 do not put in 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.360
 any garage or church 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.450
 I think he the problem 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.410
 radical 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.180
 should be raised in this way talking about the theology of the 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.690
 prosperity 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.750
 starts by exploiting human need 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.920
 you are not 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.750
 your child is sick imagine that there is not any 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.550
 oo or you're in a bankruptcy situation in the second place take advantage 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.689
 the ignorance 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:12.909
 First 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.810
 the ignorance that may be in a person who handles incorrectly 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:22.250
 the same bible that is a warning to her so if you are going to use me 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.299
 he knows it well 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.679
 that uses the word of truth well 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.679
 and is and is driven by manipulation 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.409
 when someone wants to achieve something 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.340
 in correct improper way appealing to emotion 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.539
 the ignorance I'm talking about the worst of all 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:43.390
 because ignorance 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.369
 of the concepts of god 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.779
 who are 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:51.509
 so commonly in evangelical religious last name has Catholic surname there is 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.589
 a huge ignorance of what God expects 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.489
 of us in concepts eminently 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.219
 and purely biblical 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.949
 that ignorance is the worst of all and that's where I think 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.989
 what is our 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.169
 our greatest responsibility 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:12.639
 in we need to grow to develop and it is that people know now a cardona 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.749
 I have not been told what is done to prevent 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:17.839
 that anyone gets like that 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.119
 I think something like that 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.129
 there must be a record 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.690
 should demand text 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.979
 the academics 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:26.179
 I think so 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:27.420
 even though 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.890
 the people cutting experience 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.110
 not only evangelicals and note also Catholic I do not know if the 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.850
 titles are necessarily the only filter that guarantees that someone 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.349
 after going through here you will end up doing it well 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.489
 I believe that in effect 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.620
 the fact that in a country like Costa Rica 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.119
 There is a church 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:50.449
 the official 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:54.079
 and that all the other evangelical churches for example we have to 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.019
 shelter us give figures as 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.339
 as associations to be able to function 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.780
 the legally 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.140
 I believe that the time is approaching when a country like ours 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.639
 you need to make a whole regulation 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.359
 so that the effect 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.540
 a person 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.379
 that it's going to be a subject to function as a pastor 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.850
 we have to 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.989
 fill a series of requirements 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.959
 as organizations ares has unleashed 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.190
 of someone reading the law and the bill but 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.160
 for the moment of singing is happening now it's crap 10 years are 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.210
 giving the fight 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.610
 in ten years nothing has been done to filter this type of people 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.580
 I believe that 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.060
 up to where we 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.770
 where is our responsibility said I speak now strictly from the 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.540
 trench 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.430
 from a huge group shepherds 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.900
 that for a long time we have carried this we are for example in one in a 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.900
 meeting of the Costa Rican evangelical alliance 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:57.210
 we gave him a speech very similar to what we are talking about here 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.020
 i the decision of that one of that assembly 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.969
 of churches you can create a 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.439
 a document 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.219
 through which 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:11.189
 the way in which funds were raised in churches and in the middle 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:12.809
 Communication 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:17.939
 i was an arduous job for a long time it was this binary mind well 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.139
 but not just remarkable on paper 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.379
 and that is one of our great frustrations 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.529
 because we achieved some point 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.579
 a regulation of the fundraising mat explained balanced biblical 

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:34.490
 that does not hurt that is 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.199
 which is that the correct prudent is done but I do not know did not take Ecuador to the 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:39.860
 serene 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.860
 parents another one of those great things well I would expect more 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.710
 of those who are in charge of the Costa Rican evangelical alliance 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.770
 I say it like 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.999
 as a shepherd 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:51.350
 I would expect smaller ones 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.809
 he represents 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:56.630
 so that it is clear in the position for all the people that 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.710
 who attend church where they ask for money and in exchange for that 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.479
 fashion god 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.710
 miracles 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.819
 you said the money stays for humans 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:08.580
 I'm not in those little ones 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.120
 I think 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.300
 when we are talking 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.250
 d 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.710
 must seek God's favor 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.339
 there is 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:22.289
 treating god as if he were a rocola is offensive I give him a coin 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.969
 and time is going to sing what I want my singing 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:27.629
 he is in heaven whether anyone 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:30.809
 I implore to react generously 

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:32.639
 in your favor towards us 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.979
 but contrary a favor 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.979
 because pedro said one of the strongest sentences to a man named Simon 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.490
 the magician in the book of events 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.900
 yes he did not offer 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.869
 buy the holy spirit in exchange for money 

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:48.809
 and Pedro came back to see and said 

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.060
 that your money 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.699
 perish with you 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.860
 because you thought you can buy him goodbye 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.899
 its power 

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:59.039
 those same words continue to resonate for anyone 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.129
 who offers it or whoever wants to buy it 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:05.059
 thank you very much don ricardo we will be outstanding 

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:08.999
 we are going to be pending with this one very many thanks for having reasons 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:12.569
 You and your wife who are here present to the farms, we go to the 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:14.219
 pause the itea we come all
