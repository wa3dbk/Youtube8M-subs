00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.860 
I'm I could probably find some more but
let's<00:04:38.900> try<00:04:39.050> it<00:04:39.110> so<00:04:39.380> right-click<00:04:40.870> holding

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
let's try it so right-click holding

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.170 
let's try it so right-click holding
right<00:04:42.050> click<00:04:42.290> click<00:04:42.620> on<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.860> image<00:04:43.130> drop<00:04:44.030> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
right click click on the image drop the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.610 
right click click on the image drop the
painkillers<00:04:45.520> I'm<00:04:47.050> guessing<00:04:48.050> they<00:04:48.169> were<00:04:48.229> taken

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
painkillers I'm guessing they were taken

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.530 
painkillers I'm guessing they were taken
I<00:04:48.740> don't<00:04:48.949> think<00:04:49.010> anything<00:04:49.520> pops<00:04:50.030> up<00:04:50.300> when

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
I don't think anything pops up when

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.020 
I don't think anything pops up when
you're<00:04:50.690> using<00:04:50.870> painkillers<00:04:51.650> so<00:04:52.430> I'm<00:04:52.610> not<00:04:52.639> sure

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
you're using painkillers so I'm not sure

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.530 
you're using painkillers so I'm not sure
if<00:04:53.419> that<00:04:53.600> worked<00:04:54.199> I'm<00:04:55.000> guessing<00:04:56.000> so<00:04:56.240> because

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
if that worked I'm guessing so because

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.500 
if that worked I'm guessing so because
now<00:04:56.800> my<00:04:57.800> site<00:04:58.100> is<00:04:58.130> just<00:04:58.490> completely<00:04:58.639> normal

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
now my site is just completely normal

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.800 
now my site is just completely normal
I'm<00:05:00.910> guessing<00:05:01.910> this<00:05:02.030> works<00:05:02.330> with<00:05:02.510> things<00:05:02.690> like

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
I'm guessing this works with things like

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.529 
I'm guessing this works with things like
bandages<00:05:03.380> too<00:05:03.919> let's<00:05:04.340> just<00:05:04.550> try<00:05:04.940> it<00:05:04.970> drop<00:05:05.510> a

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
bandages too let's just try it drop a

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.279 
bandages too let's just try it drop a
bandage<00:05:06.139> bandage<00:05:06.620> myself<00:05:07.039> he<00:05:08.030> loves<00:05:08.330> ya<00:05:08.810> see

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
bandage bandage myself he loves ya see

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.830 
bandage bandage myself he loves ya see
but<00:05:10.190> bandaging<00:05:10.669> yourself<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.449> bandage

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
but bandaging yourself and the bandage

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.420 
but bandaging yourself and the bandage
is<00:05:12.020> still<00:05:12.350> on<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.530> floor<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.070> I'm<00:05:13.160> guessing

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
is still on the floor so I'm guessing

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.930 
is still on the floor so I'm guessing
that<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.880> painkillers<00:05:14.479> works<00:05:14.720> um<00:05:15.940> things

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
that the painkillers works um things

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.120 
that the painkillers works um things
like<00:05:17.150> blood<00:05:17.449> bags<00:05:17.720> obviously<00:05:18.470> won't<00:05:18.770> work

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
like blood bags obviously won't work

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.040 
like blood bags obviously won't work
because<00:05:19.820> those<00:05:20.180> are<00:05:20.419> things<00:05:20.600> that<00:05:20.780> you<00:05:20.870> have

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
because those are things that you have

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.170 
because those are things that you have
to<00:05:21.110> actually<00:05:21.380> go<00:05:21.800> up<00:05:21.830> someone<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.400> use<00:05:22.639> but

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
to actually go up someone and use but

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.150 
to actually go up someone and use but

these this one is more expensive and

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.939 
these this one is more expensive and
I've<00:05:58.280> looked<00:05:58.430> on<00:05:58.610> the<00:05:58.639> mega<00:05:58.880> hurt<00:05:59.090> and<00:05:59.360> I'm

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
I've looked on the mega hurt and I'm

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.010 
I've looked on the mega hurt and I'm
sure<00:06:00.949> that<00:06:01.639> the<00:06:01.729> normal<00:06:02.060> one<00:06:02.240> is<00:06:02.360> 1<00:06:02.660> gigahertz

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
sure that the normal one is 1 gigahertz

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.520 
sure that the normal one is 1 gigahertz
and<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:04.460> azuz<00:06:04.849> one<00:06:05.180> so<00:06:05.510> the<00:06:05.690> superclocked<00:06:06.229> 1

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
and the azuz one so the superclocked 1

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.620 
and the azuz one so the superclocked 1
is<00:06:06.800> 1<00:06:07.490> gigahertz<00:06:07.789> and<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:08.300> su<00:06:08.570> chuan<00:06:08.630> is<00:06:09.400> 1.2

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
is 1 gigahertz and the su chuan is 1.2

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.300 
is 1 gigahertz and the su chuan is 1.2
