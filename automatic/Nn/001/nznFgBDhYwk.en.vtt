00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
one shot are you doing that way and you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.010 
one shot are you doing that way and you
kill<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.410> off<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.649> net<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:19.920> play<00:01:20.100> ready<00:01:21.020> okay

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
then it can be hit but because a shuttle

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.480 
then it can be hit but because a shuttle
moves<00:01:24.360> off<00:01:25.160> now<00:01:26.160> but<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:28.050> way<00:01:28.500> yeah

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
moves off now but if I do that way yeah

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.090 
moves off now but if I do that way yeah
it's<00:01:29.790> difficult<00:01:30.060> kill<00:01:30.570> thread<00:01:30.869> kill<00:01:31.170> it's

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
it's difficult kill thread kill it's

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.460 
it's difficult kill thread kill it's
difficult<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.670> kill<00:01:33.050> so<00:01:34.050> flat<00:01:35.000> can<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.149> used

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
difficult to kill so flat can be used

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:45.919 
difficult to kill so flat can be used
for<00:01:37.470> jobs<00:01:38.690> now<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.850> single<00:01:43.789> specialized<00:01:44.929> that

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
for jobs now the single specialized that

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.219 
for jobs now the single specialized that
plane<00:01:46.700> because<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> single<00:01:48.119> operand<00:01:48.780> isn't

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
plane because the single operand isn't

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.169 
plane because the single operand isn't
it<00:01:49.319> will<00:01:49.440> be<00:01:49.560> far<00:01:49.860> less<00:01:50.520> they<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.970> prove

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
it will be far less they have to prove

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.499 
it will be far less they have to prove
short<00:01:52.100> even<00:01:53.100> if<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.429> hit<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.880> little<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.270> high

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
short even if you hit the little be high

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.050 
short even if you hit the little be high
because<00:01:55.500> he<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.950> our<00:01:56.220> way

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
because he is our way

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
because he is our way
particular<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:58.619> better<00:01:59.000> singers<00:02:00.049> go<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
particular it's better singers go a

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.950 
particular it's better singers go a
little<00:02:01.290> bit<00:02:01.530> high<00:02:01.729> but<00:02:02.729> shuttle<00:02:03.060> go<00:02:03.210> Steve

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
little bit high but shuttle go Steve

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.620 
little bit high but shuttle go Steve
okay<00:02:04.590> heavily<00:02:04.940> this<00:02:05.940> is<00:02:06.150> I<00:02:06.509> call<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.890> signal

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
okay heavily this is I call it signal

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:17.830 
okay heavily this is I call it signal
let's<00:02:09.630> play<00:02:09.899> by<00:02:10.770> hand<00:02:16.040> watch<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.280> shuttle<00:02:17.430> fly

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
let's play by hand watch the shuttle fly

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.050 
let's play by hand watch the shuttle fly
here<00:02:18.840> there<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:20.280> shuttle<00:02:20.489> goes<00:02:20.730> straight

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
here there and the shuttle goes straight

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.910 
here there and the shuttle goes straight
down<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.700> instead<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.660> hit<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.200> way<00:02:25.380> you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
down so instead of a hit that way you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.810 
down so instead of a hit that way you
get<00:02:26.250> up<00:02:26.489> here<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.989> shuttle<00:02:28.200> goes<00:02:28.470> down

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
get up here and the shuttle goes down

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.430 
get up here and the shuttle goes down
now<00:02:29.820> have<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.060> look<00:02:30.239> Tom<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.840> do<00:02:30.989> take<00:02:31.709> racket

forgive me over them do that I will do
the<00:02:41.519> single<00:02:41.880> net<00:02:42.060> try<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.080> lift<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.560> tricks<00:02:44.569> look

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
the single net try to lift a tricks look

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:55.040 
the single net try to lift a tricks look
so<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.410> do<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:48.830> okay<00:02:51.620> okay<00:02:53.000> yeah<00:02:54.000> even<00:02:54.840> they

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
so I do that okay okay yeah even they

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.460 
so I do that okay okay yeah even they
try<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.500> lift<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.400> can<00:02:56.730> go<00:02:56.970> further<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.440> you

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
try to lift it you can go further so you

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.920 
try to lift it you can go further so you
who<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.720> kick<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.920> don't<00:03:02.160> use<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.930> when

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
who can kick but don't use it when

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.030 
who can kick but don't use it when
opponent<00:03:04.829> is<00:03:04.980> doing<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.440> if<00:03:07.890> you

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
opponent is doing that that and if you

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.030 
opponent is doing that that and if you
do<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.430> shot<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:09.390> can<00:03:09.660> be<00:03:09.780> killed<00:03:10.079> like<00:03:10.320> that

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
do this shot it can be killed like that

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.179 
do this shot it can be killed like that
so<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:11.670> do<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.000> I

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
so you do that I

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.119 
so you do that I
you<00:03:15.189> use<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.670> technique<00:03:16.379> when<00:03:17.379> the

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
you use this technique when the

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:31.649 
you use this technique when the
structure<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:20.230> then<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.590> can<00:03:20.860> do<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:30.659> so

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
structure and then you can do that so

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.809 
structure and then you can do that so
that<00:03:31.900> is<00:03:32.230> for<00:03:33.269> single<00:03:34.269> net<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.310> shook<00:03:36.640> you

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
that is for single net so I shook you

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.020 
that is for single net so I shook you
three<00:03:37.090> no<00:03:37.540> man<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:38.459> net<00:03:39.459> shot<00:03:39.849> for<00:03:40.290> SS<00:03:41.290> flat

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
three no man that net shot for SS flat

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.629
