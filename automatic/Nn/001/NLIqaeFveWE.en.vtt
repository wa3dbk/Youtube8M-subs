you this depth and you only get that the
first<00:01:08.899> thing<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:09.289> use<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:09.470> sherry<00:01:09.770> cask<00:01:10.070> and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250

first thing we use a sherry cask and
these<00:01:10.399> are<00:01:10.520> expensive<00:01:11.000> casks<00:01:11.509> and<00:01:11.660> it<00:01:12.289> really

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
these are expensive casks and it really

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.340 
these are expensive casks and it really
captures<00:01:12.979> it<00:01:13.100> here<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.490> eighteen<00:01:14.350> and

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
captures it here in the eighteen and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.900 
captures it here in the eighteen and
then<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.560> most<00:01:16.009> tremendous<00:01:16.280> of<00:01:16.550> rich<00:01:16.729> it

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
then the most tremendous of rich it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.370 
then the most tremendous of rich it
really<00:01:17.390> fills<00:01:17.660> the<00:01:17.810> mouth<00:01:17.929> it<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.200> be<00:01:18.320> eight

really fills the mouth it to be eight
quarts<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:20.890> apples<00:01:21.890> again<00:01:22.039> maltiness<00:01:23.439> you're

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
quarts it apples again maltiness you're

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.020 
quarts it apples again maltiness you're
certainly<00:01:24.770> drier<00:01:25.159> we're<00:01:25.490> certainly<00:01:25.700> moving

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
certainly drier we're certainly moving

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.539 
certainly drier we're certainly moving
into<00:01:26.270> drier<00:01:26.540> but<00:01:27.229> by<00:01:27.350> no<00:01:27.409> means<00:01:27.560> is<00:01:28.009> astringent

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
into drier but by no means is astringent

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.460 
into drier but by no means is astringent
it<00:01:28.939> still<00:01:29.390> got<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.689> freshness<00:01:30.110> which

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
it still got that freshness which

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.109 
it still got that freshness which
wonderfully<00:01:31.009> balanced<00:01:31.310> is<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.610> it's<00:01:31.970> like<00:01:32.090> a

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
wonderfully balanced is it it's like a

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.910 
wonderfully balanced is it it's like a
slightly<00:01:32.509> spice<00:01:32.900> struggle<00:01:33.380> its<00:01:33.560> superable

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
slightly spice struggle its superable

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.039 
slightly spice struggle its superable
I'm<00:01:36.920> sure<00:01:37.100> we<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.520> splash<00:01:38.450> of<00:01:38.540> water<00:01:38.659> in<00:01:38.899> there

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
I'm sure we a splash of water in there

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.100 
I'm sure we a splash of water in there
see<00:01:39.229> what<00:01:39.320> happens<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:40.509> don't<00:01:41.509> want<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:41.750> drone<00:01:41.930> a

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
see what happens I don't want a drone a

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.719 
see what happens I don't want a drone a
butter<00:01:42.500> knife<00:01:42.530> in<00:01:42.799> for<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.100> open<00:01:43.130> up<00:01:43.369> John

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.340 

we're<00:01:48.299> getting<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> bit<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> separation<00:01:49.020> then

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
we're getting a bit of separation then

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.929 
we're getting a bit of separation then
they're<00:01:49.560> definitely<00:01:50.100> getting<00:01:50.400> separation

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
they're definitely getting separation

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.420 
they're definitely getting separation
touch'<00:01:51.390> haze<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:52.020> well<00:01:52.229> again<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.280> quite

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
cold in here that's given some good sign

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.410 
cold in here that's given some good sign
of<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.250> body<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.790> amount<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.060> oils

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420

within this whisky and the water is

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.980 
within this whisky and the water is
bringing<00:02:00.750> back<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.680> extremis<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.640> was

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
distillation that was that slow

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.510 
distillation that was that slow
distillation<00:02:07.049> putting<00:02:07.799> your<00:02:07.920> sweet<00:02:08.190> Airy

flavors<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.000> they<00:02:09.179> believed<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.050> cask<00:02:10.289> for

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
flavors and they believed in a cask for

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.110 
flavors and they believed in a cask for
18<00:02:10.860> years<00:02:11.220> or<00:02:11.370> even<00:02:11.400> longer

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
18 years or even longer

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.729 
18 years or even longer
we<00:02:12.540> had<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.660> splash<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:13.110> water<00:02:13.290> I'm<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
we had a splash of water I'm a

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.990 
we had a splash of water I'm a
write-back<00:02:14.100> than<00:02:14.310> they<00:02:14.400> ever<00:02:14.519> started

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
write-back than they ever started

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.820 
write-back than they ever started
definitely<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.140> temperatures<00:02:16.650> in

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
definitely because the temperatures in

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.009 
definitely because the temperatures in
Scotland<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.370> not<00:02:17.550> too<00:02:17.700> warm<00:02:18.090> these<00:02:18.540> esters

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
Scotland is not too warm these esters

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.259 
Scotland is not too warm these esters

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
and hauk temperatures no it's cold so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.580 
and hauk temperatures no it's cold so
they<00:02:23.790> stay<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.239> cask<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.840> evolved<00:02:25.410> they

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
they stay in the cask be evolved they

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.690 
they stay in the cask be evolved they
become<00:02:25.860> bigger<00:02:26.069> they've<00:02:26.340> become<00:02:26.459> more
