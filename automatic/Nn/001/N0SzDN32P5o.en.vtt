super sensitive area that can get really

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.800 
super sensitive area that can get really
cakey<00:04:28.620> quickly<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:29.550> just<00:04:29.970> think<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.780> I

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
cakey quickly I just think that I

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.540 
cakey quickly I just think that I
noticed<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.590> feel<00:04:31.800> like<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:32.070> just<00:04:32.250> kind<00:04:32.490> of

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
noticed so I feel like that just kind of

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.400 
noticed so I feel like that just kind of
gets<00:04:32.700> rid<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.330> lines<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.140> have

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
gets rid of the lines that I have

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.230 
gets rid of the lines that I have
naturally<00:04:34.650> like<00:04:35.160> not<00:04:35.430> completely<00:04:35.970> but<00:04:36.150> it

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
naturally like not completely but it

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.270 
naturally like not completely but it
does<00:04:36.390> floor<00:04:36.690> them<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:36.930> little<00:04:37.200> bit<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.620> am

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280

here<00:04:46.590> I<00:04:47.040> think<00:04:47.370> for<00:04:47.640> me<00:04:47.810> on<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:49.080> daily<00:04:49.260> basis

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
here I think for me on a daily basis

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.260 
here I think for me on a daily basis
this<00:04:50.100> would<00:04:50.310> be<00:04:50.430> just<00:04:50.730> fine

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
this would be just fine

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.570 
this would be just fine
but<00:04:51.720> he<00:04:51.960> does<00:04:52.110> say<00:04:52.320> then<00:04:52.470> after<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:52.980> translucent

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
but he does say then after a translucent

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.400 
but he does say then after a translucent
powder<00:04:53.610> he'll<00:04:54.000> set<00:04:54.180> it<00:04:54.300> one<00:04:54.510> more<00:04:54.720> time<00:04:54.930> with

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
powder he'll set it one more time with

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.740 
powder he'll set it one more time with
just<00:04:55.770> like<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.920> full<00:04:56.190> coverage<00:04:56.430> powder<00:04:56.820> so<00:04:57.480> I'm
