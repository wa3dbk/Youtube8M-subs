game deleting

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.100 
game deleting
this<00:02:17.760> reason<00:02:18.270> being<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.960> only

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
this reason being because it only

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.620 
this reason being because it only
deletes<00:02:19.560> 1%<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.430> saved<00:02:20.700> games<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.510> they

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
deletes 1% of saved games so they

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.510 
deletes 1% of saved games so they

right let's start with the game could be

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.040 
right let's start with the game could be
very<00:05:44.280> very<00:05:44.460> cool<00:05:44.820> because<00:05:45.090> then<00:05:45.270> they<00:05:45.660> can<00:05:45.690> put

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
very very cool because then they can put

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.440 
very very cool because then they can put
things<00:05:46.290> inside<00:05:46.500> of<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.100> game<00:05:47.310> that<00:05:47.940> play<00:05:48.210> into

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
things inside of the game that play into

things inside of the game that play into
that<00:05:48.690> lag<00:05:49.020> wat<00:05:49.260> Dodger<00:05:49.500> what<00:05:49.830> sorts<00:05:50.190> of<00:05:50.280> things

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
that lag wat Dodger what sorts of things

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.980 
that lag wat Dodger what sorts of things
could<00:05:50.730> be<00:05:50.790> different<00:05:51.060> I<00:05:51.450> don't<00:05:51.660> know<00:05:51.750> I

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
their base frame is going to be and then

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.670 
their base frame is going to be and then
how<00:05:59.910> they<00:06:00.090> make<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.420> game<00:06:00.660> I<00:06:00.840> feel<00:06:01.260> like<00:06:01.470> I
