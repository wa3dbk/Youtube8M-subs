00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640 

you<00:00:00.120> know<00:00:00.329> what<00:00:00.659> I'd<00:00:00.750> like<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.960> do<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.350> talk<00:00:01.589> a

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
you know what I'd like to do is talk a

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.409 
you know what I'd like to do is talk a
little<00:00:01.890> bit<00:00:02.070> about<00:00:02.100> my<00:00:02.490> concept<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.240> fly

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
little bit about my concept of fly

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.039 
little bit about my concept of fly
casting<00:00:04.069> which<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.339> quite<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.270> bit<00:00:06.569> different

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
casting which is quite a bit different

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.890 
casting which is quite a bit different
from<00:00:07.109> what<00:00:07.200> most<00:00:07.649> people<00:00:08.010> teach<00:00:08.690> the<00:00:09.690> first

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
from what most people teach the first

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.330 
from what most people teach the first
thing<00:00:10.050> I'd<00:00:10.139> like<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.290> point<00:00:10.440> out<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.130> don't

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
thing I'd like to point out is you don't

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.930 
thing I'd like to point out is you don't
cast<00:00:11.580> fly<00:00:11.910> lines<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.960> know<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.889> say<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:14.670> but

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
cast fly lines I know we say we do but

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.709 
cast fly lines I know we say we do but
you<00:00:15.120> don't

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
you don't

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.910 
you don't
you<00:00:16.350> can't<00:00:16.680> lure<00:00:17.070> x'<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.970> can't<00:00:18.270> bake<00:00:18.920> but

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
you can't lure x' and you can't bake but

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.700 
you can't lure x' and you can't bake but
you<00:00:20.130> unroll<00:00:20.730> fly<00:00:21.270> lines<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.140> when<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.410> stop

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
you unroll fly lines so when you stop

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.210 
you unroll fly lines so when you stop
this<00:00:22.949> rod<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:24.150> line<00:00:24.510> actually<00:00:24.930> unrolls<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
this rod this line actually unrolls to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.980 
this rod this line actually unrolls to
the<00:00:26.340> target<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.390> don't<00:00:27.599> cast<00:00:28.019> lot<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.680> fact

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
the target you don't cast lot in fact

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.269 
the target you don't cast lot in fact
for<00:00:30.990> many<00:00:31.170> people<00:00:31.679> who<00:00:31.830> think<00:00:32.130> they're

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
for many people who think they're

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.459 
for many people who think they're
casting<00:00:32.790> lines<00:00:33.059> or<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> tendency<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.930> punch

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
casting lines or the tendency to punch

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.110 
casting lines or the tendency to punch
the<00:00:34.739> line<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.340> all<00:00:35.489> kind<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.850> shock

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the line and you get all kind of shock

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.569 
the line and you get all kind of shock
waves<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.680> think<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.250> you're

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
waves in it if you think that you're

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.209 
waves in it if you think that you're
actually<00:00:38.790> unrolling<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.989> line<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.980> line

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
actually unrolling this line the line

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.139 
actually unrolling this line the line
goes<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.910> much<00:00:41.940> smoother<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.350> much<00:00:43.590> easier

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
goes so much smoother and so much easier

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.479 
goes so much smoother and so much easier
but<00:00:45.149> there's<00:00:45.420> other<00:00:45.719> reasons<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:47.010> thinking

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
but there's other reasons for thinking

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.130 
but there's other reasons for thinking
about<00:00:47.719> understanding<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.780> you're

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
about understanding that you're

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.510 
about understanding that you're
unrolling<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.100> line<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.530> I'm<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> them

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
unrolling the line and I'm one of them

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.510 
unrolling the line and I'm one of them
is<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.270> make<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:55.050> big<00:00:55.350> loop<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:56.489> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
is this if you make a big loop like that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.720 
is this if you make a big loop like that
or<00:00:57.120> out<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> side<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.949> reason<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.460> line

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
or out to the side the reason that line

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.020 
or out to the side the reason that line
didn't<00:01:00.149> go<00:01:00.329> anywhere<00:01:00.710> is<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.670> you

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
didn't go anywhere is because as you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.390 
didn't go anywhere is because as you
winter<00:01:03.359> made<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.409> made<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.650> line<00:01:05.070> go

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
winter made that you made that line go

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.429 
winter made that you made that line go
around<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.790> circle<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.540> actually<00:01:06.869> took

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
around a circle so you actually took

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.410 
around a circle so you actually took
your<00:01:07.740> energy<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.310> dissipate<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> around<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
your energy and dissipate it around a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.810 
your energy and dissipate it around a
circle<00:01:09.869> also<00:01:11.420> you're<00:01:12.420> throwing<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.930> line

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
circle also you're throwing that line

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.910 
circle also you're throwing that line
against<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> air<00:01:15.119> well<00:01:16.020> people<00:01:16.290> think<00:01:16.619> air

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
against the air well people think air

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
against the air well people think air
don't<00:01:17.280> make<00:01:17.700> any<00:01:18.000> difference<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.869> it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
don't make any difference but when it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
don't make any difference but when it
blows<00:01:19.200> towards<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:19.979> wind<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.640> does

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
blows towards you it's wind so it does

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.450 
blows towards you it's wind so it does
make<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.390> difference<00:01:21.619> but<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:22.799> we<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.189> throw<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
make a difference but if we can throw a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.820 
make a difference but if we can throw a
smaller<00:01:24.000> tighter<00:01:24.570> loop<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.290> what

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
smaller tighter loop like this what

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.010 
smaller tighter loop like this what
you're<00:01:26.009> doing<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.580> throwing<00:01:26.790> less<00:01:27.689> line

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
you're doing is throwing less line

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.469 
you're doing is throwing less line
through<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> air<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.189> you're<00:01:29.820> directing

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
through the air and you're directing

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.210 
through the air and you're directing
your<00:01:30.509> energy<00:01:31.110> straight<00:01:31.530> back<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.159> straight

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
your energy straight back and straight

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.609 
your energy straight back and straight
to<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.850> target<00:01:33.079> another<00:01:34.079> thing<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
to the target another thing I like to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.399 
to the target another thing I like to
point<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:36.270> 83<00:01:36.600> years<00:01:36.840> old<00:01:37.200> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
point out that it I'm 83 years old I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.380 
point out that it I'm 83 years old I
ain't<00:01:37.530> got<00:01:37.650> no<00:01:37.799> power<00:01:38.100> left<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.119> does

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
ain't got no power left and this does

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.710 
ain't got no power left and this does
not<00:01:39.570> require<00:01:39.869> power<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.890> any<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.970> ladies<00:01:42.420> can

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
not require power so any you ladies can

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.200 
not require power so any you ladies can
cast<00:01:43.020> well<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.890> fact<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.430> teach<00:01:44.610> any<00:01:44.850> woman

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.759 
emphasize the first thing is that you
have<00:02:19.299> rotator<00:02:20.299> cuffs<00:02:20.749> up<00:02:21.049> here<00:02:21.349> which<00:02:21.590> are

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
have rotator cuffs up here which are

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.149 
have rotator cuffs up here which are
attached<00:02:22.129> to<00:02:22.430> your<00:02:22.639> forearm<00:02:23.329> up<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.659> your<00:02:23.780> of

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
your clavicle can't remember name up but

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.640 
your clavicle can't remember name up but
anyway<00:02:28.159> when<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.239> go<00:02:29.359> up<00:02:29.450> like<00:02:29.629> this<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.319> down

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
anyway when you go up like this and down

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.979 
anyway when you go up like this and down
like<00:02:30.889> this<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.189> pull<00:02:31.760> up<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.359> down<00:02:32.540> on<00:02:32.780> these

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
like this you pull up and down on these

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.839 
like this you pull up and down on these
and<00:02:33.379> that's<00:02:33.590> what<00:02:33.829> causes<00:02:34.129> torn<00:02:34.670> rotator

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
and that's what causes torn rotator

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.289 
and that's what causes torn rotator
cuffs<00:02:35.450> if<00:02:36.409> we<00:02:36.739> could<00:02:36.950> cast<00:02:37.250> in<00:02:37.579> a<00:02:37.670> way<00:02:37.849> that<00:02:38.180> we

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
cuffs if we could cast in a way that we

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.490 
cuffs if we could cast in a way that we
did<00:02:38.540> not<00:02:38.689> move

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
did not move

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.489 
did not move
up<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.159> down<00:02:40.730> if<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.719> could<00:02:41.870> cast<00:02:42.109> so<00:02:42.349> we

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:42.499 
up and down if we could cast so we

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.949 
up and down if we could cast so we
didn't<00:02:42.769> stress<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.669> also<00:02:44.299> people<00:02:44.599> catch

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
didn't stress that and also people catch

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.080 
didn't stress that and also people catch
with<00:02:45.200> their<00:02:45.379> wrists<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.980> if<00:02:46.519> you<00:02:46.639> put<00:02:46.939> your

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
you're pulling on these tendons attached

and go up and down you tend first of all

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.420 
and go up and down you tend first of all
if<00:03:00.169> you're<00:03:00.260> gonna<00:03:00.409> use<00:03:00.560> heavy<00:03:00.829> tackle<00:03:01.189> you're

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.110 
gonna end up with a torn rotator cuff
and<00:03:03.319> then<00:03:03.889> if<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.099> use<00:03:04.129> your<00:03:04.489> wrist<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.909> lot

and then if you use your wrist a lot

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.659 
and then if you use your wrist a lot
you're<00:03:05.810> gonna<00:03:06.019> end<00:03:06.319> up<00:03:06.439> with<00:03:06.500> tennis<00:03:06.949> elbow<00:03:07.159> if

you're gonna end up with tennis elbow if
we<00:03:08.090> eliminate<00:03:08.599> it<00:03:08.629> those<00:03:08.900> two<00:03:09.109> problems<00:03:09.469> then

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
we eliminate it those two problems then

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.189 
we eliminate it those two problems then
you<00:03:10.430> can<00:03:10.730> cast<00:03:10.969> better<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.689> other<00:03:11.870> thing

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:12.199 
you can cast better the other thing

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.610 
you can cast better the other thing
wrong<00:03:12.469> with<00:03:12.739> casting<00:03:13.459> just<00:03:13.760> this<00:03:14.030> way<00:03:14.299> is<00:03:15.199> only

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
wrong with casting just this way is only

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.059 
wrong with casting just this way is only
strong<00:03:16.219> people<00:03:16.849> can<00:03:17.120> use<00:03:17.299> big<00:03:17.659> tackle<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.829> we

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
strong people can use big tackle so we

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.129 
strong people can use big tackle so we
automatically<00:03:19.759> eliminate<00:03:20.269> most<00:03:20.509> women<00:03:20.959> from

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
automatically eliminate most women from

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.740 
automatically eliminate most women from
casting<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:21.889> most<00:03:22.250> children<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:22.970> older

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
casting and most children and older

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.479 
casting and most children and older
people<00:03:24.040> what<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.269> maintain<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.449> it<00:03:26.799> fly<00:03:27.799> casting

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
people what I maintain is it fly casting

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.270 
people what I maintain is it fly casting
is<00:03:28.669> the<00:03:28.699> only<00:03:29.299> sport<00:03:29.689> I<00:03:29.870> know<00:03:30.099> where<00:03:31.099> you're

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
taught to cast with just your arm even

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.149 
taught to cast with just your arm even
in<00:03:34.790> ping-pong<00:03:35.229> people<00:03:36.229> use<00:03:36.470> their<00:03:36.709> bodies<00:03:37.129> to

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
this will not move at all and I don't

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.099 
this will not move at all and I don't
want<00:03:55.759> you<00:03:55.879> doing<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:56.269> but<00:03:56.509> I<00:03:56.540> just<00:03:56.750> want<00:03:56.989> to

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
show you that the body can make the cast

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.459 
show you that the body can make the cast
so<00:04:00.500> if<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:00.769> lock<00:04:01.069> that<00:04:01.340> elbow<00:04:01.819> there<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.469> just

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:03.469 
so if I lock that elbow there and just

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:05.890 
so if I lock that elbow there and just
swivel<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:04.009> body<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.699> line<00:04:04.909> goes<00:04:05.180> back<00:04:05.449> here

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
swivel the body the line goes back here

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.399 
swivel the body the line goes back here
if<00:04:06.139> I<00:04:06.530> swivel<00:04:06.979> back<00:04:07.159> I<00:04:07.609> have<00:04:08.569> thrown<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.199> line

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
if I swivel back I have thrown the line

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.129 
if I swivel back I have thrown the line
with<00:04:09.709> my<00:04:09.949> body<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.699> I've<00:04:11.269> never<00:04:11.599> moved<00:04:11.870> the

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
with my body and I've never moved the

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.039 
with my body and I've never moved the
rotator<00:04:12.620> cuffs<00:04:12.979> and<00:04:13.370> when<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.060> come<00:04:14.419> forward<00:04:14.780> if

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
rotator cuffs and when I come forward if

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.289 
rotator cuffs and when I come forward if
you<00:04:15.169> watch<00:04:15.409> my<00:04:15.680> hand<00:04:15.919> my<00:04:16.159> wrist<00:04:16.519> does<00:04:16.789> not<00:04:17.000> move

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
you watch my hand my wrist does not move

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.110 
you watch my hand my wrist does not move
it<00:04:17.419> on<00:04:17.599> the<00:04:17.780> back<00:04:18.019> cast<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.549> all<00:04:19.820> it

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
it on the back cast and this is all it

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.459 
it on the back cast and this is all it
moves<00:04:20.359> on<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.690> forecast

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:21.469 
moves on the forecast

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.339 
moves on the forecast
so<00:04:22.130> you've<00:04:22.310> eliminated<00:04:22.610> first<00:04:23.389> of<00:04:23.570> all<00:04:23.690> tennis

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
so you've eliminated first of all tennis

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.090
