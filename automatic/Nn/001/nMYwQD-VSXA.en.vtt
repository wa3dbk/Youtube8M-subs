Vlad off pistol obviously vengeful is
just<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.780> prefix<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.380> fire<00:00:10.860> rate<00:00:11.130> for<00:00:11.490> Vlad

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
just the prefix for fire rate for Vlad

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.120 
just the prefix for fire rate for Vlad
off<00:00:11.910> pistols<00:00:12.360> as<00:00:12.540> we<00:00:13.200> can<00:00:13.320> see<00:00:13.500> here<00:00:13.710> though<00:00:13.889> as

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
off pistols as we can see here though as

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.519 
off pistols as we can see here though as
compared<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.790> other<00:00:15.089> Vlad<00:00:15.389> off<00:00:15.570> pistols<00:00:16.020> it

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
compared to other Vlad off pistols it

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.730 
compared to other Vlad off pistols it
has<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> superior<00:00:17.609> fire<00:00:18.150> rate<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.779> damage

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
has a superior fire rate and damage

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.740 
has a superior fire rate and damage
however<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.609> does<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:21.029> very<00:00:21.240> slow-moving

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
however it does have very slow-moving

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.500 
however it does have very slow-moving
projectiles<00:00:22.320> as<00:00:23.010> compared<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.699> others<00:00:23.970> it

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
projectiles as compared to the others it

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.390 
projectiles as compared to the others it
has<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.810> slightly<00:00:25.140> smaller<00:00:25.500> magazine<00:00:25.859> it's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
has a slightly smaller magazine it's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.120 
has a slightly smaller magazine it's
less<00:00:26.820> accurate<00:00:27.390> however<00:00:28.080> we're<00:00:28.830> gonna<00:00:28.920> see

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
less accurate however we're gonna see

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.160 
less accurate however we're gonna see
how<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.220> does<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.119> barroom<00:00:30.390> blitz<00:00:30.900> I

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
how it does here in the barroom blitz I

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.500 
how it does here in the barroom blitz I
expect<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.920> be<00:00:31.980> pretty<00:00:32.669> good<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.329> this

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
expect it to be pretty good here in this

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.080 
expect it to be pretty good here in this
small<00:00:33.989> room<00:00:34.430> because<00:00:35.430> we're<00:00:35.640> not<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.910> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
small room because we're not going to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.000 
small room because we're not going to
have<00:00:36.210> too<00:00:36.360> much<00:00:36.510> trouble<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
have too much trouble with the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.670 
have too much trouble with the
projectile<00:00:38.610> speed<00:00:38.940> slowing<00:00:39.450> us<00:00:39.600> down

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
projectile speed slowing us down

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.680 
projectile speed slowing us down
necessarily<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:41.520> would<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.570> know

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
necessarily as we would have in you know

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.139 
necessarily as we would have in you know
a<00:00:42.899> larger<00:00:43.350> map<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.890> more<00:00:44.190> open<00:00:44.550> areas<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
a larger map with more open areas and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.479 
a larger map with more open areas and
more<00:00:45.690> distance<00:00:46.200> between<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.250> enemy

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
more distance between you and the enemy

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.540 
more distance between you and the enemy
and<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.840> weapon<00:00:49.260> does<00:00:49.500> bounce<00:00:49.770> around<00:00:49.980> quite

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and this weapon does bounce around quite

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.639 
and this weapon does bounce around quite
a<00:00:50.579> bit<00:00:50.640> much<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.539> stinger<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.260> way<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
a bit much like the stinger in a way and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.490 
a bit much like the stinger in a way and
so<00:00:53.190> maybe<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.550> will<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.850> really<00:00:54.239> good<00:00:54.420> for

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
so maybe it will be really good for

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.689 
so maybe it will be really good for
Chain<00:00:55.500> Reaction<00:00:55.530> we're<00:00:56.250> obviously<00:00:56.399> gonna

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
Chain Reaction we're obviously gonna

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.069 
Chain Reaction we're obviously gonna
have<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.180> how<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.449> works<00:00:57.629> though<00:00:57.899> as

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
have to see how it works though as

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.529 
have to see how it works though as
always<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:59.399> these<00:00:59.640> tests<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.120> I'm<00:01:00.239> doing

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
always for these tests that I'm doing

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.119 
always for these tests that I'm doing
I'm<00:01:00.660> seeing<00:01:00.930> how<00:01:01.020> they<00:01:01.199> work<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.590> my<00:01:01.829> blurred

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
I'm seeing how they work with my blurred

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.130 
I'm seeing how they work with my blurred
tricks<00:01:02.520> our<00:01:02.699> build<00:01:02.879> which<00:01:03.449> allows<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.750> ten

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
tricks our build which allows for ten

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140 
tricks our build which allows for ten
points<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.650> chain<00:01:04.890> reaction<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.519> some<00:01:06.030> other

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
points in chain reaction and some other

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.450 
points in chain reaction and some other
points<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.600> survivability<00:01:07.110> skills<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.340> we'll

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
points in survivability skills so we'll

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
points in survivability skills so we'll
go<00:01:08.580> ahead<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.270> started<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.720> I'd<00:01:09.990> like

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
go ahead and get started here I'd like

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.690 
go ahead and get started here I'd like
to<00:01:10.229> find<00:01:10.439> two<00:01:10.619> enemies<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.250> grouped

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to find two enemies that are grouped

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.780 
to find two enemies that are grouped
together<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.210> order<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.170> go<00:01:13.409> ahead<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.010> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
together in order to go ahead and you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.520 
together in order to go ahead and you
know<00:01:14.820> maybe<00:01:15.210> get<00:01:15.450> an<00:01:15.540> initial<00:01:15.810> double<00:01:16.320> kill

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
know maybe get an initial double kill

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.880 
know maybe get an initial double kill
which<00:01:17.130> will<00:01:17.430> most<00:01:17.939> likely<00:01:18.420> cause<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:19.080> badass

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
which will most likely cause a badass

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.130 
which will most likely cause a badass
enforcer<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.549> spawn<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.570> rats<00:01:21.869> getting

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
enforcer to spawn this rats getting

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.219 
enforcer to spawn this rats getting
pretty<00:01:22.500> close<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.070> rat<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.229> we're

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
pretty close to this rat and so we're

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.330 
pretty close to this rat and so we're
gonna<00:01:25.350> wait<00:01:25.560> until<00:01:25.710> they're<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.220> little

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
gonna wait until they're just a little

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.179 
gonna wait until they're just a little
bit<00:01:26.549> closer<00:01:26.790> phase<00:01:27.210> lock<00:01:27.420> them<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.829> we

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
bit closer phase lock them and see if we

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.039 
bit closer phase lock them and see if we
get<00:01:29.369> anything<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.240> chain<00:01:30.600> reaction

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
get anything going on chain reaction

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.380 
get anything going on chain reaction
wise<00:01:31.460> alright<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.700> killed<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.000> bottom<00:01:33.240> one

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
wise alright so we killed the bottom one

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.550 
wise alright so we killed the bottom one
there<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.869> looked<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.320> had<00:01:34.350> done<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
there and it looked like we had done a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.260 
there and it looked like we had done a
little<00:01:34.799> bit<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.040> damage<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.549> top<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.119> as

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
little bit of damage to that top one as

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
little bit of damage to that top one as
well<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.259> we're<00:01:37.380> gonna<00:01:37.470> try<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> find<00:01:38.070> one

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
well so now we're gonna try to find one

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.190 
well so now we're gonna try to find one
of<00:01:38.280> those<00:01:38.460> ultimate<00:01:38.970> badass<00:01:39.150> enforcers<00:01:39.960> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
of those ultimate badass enforcers and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.319 
of those ultimate badass enforcers and
see<00:01:40.439> how<00:01:40.560> quickly<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.189> stalker<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.670> able<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
see how quickly the stalker is able to

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.690 
see how quickly the stalker is able to
kill<00:01:42.600> them<00:01:42.829> this<00:01:43.829> gun<00:01:44.009> does<00:01:44.189> appear<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.460> have

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
kill them this gun does appear to have

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.030 
kill them this gun does appear to have
pretty<00:01:44.970> high<00:01:45.180> stopping<00:01:45.689> power<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.500> noticed

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
pretty high stopping power I noticed

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.190 
pretty high stopping power I noticed
that<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.090> killing<00:01:48.390> these<00:01:48.600> enemies<00:01:48.960> pretty

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that it was killing these enemies pretty

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.929 
that it was killing these enemies pretty
quickly<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.710> obviously<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.700> first

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
quickly and obviously this is the first

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.340 
quickly and obviously this is the first
big<00:01:51.119> enemy<00:01:51.420> we're<00:01:51.570> getting<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.229> we'll

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
big enemy we're getting to but we'll

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.749 
big enemy we're getting to but we'll
watch<00:01:52.500> how<00:01:52.649> quickly<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.189> kills<00:01:53.399> him

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
watch how quickly it kills him

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.460 
watch how quickly it kills him
oh<00:01:53.790> yeah<00:01:54.360> that's<00:01:54.570> definitely<00:01:55.079> very<00:01:55.320> very

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
oh yeah that's definitely very very

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.920 
oh yeah that's definitely very very
quick<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.280> that's<00:01:56.880> good<00:01:57.149> they're<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.780> main

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
quick so that's good they're the main

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.840 
quick so that's good they're the main
drawbacks<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.710> weapon<00:01:58.950> are<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.579> low

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
drawbacks of this weapon are the low

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.929 
drawbacks of this weapon are the low
projectile<00:02:00.540> speed<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.549> slight

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
projectile speed and the you know slight

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.760 
projectile speed and the you know slight
inaccuracy<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.960> has<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.469> still<00:02:04.649> able

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
inaccuracy that it has I was still able

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.150 
inaccuracy that it has I was still able
to<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> critical<00:02:05.460> hit<00:02:05.640> there<00:02:05.880> obviously

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
to get a critical hit there obviously

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.320 
to get a critical hit there obviously
when<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> kill<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.119> build

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
when you get a kill with this build

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.750 
when you get a kill with this build
you'll<00:02:09.599> gain<00:02:10.200> access<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.129> kill<00:02:11.459> skills

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you'll gain access to the kill skills

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760 
you'll gain access to the kill skills
and<00:02:12.030> nurse'<00:02:12.270> life<00:02:12.989> tap<00:02:13.260> and

and nurse' life tap and
Natick<00:02:14.010> reflection<00:02:14.550> which<00:02:15.060> should<00:02:15.210> keep<00:02:15.300> you

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
Natick reflection which should keep you

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.570 
Natick reflection which should keep you
alive<00:02:15.690> very<00:02:15.930> very<00:02:16.230> easily<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.950> just<00:02:17.490> got

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
alive very very easily I just got

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.010 
alive very very easily I just got
punched<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.000> back<00:02:18.210> by<00:02:18.420> some<00:02:18.690> enemies

punched in the back by some enemies

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.990 
punched in the back by some enemies
there<00:02:19.230> however<00:02:20.040> life<00:02:20.370> tap<00:02:20.580> will<00:02:20.730> keep<00:02:20.880> me

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
there however life tap will keep me

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.720 
there however life tap will keep me
alive<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:21.630> we<00:02:22.290> have<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> big<00:02:22.950> into<00:02:23.160> me<00:02:23.280> behind<00:02:23.580> us

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
alive so we have a big into me behind us

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.300 
alive so we have a big into me behind us
here<00:02:23.910> we're<00:02:24.060> gonna<00:02:24.150> go<00:02:24.360> ahead<00:02:24.390> pick<00:02:24.870> him<00:02:25.050> up

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
here we're gonna go ahead pick him up

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.290 
here we're gonna go ahead pick him up
hopefully<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.490> kill<00:02:26.670> some<00:02:26.820> other<00:02:26.880> enemies

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
hopefully we kill some other enemies

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.660 
hopefully we kill some other enemies
around<00:02:27.540> him<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:28.260> chain<00:02:28.530> reaction<00:02:28.980> as<00:02:29.130> we

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
around him with chain reaction as we

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.290 
around him with chain reaction as we
kill<00:02:29.910> him

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
kill him

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.970 
kill him
looks<00:02:30.960> like<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:31.230> were<00:02:31.290> able<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.560> finish<00:02:31.830> off

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
looks like we were able to finish off

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.590 
looks like we were able to finish off
that<00:02:32.010> Bonecrusher<00:02:32.820> there<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.240> that's<00:02:33.420> pretty

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
that Bonecrusher there so that's pretty

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.040 
that Bonecrusher there so that's pretty
cool

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
cool

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.330 
cool
there's<00:02:34.530> gonna<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.830> some<00:02:35.010> more<00:02:35.160> badass

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
there's gonna be some more badass

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.890 
there's gonna be some more badass
enforcers<00:02:36.030> downstairs<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.720> we're<00:02:36.810> gonna

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
enforcers downstairs and we're gonna

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.240 
enforcers downstairs and we're gonna
need<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.290> finish<00:02:37.500> them<00:02:37.830> off

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
need to finish them off

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.100 
need to finish them off
I<00:02:38.280> will<00:02:38.760> say<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.300> weapon<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.750> slightly

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
I will say that this weapon is slightly

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.730 
I will say that this weapon is slightly
more<00:02:40.410> ammo<00:02:40.970> efficient<00:02:41.970> than<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.900> stinger<00:02:43.560> or

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
more ammo efficient than the stinger or

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.060 
more ammo efficient than the stinger or
the<00:02:44.810> anarchist<00:02:45.810> was<00:02:46.020> because<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> bullets<00:02:46.950> do

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
the anarchist was because the bullets do

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.370 
the anarchist was because the bullets do
slightly<00:02:47.490> more<00:02:47.670> damage<00:02:48.030> obviously<00:02:48.540> they<00:02:49.140> are

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
slightly more damage obviously they are

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.410 
slightly more damage obviously they are
slower<00:02:50.070> though<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:50.970> could<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.150> more

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
slower though and so it could be more

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.600 
slower though and so it could be more
inefficient<00:02:51.810> if<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.290> were<00:02:52.410> trying<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.800> shoot

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
inefficient if you were trying to shoot

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.670 
inefficient if you were trying to shoot
an<00:02:53.730> enemy<00:02:54.030> at<00:02:54.180> range<00:02:54.540> however<00:02:54.930> close<00:02:55.350> up<00:02:55.530> like

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
an enemy at range however close up like

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.740 
an enemy at range however close up like
this<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.430> gun<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.760> doing<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.150> very<00:02:57.390> very<00:02:57.480> good

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
this this gun is doing a very very good

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.490 
this this gun is doing a very very good
job

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
job

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.130 
job
so<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.130> stalker<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.610> also<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> decent<00:03:00.480> lad<00:03:00.960> off

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
so the stalker is also a decent lad off

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.530 
so the stalker is also a decent lad off
pistol<00:03:01.590> all<00:03:02.130> said<00:03:02.520> though<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.760> wouldn't<00:03:03.240> really

pistol all said though I wouldn't really

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.570 
pistol all said though I wouldn't really
recommend<00:03:03.690> any<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.560> these<00:03:04.710> flat<00:03:04.980> off<00:03:05.130> pistols

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
recommend any of these flat off pistols

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.970 
recommend any of these flat off pistols
for<00:03:05.790> this<00:03:06.030> build<00:03:06.300> unless<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.410> really<00:03:07.620> enjoy

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
for this build unless you really enjoy

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.860 
for this build unless you really enjoy
using<00:03:08.250> them<00:03:08.580> because<00:03:08.910> there<00:03:09.630> are<00:03:09.660> other

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
using them because there are other

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.180 
using them because there are other
weapons<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.350> are<00:03:10.500> obviously<00:03:10.800> gonna<00:03:10.980> do<00:03:11.160> a

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
weapons that are obviously gonna do a

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.980 
weapons that are obviously gonna do a
lot<00:03:11.430> better

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
lot better

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.080 
lot better
however<00:03:12.990> this<00:03:13.230> gun<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.680> pretty<00:03:13.980> strong<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.310> I

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
however this gun is pretty strong and I

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.540 
however this gun is pretty strong and I
have<00:03:15.990> five<00:03:16.260> points<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.680> accelerate<00:03:17.220> which<00:03:17.400> is

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
have five points in accelerate which is

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.140 
have five points in accelerate which is
increasing<00:03:17.970> my<00:03:18.090> projectile<00:03:18.750> speed<00:03:19.080> by<00:03:19.440> 20%

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
increasing my projectile speed by 20%

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.030 
increasing my projectile speed by 20%
which<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.330> pretty<00:03:21.510> good<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:22.709> could<00:03:22.890> be<00:03:23.010> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
which is pretty good it could be a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.380 
which is pretty good it could be a
little<00:03:23.250> bit<00:03:23.430> better<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.670> can<00:03:23.910> see<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.300> the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
little bit better you can see that the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.890 
little bit better you can see that the
bullets<00:03:24.690> are<00:03:24.870> still<00:03:25.020> kind<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.680> slow<00:03:25.950> however

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
bullets are still kind of slow however

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.650 
bullets are still kind of slow however
they're<00:03:27.900> quick<00:03:28.110> enough<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:29.090> deal<00:03:30.090> damage<00:03:30.300> with

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
they're quick enough to deal damage with

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.780 
they're quick enough to deal damage with
and<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.320> kill<00:03:31.560> enemies<00:03:31.890> with<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.610> that's

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
and to kill enemies with and so that's

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.550 
and to kill enemies with and so that's
pretty<00:03:32.970> cool<00:03:33.150> especially<00:03:33.450> if<00:03:34.020> you're<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.320> a

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
pretty cool especially if you're in a

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.090 
pretty cool especially if you're in a
tight<00:03:34.920> area<00:03:35.480> if<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.690> were<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.020> you<00:03:37.620> know<00:03:37.740> close

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
tight area if you were in you know close

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.680 
tight area if you were in you know close
