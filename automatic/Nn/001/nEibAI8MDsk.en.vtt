00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hi girls style will have a good 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.980
 tip meadow syringe as I give 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.660
 practical advice on 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.490
 training to have a healthy weight 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.440
 and be well in your skin so 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.290
 today I'm talking to you about protein 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.179
 I have a question precisely of a 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.340
 client of fit for real then 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.109
 nontron it was relative to what 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.080
 protein how do I know if I should 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.800
 take whey protein where it 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.539
 has isolated the barracks of vg done there are some 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.449
 many who I can understand how 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.279
 his share is still enough it's 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.770
 intimidating sometimes as well as making 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.230
 this store and then I wanted precisely 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.850
 to talk about it because I'm sure 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.940
 that it is not the only one who feels 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.340
 like that so I will address the subject 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 today in time but I 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.489
 have not tried a lot of protein from 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.640
 working in a supplement store 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.920
 precisely then that's it I have a 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.969
 good idea of ​​how I tolerate 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.520
 protein I had the opportunity 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.489
 to try to find out how my body 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.699
 reacts done I think that's where 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.129
 the importance of choosing our protein 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.890
 chosen a lot in the background that it 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.030
 come back to taste yes but the quality of 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.430
 the protein is very important 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.890
 also know that we consume some 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.540
 good thing I heard precisely in 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.140
 weekend that yugo he made himself 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.789
 tested positive at a competition of 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.530
 precisely because there was some 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.350
 thing in his protein that were that 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.659
 and tested positive but that he and his 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.069
 mates he takes protein because they 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.109
 think they were that that means 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.119
 his truth and the rich would pay more 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:41.259
 quickly that in terror then a 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.090
 child that makes it positive then 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.429
 pick these steroids so that's 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.140
 really serious for him but must 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.789
 make sure you know who understands 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.219
 that she produces and that I was rod 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.229
 what is the company that have 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.780
 had or chose our supplement that 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.310
 I was going so me with the store 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.610
 precisely because I worked I 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.099
 can wear it to keep fit and 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.450
 inform me but trained on a lot of 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:10.090
 products try them so the different 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.040
 types of side so there are types of 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.750
 proteins that are the most absolution 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.840
 fast I've already talked about it but kind 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.329
 spoke briefly no sooner 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.299
 depressed isolate them it's a protein of 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.099
 whey is yes proteins but 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.470
 which isolated so it's a form of 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.269
 protein that is very very very scared 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.420
 so this is the purest risk is the 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.010
 more expensive obviously this is the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.440
 protein form that is absorbed very 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.420
 quickly learned in half an hour 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.340
 at most one hour the protein is 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.810
 absorbed that means absorbed 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.680
 sequelae the amino acids are a 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.209
 system to be absorbed and children to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.310
 the led sna what's this is the 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.370
 sub product a protein faamp eat 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.660
 a chicken a steak de1 memorial shape 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.970
 of protein in our diet 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.209
 got degraded in our body under 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.459
 amino acid form so with its 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.109
 together the books the protein husband 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.200
 promotes a background of absence 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.669
 absorption of 6.2 occurred there 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.380
 so it's still names 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.209
 supplement the proteins by what is 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.480
 notable mentation does not allow us 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.430
 to have such a quick absorption of 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.250
 the importance of supplementing when one 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.410
 trains but I always said 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.260
 that it's extra supplementation 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.849
 it's not necessary all the time 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.900
 have ecce terra supplementation 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.660
 it's really not added but when we 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.820
 still not training 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.130
 22 30 minutes there after training 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.680
 which is still very important 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.050
 we want to promote it with a protein 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.640
 isolate a concentrate that is still a 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.760
 wii but it's a bit of a shape 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.980
 less pure I would say that isolate it 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.260
 people can have the measure to the 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.160
 jerry by gastro discomfort 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.480
 intestinal it depends on the people is 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.670
 less than half and intolerant to 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.930
 lactose I do not suggest you if we are at 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.730
 inside on the cause 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.650
 I suggest more isolated there or even 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.950
 a form of often vegetable protein 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.930
 so that proteins are rice that's 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.760
 cranberries that close to peas 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.130
 chick 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.750
 it is form vg I would like that 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.340
 absorption and not the same it takes a 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.570
 little more time but at the level of the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.270
 quality of the protein it is 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.230
 probably the best 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.450
 me that's what I'm taking now 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.420
 I have all the time proteins of small 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.570
 milk and rendering with vg protein 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.860
 so is a vegetarian so I feel by 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.930
 a little more in the second capsule 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.460
 so you have an idea if 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.730
 you want to try it or not and then yes 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.310
 it is certain that the project of the protein to 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.720
 the house if you want to have an idea 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.950
 of cash that I will take that it is 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.380
 more details it will make me happy 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.480
 to tell you that simply 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.980
 send an email and then games can 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.360
 give directions to tell you 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.740
 what I would do maybe 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.810
 it's something for you too 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.280
 the second capsule is reserved for 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.410
 members to become a member simply 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.880
 the other tribes w first form brel 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.310
 points as slashes subscription 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.320
 to become a member then you go 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.480
 have access to my second capsule and in 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.430
 more to programs from maxim 5,11 to 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.890
 every week so on stage I'm going 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.890
 see you right away
