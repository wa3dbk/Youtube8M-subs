00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 we can say that we are in minecraft 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.189
 1.8 let's see a mod 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.010
 which serves to save the experience and 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.059
 the truth is that there are different modes 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.400
 to save experience this is not what 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.900
 we had seen but it seemed very 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.960
 cool the thing is that now we have 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.590
 this is the ex experience translator 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:28.080
 it would be with any color 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.420
 3 unrefined wood as you are 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.080
 seeing 2 diamonds and an emerald of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.080
 I'm looking 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 two diamonds right medial ions and no 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 I see no difference no 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.880
 of this style in coffee or I mean 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.210
 maybe it goes like this to put all the 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.300
 types of wood and that but the truth that 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.110
 with this pileup we can go putting the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.760
 experience is fine really but the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.640
 theme is that the experience you keep it 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.290
 in the little bottles these will see 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.280
 then you can not do it where you want 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.650
 you can only do it where you have the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.310
 little table is and that can be a little 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.619
 more annoying let's go to any area there 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.430
 is this here the table is that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.710
 we have done let's remove 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.180
 this so that it looks good is like half 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.000
 step in fact we can upload it 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.430
 perfectly without jumping and then we have 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.920
 to do this here are the bottom 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.560
 simply with three glass and one 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.710
 wooden step we make five bottles 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.540
 and this we can give you 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.280
 with a crash we make five and each 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.840
 one of these contains a level of 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.360
 experience and with this when we want 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.350
 put us the simply is right click 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.320
 you see it 13 level 14 15 16 17 is 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.880
 pretty pretty cool I just 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.409
 change one and I put it back on 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.790
 because I'm stupid that by doing so they have 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.790
 the particles are coming out here 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.829
 and with bottles of these one level 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.149
 we can make a bottle of 9 if 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.409
 we put together 9 bottles of one level 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.090
 we make the bottle 9 this serves 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.730
 simply for 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.860
 for this that I do not leave now blame that 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.000
 and it does not come out to save space that's 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.190
 a fact let's put it in the levels 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.410
 of 99 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.530
 It is outrageous that yes but so cool 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:24.130
 I can have it saved I love it 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.870
 triki triki triki triki apart these are 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.209
 My nonsense but as you can see each one 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.270
 it gives us a level and we can 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.380
 store a level is to say us 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.800
 we have a level we give them with the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.550
 bottle and it gives us a level but it's a 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.470
 level always and I have understood what 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.180
 better it's not like that anymore I'm wrong 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.959
 but I understand that it is not the same 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:52.930
 upload you from nothing to level 1 that level 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:56.170
 30 to 31 for example then if so 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.810
 that costs more, it's better to go up 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.400
 better two levels and put the little bottles 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.170
 and then put 30 levels of blow no 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.640
 they do it faster than going up the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.260
 experience in a normal but good way 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.269
 This is the amount of your most curious 7 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.519
 this experience is pretty 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.640
 pretty cool but good you have the 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.769
 description is for 1.8 if the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.760
 make up etcetera as always in that 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.760
 heap
