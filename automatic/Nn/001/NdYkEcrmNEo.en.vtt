looking<00:00:10.210> at<00:00:10.450> how<00:00:10.600> to<00:00:10.660> make<00:00:11.049> and<00:00:11.320> use<00:00:11.799> macerator

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
looking at how to make and use macerator

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.480 
looking at how to make and use macerator
zand<00:00:13.000> rotary<00:00:13.750> mass<00:00:13.900> raters<00:00:14.380> now<00:00:15.009> these<00:00:15.190> things

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
zand rotary mass raters now these things

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.490 
zand rotary mass raters now these things
are<00:00:15.639> great<00:00:15.790> they're<00:00:16.420> Industrial<00:00:16.960> Craft<00:00:17.110> and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
are great they're Industrial Craft and

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.800 
are great they're Industrial Craft and
basically<00:00:18.189> what<00:00:18.460> they<00:00:18.640> do<00:00:18.700> is<00:00:19.180> they<00:00:19.630> will

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
basically what they do is they will

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.830 
basically what they do is they will
double<00:00:20.290> any<00:00:20.590> kind<00:00:20.919> of<00:00:21.070> all<00:00:21.279> that<00:00:21.670> you<00:00:21.820> get<00:00:22.090> so

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
double any kind of all that you get so

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.109 
double any kind of all that you get so
they're<00:00:23.140> fantastic<00:00:23.800> get<00:00:24.430> one<00:00:24.640> as<00:00:24.820> soon<00:00:24.970> as

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
they're fantastic get one as soon as

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.210 
they're fantastic get one as soon as
possible<00:00:25.570> right<00:00:26.320> let's<00:00:26.619> have<00:00:26.830> a<00:00:26.859> look<00:00:27.039> at<00:00:27.100> how

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
possible right let's have a look at how

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.009 
possible right let's have a look at how
to<00:00:27.279> make<00:00:27.550> one<00:00:27.580> so<00:00:27.910> firstly<00:00:28.330> you're<00:00:28.689> going<00:00:28.900> to

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
to make one so firstly you're going to

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.599 
to make one so firstly you're going to
need<00:00:29.170> a<00:00:29.199> machine<00:00:29.590> blocking<00:00:30.070> from<00:00:30.250> machine

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
need a machine blocking from machine

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.339 
need a machine blocking from machine
block<00:00:30.820> you're<00:00:31.330> going<00:00:31.449> to<00:00:31.539> need<00:00:31.630> refined<00:00:32.019> iron

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
block you're going to need refined iron

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.160 
block you're going to need refined iron
so<00:00:32.680> get<00:00:32.980> your<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.129> fine<00:00:33.370> dine<00:00:33.580> and<00:00:33.960> make<00:00:34.960> a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
so get your a fine dine and make a

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.219 
so get your a fine dine and make a
square<00:00:35.620> like<00:00:36.040> so<00:00:36.489> so<00:00:37.360> there<00:00:37.629> is<00:00:37.750> your<00:00:37.780> machine

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:38.229 
square like so so there is your machine

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:40.229 
square like so so there is your machine
block<00:00:38.500> next<00:00:39.280> you're<00:00:39.580> going<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:39.729> want<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:39.940> place

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
block next you're going to want to place

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.329 
block next you're going to want to place
your<00:00:40.420> machine<00:00:40.720> bak<00:00:40.960> in<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.739> middle<00:00:41.949> of<00:00:42.040> your

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
your machine bak in the middle of your

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.060

crafting<00:00:42.879> table<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.360> at<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.809> top<00:00:44.049> take<00:00:44.739> three

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
crafting table and at the top take three

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.789 
crafting table and at the top take three
Flint<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.750> there<00:00:46.750> we<00:00:46.839> go<00:00:47.019> and<00:00:47.260> then<00:00:47.680> you're

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:47.799 
Flint and there we go and then you're

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:49.439 
Flint and there we go and then you're
going<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:47.979> want<00:00:48.129> to<00:00:48.220> put<00:00:48.430> cobblestone<00:00:49.089> either

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
going to want to put cobblestone either

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.689 
going to want to put cobblestone either
side<00:00:49.809> and<00:00:50.110> then<00:00:50.680> at<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:50.949> very<00:00:50.979> bottom<00:00:51.280> you're

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
side and then at the very bottom you're

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.250 
side and then at the very bottom you're
going<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:51.909> want<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.180> put<00:00:52.390> an<00:00:52.570> electronic

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
going to want to put an electronic

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.380 
going to want to put an electronic
circuit<00:00:53.589> there<00:00:54.369> we<00:00:54.460> go<00:00:54.610> and<00:00:54.850> there<00:00:55.119> is<00:00:55.239> our

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
circuit there we go and there is our

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.289 
circuit there we go and there is our
first<00:00:55.629> macerator<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:57.190> take<00:00:57.760> your<00:00:57.909> macerator

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
first macerator so take your macerator

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.410 
first macerator so take your macerator
and<00:00:59.400> plunk<00:01:00.400> it<00:01:00.489> down<00:01:00.549> and<00:01:00.940> I<00:01:00.970> say<00:01:01.180> it's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
and plunk it down and I say it's

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.119 
and plunk it down and I say it's
Industrial<00:01:01.960> Craft<00:01:02.049> so<00:01:02.409> it's<00:01:02.650> powered<00:01:02.979> by

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
Industrial Craft so it's powered by

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.490 
Industrial Craft so it's powered by
cables<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.030> not<00:01:04.420> by<00:01:04.750> Reds<00:01:05.110> powered

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
cables and not by Reds powered

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.310 
cables and not by Reds powered
conductive<00:01:06.070> circuit<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.600> as<00:01:07.840> you<00:01:07.960> can<00:01:08.080> see

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
conductive circuit so as you can see

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.940 
conductive circuit so as you can see
there<00:01:08.740> we<00:01:08.920> go<00:01:09.100> it's<00:01:09.370> powered<00:01:09.730> and<00:01:10.320> if<00:01:11.320> you<00:01:11.470> say

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
there we go it's powered and if you say

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.460 
there we go it's powered and if you say
put<00:01:12.190> in<00:01:12.280> call<00:01:12.520> you<00:01:13.390> can<00:01:13.510> see<00:01:13.750> there<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.080> is<00:01:14.200> its

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
put in call you can see there it is its

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.190 
put in call you can see there it is its
mass<00:01:14.710> rating<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.370> at<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.940> end<00:01:16.090> product<00:01:16.420> we

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
mass rating and at the end product we

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.550 
mass rating and at the end product we
can<00:01:17.530> get<00:01:17.770> coal<00:01:18.130> dust<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:20.080> you'll<00:01:20.200> see<00:01:20.410> these

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
can get coal dust and you'll see these

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.010 
can get coal dust and you'll see these
patches<00:01:21.220> at<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.550> side<00:01:21.790> now<00:01:22.000> these<00:01:22.210> are<00:01:22.600> for

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
patches at the side now these are for

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.780 
patches at the side now these are for
overclocking<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.460> will<00:01:24.610> basically

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
overclocking and this will basically

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.910 
overclocking and this will basically
make<00:01:25.030> your<00:01:25.390> master<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.840> two<00:01:25.900> run<00:01:26.140> much<00:01:26.650> faster

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
make your master a two run much faster

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.760 
make your master a two run much faster
but<00:01:27.820> be<00:01:27.940> warned<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:28.570> does<00:01:28.810> suck<00:01:29.290> a<00:01:29.350> lot<00:01:29.560> more

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
but be warned it does suck a lot more

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.920 
but be warned it does suck a lot more
power<00:01:30.040> into<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.430> now<00:01:31.060> you<00:01:31.120> can<00:01:31.360> actually<00:01:31.690> fuel

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
power into it now you can actually fuel

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.980 
power into it now you can actually fuel
these<00:01:32.170> down<00:01:32.590> here<00:01:32.890> as<00:01:33.010> well<00:01:33.190> and<00:01:33.990> basically

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
these down here as well and basically

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.320 
these down here as well and basically
right<00:01:35.470> let's<00:01:35.650> move<00:01:35.740> on<00:01:35.980> to<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.670> rotary

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
right let's move on to the rotary

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.540 
right let's move on to the rotary
macerator<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.200> for<00:01:38.380> this<00:01:38.530> you're<00:01:39.250> going<00:01:39.430> to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
macerator so for this you're going to

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.060 
macerator so for this you're going to
want<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.880> get<00:01:40.540> your<00:01:40.750> mass<00:01:41.020> rates<00:01:41.260> back<00:01:41.470> now<00:01:41.740> be

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
want to get your mass rates back now be

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.280 
want to get your mass rates back now be
warned<00:01:42.460> using<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.180> pick<00:01:43.360> axe<00:01:43.600> will<00:01:44.020> just

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
warned using a pick axe will just

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.410 
warned using a pick axe will just
destroy<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.490> if<00:01:45.580> you<00:01:45.820> actually<00:01:46.060> want<00:01:46.390> to

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
destroy it so if you actually want to

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.260 
destroy it so if you actually want to
wrench<00:01:46.690> so<00:01:47.290> you<00:01:47.350> take<00:01:47.500> your<00:01:47.650> wrench<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.270> there

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
wrench so you take your wrench and there

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.850 
wrench so you take your wrench and there
we<00:01:49.390> go<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.810> there's<00:01:49.840> your<00:01:50.290> mouse<00:01:50.409> rights<00:01:50.650> back

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
we go and there's your mouse rights back

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.520 
we go and there's your mouse rights back
go<00:01:51.460> back<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.790> a<00:01:51.820> crafting<00:01:52.180> bench<00:01:52.300> and<00:01:52.659> take

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
go back to a crafting bench and take

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.130 
go back to a crafting bench and take
your<00:01:53.740> macerator<00:01:54.270> Punk<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.420> directly<00:01:55.960> in<00:01:56.080> the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
your macerator Punk it directly in the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.710 
your macerator Punk it directly in the
middle<00:01:56.220> now<00:01:57.220> what<00:01:57.760> you're<00:01:57.880> going<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.120> need<00:01:58.360> is

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
middle now what you're going to need is

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.920 
middle now what you're going to need is
an<00:01:59.320> advanced<00:02:00.159> machine<00:02:00.940> block<00:02:01.240> now<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.630> should

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
an advanced machine block now I should

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.680 
an advanced machine block now I should
do<00:02:02.200> this<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.979> take<00:02:03.250> your<00:02:03.760> normal<00:02:04.240> machine

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
do this you take your normal machine

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.719 
do this you take your normal machine
block<00:02:04.900> so<00:02:05.080> we<00:02:05.200> create<00:02:05.470> one<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:08.610> there<00:02:09.610> we

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
block so we create one like so there we

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.850 
block so we create one like so there we
go<00:02:09.759> now<00:02:10.179> plunk<00:02:10.539> down<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.750> middle<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.049> then

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
go now plunk down the middle and then

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.949 
go now plunk down the middle and then
basically<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.640> need<00:02:12.819> carbon<00:02:13.360> plates<00:02:13.660> and

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
basically you need carbon plates and

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.260 
basically you need carbon plates and
advanced<00:02:14.350> alloys<00:02:14.860> now<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.490> need<00:02:15.670> one<00:02:16.090> at<00:02:16.209> the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
advanced alloys now you need one at the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.950 
advanced alloys now you need one at the
top<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.780> bottom

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
top on the bottom

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.900 
top on the bottom
and<00:02:18.050> then<00:02:18.200> for<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.440> carbon<00:02:18.770> plates<00:02:19.040> one<00:02:19.760> on

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
and then for the carbon plates one on

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.420 
and then for the carbon plates one on
either<00:02:20.030> side<00:02:20.230> there's<00:02:21.230> your<00:02:21.800> advanced

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
either side there's your advanced

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.120 
either side there's your advanced
machine<00:02:22.820> block<00:02:23.000> take<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.950> what<00:02:24.950> we<00:02:25.010> do

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
machine block take that and what we do

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.790 
machine block take that and what we do
is<00:02:25.160> we<00:02:25.310> punk<00:02:25.490> that<00:02:25.640> bottom<00:02:26.410> macerator<00:02:27.410> goes<00:02:27.650> in

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
is we punk that bottom macerator goes in

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.010 
is we punk that bottom macerator goes in
the<00:02:27.920> middle<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.340> then<00:02:29.240> basically<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.960> want

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
the middle and then basically you want

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.690 
the middle and then basically you want
to<00:02:30.170> surround<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.500> whole<00:02:30.830> thing<00:02:31.160> with<00:02:31.430> more

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
to surround the whole thing with more

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.870 
to surround the whole thing with more
refined<00:02:32.540> iron<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.890> there<00:02:34.100> we<00:02:34.190> go<00:02:34.340> there<00:02:34.670> is

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
refined iron and there we go there is

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.840 
refined iron and there we go there is
your<00:02:35.030> rotary<00:02:35.360> macerator<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.800> like<00:02:37.490> before

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
your rotary macerator so like before

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.110 
your rotary macerator so like before
take<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.660> plunk<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.530> down<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.130> there<00:02:41.000> we<00:02:41.090> go

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
take it plunk it down and there we go

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.850 
take it plunk it down and there we go
now<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.570> can<00:02:41.720> see<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:41.870> powering<00:02:42.110> up<00:02:42.290> now

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
now you can see is powering up now

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.140 
now you can see is powering up now
basically<00:02:43.160> what<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.490> will<00:02:43.670> do<00:02:43.790> this<00:02:43.970> will

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
basically what this will do this will

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.230 
basically what this will do this will
macerate<00:02:44.660> twice<00:02:45.230> as<00:02:45.440> much<00:02:45.620> at<00:02:46.040> once<00:02:46.430> at<00:02:46.880> being

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
macerate twice as much at once at being

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.810 
macerate twice as much at once at being
pad<00:02:47.450> but<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.590> best<00:02:48.800> thing<00:02:48.920> about<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.580> the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
pad but the best thing about it is the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.450 
pad but the best thing about it is the
more<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:51.290> put<00:02:51.500> those<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:51.890> longer<00:02:52.160> it's<00:02:52.310> in

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
more you put those the longer it's in

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.330 
more you put those the longer it's in
the<00:02:53.240> faster<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.840> gets<00:02:54.020> see<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.770> RPM<00:02:55.190> is

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
the faster it gets see the RPM is

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.880 
the faster it gets see the RPM is
building<00:02:55.730> them<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.450> goes<00:02:56.780> really<00:02:57.230> fast<00:02:57.470> and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
building them that goes really fast and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.880 
building them that goes really fast and
when<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.160> gets<00:02:58.700> very<00:02:58.850> high<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.930> will<00:03:00.170> go<00:03:00.350> like

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
when it gets very high this will go like

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.150 
when it gets very high this will go like
bats<00:03:01.520> out<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.790> hell<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.660> there<00:03:03.620> is<00:03:03.770> a<00:03:03.800> trick<00:03:04.130> to

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
bats out of hell so there is a trick to

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.040 
bats out of hell so there is a trick to
this<00:03:04.370> because<00:03:04.640> basically<00:03:04.970> once<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.480> take<00:03:05.720> out

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
this because basically once you take out

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.230 
this because basically once you take out
what<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.680> put<00:03:06.770> in<00:03:07.040> there<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.850> can<00:03:08.090> see<00:03:08.120> the

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
what you put in there you can see the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.840 
what you put in there you can see the
RPM<00:03:08.840> that's<00:03:09.110> getting<00:03:09.350> much<00:03:09.620> there<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.490> there's

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
RPM that's getting much there so there's

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.690 
RPM that's getting much there so there's
a<00:03:10.910> trick<00:03:11.120> behind<00:03:11.270> us<00:03:11.540> make<00:03:12.470> yourself<00:03:12.920> redstone

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
a trick behind us make yourself redstone

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:22.750 
a trick behind us make yourself redstone
torch<00:03:15.550> like<00:03:16.550> so<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:19.360> plunk<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:20.450> down<00:03:21.670> next<00:03:22.670> to

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
torch like so and plunk it down next to

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.000 
torch like so and plunk it down next to
as<00:03:22.850> you<00:03:22.910> can<00:03:23.030> see<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.180> turns<00:03:23.390> on<00:03:23.540> now<00:03:24.500> without

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
as you can see it turns on now without

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.340 
as you can see it turns on now without
anything<00:03:25.310> being<00:03:25.580> in<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:25.850> this<00:03:26.060> will<00:03:26.270> just<00:03:26.630> get

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
anything being in it this will just get

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.770 
anything being in it this will just get
faster<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:27.950> faster<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.370> will<00:03:28.640> stay<00:03:28.970> fast<00:03:29.300> so

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
faster and faster and will stay fast so

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.750 
faster and faster and will stay fast so
as<00:03:30.170> soon<00:03:30.440> as<00:03:30.590> anything<00:03:30.800> goes<00:03:31.100> into<00:03:31.490> it<00:03:31.610> like

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
as soon as anything goes into it like

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.490 
as soon as anything goes into it like
that<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.660> will<00:03:32.780> just<00:03:32.960> start<00:03:33.200> getting

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
that it will just start getting

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.980 
that it will just start getting
macerated<00:03:34.690> alright<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.840> there<00:03:36.080> we<00:03:36.230> go<00:03:36.410> so

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
macerated alright and there we go so

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.050 
macerated alright and there we go so
with<00:03:38.990> that<00:03:39.170> also<00:03:39.590> just<00:03:39.830> remember<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.670> you

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
with that also just remember that you

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.510 
with that also just remember that you
want<00:03:41.300> all<00:03:41.780> your<00:03:42.050> items<00:03:42.140> going<00:03:42.590> in<00:03:42.830> at<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.310> top

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
want all your items going in at the top

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.610 
want all your items going in at the top
and<00:03:43.730> out<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.210> sides<00:03:44.450> we've<00:03:45.140> put<00:03:45.320> them<00:03:45.440> in<00:03:45.500> out

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
and out the sides we've put them in out

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.290 
and out the sides we've put them in out
the<00:03:45.710> sides<00:03:45.950> they<00:03:46.310> won't<00:03:46.520> get<00:03:46.640> macerated<00:03:47.180> love

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
the sides they won't get macerated love

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.540 
the sides they won't get macerated love
just<00:03:47.510> going<00:03:47.750> here<00:03:47.990> and<00:03:48.200> that's<00:03:48.950> basically<00:03:49.250> it

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
just going here and that's basically it
