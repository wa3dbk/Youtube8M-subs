 congratulated like the athletes 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.160
 copies that are if it's like a fever 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.470
 especially I think that the same 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.230
 way is going to happen here in Lima in 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.720
 huancayo adds in my land where I am 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.430

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.940
 powers and black has raised with a few 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.290
 super energies I feel not even 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.290
 tired on the contrary 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.930
 I love 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.030
 according to the world health organization 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.220
 running daily helps our 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.870
 body work several muscles because 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.780
 our bones get stronger 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.910
 ms side says that this sport helps 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.100
 generate neurons thus avoiding the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.350
 alzheimer but if this still does not 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.480
 convinces to already get out of his bed and 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.640
 do a little exercise we remind you 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.940
 that running also helps with the reduction 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.280
 of infarct risks the improvement by 50% 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.650
 in the efficiency of the lungs but 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.110
 before running it is important to take in 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.640
 account some details I started 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.130
 running with my sports clothes with the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.900
 that work but to run definitively 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.670
 I came running shoes 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.740
 example to run is very important 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.810
 because it depends on the sole of the plant 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.940
 of the same damping are 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.670
 light and more do not weigh and have a 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.340
 ventilation takes no longer takes then then 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.770
 the foot when the heat of the tread of 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.510
 constantly track between UNAM 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.370
 then puts heat vent 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.140
 compression that adjust the calf 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.180
 part of the calf has the adjustment 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.680
 exact for a broker to have a 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.569
 muscular fatigue 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.219
 I do not know is a town that is not suitable 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.010
 you can have problems even health 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:14.319
 or many times the cotton polo that 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.919
 they think it's the best but the colander 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:21.220
 a sponge gets wet doubts and it 's that sweat 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.860
 it is there in the model pole here that 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.050
 is the 920 that is the best we have 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.699
 until the moment that is it serves for 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.380
 run but also have to split the curtain 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.780
 because it is aquatic you can use it 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.699
 for the sea that bicycle and to run 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.930
 I'll look at the way you're going 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.160
 had the calories account with the 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.630
 calories you lose during the 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.669
 training to be well informed not 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.470
 enough we also have to carry a 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.080
 disciplined life if we want to achieve 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.750
 our goals is you do not have to 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.570
 be thirsty to drink liquid 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.180
 we run and sweat and come back 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.849
 amounts that you can not imagine the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.680
 amount of sweating then the 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.400
 moisturizing with a moisturizing drink 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.169
 gatorade I put this bottle my 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.360
 children kilometers and then the again 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.070
 I fill it and I make my instance against 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.070
 because they are hydrates in our diet 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:18.289
 protein a little carbohydrates 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.370
