00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 mr johannes here from news.de and the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.649
 is my review for the new 13 inches 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.649
 apple macbook pro retina early 2015 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.040
 first we go to the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.929
 technical data a look what 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.760
 has improved over the predecessor 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.320
 or newly added 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.180
 and then there is also a small one 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.330
 compare with my 13 inch apple 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.369
 macbook pro the 2013 in the third 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.769
 generation of the intel core i5 processor 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 Let's get to design first 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.500
 There is not much now 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.860
 changed that still has a nice one 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.140
 Aluminum unibody housing and you can 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.149
 from the outside do not really realize that 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.680
 i let him do new macbook pro 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.149
 most of the changes are in 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 been made inside 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.140
 apple now puts on the fifth here 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.379
 generation of intel core i processors 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.079
 codename broadway this image processor 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.110
 will be dealt with in the 14th name 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.809
 made is performant and even more 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.789
 more energy efficient than its predecessors 9 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.350
 13 inch macbook pro retina you can 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.360
 now choose between the intel core i5 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:11.100
 with 2.7 ghz turbo up to 3.1 ghz intel 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.250
 core i5 with 2.9 ghz turbo to 33 ghz and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 the intel core i7 with 3.1 ghz turbo up 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.509
 3 4 ghz 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.540
 these are all dual core processors and 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.680
 the tester has an intel core i5 2 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.720
 7 ghz 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.520
 I think that's just the model 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.000
 is what most choose 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.530
 become 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.810
 You can then also 8 or 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.549
 Select 16 gb ram and you have the choice 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.880
 between 128 256 512 or one terabyte 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.439
 pc ebase flash storage this new flash 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.360
 storage was also upgraded again 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.430
 and now offers even faster 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.470
 transfer rates the display has not changed 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.890
 still changed a 13 inch tall 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.680
 display with retina resolution are 2560 x 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.680
 1600 pixels as internal graphics solution 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.420
 comes the intel as 6100 with the use 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.890
 shared memory I'm not a friend of 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.649
 benchmarks that's why I have something 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.320
 Realistically taken one 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.429
 file by meyer gopro about nine minutes 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.670
 long and then working under and at 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.560
 my 2013 a macbook has that 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.770
 export two minutes 4 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.209
 40 degrees and at 90 1 minute 51 it is 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.989
 in any case already clear 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.430
 more quickly 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.080
 and then I have the same video too 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.150
 edited a bit more 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.620
 So added white effects 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.690
 equalized etc 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.099
 and then export it to mine 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.319
 2013 macbook 15 minutes 22 used and 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.390
 at the new 2015 macbook pro 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.860
 only six minutes eleventh are on each 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.019
 case impressive results and me 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.769
 I think I will become the new macbook 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.450
 have to change 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.530
 Let's go to the connections there 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.680
 we have on the left side the 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.690
 22 times the bolt once usb and magsafe 22 man 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.000
 a headphone jack on the right 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.100
 side are a usb port hdmi 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.200
 and a card reader and look now 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.180
 Let's look at a new component of the macbook 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.090
 pro and the new board 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.860
 trackpad where they are now in new macbook 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.340
 presented but apple still has it 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.110
 brought on the 13 inch macbook pro like that 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.140
 say it a really very innovative 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.330
 touchpad who knew the predecessor of the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.819
 know that it was almost everywhere 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.040
 but it can really just click 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.040
 bottom left and right just on 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.109
 is the simplest and the new ford 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.709
 You can easily touch trackpad anywhere 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.959
 click 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.340
 there the feeling is the same that is 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.930
 In any case, really, really 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.970
 nice especially for drag &amp; drop or something 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.910
 and then there are those too 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.730
 possibility of a special further 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.319
 use the click and the research 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.420
 click one then you have one more 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.299
 another click after the normal click 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.489
 and that's for example yes in 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.220
 quicktime audition videos faster 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.319
 or for example in the browser words 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.359
 so really cool and looking up 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.370
 I think developers will be yours 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.489
 next weeks also very much 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.889
 Build cool features into your apps 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.180
 last but not least the battery life so 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.459
 Of course, the battery life depends entirely 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.750
 from how you use the notebook 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.819
 I just have two now 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.190
 realistic scenarios selected once 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.840
 surf and watch videos once 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.600
 the results are quite good we have 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.180
 here when surfing eight hours 40 and 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.400
 when filming nine hours 30 so 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.410
 so you can go really well 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.060
 work so what can she do after almost now 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.539
 two weeks with the new 13 inches 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.460
 say macbook pro retina 2015 is up 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.000
 every case a very good notebook for 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.880
 but 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.700
 offers a lot of power the pages 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.020
 connections team and needed but would be 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.670
 of course, a little more power 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.800
 that should perhaps be that 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.180
 15 inch macbook pro cinema look there 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.080
 come the quad core processors from 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.630
 intel for use 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.470
 and you can also do a dedicated one 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.990
 graphics card choose who his notebook 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.080
 mostly for surfing for choose for 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.880
 youtube office or for 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.680
 personal video editing uses the 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.510
 comes with the 13 inch macbook per girl 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.120
 Definitely have fun so that 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.000
 was my review of the 9 13 inch apple 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.530
 macbook pro retina july 2015 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.760
 if you liked the video then 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.410
 Of course, I also want to be very happy 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.900
 if you give this video a thumbs up here 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.640
 high on youtube there and my channel 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.500
 subscribed and if you have any 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.330
 ask to the thunderstorms that she poses 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.620
 just below in the comments and 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.090
 she wants to try for you so fast 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.100
 as possible to answer 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.169
 also you can find below in the video 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.020
 description still a link where it is 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.640
 So to buy new Macbook are many 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.150
 thanks for watching around to my 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.150
 next video
