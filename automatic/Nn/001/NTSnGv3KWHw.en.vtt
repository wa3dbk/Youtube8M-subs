00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.349
 hello welcome to the saints today 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:14.019
 we are with me in a revision to the king 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.490
 of the skid that was verified by 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.710
 rockstar one of the last races 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.150
 verified by rockstar good and ok 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.920
 hello good friends Yes we are here 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.689
 in a race for good in principle 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.830
 we had to beat the record the record 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.630
 of the world we had done 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.940
 we were looking to improve the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.930
 record because the first two try 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.760
 two we fell and this one was perfect if 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.620
 so perfect that I only had to 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.730
 baquet go and there on the bike and now you 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.730
 I visited all beings 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.690
 this track is the one I like the most 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.210
 every game I'm behind like that in a 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.300
 curve entry between arming no longer 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.489
 you can catch it well 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.210
 yes and we are also playing with the payo 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.340
 ball and with ram贸n pi who are two friends 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.949
 of the game and the payo boli I met him ago 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.560
 enough time here in the gta I saw that 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.180
 I played pretty well and I said look 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.180
 do a couple of missions put what 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.740
 that they like and career puts ram贸n what 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.320
 that passes from that time also the sector 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.590
 follow ram贸n is here is a friend of mine of 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.659
 my city and well he bought the gta and 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.399
 then I bought it myself and it's the 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.470
 better points really not having 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.630
 here we see that ahead we 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.990
 They advanced to exit because it is animal and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.240
 do not go ahead because I say yes yes 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.610
 I risk going ahead here I 'm going 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.550
 to fall and wait a little bit and behind 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.620
 letting him do 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.040
 then you'll see that they come 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.810
 in the image that is the first to the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.510
 second round already 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.690
 here we change the camera 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.160
 and well it's late I could go 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.370
 explaining a little each path if 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.710
 you want the circuit yes clear good 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.960
 now to be rally on the bike the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.850
 great that do not run anything at all and it's 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.000
 practically the whole circuit is a 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.940
 background are thorough circuits - the first 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.890
 bend after nothing else pass the goal 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.810
 you have to touch the brake a bit more 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.610
 that nothing to ensure to see you thoroughly 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.680
 You could do the rally and next 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.090
 now you are also thoroughly although the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.250
 that comes now you also have to touch 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.100
 a little bit the brake to ensure good 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.570
 but if you could do it thoroughly there it 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.310
 they gave it and well explain what is a 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.020
 rally race when you make a 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.450
 rally race buy that you can run 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.160
 with your partner and you have to choose what 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.740
 position you want to have on the motorcycle or 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:37.680
 pilot copilot not clear this account is 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.459
 the month and a second round we did 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.990
 the the lap time record yes there 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.950
 is the market world record by 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.950
 rockstar 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.440
 and nobody is in the third round and 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:55.660
 we have broken that world record 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.630
 and now we're going to beat the record of 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.140
 total time for what we end up with 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.910
 4 minutes later but not if now what 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.430
 we look good because if they were 4 minutes 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.960
 and few and there are some curves that 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.390
 we take that we saved ourselves by little 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.860
 like that for example that per day and the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.400
 curb that comes next that 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.890
 let's always take it very very 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.810
 just in itself yes you have to hurry a lot 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.390
 to be here is to do it well you have 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.190
 to go inside the ballet to the 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.200
 machine you have to enter inside already 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.480
 throw you in almost taking against the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.220
 wall 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.540
 to fuck her really well if she does not bounce 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.269
 much the bike and you go out 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.730
 and this will also drive like the 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.730
 Great tourism surely not if I 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.469
 always everything that games are always 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.079
 I have played great tourism games 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:46.640
 cars always car games not the 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.670
 truth is that I have not played anything else and the 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.430
 gta because good has everything and put on 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.470
 very fashionable when the vice city and from 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.579
 then the gta iv is very cool 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.250
 now they have implanted this for him 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.310
 perfect as the 7th race is fucking 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.530
 mother 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.099
 also say that we know several 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.280
 riders from here like the cannibal 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.530
 cannibal as the chief as bnp who runs 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.440
 very well with bikes we will also put in 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.380
 the channel some circuit with them that 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.150
 We have pending but good for now 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.669
 we are in this root race of the skid 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.669
 remember we go for the world record 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.440
 named are hard to peel with him 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.710
 like the cannibal and in the pdk are canaries 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.560
 and here in the Canary Islands, there are so many 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.060
 motoring enthusiasm to the world of rally 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.600
 the good races already we entered in goal 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.600
 I 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.220
 but wait for ram贸n 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:58.280
 the pony 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.690
 if you do not take it to hit the curve it's 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.790
 very fast also this track yes yes it 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.920
 It also gives the bike and the bike 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.140

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.420
