00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 Hello welcome to us 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.179
 at home in the house with the big sofa we 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.010
 Yesterday I was the first time up 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.620
 the fabric market and that was the in 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.730
 hamburg the holland fabric market and me 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.710
 show you our goal is the power of that 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.180
 was is a super exciting thing wants 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.800
 I'll go and then go 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.320
 Hamburg is 100 kilometers from here 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.730
 and in downtown I drive 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.630
 actually not so much anymore 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.460
 that is always very stressful though 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.620
 this fabric market that was nice that is 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.219
 not even in the middle of hamburg that is the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.280
 part 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.660
 I'm hamburger where I then popular 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.309
 that I could remember it though 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.289
 at least I know myself a bit 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.020
 out and when we liked him with one 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.510
 girlfriend and her daughter and one 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.539
 supposed change and that was total 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.760
 nice because the sun has shone and 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.180
 it was very busy 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.160
 you have to do a bit of this 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.290
 this mentality earlier 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.119
 Aldi on Wednesdays at 8 gave the one must 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.869
 a bit off but can be gorgeous 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.360
 beautiful fabrics 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.310
 I really like to talk to the dutch 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.770
 this indeed hear the accent 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.229
 The German could sweet are the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.939
 somehow that has me a lot 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.729
 made fun you have me really good 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.049
 weather so i was armed with one 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.640
 small book and after me your money 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.619
 had brought and then back again 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.180
 drink and eat and I do not know 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.479
 what's finally happening again 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.280
 and it was jam-packed so really 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.119
 really full 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.520
 but I got scared what I got 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.619
 I wanted and I ordered 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.060
 of colors mix johanna this is one 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.790
 sewing pattern for a name 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.320
 and that has baffled the melli and 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.500
 sewn sewn for you 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.850
 that was a remake wednesday project and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.620
 he has become fantastically beautiful 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.720
 she has a light plastic 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.370
 taken outside then she has a green one 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.410
 taken forage and really great 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.700
 Apply this with the applications 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.080
 I will certainly not be able to do that 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.600
 but mary really inspired me there 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.220
 So I want that too I can 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.479
 no hoods then I know now 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.330
 Not at all how I should do it 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.860
 is the hangover rioting at the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.090
 I do not have to cut it normally 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.920
 more I have to look again if 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.970
 the least christopher and then 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.860
 temperature 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.750
 He wants to see this dress and that 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.670
 I would like to take me 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.200
 which is a long greater totally 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.780
 nice because I'm alone 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.700
 and I think that's nice at all 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.950
 i can not put money on it so web 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.100
 is not I show you something 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.519
 for fabrics i found and i 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.680
 even plug in so here is mine 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.000
 exploitative days with plastic bags on the 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.560
 table I actually still have that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.390
 times requested because the barrier 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.280
 have written on facebook show me 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.739
 what you bought or china yes good 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.500
 then I drive that mine there 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:59.040
 estimated on the internet here may yes 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.570
 really nice so i have one 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.530
 comes there and then you see first 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.790
 big big boxes with many rests and 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.890
 yes, I struck there 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.010
 that is actually doing you 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.150
 just kind of good driving but where I am 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.150
 still do not know where to take feet 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:24.220
 that is always 60 x 140 and cotton 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.440
 what can you always need and this 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.920
 I originally wanted to down to the 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.090
 ranmachen coat which is a taffeta rest 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.290
 But it does not fit color anymore 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.090
 because I changed my mind with the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.310
 That's why the colors are over 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.290
 And if you are looking forward to buy then there 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.430
 it's one of the cheap so once 350 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.010
 gave it in vain 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.410
 that's a good one 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.950
 the beginning is 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.230
 Then I found Velcro what 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.890
 not self-adhesive is super 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.410
 namely for the summer skirt for mine 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:02.440
 bag then I have a great one here 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:04.690
 I also found words so yes 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.580
 There is no use at all 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.280
 for this but absolutely beautiful and since it costs 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.720
 I do not remember now 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.109
 that's three meters and I believe four 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.109
 Euro 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.260
 and then I shopped again 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.040
 all love to roll too early too 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.510
 or fox 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.510
 So that's my owls booty 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.950
 I already had pins in use 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:45.640
 are totally beautiful so now comes one 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.550
 small piece and that I needed there 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.060
 for the rockstar you need 46 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.830
 is this the colors I can believe 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:02.260
 well, and I feel good about it 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:05.260
 great on that is a thin flow 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.790
 the material I find very nice because you can 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.500
 It does not cost this zipper 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.600
 Somehow now here in the apartment 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.080
 I'm not that convinced 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:17.080
 but this africa did not exist either 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.920
 therefore I would probably 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.960
 easy to use 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.850
 that is the fabric is the upper part of the is 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.680
 actually thick and fluid somehow 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:29.200
 so i know is a summer dress 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.140
 actually rather unusual but mine 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.490
 with coming ladies thought of the sound 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.840
 And the saleswoman also said it 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.140
 that's great too and that's the way it is 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.580
 a mix and the things everything fits 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.600
 so from jabbed lauda feels 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.190
 great and different my dress i 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.720
 hope is one that sums up that I can do 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.180
 do not show because he's women 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.740
 pattern are, respectively 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.280
 a must is not easy to pass on 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.860
 and second, there are so many parts 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.910
 so something always difficult at first 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:05.150
 so now my coat is 4 this is 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.250
 a very nice denim in gray can 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.949
 I totally good for me presented me 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.960
 and fittingly I wanted somehow 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.870
 From this fabric take what the five 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.729
 my daughter looks great too 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.710
 most expensive stuffed animal kavlak of the cost 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.870
 namely actually 12 euros the meter 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.449
 is also more expensive there is also much 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.729
 cheaper that was about the me 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.960
 bought yesterday when I got there 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.250
 to make the bags outside or 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.290
 maybe a fence around it below 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:35.389
 or I'll have a look then 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.070
 I bought words , there she was 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.450
 not exactly where the long but I think 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.030
 they land somehow I have to 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:45.940
 watch if that fits together and that is 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:48.610
 my condition the goods have cheap malley 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.900
 flows exactly I have this profession 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.030
 Do not ask me what it is 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.229
 is easy on a one 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.760
 elastic piece that is in jersey so 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:07:00.169
 I'm actually completely ignorant 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.280
 as far as substances go there and says 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.990
 I need that and that and then give 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.610
 me that I did not like here 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.960
 I think you fit in my coat I 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.870
 I just asked if I'm in math with it 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.639
 is then said yes so bought and red 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.560
 I think I can dress well too 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.030
 so that's my feed material and 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.440
 due to this I have again borte 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:21.470
 So let's have a look so I will 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.650
 sure somehow drape that that 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.210
 everything a bit playful 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.910
 and that's unusual 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:33.080
 unusual coat is yes that is 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:35.740
 my holland fabric market hall and me 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.740
 I hope you like it
