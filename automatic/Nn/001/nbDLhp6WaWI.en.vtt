00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.660
 when I saw it I immediately got it 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.939

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.780
 they are what it costs and so on 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.660
 but I can tell you that it is not a 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.309
 subscription and shipping in Italy and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.350

 March etc. and so on 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.530
 and now let's start with this opening e 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.770
 review of this bb box then when 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.910
 open the mini-box as usual 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.719
 first thing you find is the postcard 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.390
 indispensable because they are all 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.860
 Korean products on the labels and everything 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.950
 written in Korean so if you don't have it 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.850
 this informational postcard 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:17.700
 you are a little lost and in this mini box 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.560
 there are 5 glazes from here chan and vi 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.490
 send these five colors now 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.380
 I'll show you 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.119
 these are these and as you can see they are 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.420
 very vivid colors pop and for that yes 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.799
 he calls the mini box and I speak from 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.829
 the darker one going from the one over 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.990
 clear the color is this dark purple e 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.780
 very pigmented , just one is enough 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.540
 passed then we have this fuchsia color 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.270
 purple cyclamen this too much 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.940
 pigmented and you need only one pass e 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.549
 when it dries, you finish a little 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.659
 crazier than others who are more 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.960
 on the other hand, we have this red 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.390
 cold red rose let's say a lot a lot 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.750
 nice very pigmented just one 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.000
 passed this orange highlighter 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.819
 this is also very nice a lot more 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.430
 imitated that overturns a single pass e 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.350
 finally this green turned on a little 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.180
 this highlight too 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.880
 and this is the only one who writes a little 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.150
 less and then to get this color 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.100
 here you need two of these all 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.130
 enamels are very easy to apply and 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.830
 they do not splinter easily we say e 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:37.350
 then the second the second products are i 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.500
 then saracens fluorescent glitters 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.340
 four small bottles arrive like this 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.930
 glitter these are silvered these 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.930
 they are black these are electric blue and 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.450
 these lasted and with these you can 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.840
 embellish your nails again by 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.310
 more 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.350
 and these were all the products that 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.540
 there were in fact written in a postcard 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.670
 this mini box costs 18 dollars 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.329
 but the total value and all these 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.720
 productive and the 46 dollars because each 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.880
 Nail polish costs 4 dollars and each bottle 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.090
 of glitter costs 6 dollars 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.780
 But I also received this spa 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.019
 Water twin towers boys racing tops 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.780
 mask which is practically a mask of 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.720
 top for the skin 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.390
 this is the packaging 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.080
 very very nice the applicator 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.720
 so you crush and come out of it 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.490
 this gel and this is a mask that 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.770
 therefore it serves to purify the pores 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.170
 eliminate all impurities close i 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.110
 pores and also blackheads etc. e 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.280
 it also makes the skin brighter more 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.070
 homogeneous 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.930
 I tried it several times and it works ed 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.750
 is one of those masks that make the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.210
 bubbles one of the first minibox I have 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.040
 received had all the products for the 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.520
 skin care and in that video vi 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.410
 I also show the application is a 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.690
 couple of those products just after 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.820
 the application made these bubbles 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.790
 which you then went to massage into 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.430
 skin and helped precisely to purify i 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.080
 pores and this mask is very similar to 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.580
 the ones it's all 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.470
