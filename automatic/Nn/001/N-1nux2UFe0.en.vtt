00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.410 
bones cut and how the screw is placed
into<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.800> bone<00:04:55.950> this<00:04:56.520> is<00:04:56.670> a<00:04:56.700> person's<00:04:57.180> foot

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
into the bone this is a person's foot

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.210 
into the bone this is a person's foot
that<00:04:57.540> just<00:04:57.750> had<00:04:57.900> surgery<00:04:58.170> about<00:04:58.590> six<00:04:58.980> weeks

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
that just had surgery about six weeks

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.520 
that just had surgery about six weeks
ago<00:04:59.460> and<00:04:59.850> right<00:05:00.510> here<00:05:00.540> again<00:05:01.140> is<00:05:01.260> where<00:05:01.440> the

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
ago and right here again is where the

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.530 
ago and right here again is where the
bunion<00:05:02.310> lies<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:02.880> can<00:05:03.000> see<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.180> soft

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
bunion lies and you can see the soft

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.630 
bunion lies and you can see the soft
tissue<00:05:03.810> swelling<00:05:04.260> that's<00:05:04.920> occurring<00:05:05.310> around

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
tissue swelling that's occurring around

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.040 
tissue swelling that's occurring around
here<00:05:06.330> okay<00:05:07.460> what<00:05:08.460> we<00:05:08.610> do<00:05:08.790> is<00:05:09.030> we<00:05:09.180> went<00:05:09.540> in<00:05:09.750> we

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
here okay what we do is we went in we

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.140 
here okay what we do is we went in we
remove<00:05:10.440> this<00:05:10.680> small<00:05:10.980> segment<00:05:11.520> of<00:05:11.580> bone<00:05:11.790> here

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
remove this small segment of bone here

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.050 
remove this small segment of bone here
we<00:05:12.720> shifted<00:05:13.230> this<00:05:13.500> segment<00:05:13.980> of<00:05:14.010> bone<00:05:14.190> over<00:05:14.430> in

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
we shifted this segment of bone over in

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.750 
we shifted this segment of bone over in
this<00:05:15.270> direction<00:05:15.330> like<00:05:16.080> this<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.760> therefore

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
this direction like this and therefore

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.880 
this direction like this and therefore
were<00:05:18.210> allowed<00:05:18.450> to<00:05:18.480> realign<00:05:19.170> the<00:05:19.440> sesamoid

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
were allowed to realign the sesamoid

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.500 
were allowed to realign the sesamoid
bones<00:05:20.130> assess<00:05:20.490> my<00:05:20.640> bones<00:05:20.880> are<00:05:21.030> sitting<00:05:21.330> right

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
bones assess my bones are sitting right

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.780 
bones assess my bones are sitting right
here<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.050> right<00:05:22.080> here<00:05:22.770> right<00:05:23.190> now<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.520> which

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
here and right here right now and which

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.640 
here and right here right now and which
you<00:05:23.820> can<00:05:24.060> see<00:05:24.090> in<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.600> post-operative<00:05:25.080> view

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
you can see in the post-operative view

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.790 
you can see in the post-operative view
is<00:05:25.860> that<00:05:25.920> the<00:05:26.910> sesamoid<00:05:27.540> bones<00:05:27.840> are<00:05:28.170> realigned

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
is that the sesamoid bones are realigned

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.530 
is that the sesamoid bones are realigned
right<00:05:29.460> here<00:05:29.790> right<00:05:30.030> where<00:05:30.060> they<00:05:30.270> should<00:05:30.300> be

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
right here right where they should be

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.850 
right here right where they should be
and<00:05:32.480> that<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:33.660> bone<00:05:33.900> is<00:05:34.170> a<00:05:34.200> nice<00:05:34.500> alignment

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
and that the bone is a nice alignment

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.950 
and that the bone is a nice alignment
and<00:05:35.250> you<00:05:35.340> can<00:05:35.490> see<00:05:35.730> how<00:05:35.910> the<00:05:35.970> angulation<00:05:36.600> or

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
and you can see how the angulation or

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.600 
and you can see how the angulation or
the<00:05:37.050> distance<00:05:37.230> now<00:05:37.500> between<00:05:37.980> this<00:05:38.190> bone<00:05:38.430> and

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
the distance now between this bone and

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.790 
the distance now between this bone and
this<00:05:38.670> bone<00:05:38.910> is<00:05:38.940> a<00:05:39.150> lot<00:05:39.420> less<00:05:39.660> the<00:05:40.380> toe<00:05:40.590> is<00:05:40.770> a

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
this bone is a lot less the toe is a

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.500 
this bone is a lot less the toe is a
nice<00:05:41.070> straight<00:05:41.520> alignment<00:05:41.790> with<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.150> first
