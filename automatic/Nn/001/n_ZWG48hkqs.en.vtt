00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.910 
plus to making your own pastry is that
you<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.570> control<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.140> amount<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.530> sweetness

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you can control the amount of sweetness

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.830 
you can control the amount of sweetness
that<00:01:53.100> goes<00:01:53.399> into<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.299> I'm<00:01:54.390> only<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.720> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that goes into it so I'm only going to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.209 
that goes into it so I'm only going to
put<00:01:55.020> about<00:01:55.520> two<00:01:56.520> tablespoons<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:57.600> honey<00:01:58.219> so

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
put about two tablespoons of honey so

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.010 
put about two tablespoons of honey so
I'm<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> stir<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.600> all<00:02:00.810> together

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
I'm just going to stir this all together

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
I'm just going to stir this all together
until<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.829> well<00:02:01.890> incorporated

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.140 

look<00:02:07.040> at<00:02:07.160> how<00:02:07.220> beautiful<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.670> looks<00:02:08.000> it

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.150 
look at how beautiful that looks it

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.940 
look at how beautiful that looks it
almost<00:02:08.360> looks<00:02:08.570> like<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.750> custard<00:02:09.290> I<00:02:09.500> would<00:02:09.680> dive

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
almost looks like a custard I would dive

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.350 
almost looks like a custard I would dive
into<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.340> right<00:02:10.520> now<00:02:10.670> if<00:02:10.820> it<00:02:10.880> didn't<00:02:11.090> have<00:02:11.210> an

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
well and you can also just bake it as a

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.150 
well and you can also just bake it as a
as<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:34.850> sort<00:02:35.240> of<00:02:35.330> flan<00:02:35.750> or<00:02:36.110> pudding<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.710> top<00:02:36.980> it

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
as a sort of flan or pudding and top it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.040 
as a sort of flan or pudding and top it
with<00:02:37.190> fresh<00:02:37.550> berries<00:02:38.030> not<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.510> give<00:02:38.660> this<00:02:38.810> some

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
with fresh berries not to give this some

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.750 
with fresh berries not to give this some
Middle<00:02:39.320> Eastern<00:02:39.710> Flair<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.520> have<00:02:41.530> fig<00:02:42.530> jam

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
Middle Eastern Flair I have fig jam

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.820 
Middle Eastern Flair I have fig jam
usually<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.790> make<00:02:44.060> my<00:02:44.210> own<00:02:44.240> fig<00:02:44.750> jam<00:02:44.780> in<00:02:45.350> the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
usually I make my own fig jam in the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.750 
usually I make my own fig jam in the
summer<00:02:46.270> but<00:02:47.270> right<00:02:47.660> now<00:02:47.810> it's<00:02:48.050> not<00:02:48.250> fig<00:02:49.250> season

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
summer but right now it's not fig season

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.150 
summer but right now it's not fig season
so<00:02:50.090> fig<00:02:50.540> jam<00:02:50.570> does<00:02:51.140> just<00:02:51.500> as<00:02:51.680> well<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:52.040> it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
so fig jam does just as well and it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.640 
so fig jam does just as well and it
gives<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.490> that<00:02:52.520> nice<00:02:52.900> Middle<00:02:53.900> Eastern<00:02:54.320> flavor

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
gives it that nice Middle Eastern flavor

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.560 
gives it that nice Middle Eastern flavor
and<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.280> don't<00:02:55.490> need<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.790> go<00:02:55.880> crazy<00:02:56.150> with<00:02:56.450> the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
and you don't need to go crazy with the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.330 
and you don't need to go crazy with the
fig<00:02:56.750> jam<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.500> just<00:02:57.710> because<00:02:57.980> it's<00:02:58.130> gonna

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
spread so just about like a teaspoon and

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.970 
spread so just about like a teaspoon and
a<00:03:02.960> half<00:03:03.010> just<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.130> give<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.460> that<00:03:04.580> beautiful

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
of mixing east and west this is what's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.430 
of mixing east and west this is what's
really<00:03:14.150> going<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.510> set<00:03:14.690> things<00:03:14.870> apart<00:03:15.290> from

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
really going to set things apart from
