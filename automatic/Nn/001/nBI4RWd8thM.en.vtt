right now so one of the newest features
with<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> sandbox<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.269> our<00:00:27.599> now<00:00:27.750> console

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
with the sandbox is our now console

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.349 
with the sandbox is our now console
options<00:00:28.619> basically<00:00:29.460> all<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.000> do<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
working for that i'm working on to the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.650 
working for that i'm working on to the
xbox<00:00:34.440> 360<00:00:34.920> or<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> playstation<00:00:36.210> 3<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.450> it's

xbox 360 or the playstation 3 and it's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.959 
xbox 360 or the playstation 3 and it's
simply<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:36.960> an<00:00:37.260> enabled<00:00:37.620> checkbox<00:00:37.969> once

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
simply just an enabled checkbox once

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.850 
simply just an enabled checkbox once
I've<00:00:39.090> checked<00:00:39.300> these<00:00:39.450> off<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
I've checked these off you can see that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.380 
I've checked these off you can see that
i<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.100> actually<00:00:41.250> synchronize<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> camera

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
i can actually synchronize the camera

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
i can actually synchronize the camera
across<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.440> xbox<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:44.070> well<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
across the xbox as well as the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.400 
across the xbox as well as the
playstation<00:00:45.270> 3<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> everything<00:00:48.960> i'm<00:00:49.079> doing<00:00:49.110> in

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
playstation 3 so everything i'm doing in

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.900 
playstation 3 so everything i'm doing in
the<00:00:49.530> editor<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.550> all<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> way

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the editor here is going all the way

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.500 
the editor here is going all the way
across<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.750> both<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> consoles<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:54.390> we

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
across to both the consoles so we

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.790 
across to both the consoles so we
haven't<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.870> made<00:00:54.960> improvements<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
haven't just made improvements to the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.590 
haven't just made improvements to the
sandbox<00:00:56.190> interface<00:00:56.670> we've<00:00:57.000> also<00:00:57.180> made<00:00:57.390> major

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
sandbox interface we've also made major

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.119 
sandbox interface we've also made major
improvements<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.410> rendering<00:00:58.829> engine

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
improvements on the rendering engine

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.680 
improvements on the rendering engine
what<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> want<00:00:59.940> to<00:00:59.969> show<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.149> real<00:01:00.359> quick<00:01:00.390> is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
what I want to show you real quick is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.520 
what I want to show you real quick is
our<00:01:00.809> deferred<00:01:01.050> lighting<00:01:01.379> system

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.500 

so<00:01:09.159> obviously<00:01:09.820> lights<00:01:10.090> are<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.299> keys<00:01:10.479> to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
so obviously lights are the keys to

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.200 
so obviously lights are the keys to
making<00:01:10.720> things<00:01:11.110> look<00:01:11.320> nice<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:12.640> we<00:01:12.970> create

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
making things look nice as we create

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.969 
making things look nice as we create
more<00:01:13.360> lights<00:01:13.600> in<00:01:13.720> a<00:01:13.810> scene<00:01:14.020> more<00:01:14.650> lights<00:01:14.830> are

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
more lights in a scene more lights are

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.200 
more lights in a scene more lights are
interacting<00:01:15.430> with<00:01:15.549> the<00:01:15.640> objects<00:01:16.030> in<00:01:16.090> the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
interacting with the objects in the

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.700 
interacting with the objects in the
scene<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.570> obviously<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.320> textures<00:01:17.619> are

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
scene and obviously the textures are

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.020 
scene and obviously the textures are
going<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.920> pop<00:01:18.100> a<00:01:18.130> lot<00:01:18.369> more<00:01:18.520> normal<00:01:18.880> map

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
going to pop a lot more normal map

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.180 
going to pop a lot more normal map
specular<00:01:19.540> maps<00:01:19.750> anything<00:01:20.170> like<00:01:20.320> this<00:01:20.500> so<00:01:21.100> what

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
specular maps anything like this so what

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.440 
specular maps anything like this so what
I'm<00:01:21.280> going<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.430> do<00:01:21.580> here<00:01:21.790> I'm<00:01:21.880> just<00:01:22.090> grabbing<00:01:22.210> a

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
I'm going to do here I'm just grabbing a

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.510 
I'm going to do here I'm just grabbing a
light<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:23.259> I'm<00:01:23.710> going<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:23.920> move<00:01:24.009> it<00:01:24.159> around<00:01:24.190> in

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
light and I'm going to move it around in

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.680 
light and I'm going to move it around in
the<00:01:24.550> hallway<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:24.909> as<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.210> can<00:01:25.330> see<00:01:25.360> that's

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
the hallway and as you can see that's

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.600 
the hallway and as you can see that's
updating<00:01:26.110> on<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.259> ps3<00:01:26.530> as<00:01:26.830> well<00:01:26.979> as<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.250> xbox

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
updating on the ps3 as well as the xbox

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.680 
updating on the ps3 as well as the xbox
so<00:01:27.759> we'll<00:01:27.940> make<00:01:28.090> some<00:01:28.240> more<00:01:28.390> major

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
so we'll make some more major

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.210 
so we'll make some more major
modifications<00:01:29.440> to<00:01:29.560> this<00:01:29.680> deferred<00:01:29.979> light

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
modifications to this deferred light

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.080 
modifications to this deferred light
here<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:32.110> I'm<00:01:32.229> upping<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.560> radius<00:01:32.860> 25<00:01:33.190> change

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
here so I'm upping the radius 25 change

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.180 
here so I'm upping the radius 25 change
the<00:01:34.240> diffuse<00:01:34.540> multiplier<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.290> bring<00:01:35.950> up<00:01:36.070> the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
the diffuse multiplier and bring up the

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.100 
the diffuse multiplier and bring up the
specular<00:01:36.580> now<00:01:37.540> it's<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:37.780> little<00:01:37.960> blue<00:01:38.080> and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
specular now it's a little blue and

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.480 
specular now it's a little blue and
washed<00:01:38.440> out<00:01:38.649> i'm<00:01:38.830> just<00:01:38.979> going<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.159> change<00:01:39.399> it

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
washed out i'm just going to change it

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.249 
washed out i'm just going to change it
to<00:01:39.580> maybe<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.790> green<00:01:40.030> color<00:01:40.299> something<00:01:41.110> like

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
to maybe a green color something like

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.540 
to maybe a green color something like
this<00:01:41.289> and<00:01:41.619> you<00:01:41.710> see<00:01:41.860> how<00:01:41.979> easy<00:01:42.220> it<00:01:42.429> is<00:01:42.490> to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
this and you see how easy it is to

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.639 
this and you see how easy it is to
actually<00:01:42.850> manipulate<00:01:43.119> this<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:43.929> change

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
actually manipulate this and change

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.740 
actually manipulate this and change
everything<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.399> want<00:01:45.610> directly<00:01:46.509> on<00:01:46.659> the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
everything that you want directly on the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.260 
everything that you want directly on the
playstation<00:01:47.229> 3<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:47.440> xbox<00:01:47.590> 360<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:49.030> if<00:01:49.119> you're

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
playstation 3 and xbox 360 so if you're

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.149 
playstation 3 and xbox 360 so if you're
a<00:01:49.300> developer<00:01:49.450> making<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.229> multi-platform<00:01:50.740> game

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
a developer making a multi-platform game

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.550 
a developer making a multi-platform game
this<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.880> essential<00:01:52.750> tool<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.200> be<00:01:53.319> able<00:01:53.350> to

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
this is a essential tool to be able to

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.930 
this is a essential tool to be able to
compare<00:01:53.860> what<00:01:54.100> your<00:01:54.250> game<00:01:54.399> is<00:01:54.429> looking<00:01:54.789> like

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
compare what your game is looking like

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.779 
compare what your game is looking like
on<00:01:55.149> consoles<00:01:56.159> there's<00:01:57.159> a<00:01:57.250> couple<00:01:57.369> more<00:01:57.580> nice

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
on consoles there's a couple more nice

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.550 
on consoles there's a couple more nice
features<00:01:58.179> with<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.450> deferred<00:01:58.720> lighting<00:01:59.020> we

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
features with the deferred lighting we

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.020 
features with the deferred lighting we
can<00:01:59.679> do<00:01:59.800> a<00:01:59.830> lot<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.159> different<00:02:00.310> lighting<00:02:00.700> types

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
can do a lot of different lighting types

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.660 
can do a lot of different lighting types
so<00:02:01.300> this<00:02:02.050> one<00:02:02.259> for<00:02:02.440> example<00:02:02.470> is<00:02:03.039> going<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.550> be<00:02:03.640> a

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
so this one for example is going to be a

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.730 
so this one for example is going to be a
projection<00:02:04.030> type<00:02:04.300> light<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:05.319> as<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.470> can<00:02:05.560> see

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
projection type light so as you can see

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.609 
projection type light so as you can see
i'm<00:02:05.860> projecting<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.429> texture<00:02:07.030> across<00:02:07.750> but<00:02:08.500> it's

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
i'm projecting a texture across but it's

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.430 
i'm projecting a texture across but it's
simulated<00:02:09.069> like<00:02:09.190> lights<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:11.080> in<00:02:11.200> again

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
simulated like lights so in again

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.990 
simulated like lights so in again
updating<00:02:12.040> on<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.220> ps3<00:02:12.519> and<00:02:12.880> xbox<00:02:13.480> 360<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.910> i'm

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
updating on the ps3 and xbox 360 so i'm

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.100 
updating on the ps3 and xbox 360 so i'm
going<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.150> go<00:02:16.239> ahead<00:02:16.299> and<00:02:16.480> remove<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:16.900> light

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
going to go ahead and remove this light

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.750 
going to go ahead and remove this light
and<00:02:17.320> i'll<00:02:17.590> move<00:02:17.709> us<00:02:17.860> outdoors

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.449 

so<00:02:24.760> as<00:02:24.879> I<00:02:24.969> come<00:02:25.120> outside<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:26.560> can<00:02:26.680> see<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.310> is

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
so as I come outside you can see this is

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.209 
so as I come outside you can see this is
very<00:02:27.670> much<00:02:27.849> a<00:02:28.269> crisis<00:02:29.260> type<00:02:29.439> seen<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:30.040> we<00:02:30.129> had

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
very much a crisis type seen that we had

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.580 
very much a crisis type seen that we had
done<00:02:30.430> now<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.780> difference<00:02:32.140> here<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.530> that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
done now the difference here is that

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.929 
done now the difference here is that
you're<00:02:33.040> going<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.310> see<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.579> on<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
you're going to see it on the

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.660 
you're going to see it on the
playstation<00:02:34.450> 3<00:02:34.629> and<00:02:34.780> xbox<00:02:35.019> 360<00:02:35.799> now<00:02:36.040> there<00:02:36.579> are

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
playstation 3 and xbox 360 now there are

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.819 
playstation 3 and xbox 360 now there are
some<00:02:36.730> really<00:02:37.049> nice<00:02:38.049> tools<00:02:38.349> that<00:02:38.560> we're<00:02:38.680> taking

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
some really nice tools that we're taking

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.800 
some really nice tools that we're taking
over<00:02:39.189> from<00:02:39.280> sandbox<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:40.060> be<00:02:40.150> able<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.450> develop

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
over from sandbox to be able to develop

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.330 
over from sandbox to be able to develop
onto<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.140> consoles<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.709> one<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.189> biggest

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
onto the consoles and one of the biggest

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.580 
onto the consoles and one of the biggest
tools<00:02:42.670> was<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:43.000> time<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.239> day<00:02:43.450> tool<00:02:43.659> our

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
tools was the time of day tool our

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.050 
tools was the time of day tool our
designers<00:02:45.040> don't<00:02:45.189> want<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.489> be<00:02:45.609> bothered<00:02:46.000> with

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
designers don't want to be bothered with

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.500 
designers don't want to be bothered with
a<00:02:46.450> lot<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.019> graphs<00:02:47.409> a<00:02:47.769> lot<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.340> problems<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:48.819> we

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
a lot of graphs a lot of problems so we

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.030 
a lot of graphs a lot of problems so we
just<00:02:49.659> gave<00:02:49.780> them<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:50.049> simple<00:02:50.230> slider<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:50.799> as<00:02:50.920> you

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
just gave them a simple slider so as you

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.039 
just gave them a simple slider so as you
can<00:02:51.159> see<00:02:51.370> as<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:52.239> change<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.629> time<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.900> day

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
can see as I change the time of day

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.440 
can see as I change the time of day
that's<00:02:53.859> updating<00:02:54.280> on<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.400> xbox<00:02:54.790> 360<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.389> the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
that's updating on the xbox 360 and the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.300 
that's updating on the xbox 360 and the
ps3<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.109> the<00:02:56.139> pc<00:02:56.620> all<00:02:56.859> at<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.099> same<00:02:57.250> time<00:02:59.310> so

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
ps3 and the pc all at the same time so

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.379 
ps3 and the pc all at the same time so
I'm<00:03:00.370> just<00:03:00.519> going<00:03:00.639> to<00:03:00.700> change<00:03:00.909> it<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.120> more<00:03:01.269> of<00:03:01.329> a

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
I'm just going to change it to more of a

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.220 
I'm just going to change it to more of a
night<00:03:01.540> scene<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:01.959> can<00:03:02.139> see<00:03:03.090> again

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
night scene and you can see again

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.780 
night scene and you can see again
comparing<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:07.019> makes<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.079> very<00:03:08.230> nice<00:03:08.790> so

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
comparing this makes it very nice so

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.879 
comparing this makes it very nice so
I'll<00:03:09.939> bring<00:03:10.090> back<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.389> time<00:03:10.569> here<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:10.989> I'll

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
I'll bring back the time here and I'll

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:12.839 
I'll bring back the time here and I'll
show<00:03:11.919> you<00:03:12.040> how<00:03:12.250> we<00:03:12.310> do<00:03:12.489> our<00:03:12.519> terrain

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
show you how we do our terrain

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.339 
show you how we do our terrain
modification<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.689> a<00:03:13.870> bit<00:03:14.019> of<00:03:14.049> terrain

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
modification and a bit of terrain

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:20.070 
modification and a bit of terrain
painting<00:03:14.739> in<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.970> sandbox

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.690 

so<00:03:20.680> I'm<00:03:20.800> just<00:03:20.950> moving<00:03:21.070> my<00:03:21.220> camera<00:03:21.550> into

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
so I'm just moving my camera into

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.580 
so I'm just moving my camera into
position<00:03:22.030> here<00:03:22.210> and<00:03:22.480> I'm<00:03:23.260> going<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.410> go<00:03:23.560> ahead

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
position here and I'm going to go ahead

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.230 
position here and I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:23.920> grab<00:03:24.040> our<00:03:24.160> modify<00:03:24.580> brush<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.030> what<00:03:25.150> this

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
and grab our modify brush and what this

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.970 
and grab our modify brush and what this
allows<00:03:25.300> us<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.810> do<00:03:25.960> is<00:03:26.140> just<00:03:26.200> do<00:03:26.770> simple

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
allows us to do is just do simple

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.690 
allows us to do is just do simple
heightmap<00:03:27.400> painting<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:30.310> I'll<00:03:30.400> change<00:03:30.640> my

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
heightmap painting so I'll change my

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.880 
heightmap painting so I'll change my
sliders<00:03:31.180> here<00:03:35.370> smooth<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.490> down<00:03:36.520> a<00:03:36.670> little<00:03:36.850> bit

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
sliders here smooth it down a little bit

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.140 
sliders here smooth it down a little bit
we'll<00:03:38.890> do<00:03:39.010> something<00:03:39.250> real<00:03:39.460> fast<00:03:39.670> just<00:03:39.910> maybe

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
we'll do something real fast just maybe

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.580 
we'll do something real fast just maybe
a<00:03:40.240> little<00:03:40.390> island<00:03:40.630> or<00:03:40.930> something<00:03:41.230> coming<00:03:41.410> out

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
a little island or something coming out

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.790 
a little island or something coming out
here<00:03:42.360> smooth<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:43.600> right<00:03:43.810> down<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.560> as<00:03:47.710> you

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
here smooth this right down so as you

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.230 
here smooth this right down so as you
can<00:03:47.890> see<00:03:48.100> that's<00:03:48.280> updating<00:03:48.670> on<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.790> consoles

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
can see that's updating on the consoles

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.360 
can see that's updating on the consoles
as<00:03:49.360> well<00:03:49.540> while<00:03:49.780> I'm<00:03:49.930> painting<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.470> pc

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.910 

sample<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.400> bit<00:03:54.550> of<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.700> lower<00:03:54.850> height<00:03:55.920> maybe

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
sample a bit of a lower height maybe

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.480 
sample a bit of a lower height maybe
give<00:03:57.160> some<00:03:57.430> some<00:03:58.420> shape<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.690> this

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.190 

alright<00:04:02.240> great<00:04:02.390> i'm<00:04:02.630> pretty<00:04:02.810> happy<00:04:02.930> with<00:04:03.140> that

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
alright great i'm pretty happy with that

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.080 
alright great i'm pretty happy with that
so<00:04:04.190> what<00:04:04.310> we're<00:04:04.400> going<00:04:04.490> to<00:04:04.580> go<00:04:04.700> ahead<00:04:04.730> now<00:04:04.940> and

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
so what we're going to go ahead now and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.850 
so what we're going to go ahead now and
do<00:04:05.330> is<00:04:05.510> do<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.900> bit<00:04:06.140> of<00:04:06.170> labor<00:04:06.410> painting<00:04:06.710> because

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
do is do a bit of labor painting because

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.750 
do is do a bit of labor painting because
obviously<00:04:06.980> that<00:04:07.250> doesn't<00:04:07.460> look<00:04:07.700> very

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
obviously that doesn't look very

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.250 
obviously that doesn't look very
realistic<00:04:08.240> yet<00:04:08.570> we're<00:04:08.780> going<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:08.960> throw<00:04:09.080> some

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
realistic yet we're going to throw some

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.070 
realistic yet we're going to throw some
textures<00:04:09.590> on<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.540> first<00:04:11.660> thing<00:04:11.780> I'm<00:04:11.930> going

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
textures on so the first thing I'm going

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.350 
textures on so the first thing I'm going
to<00:04:12.170> grab<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:13.220> actually<00:04:13.550> our<00:04:13.670> terrain<00:04:13.940> texture

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
to grab is actually our terrain texture

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.690 
to grab is actually our terrain texture
layer<00:04:14.540> browser<00:04:15.080> this<00:04:15.800> is<00:04:15.950> a<00:04:15.980> new<00:04:16.160> feature<00:04:16.370> that

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
layer browser this is a new feature that

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.750 
layer browser this is a new feature that
wasn't<00:04:17.450> existing<00:04:17.840> in<00:04:17.930> CryEngine<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.709> this<00:04:19.640> is

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
wasn't existing in CryEngine to this is

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.520 
wasn't existing in CryEngine to this is
a<00:04:19.790> nice<00:04:19.970> way<00:04:20.150> to<00:04:20.209> interface<00:04:20.720> with<00:04:20.959> all<00:04:21.350> our

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
a nice way to interface with all our

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.380 
a nice way to interface with all our
textures<00:04:21.950> so<00:04:22.580> these<00:04:22.730> are<00:04:22.790> all<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.090> textures

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
textures so these are all the textures

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.730 
textures so these are all the textures
that<00:04:23.420> are<00:04:23.570> going<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.840> go<00:04:23.990> on<00:04:24.170> to<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.440> terrain

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
that are going to go on to the terrain

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.960 
that are going to go on to the terrain
and<00:04:24.950> you<00:04:25.250> can<00:04:25.370> actually<00:04:25.490> see<00:04:25.670> all<00:04:25.880> the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
and you can actually see all the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.400 
and you can actually see all the
restrictions<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.510> we<00:04:26.660> place<00:04:26.870> on<00:04:27.080> them<00:04:27.200> for

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
restrictions that we place on them for

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.960 
restrictions that we place on them for
example<00:04:27.830> they<00:04:28.130> might<00:04:28.280> have<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.460> minimum<00:04:28.820> height

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
example they might have a minimum height

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.270 
example they might have a minimum height
a<00:04:29.030> maximum<00:04:29.570> height<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:29.930> maximum<00:04:30.590> angle<00:04:30.890> minimum

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
a maximum height a maximum angle minimum

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.030 
a maximum height a maximum angle minimum
angle<00:04:31.400> anything<00:04:31.910> that<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.240> effect<00:04:33.040> so

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
angle anything that to that effect so

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.030 
angle anything that to that effect so
I'll<00:04:34.100> go<00:04:34.220> ahead<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.430> close<00:04:34.640> that<00:04:36.040> database

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
I'll go ahead and close that database

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.230 
I'll go ahead and close that database
you<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.330> just<00:04:38.600> jump<00:04:38.810> into<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.080> lair
