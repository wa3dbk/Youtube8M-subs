00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.190 

due<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:07.970> lack<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.150> firing<00:01:08.600> activity<00:01:08.720> on

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
due to the lack of firing activity on

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.020 
due to the lack of firing activity on
the<00:01:09.320> Sun<00:01:09.500> over<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.830> last<00:01:10.010> week<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.490> thought<00:01:10.910> it

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
the Sun over the last week I thought it

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.340 
the Sun over the last week I thought it
might<00:01:11.150> be<00:01:11.270> fun<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.510> put<00:01:11.720> together<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:12.110> montage

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
might be fun to put together a montage

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.300 
might be fun to put together a montage
of<00:01:13.030> filament<00:01:14.030> eruptions<00:01:14.510> and<00:01:14.750> jets<00:01:15.320> seen<00:01:16.160> in

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
of filament eruptions and jets seen in

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.490 
of filament eruptions and jets seen in
the<00:01:16.370> transition<00:01:16.850> region<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.930> I'm<00:01:18.050> calling<00:01:18.410> it

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
the transition region and I'm calling it

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.660 
the transition region and I'm calling it
the<00:01:18.590> dance<00:01:18.800> of<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.100> Sun<00:01:21.250> first<00:01:22.250> we<00:01:22.370> start<00:01:22.430> with

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
the dance of the Sun first we start with

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.110 
the dance of the Sun first we start with
a<00:01:22.820> stately<00:01:23.270> surge<00:01:23.540> off<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.990> north<00:01:24.170> west<00:01:24.410> linn

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.890 

you<00:01:29.120> see<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.360> look<00:01:29.450> like<00:01:29.600> an<00:01:29.720> ordinary

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
you see it look like an ordinary

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.140 
you see it look like an ordinary
prominence<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.650> start<00:01:30.950> with<00:01:31.160> but<00:01:31.700> very<00:01:32.000> very

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
prominence to start with but very very

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.900 
prominence to start with but very very
slowly<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.930> prominence<00:01:33.350> rises<00:01:33.980> and<00:01:34.550> starts

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
slowly the prominence rises and starts

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.450 
slowly the prominence rises and starts
to<00:01:35.030> twist<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.780> eventually<00:01:36.770> erupts<00:01:37.040> away<00:01:37.250> from

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
to twist and eventually erupts away from

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.490 
to twist and eventually erupts away from
the<00:01:37.550> Sun<00:01:37.760> however<00:01:38.240> not<00:01:38.810> with<00:01:38.960> great<00:01:39.320> deal<00:01:39.470> of

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
the Sun however not with great deal of

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.950 
the Sun however not with great deal of
velocity<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:40.550> most<00:01:40.790> of<00:01:40.940> it<00:01:41.060> falls<00:01:41.300> back<00:01:41.420> again

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
velocity so most of it falls back again

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.170 
velocity so most of it falls back again
on<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.160> service<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:43.580> Sun<00:01:43.820> probably

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
on to the service and Sun probably

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.020 
on to the service and Sun probably
behind<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.780> Lin<00:01:45.550> next<00:01:46.550> we<00:01:46.610> have<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.730> huge

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
behind the Lin next we have a huge

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.230 
behind the Lin next we have a huge
prominence<00:01:47.570> on<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.810> east<00:01:48.050> limb<00:01:49.120> which<00:01:50.120> is

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
prominence on the east limb which is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.910 
prominence on the east limb which is
variant<00:01:50.660> so<00:01:51.050> you<00:01:51.140> have<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.380> watch<00:01:51.530> this<00:01:51.680> very

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
variant so you have to watch this very

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.040 
variant so you have to watch this very
carefully<00:01:52.600> initially<00:01:53.600> there<00:01:53.690> seems<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:53.990> be

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
carefully initially there seems to be

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.050 
carefully initially there seems to be
hardly<00:01:54.290> anything<00:01:54.590> happening<00:01:55.160> then<00:01:55.730> very

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
hardly anything happening then very

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.200 
hardly anything happening then very
slowly<00:01:56.420> this<00:01:56.870> huge<00:01:57.620> prominent<00:01:58.070> rises<00:01:58.640> up<00:01:58.670> you

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
slowly this huge prominent rises up you

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.120 
slowly this huge prominent rises up you
will<00:01:59.360> see<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.630> twisted<00:02:00.080> magnetic<00:02:00.290> fields<00:02:00.980> as

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
will see the twisted magnetic fields as

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.630 
will see the twisted magnetic fields as
it<00:02:01.700> rises

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.690 

quite<00:02:08.640> beautiful<00:02:10.160> then<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.490> very

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
quite beautiful then we have this very

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.080 
quite beautiful then we have this very
intense<00:02:12.260> eruption<00:02:13.670> Newser<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.820> can<00:02:14.940> already

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
intense eruption Newser you can already

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.300 
intense eruption Newser you can already
see<00:02:15.330> anything<00:02:15.720> there<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.290> then<00:02:16.800> all<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.160> a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
see anything there and then all of a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.010 
see anything there and then all of a
sudden<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.700> get<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.880> small<00:02:18.210> jet<00:02:18.480> growing<00:02:18.900> out

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
sudden you get a small jet growing out

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.020 
sudden you get a small jet growing out
of<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.320> east<00:02:19.680> limb<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.400> then<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.700> very

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
of the east limb and then this very

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.560 
of the east limb and then this very
intense<00:02:21.570> bright<00:02:22.430> eruption<00:02:23.430> again<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.420> great

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
intense bright eruption again the great

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.390 
intense bright eruption again the great
deal<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.050> material<00:02:25.500> falls<00:02:25.740> back<00:02:26.010> into<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
deal of the material falls back into the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.460 
deal of the material falls back into the
service<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.910> sun<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.930> velocity<00:02:28.050> wasn't

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
service and sun so the velocity wasn't

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.770 
service and sun so the velocity wasn't
that<00:02:28.770> high

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.260 

to<00:02:36.380> have<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.560> beautiful<00:02:36.980> surge<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.610> fulham

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
to have a beautiful surge and fulham

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.770

we<00:03:03.620> have<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:03.830> beautiful<00:03:04.100> arcane<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.850> loops

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
we have this beautiful arcane of loops

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.259 
we have this beautiful arcane of loops
that<00:03:05.330> forms<00:03:05.800> over<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.830> period<00:03:07.370> of<00:03:07.640> about<00:03:07.820> two

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
that forms over the period of about two

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.080 
that forms over the period of about two
days<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:09.860> we<00:03:09.890> have<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.190> full<00:03:10.370> sequence<00:03:10.820> here

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
days so we have the full sequence here

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.479 
days so we have the full sequence here

for the answer our trivia question John
Walker<00:05:18.169> marketed<00:05:18.910> no<00:05:19.910> not<00:05:20.240> whiskey<00:05:20.740> something

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
Walker marketed no not whiskey something

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.469 
Walker marketed no not whiskey something
he<00:05:21.830> called<00:05:22.100> coal<00:05:22.370> grains<00:05:22.640> what<00:05:23.330> do<00:05:23.390> you<00:05:23.419> think

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
he called coal grains what do you think

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.310 
he called coal grains what do you think
they<00:05:23.660> are<00:05:23.690> better<00:05:24.080> known<00:05:24.320> as<00:05:24.530> today<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:25.760> match

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
they are better known as today the match

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.550 
they are better known as today the match
so<00:05:27.320> that's<00:05:27.530> it<00:05:27.650> for<00:05:27.860> today<00:05:28.240> keep<00:05:29.240> safe<00:05:29.510> bye<00:05:30.350> for

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
so that's it for today keep safe bye for

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.590 
so that's it for today keep safe bye for
now
