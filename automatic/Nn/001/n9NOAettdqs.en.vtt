00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.110
 very good to all welcome to me 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.790
 welcome to a new video channel 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.350
 I have the fourth episode of the ronald 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.480
 of bronzino is more the episode in the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.530
 which are we going to play two games until 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.330
 now we were always playing a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.309
 match by episode but starting now 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.660
 we have two games in each episode already 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.160
 You know how it always leans like me 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.140
 you can already with far away I thank you 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.240
 very much and so we can go over 100 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.770
 likes in this episode and well then like 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.270
 you will know and if you do not know why 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.920
 I explain and you also have the space 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.930
 the attention because you want to see it in 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.120
 previous election episode 3 we lost 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.189
 in the semifinals so I have to start 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.079
 again we will play in this game that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.789
 you are going to see 2 the eighth and 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.350
 if we win we will pass and we will see also 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.850
 the same episode and the party of 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.469
 quarters and if we lose the first game 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.329
 of eighths we will try again 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.980
 also and we will play another match of the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.929
 eighth the opponent against whom we 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.449
 we face is a rival very similar to 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.620
 that eliminated them in the semifinals and already 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.510
 He says 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.879
 from now on we will not trust 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.829
 the rival is the one that is made of bronze 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.360
 gold silver I do not care let's go out to 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.829
 for all because if it does not happen what happens 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.839
 in previous election and we just 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.000
 losing minute 19 and there will come the 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.530
 first goal on our part and if it's going to 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.390
 be of pass I feel that many of those who 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.190
 I made sure he scored goals with the pass he quoted 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.640
 half like that really when you 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.619
 mark then it seems fine if it is yes 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.880
 you end up scoring a pass goal he cited as 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.979
 which I am now is because with the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.750
 kickback you've done great and just 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.820
 arriving with more players than the three 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.670
 with those who are defending the how 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.649
 You see in minute 33 well, I make a 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.899
 penalty of the typical ones who know this 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.630
 fifa , I 'm just going, just dialing 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.670
 penalty but from 45 tired he was going to 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.800
 start the draw of the tail that I was going to do 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 in this episode after the hat 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.789
 that makes a good control and with its 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.770
 power and its speed ends up facing 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.630
 goal very well and ends up scoring goal 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.940
 with his left leg so we 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.130
 we go to rest with that 2 to 1 in the 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.920
 rest as you see 36 shots I 4 a 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.569
 door with 57% of the position and the one 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.239
 I shot the only shot that to our port 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.739
 to 43% of the position and it was not the shot 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.330
 of the goal because obviously the shot 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:01.940
 penal 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.040
 and I think I'm not sure 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.510
 with that tremendous mistake that I make to 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.880
 defend the value of calculates good and 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.440
 it just marks golf comes in a 3 61 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.840
 then again tired him with his speed 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.600
 and a little bit of luck there ends up 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.690
 staying goal and ends up scoring goal 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.630
 but again in the 77 state to do 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.850
 lucas I believe the one who will recover the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.560
 ball and I defend quite badly the 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.630
 truth as you see and I just get 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.700
 in and the 78th minute as I say 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.800
 I ended up with three to three and 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.710
 when it seemed like everything was going to end or 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.330
 going to the extension well blue good a 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.100
 take out pretty bad the ball leaves and of 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.350
 new who to whom if he does not fall 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.390
 cannes oil and good turns very well there 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.820
 as you can see and with a shot that ends 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.920
 playing in the center so the goalkeeper 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.390
 we do not stop it or we get it by marking with a 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.700
 little luck but goal that is very 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.190
 interesting what's important and the party 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.420
 it ends 43 so we went to quarters 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.850
 end to the game that we are going to see now 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.670
 but before seeing the statistics in 12 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.290
 shots I had made another door 53 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.400
 percent of the flex well yes that is 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.320
 true that the second part had 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.170
 tight much more here was coming 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.269
 much more and good, really, I think 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.209
 that it would have been fair to go to extension 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.250
 but tired and well he was there 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.320
 new then we pass and it has to happen to us 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.920
 the next round we have four points 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.930
 to spend in this episode for the 36 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.880
 points a goal that did not get tired and seven 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.170
 points minus three points for the goals 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.510
 that have marked us so four 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.720
 points but we will only spend two already 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.310
 that if I put another player the subject of 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.380
 the rapport remained the parents 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.760
 with less than nine conversation and not 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.680
 I like it so we only put 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.780
 picture and we are going to face this 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.239
 team a team that has up to a 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.280
 version of alexis sanchez omen to 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.870
 walcott also has a sterling for 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.310
 left band where right usually 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.350
 for the left of Maria room and in the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.780
 midfield and this match was going to 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.090
 be the party where I get tired and I think 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.160
 that with me more has taken you over 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.490
 minute 3 marks the first goal can soil 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.960
 and start from here a series of 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.510
 plays in which caused the as well as 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.010
 You see long goal would mark the pot 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.170
 favors goose very well the leaves the 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.720
 goalkeeper and the pike over minute 12 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.300
 another goal minute 19 I wear the one again and 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.460
 is going to have another chance and obviously at 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.890
 be the bronze role just marking hat 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.780
 tricks already in 20 minutes and I was 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.430
 arriving a lot was going marking 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.190
 almost all I had with cançó he 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.080
 but 29 minutes there as well I 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.060
 I defend quite badly and with walcott I think 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.920
 which is a brand scoring goal but water 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.810
 it caused him to say that but you that you think 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.790
 that you are and in it, just take the point 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.300
 30 says around here over there for 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.910
 there 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.020
 He scored and scored and scored four goals in 30 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.210
 minutes 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.740
 brutal camps oil is a total 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.670
 try it but the explorer 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.230
 because it's amazing 133 and after a 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.880
 pass pretty good good mark each 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.280
 scoring goal I do not know what I was doing 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.230
 my defense really at this moment I 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.030
 tired he says it seems to you by four goals 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.130
 so calm that you marked 5 there what 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.460
 you have five goals in one 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.710
 incredible cannes oil brutal I'm not 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.050
 in love with this guy 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.790
 it's a foolish thing that he's just done 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.830
 the plays with the speed he has 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.690
 the power of the force and over 4 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.390
 skills that I put in this game do not 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.690
 he has used them a lot but today you have 5 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.250
 goals in 45 minutes well a total of 8 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.260
 goals in a match and a half 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.320
 good in two games since I'm not going to 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.520
 put in what happened in the second part 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.690
 I 'm not going to put a play on the 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.910
 second part as you see taken the 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.590
 match 2 to 5 since although I had had 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.090
 many times and almost all with 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.710
 tired because the second part was 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.060
 a little more fallon is normal with favor 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.220
 bronze and new can put all 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.480
 but you already see in a game five goals 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.790
 in the two matches he has seen today 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.530
 eight goals of cannes oil eyed peas 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.060
 statistics throughout the game in the 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.640
 had thrown six times six shots to the 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.700
 door has scored two goals and I 15 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.590
 11 Shots 5 goals goose door he and 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.170
 most of the shots you see the field 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.850
 so well you see an episode in the 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.320
 what camps oil does what it has to do 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.240
 do what I like to take off the 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.400
 recorded and mark all you can 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.020
 it meant that you know that if you are 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.300
 still do not forget to hit like 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.979
 I always tell you 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.020
 will test cancers invades tested because 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.639
 is a player's asshole and no doubt 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.830
 every day that I play in style I have 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.990
 clearer is the bronze ronaldo well 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.250
