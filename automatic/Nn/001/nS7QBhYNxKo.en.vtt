vulnerable part of a case usually

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.630 
vulnerable part of a case usually
staying<00:01:58.720> nice<00:01:59.050> and<00:01:59.110> connected<00:01:59.710> less<00:02:00.250> likely

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
staying nice and connected less likely

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.240 
staying nice and connected less likely
to<00:02:00.760> tear<00:02:00.970> so<00:02:01.570> it's<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.290> minimal<00:02:02.620> case<00:02:02.830> doesn't

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
to tear so it's a minimal case doesn't

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.010 
to tear so it's a minimal case doesn't
add<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.460> lot<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.640> weight<00:02:03.910> or<00:02:04.090> bulk<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:04.570> it

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
add a lot of weight or bulk and it

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.680 
add a lot of weight or bulk and it
actually<00:02:05.170> feels<00:02:05.470> pretty<00:02:05.590> good<00:02:05.800> in<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.070> hand<00:02:06.220> I

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
actually feels pretty good in the hand I

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.690 
actually feels pretty good in the hand I
actually<00:02:07.690> like<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.349> lot<00:02:08.530> more<00:02:08.739> for<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
actually like this a lot more for the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.509 
actually like this a lot more for the
iphone<00:02:10.090> 5<00:02:10.360> simply<00:02:11.019> because<00:02:11.379> the<00:02:11.739> iphone<00:02:12.099> 5<00:02:12.340> is

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
iphone 5 simply because the iphone 5 is

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.369 
iphone 5 simply because the iphone 5 is
so<00:02:12.670> thin<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.000> light<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:13.660> don't<00:02:13.840> want<00:02:14.200> a

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
so thin and light that you don't want a

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.830 
so thin and light that you don't want a
huge<00:02:14.709> bulky<00:02:15.099> case<00:02:15.340> but<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.420> do<00:02:16.569> want<00:02:16.780> to
