today<00:00:04.509> we're<00:00:04.720> going<00:00:04.870> to<00:00:05.020> demonstrate<00:00:05.230> the

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:05.859 
today we're going to demonstrate the

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.459 
today we're going to demonstrate the
many<00:00:06.130> versatile<00:00:06.670> uses<00:00:06.939> of<00:00:07.359> black<00:00:07.870> rub<00:00:08.320> and

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:08.469 
many versatile uses of black rub and

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.470 
many versatile uses of black rub and
restore<00:00:08.860> so<00:00:09.549> I've<00:00:09.670> already<00:00:10.000> removed<00:00:10.180> the

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
restore so I've already removed the

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.410 
restore so I've already removed the
pressure<00:00:10.690> seal<00:00:10.990> and<00:00:11.290> thoroughly<00:00:11.800> stirred<00:00:12.219> it

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
pressure seal and thoroughly stirred it

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.629 
pressure seal and thoroughly stirred it
I'm<00:00:13.420> I've<00:00:14.170> got<00:00:14.380> my<00:00:14.500> cellulose<00:00:15.040> sponge<00:00:15.400> here

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
I'm I've got my cellulose sponge here

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.519 
I'm I've got my cellulose sponge here
you<00:00:15.790> can<00:00:15.969> see<00:00:16.150> there's<00:00:16.360> no<00:00:16.540> green<00:00:17.020> scrubby<00:00:17.500> on

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
you can see there's no green scrubby on

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.849 
you can see there's no green scrubby on
the<00:00:17.770> back<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:19.180> to<00:00:20.109> create<00:00:20.470> an<00:00:21.150> easier<00:00:22.859> sponge

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
the back and to create an easier sponge

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.390 
the back and to create an easier sponge
to<00:00:24.279> use<00:00:24.550> I'm<00:00:24.910> going<00:00:24.939> to<00:00:25.180> cut<00:00:25.449> it<00:00:26.400> diagonally

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
to use I'm going to cut it diagonally

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.240 
to use I'm going to cut it diagonally
which<00:00:28.359> creates<00:00:28.810> these<00:00:29.050> wonderful<00:00:29.650> sculpted

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
which creates these wonderful sculpted

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.790 
which creates these wonderful sculpted
edges<00:00:30.609> that<00:00:30.849> can<00:00:31.090> make<00:00:31.720> your<00:00:31.869> your<00:00:32.290> project<00:00:32.739> a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
edges that can make your your project a

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.649 
edges that can make your your project a
lot<00:00:32.949> easier<00:00:33.900> to<00:00:34.900> work<00:00:35.019> with<00:00:36.030> putting<00:00:37.030> on<00:00:37.210> my

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:37.659 
lot easier to work with putting on my

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:42.210 
lot easier to work with putting on my
glove<00:00:40.140> I'm<00:00:41.140> right-handed<00:00:41.409> so<00:00:41.769> I<00:00:41.949> should

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
glove I'm right-handed so I should

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.539 
glove I'm right-handed so I should
probably<00:00:42.309> just<00:00:42.580> stick<00:00:43.000> the<00:00:43.180> padding<00:00:43.600> and

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:44.549 
probably just stick the padding and

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:47.910 
probably just stick the padding and

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.530 
this is in my car in our service vehicle
and<00:00:50.530> it's<00:00:51.129> got<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.280> lot<00:00:51.460> of<00:00:51.489> rub<00:00:52.150> and<00:00:52.269> restore

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
stains on it that I didn't get to very

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.210 
stains on it that I didn't get to very
quickly<00:00:55.269> and<00:00:55.960> what<00:00:56.350> better<00:00:56.500> way<00:00:56.619> to<00:00:56.739> fix<00:00:57.040> them

and then with some more rubber in the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.689 
and then with some more rubber in the
storm

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699

now with any sort of color change which
is<00:01:02.979> you<00:01:03.369> know<00:01:03.489> we're<00:01:03.939> trying<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.210> cover<00:01:04.600> those

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
is you know we're trying to cover those

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.440 
is you know we're trying to cover those
those<00:01:05.290> spots<00:01:06.130> will<00:01:06.700> probably<00:01:07.060> take<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.420> couple

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
those spots will probably take a couple

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.950 
those spots will probably take a couple
of<00:01:07.870> coats<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:09.280> want<00:01:09.760> to<00:01:09.790> thoroughly<00:01:10.150> dry<00:01:10.540> each

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
of coats and want to thoroughly dry each

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:21.070 
of coats and want to thoroughly dry each
one<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.590> between

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.410 

now<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.410> plastics<00:01:23.130> which<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.850> usually<00:01:24.300> what

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
now with plastics which is usually what

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.190 
now with plastics which is usually what
you'll<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.110> exteriors<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.390> vehicles<00:01:27.390> we

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you'll see on exteriors of vehicles we

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 
you'll see on exteriors of vehicles we
would<00:01:28.440> recommend<00:01:28.800> a<00:01:29.010> plastic<00:01:29.490> primer<00:01:29.760> for

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
would recommend a plastic primer for

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.350 
would recommend a plastic primer for
really<00:01:30.660> good<00:01:30.840> longevity<00:01:31.700> not<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.880> plastics

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
really good longevity not all plastics

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.110 
really good longevity not all plastics
are<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.570> same<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.230> it's<00:01:34.740> kind<00:01:34.980> of<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.100> crapshoot

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
are the same so it's kind of a crapshoot

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.210 
are the same so it's kind of a crapshoot
you<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.440> use<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.950> plastic

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
you know if you have to use a plastic

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.140 
you know if you have to use a plastic
primer<00:01:38.640> or<00:01:38.940> not<00:01:40.100> but<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.220> recommend<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
primer or not but we recommend it as a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
disclaimer this product also works

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.810 
disclaimer this product also works
really<00:01:45.000> well<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.540> rubber<00:01:45.840> rubber<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.440> more

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
really well on rubber rubber is more

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.050 
really well on rubber rubber is more
porous<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.180> permeable<00:01:48.860> than<00:01:49.860> plastic<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
porous and permeable than plastic and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.520 
porous and permeable than plastic and
that's<00:01:51.150> why<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.450> product<00:01:51.900> also<00:01:52.050> works<00:01:52.350> well

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
that's why this product also works well

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.910 
that's why this product also works well
on<00:01:52.560> leather<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.040> vinyl<00:01:53.150> because<00:01:54.150> those<00:01:54.330> pros

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
on leather and vinyl because those pros

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.760 
on leather and vinyl because those pros
materials<00:01:55.920> are<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.460> porous<00:01:56.910> and<00:01:57.060> permeable

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
materials are very porous and permeable

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.980 
materials are very porous and permeable
so<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.100> how<00:01:59.220> great<00:01:59.630> you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.720> this

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so you can see how great you know this

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:09.310 
so you can see how great you know this
plastic<00:02:01.470> is<00:02:01.560> different<00:02:01.890> than<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.220> plastic

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.990

but already we've we've accomplished a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.630 
but already we've we've accomplished a
vast<00:02:12.300> improvement

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
vast improvement

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.250 
vast improvement
