correct we have the focus correct which
is<00:01:20.100> useful<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.640> some<00:01:20.820> cases

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
is useful in some cases

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.140 
is useful in some cases
but<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:23.070> notice<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.430> all<00:01:23.549> these<00:01:23.700> other<00:01:23.820> ones<00:01:24.030> I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
but you notice on all these other ones I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.969 
but you notice on all these other ones I
don't<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:25.860> just

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
don't have it on them this one just

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.530 
don't have it on them this one just
happened<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> is

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
happened to be like that because it is

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.640 
happened to be like that because it is
and<00:01:28.189> also<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.670> all<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> lenses<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.290> they<00:01:31.470> can

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and also on all the lenses but they can

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.649 
and also on all the lenses but they can
FD<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.070> would<00:01:32.430> suggest<00:01:32.640> using<00:01:33.180> any<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.540> these

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
FD I would suggest using any of these

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.230 
FD I would suggest using any of these
other<00:01:33.869> ones<00:01:34.020> except<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:35.009> FD<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
other ones except for the can FD the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.410 
other ones except for the can FD the
reason<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:38.150> here<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.270> called

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
reason is this one here is called

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.120 
reason is this one here is called
glassless<00:01:39.840> adapter<00:01:40.439> doesn't<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> glass

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
glassless adapter doesn't have the glass

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.639 
glassless adapter doesn't have the glass
but<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.090> achieve<00:01:42.270> infinity<00:01:43.140> focus<00:01:43.470> with

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
but you can achieve infinity focus with

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.980 
but you can achieve infinity focus with
the<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.009> FD<00:01:44.280> lenses<00:01:44.880> unless<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.540> adapter

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the can FD lenses unless you get adapter

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.940 
the can FD lenses unless you get adapter
with<00:01:46.170> glass<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
with glass in it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.429 
with glass in it
problem<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.450> glass<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:49.259> cut

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
problem is is that the glass will cut

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.710 
problem is is that the glass will cut
down<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.829> stop<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.369> light<00:01:50.450> coming<00:01:51.450> into<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
down one stop of light coming into the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.030 
down one stop of light coming into the
camera<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:54.229> is<00:01:55.229> pretty<00:01:55.530> much<00:01:55.770> not

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
camera so that just is pretty much not

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.480 
camera so that just is pretty much not
very<00:01:56.070> useful<00:01:56.670> at<00:01:56.729> all<00:01:57.530> but<00:01:58.530> anyway<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.100> let's

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
very useful at all but anyway so let's

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.179 
very useful at all but anyway so let's
just<00:02:00.090> show<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.299> what<00:02:00.450> kind<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.750> functions<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
just show you what kind of functions you

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.899 
just show you what kind of functions you
will<00:02:02.340> need<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.640> set<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:02.880> here<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:04.610> use<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.850> of

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
will need to set up here to use one of

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.359 
will need to set up here to use one of
these<00:02:06.000> lenses<00:02:06.710> manually<00:02:07.710> focused<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.220> your

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
these lenses manually focused on your

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.309 
these lenses manually focused on your
Canon

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
Canon

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.490 
Canon
I'll<00:02:10.319> set<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.679> here<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:11.940> point<00:02:12.120> four

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
I'll set it here to one point four

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.990 
I'll set it here to one point four
should<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.010> good<00:02:14.130> here<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.430> let's<00:02:14.580> turn<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
should be good here so let's turn on the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.020 
should be good here so let's turn on the
cannon<00:02:15.480> turn<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.080> on<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.820> yeah<00:02:17.820> we're<00:02:18.000> on

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
cannon turn it on here yeah we're on

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.990 
cannon turn it on here yeah we're on
okay<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.740> always<00:02:19.980> should<00:02:20.430> shoot<00:02:20.700> in

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
okay so you always should shoot in

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.060 
okay so you always should shoot in
manual<00:02:21.480> mode<00:02:21.690> I'll<00:02:22.050> show<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.350> an<00:02:22.500> example<00:02:22.830> if

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
manual mode I'll show you an example if

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.580 
manual mode I'll show you an example if
you<00:02:23.160> shoot<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.730> above<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.170> also<00:02:25.260> live

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
you shoot it in above this and also live

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.370 
you shoot it in above this and also live
view<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> good<00:02:26.900> option<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:30.200> using<00:02:31.200> what

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
view is a good option just using what

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.380 
view is a good option just using what
they<00:02:31.560> say<00:02:31.830> as<00:02:32.070> exposure<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:32.880> get<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> way

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
they say as exposure so you get a way

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.890 
they say as exposure so you get a way
way<00:02:34.080> overexposed<00:02:34.440> image<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.450> really<00:02:36.780> have

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
way overexposed image so you really have

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.130 
way overexposed image so you really have
to<00:02:37.020> use<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.200> internal<00:02:37.860> light<00:02:38.010> meter<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
to use the internal light meter and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.460 
to use the internal light meter and
manual<00:02:40.140> mode<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.530> get<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.680> correct<00:02:41.130> exposure<00:02:42.470> so

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
manual mode to get a correct exposure so

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.040 
manual mode to get a correct exposure so
let's<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.770> focus<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.690> here<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.900> can

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
let's just focus on that here you can

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.990 
let's just focus on that here you can
also<00:02:46.200> like<00:02:46.530> zoom<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:46.920> 10<00:02:47.130> times<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.610> focus<00:02:47.880> but

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
also like zoom in 10 times to focus but

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.220 
also like zoom in 10 times to focus but
I'm<00:02:48.120> not<00:02:48.210> gonna<00:02:48.390> focus<00:02:48.510> super<00:02:48.870> well<00:02:49.020> on<00:02:49.110> this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
I'm not gonna focus super well on this

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.550 
I'm not gonna focus super well on this
one

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
one

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.210 
one
but<00:02:50.040> anyway<00:02:50.370> see<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.850> change<00:02:51.890> shutter<00:02:52.890> speed

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
but anyway see you change shutter speed

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.710 
but anyway see you change shutter speed
until<00:02:54.470> see<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:56.250> little<00:02:56.580> thing<00:02:57.300> here<00:02:57.330> has<00:02:57.570> to

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
until see this little thing here has to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.070 
until see this little thing here has to
hit<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.440> middle<00:02:58.620> point<00:02:59.310> right<00:02:59.640> there<00:03:00.080> then

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
hit that middle point right there then

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.350 
hit that middle point right there then
we<00:03:01.260> take<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:02.210> exposure<00:03:03.210> should<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.750> right<00:03:04.590> on

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
we take that exposure should be right on

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.210 
we take that exposure should be right on
that<00:03:06.360> one's<00:03:06.570> way<00:03:06.870> overexposed<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:08.070> this

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
that one's way overexposed and this

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.550 
that one's way overexposed and this
one's<00:03:08.430> right<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:11.210> Kemps<00:03:12.210> it's<00:03:13.050> super<00:03:13.380> well

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
one's right on Kemps it's super well

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.400 
one's right on Kemps it's super well
through<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.830> camera<00:03:14.130> but<00:03:14.160> that's<00:03:14.370> how<00:03:14.490> it<00:03:14.610> is

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
through the camera but that's how it is

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.500 
through the camera but that's how it is
so<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.500> absolutely<00:03:16.860> have<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.880> use<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.180> manual

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
so you absolutely have to use a manual

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.960 
so you absolutely have to use a manual
mode<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.680> set<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.520> via<00:03:20.820> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
mode and you have to set it via the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.720 
mode and you have to set it via the
light<00:03:21.120> meter<00:03:21.300> which<00:03:21.800> can<00:03:22.800> also<00:03:22.920> seem<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.370> find

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
light meter which can also seem to find

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.250 
light meter which can also seem to find
your<00:03:23.910> hero<00:03:25.640> it's<00:03:26.640> down<00:03:26.820> there<00:03:27.090> yeah<00:03:27.840> there's<00:03:28.170> a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
your hero it's down there yeah there's a

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.600 
your hero it's down there yeah there's a
light<00:03:28.470> meter<00:03:28.620> right<00:03:29.630> right<00:03:30.630> down<00:03:30.840> there<00:03:31.610> you

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
light meter right right down there you

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.300 
light meter right right down there you
can<00:03:32.760> see<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.000> flashing<00:03:33.270> green<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:37.010> I've<00:03:38.010> used

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
can see it flashing green and I've used

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.010 
can see it flashing green and I've used
quite<00:03:38.490> a<00:03:38.580> few<00:03:38.790> manual<00:03:39.060> focus<00:03:39.360> lenses<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.750> can

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
quite a few manual focus lenses I can

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.500 
quite a few manual focus lenses I can
say<00:03:40.230> it's<00:03:40.650> worth<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.610> hassle<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:42.060> using<00:03:42.090> them

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
say it's worth the hassle of using them

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.690 
say it's worth the hassle of using them
if<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.110> don't<00:03:43.650> have<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:43.950> shoot<00:03:44.100> actions<00:03:44.580> or

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
if you don't have to shoot actions or

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.180 
if you don't have to shoot actions or
sports<00:03:44.970> which<00:03:45.330> actually<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.720> have<00:03:45.959> shot<00:03:46.290> sports

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
sports which actually I have shot sports

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.370 
sports which actually I have shot sports
with<00:03:47.370> manual<00:03:47.670> focus<00:03:47.940> lenses<00:03:48.270> before<00:03:48.690> which<00:03:49.290> is

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
with manual focus lenses before which is

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.980 
with manual focus lenses before which is
not<00:03:49.560> quite<00:03:49.770> as<00:03:49.890> easy<00:03:49.980> as<00:03:50.810> traditional<00:03:51.810> ones

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
not quite as easy as traditional ones

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.170 
not quite as easy as traditional ones
but<00:03:52.200> it's<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.350> very<00:03:52.500> cost<00:03:52.800> effective<00:03:53.280> way<00:03:53.490> to

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
but it's a very cost effective way to

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.460 
but it's a very cost effective way to
get<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.390> most<00:03:54.600> bang<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:54.870> your<00:03:55.080> buck<00:03:55.230> out<00:03:55.380> of

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
get the most bang for your buck out of

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.910 
get the most bang for your buck out of
your<00:03:55.590> lenses<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:57.230> like<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.290> said<00:03:58.380> I<00:03:58.530> have<00:03:58.709> quite
