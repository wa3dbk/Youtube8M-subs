00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.620
 hi guys, we're here for this 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.190
 spare tablets in a 600rc cbr of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.820
 a 7 believing 2008 is the same then 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.020
 let's proceed first by avoiding these two 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:26.400
 screws that are what then block them 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:29.189
 grippers these guys used if 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.369
 really good tools because the screws 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.380
 a very tall pair is locked 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:45.090
 I had previously increased one 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:50.430
 once loosened we proceed to unscrew with 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.879
 a key of 14 so that they block the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.879
 nipper 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 1 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.229
 an attention we challenge the winner ok 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:41.259
 this is the extracted pliers we deliver to 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:43.590
 touch the charges that hold to 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.590
 pills 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.890
 pay attention to these two levers 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:57.360
 that will snap this is this 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.360
 once you show, believe 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:13.980
 and now we hope that a part is enough 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.700
 next step widen pistons 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:48.610
 see how I return to my office 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:09.100
 see the time of command and of it 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:12.700
 take levissima and pisa 9 on the bull 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.390
 the Italian brembo 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.390
 so there is the code 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:42.670
 we challenge for the first two children ok that 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.670
 it's called in the office 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:57.620
 2 you see then trying to keep 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:04:03.940
 in short we insert the vertical ones 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:27.850
 pins that keep the above time 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:27.850
 lower seat ok and insert life 12 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:37.259
 I advise you could think of one 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.259
 mother things unfortunately I have not 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:42.130
 here we had looked for points to use 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:45.100
 the famous body torque wrench of 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:49.690
 tightening will definitely be indicated on 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:52.920
 booklet was closed around 26 thousand 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.920
 meters ok 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:24.810
 and here then guys and I hope to 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.930
 to have been of help that can be said 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.930
 so 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.960
 that's all
