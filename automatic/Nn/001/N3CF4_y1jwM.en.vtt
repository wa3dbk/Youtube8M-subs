00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.840
 and 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.459
 good guys welcome to call of duty 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.099
 black ops 3 what is having background 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.500
 is the first part of the game that you 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.320
 it was going up yesterday as soon as it has permission to 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.210
 go up another different game the upload the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.099
 valet I will arrive at about 10 o'clock 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.990
 night home, if I have news 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.939
 during the day after 10 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.019
 You can have different games in the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.970
 channel many of you have 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.190
 asked to upload a game with the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.080
 sniper I 've already asked and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.430
 I am waiting for answers I come to 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.440
 tell you a little about the game 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.670
 we talked a little bit about the sounds of 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.760
 weapon that many of you have given me 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.860
 said and reminds you a lot to black ops 1 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.129
 and indeed the sound of the hits 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.409
 marker is almost identical to black ops 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.720
 1 we must also say that the colors 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.699
 the colors of the maps are very 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.699
 similar to those of call of duty black 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.250
 ops 2 have done as a merger between 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.049
 black ops 1 black ops 2 and a little bit 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.000
 Futurist was a little bit of call of duty 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.250
 advanced warfare many of you 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.479
 you ask about things that are obvious 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.979
 not because I'm already seeing the time and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.350
 but well I'm going to tell you there's no 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.900
 double jump it at any time 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.040
 hit and you see double jump 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.040
 to the just just jump 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.360
 just as an impulse that I think that 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.360
 it's an advantage that has given you a jump 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.090
 a little bit bigger, but there's no 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.910
 double jump so calm and nothing 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.460
 guys you have seen for example a data 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.310
 curious has been made a triple low very 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.290
 cut is to say with a lot of time between 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.270
 low and low and they have given him the medal of 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.860
 triple low therefore what they are 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.810
 medals of mega casualties and more than 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.180
 have them that I guess it will be 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.470
 pretty easy to pull the ring with the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.470
 seen now just hit that jump 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.560
 big impulse jump not something with 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.570
 the supposed jetpack that they confirmed in 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.190
 call of duty black ops 3 so I think 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.110
 that has everything that can reach us 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.880
 like and nothing guys you know you do not 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.950
 I can upload more than 2 and a half minutes 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.479
 so I hope you liked us 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.610
 we see in the next video and as soon as 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.899
 have another I'll upload it by sticking a piece 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.899
 from like to the video if you liked it
