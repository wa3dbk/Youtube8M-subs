00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.420 
lead guitar the guitar is a one of my
influence<00:03:28.970> George<00:03:29.900> Lynch<00:03:30.170> from<00:03:30.350> Dakin<00:03:30.890> this

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
influence George Lynch from Dakin this

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.699 
influence George Lynch from Dakin this
is<00:03:31.580> not<00:03:31.760> exactly<00:03:31.940> what<00:03:32.540> George<00:03:33.019> Lynch<00:03:33.380> I<00:03:33.590> have

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
is not exactly what George Lynch I have

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.550 
is not exactly what George Lynch I have
right<00:03:33.920> now<00:03:34.010> but<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:34.730> far<00:03:34.970> this<00:03:35.239> is<00:03:35.420> much<00:03:36.050> of<00:03:36.290> my

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
right now but so far this is much of my

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.050 
right now but so far this is much of my
idea<00:03:37.489> of<00:03:37.730> mixing<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.750> up<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:39.290> what<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.400> see

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
idea of mixing it up to what I I see

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.570 
idea of mixing it up to what I I see
from<00:03:41.360> his<00:03:41.750> guitar<00:03:42.170> basically<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.400> a

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
from his guitar basically this is a

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.270 
from his guitar basically this is a
dimarzio<00:03:44.420> pickups<00:03:44.590> then<00:03:45.590> as<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:45.860> can<00:03:46.040> see

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
dimarzio pickups then as you can see

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.210 
dimarzio pickups then as you can see
there<00:03:46.489> is<00:03:46.580> only<00:03:46.730> one<00:03:47.000> volume<00:03:47.500> tone<00:03:48.500> control<00:03:49.040> I

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
there is only one volume tone control I

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.550 
there is only one volume tone control I
cut<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.090> off<00:03:50.209> five<00:03:50.630> ways<00:03:50.870> sweet<00:03:51.200> as<00:03:51.410> you<00:03:51.530> can

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
cut it off five ways sweet as you can

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.180
