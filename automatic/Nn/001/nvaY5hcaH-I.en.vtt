00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.120
 martijn jaspers you are in the elite my class you have a past 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.539
 dear is walking around hence the idea you have already driven 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.740
 spacious times is not in the dutch team but you still live an important one 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:16.539
 you can explain the contribution to the Netherlands after the Olympic Games 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.870
 how that works as a country to get we are only among the best three leaders 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.550
 of every disaster country count for most two children together all countries 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.099
 together and the best five countries may with three drivers 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.099
 2 and I am currently the third Dutchman after one of the rushes 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.620
 gentlemen van gorcum, on the other hand, did not seem to be the moment anymore 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.239
 match important that we achieved more points so come but the top five 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.719
 and then we have a chance that we will go emo with three riders and then I will come again 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:44.350
 in picture 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.620
 the third place for player to get say you can individual 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.240
 many politicians yes but i will have an hour with 6 8 games from the wk that is ours 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.060
 first competition as individual can 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.360
 on the spot there will be little top afterwards and the top 16 must turn 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.540
 and that is that everyone must be there must be one 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.269
 Everybody in the world still needs to get involved and that makes it happen 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.270
 The French who appear this season unapproachable Joris Daudet has ten of them 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.570
 won the ten games 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.030
 that will probably want to win twelve out of twelve 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.380
 Is that going to work 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.880
 i don't have any younger sisters and his teammate but i created 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.230
 europe and 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.460
 I am afraid of it 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.190
 and he really is supreme however he does many technical driving and advises 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.760
 first look m 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.480
 the past few years is a bit more man who is on all sorts than that will be quite 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.630
 It is difficult to get people who participate but that they are first game of van 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.409
 The season 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.790
 part of the rush from his injury could be the match to papendal 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.700
 denounced who must be able to handle a few techniques and here from the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.130
 planks it goes here again piece is very important and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.130
 so stood for important state becomes super important that result winner 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.290
 must stand to make the first bid of 9 degree turns it is too much honor him 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.580
 but if we want to beat the world first then he will 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.560
 you have to make sure that it passes 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.790
 I expect 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.220
 I think he can make one 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.569
 I don't expect them both out 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.069
 he will appear in the elite class on Saturday and Sunday, so why not 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.139
 people come to watch 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.599
 the sports halls and of course a message for me in this sport 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.799
 beh happens everything is a round of 30 to 35 seconds and that did not have to 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.980
 never wait for anyone in the next school in the city 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.730
 happened to be around with 8 men on a job or animal for a better everything 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.039
 speed exclusivity is running 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.829
 so everyone wants hemp in as quickly as possible, everything happens on the way 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.539
 we have had to foresee 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:40.409
 they think of that 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.099
 I think so
