00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
get three cars per pack this will be a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.280 
get three cars per pack this will be a
rather<00:00:38.219> short<00:00:38.550> opening<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.989> believe

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
rather short opening but I do believe

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.810 
rather short opening but I do believe
that<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> hollow<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.219> every<00:00:41.399> pack<00:00:41.640> or

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that you get a hollow in every pack or

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.160 
that you get a hollow in every pack or
at<00:00:41.879> least<00:00:42.000> that's<00:00:42.090> how<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.360> last<00:00:42.420> time<00:00:42.840> so

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
at least that's how it was last time so

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.950 
at least that's how it was last time so
we're<00:00:43.829> gonna<00:00:43.890> see<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:45.180> could<00:00:45.840> pull

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960

we're gonna see if we could pull
anything<00:00:46.200> great<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> think<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.010> most

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
