00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.850
 good afternoon chile good afternoon plans 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.200
 7th street we started with the competition 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.790
 really today as is lucid 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.410
 as a blonde very well to read very 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.389
 worried because the docu that has to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.160
 Below is lovely me 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.820
 worrying because this man is 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.200
 protagonist of that 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.380
 the director starts 17 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.380
 yes 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.680
 quite annoying after the bonus 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.039
 because it was a very clear attack but the 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.689
 place 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.369
 galiana 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.069
 is fair and just selected 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.780
 fernando so 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.590
 a man less next 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.600
 m 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.950
 on the julian site of the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.219
 but no 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:06.579
 of the university we still do not know of 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:06.579
 he will have to choose a yellow 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.930
 is bruno leoni 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.930
 of the yellow team 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.590
 yes 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.210
 congratulate Giuliano who can or 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.500
 Mr. destroy what happened 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.520
 a lot of pain that happened but not 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.520
 it's a cramp 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.729
 and unfortunately 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:40.400
 you can not continue therefore giuliano me 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.400
 what happens he says no 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.239
 very strong because I have seen competing 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.239
 with the 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.720
 to bruno who lost in this competition 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.740
 good if you felt a pull in some 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.539
 muscle means that it did not heat that 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.680
 is an action an action that you had to 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.960
 all competitors before competing 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.190
 especially in intense competition 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.190
 exclusive like this 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:34.580
 this competition first and then 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.380
 to replace it because it is not 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.080
 present this but so everything will do 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.509
 with the 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.580
 It was on Bruno's shoulders and he failed 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.590
 you could tell your classmates what 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.480
 they are currently prosecuting nothing 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.510
 that suddenly 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.760
 they want to maintain power 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.070
 with the old part and really not 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.670
 it has to be like that I think everyone has 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.670
 an opportunity 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.560
 it's a little easier 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:27.330
 fernando gallardo said justice 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.370
 divine that you can tell them but 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.020
 I can say 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:38.949
 when they had to compete the 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:46.610
 people that most tear me for a 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:54.190
 team and for having a people always 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:54.190
 pulling negativity and support 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.750
 a captain who is losing the north 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:03.750
 a captain 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:11.410
 but 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.000
 of your team's intern before 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:18.180
 ask him anything I no longer 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.180
 I want to talk to this stÃ©phan man 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.630
 wine will be made because he wants to talk to 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:25.510
 you because you are with the shirt 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:28.449
 of threatened that you to blame sorry 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:31.870
 called and you blame to coleoni plane 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:33.370
 of his nomination I yesterday did not 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.169
 I found in the study therefore no 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.210
 I had a chance to defend myself 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:38.500
 then I since it was an exit 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.479
 super easy for him to nominate someone 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.070
 that was not in the studio and more over 

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:45.340
 then if he has to defend me and what 

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:47.260
 does so he was talking was done to 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.500
 represent me to at least the 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.640
 size 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:54.140
 you believe you believe you believe that if 

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.690
 you have been saved before 

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.550
 to answer me that ladies and gentlemen dm 

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.210
 two minutes we're going to cut and now 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:04.210
 we come back with the real competition in 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.210
 2007
