I'm demonstrating the one man army park
which<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:18.090> my<00:00:18.300> opinion<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.660> most

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
which is in my opinion the most

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.670 
which is in my opinion the most
underrated<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.460> underused<00:00:21.300> perk<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:22.470> first

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
underrated and underused perk the first

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.839 
underrated and underused perk the first
part<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:24.500> I'd<00:00:25.500> say<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.710> come<00:00:25.949> across<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.340> once

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
part I I'd say I come across it once

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.200 
part I I'd say I come across it once
every<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.980> don't<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.580> 10<00:00:29.910> games

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
every I don't know what what 10 games

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.400 
every I don't know what what 10 games
maybe<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.470> really<00:00:31.769> uncommon<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.410> I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
maybe it's just really uncommon and I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.580 
maybe it's just really uncommon and I
say<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> main<00:00:35.280> reason<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:36.780> best<00:00:37.020> way<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> use

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
say the main reason the best way to use

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.930 
say the main reason the best way to use
it<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.860> I'm<00:00:38.100> not<00:00:38.219> saying<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.579> should<00:00:38.790> use

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
it and I'm not saying you should use

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.479 
it and I'm not saying you should use
like<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.450> its<00:00:39.660> kind<00:00:40.200> kind<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.340> bit

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
like this because its kind kind of a bit

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.970 
like this because its kind kind of a bit
cheap<00:00:41.790> I'd<00:00:42.780> say<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> best<00:00:43.230> way<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.469> use<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.649> is

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
cheap I'd say the best way to use it is

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
cheap I'd say the best way to use it is

don't have a problem with them I'm just

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.289 
don't have a problem with them I'm just
thinking<00:01:22.950> they<00:01:23.460> should<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.210> them

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
thinking they should just be one of them

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.350 
thinking they should just be one of them
instead<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.020> two<00:01:25.280> because<00:01:26.280> well<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.939> get<00:01:27.150> one

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
instead of two because well you get one

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.450 
instead of two because well you get one
c4<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.590> claim<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.340> would<00:01:29.369> make

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
c4 and one claim or so it would make

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.179 
c4 and one claim or so it would make
sense<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.240> grenade<00:01:30.509> launcher<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.960> I

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
sense that one grenade launcher to I

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.109 
sense that one grenade launcher to I
don't<00:01:32.189> know<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.430> don't<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.909> problem

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119

don't know I don't really have a problem
i'm<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.509> saying<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:33.990> make<00:01:34.110> sense

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
i'm just saying that would make sense

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.910 
i'm just saying that would make sense

I'd<00:02:08.849> say<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.149> them<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:10.080> don't<00:02:10.920> know<00:02:10.979> how<00:02:11.069> many

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
I'd say that them I don't know how many

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.770 
I'd say that them I don't know how many
people<00:02:11.250> will<00:02:11.580> agree<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.300> I'll<00:02:12.690> look

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
people will agree of this but I'll look

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.800 
people will agree of this but I'll look
at<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:12.959> fight

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
at this fight

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.170 
at this fight
well<00:02:15.890> I'd<00:02:16.890> say<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.190> most<00:02:17.549> important<00:02:17.940> part<00:02:18.120> of

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
well I'd say the most important part of

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.360 
well I'd say the most important part of
doing<00:02:18.390> these<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.260> actual<00:02:19.830> person<00:02:20.280> behind

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
doing these is the actual person behind

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.289 
doing these is the actual person behind
it<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.849> commentary<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.569> personality<00:02:22.140> etc

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
it the commentary the personality etc

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.610 
it the commentary the personality etc
now<00:02:24.299> I<00:02:25.200> can't<00:02:26.099> comment<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.750> why<00:02:27.750> my<00:02:28.140> channel<00:02:28.500> is

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
now I can't comment on why my channel is

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.530 
now I can't comment on why my channel is
well<00:02:29.370> known<00:02:29.580> because<00:02:29.730> I'm<00:02:30.090> not<00:02:30.269> really<00:02:30.420> sure

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
well known because I'm not really sure

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.289 
well known because I'm not really sure
but<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:33.060> way<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.239> go<00:02:33.390> about<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.599> is<00:02:33.750> basically

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
but the way to go about it is basically

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.509 
but the way to go about it is basically
patience<00:02:36.299> I<00:02:36.450> mean<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.930> split<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.470> had<00:02:37.590> about<00:02:37.709> 200

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
patience I mean I split I had about 200

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.039 
patience I mean I split I had about 200
videos<00:02:38.640> uploaded<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.390> World<00:02:39.569> War<00:02:39.659> videos

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.600 
videos uploaded of World War videos
before<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:40.980> got<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.400> what<00:02:41.640> 1000<00:02:42.450> subs<00:02:42.690> so

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
before I got to what 1000 subs so

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.750 
before I got to what 1000 subs so
basically<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:44.790> keep<00:02:45.180> at<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:46.760> definitely

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
basically just keep at it and definitely

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.009 
basically just keep at it and definitely
an<00:02:48.060> important<00:02:48.359> thing<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.480> have<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.989> a

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
an important thing to have is a

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.000 
an important thing to have is a
definitive<00:02:49.769> commentary<00:02:50.220> style<00:02:51.560> I'll<00:02:52.560> take

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
definitive commentary style I'll take

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.130 
definitive commentary style I'll take
seen<00:02:53.489> eyes<00:02:53.640> as<00:02:53.970> an<00:02:54.090> example<00:02:54.359> here<00:02:54.599> if<00:02:54.780> he

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
seen eyes as an example here if he

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.979 
seen eyes as an example here if he
doesn't<00:02:55.410> mind<00:02:57.590> he<00:02:59.390> not<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:00.569> long<00:03:00.720> ago<00:03:00.780> I

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
doesn't mind he not so long ago I

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.869 
doesn't mind he not so long ago I
believe<00:03:01.319> started<00:03:02.099> off<00:03:02.250> with<00:03:02.340> some<00:03:02.459> World<00:03:02.670> War

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
believe started off with some World War

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.140 
believe started off with some World War
videos<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:04.159> extremely<00:03:05.159> quickly<00:03:05.489> he<00:03:05.879> is

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
videos and extremely quickly he is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.860 
videos and extremely quickly he is
channel<00:03:06.930> guru<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.950> kind<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.659> massively<00:03:09.659> and

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
channel guru that kind of massively and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.979 
channel guru that kind of massively and
everyone<00:03:10.109> knows<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.409> now<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.900> was

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
everyone knows in now and that was

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.470 
everyone knows in now and that was
probably<00:03:13.530> partly<00:03:14.430> down<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.790> his<00:03:14.879> games<00:03:15.120> and

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
probably partly down to his games and

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.629 
probably partly down to his games and
also<00:03:16.379> down<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.680> his<00:03:16.799> unique<00:03:17.310> start<00:03:17.579> a

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
also down to his unique start a

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.009 
also down to his unique start a
commentary<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.090> everyone<00:03:18.359> recognizes<00:03:18.599> him

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
commentary that everyone recognizes him

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.099 
commentary that everyone recognizes him

picks up so I switched to my danger
close<00:04:48.620> one<00:04:49.620> strategy<00:04:50.039> already<00:04:50.310> like<00:04:50.460> to<00:04:50.550> use

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699

one man army is now I start off with a

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.860 
one man army is now I start off with a
big<00:04:53.610> heavy<00:04:53.820> machine<00:04:54.210> gun<00:04:54.389> like<00:04:54.510> this<00:04:54.539> stuff

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
big heavy machine gun like this stuff

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.540 
big heavy machine gun like this stuff
picked<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.139> mg<00:04:55.440> for<00:04:55.650> holographic<00:04:56.370> because

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
picked the mg for holographic because

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.120 
picked the mg for holographic because
it's<00:04:56.729> easy<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.360> use<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:58.050> you<00:04:58.710> can<00:04:58.740> just<00:04:58.919> keep

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
it's easy to use and you can just keep

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.620 
it's easy to use and you can just keep
spraying<00:04:59.520> and<00:04:59.729> spraying<00:04:59.850> until<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.479> look

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
spraying and spraying until you look

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.990 
spraying and spraying until you look
until<00:05:01.199> you<00:05:01.289> run<00:05:01.410> out<00:05:01.580> instead<00:05:02.580> of<00:05:02.639> reloading

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
until you run out instead of reloading

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.510 
until you run out instead of reloading
then<00:05:03.300> you<00:05:03.870> choose<00:05:04.110> one<00:05:04.320> man<00:05:04.530> army<00:05:04.680> get<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.400> back

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
then you choose one man army get it back

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.420 
then you choose one man army get it back
out<00:05:05.639> again<00:05:06.740> switch<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.860> my<00:05:07.979> danger<00:05:08.250> close

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
out again switch to my danger close

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.980 
out again switch to my danger close
thing<00:05:08.700> because<00:05:09.000> it<00:05:09.030> will<00:05:09.360> help<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:09.599> pave<00:05:09.810> low

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
thing because it will help the pave low

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.760 
thing because it will help the pave low
out<00:05:10.139> of<00:05:10.229> it<00:05:10.349> and<00:05:12.139> you<00:05:13.139> know<00:05:13.169> it<00:05:13.260> might<00:05:13.530> be<00:05:13.560> cool

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
out of it and you know it might be cool

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.469 
out of it and you know it might be cool
to<00:05:13.830> have<00:05:14.010> two<00:05:14.220> things<00:05:14.520> with<00:05:14.700> 11<00:05:15.060> army<00:05:15.300> so<00:05:15.389> you

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
to have two things with 11 army so you

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.379 
to have two things with 11 army so you
can<00:05:15.599> basically<00:05:15.960> switch<00:05:16.320> between<00:05:16.470> them

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
can basically switch between them

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.520 
can basically switch between them
because<00:05:18.389> once<00:05:18.720> you've<00:05:18.840> switched<00:05:19.050> away<00:05:19.320> from

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
because once you've switched away from

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.129 
because once you've switched away from
it<00:05:19.620> that's<00:05:19.889> it<00:05:20.099> you're<00:05:20.280> stopped<00:05:20.520> on<00:05:20.669> it<00:05:20.960> now<00:05:21.960> if

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
it that's it you're stopped on it now if

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.360 
it that's it you're stopped on it now if
you<00:05:22.260> really<00:05:22.500> want<00:05:22.650> you<00:05:22.740> can<00:05:22.860> continuously

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
you really want you can continuously

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.850 
you really want you can continuously
switch<00:05:23.700> to<00:05:23.849> the<00:05:23.940> same<00:05:24.120> one<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.710> recharge<00:05:25.710> or

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
switch to the same one and recharge or

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.510 
switch to the same one and recharge or
your<00:05:26.039> mo<00:05:26.280> all<00:05:27.030> your<00:05:27.240> grades<00:05:27.810> click<00:05:28.380> claim<00:05:29.340> or

do that with claymores you can only have
two<00:05:34.500> down<00:05:34.710> at<00:05:34.770> once<00:05:35.360> like<00:05:36.360> with<00:05:36.539> scavenger<00:05:36.960> but

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
two down at once like with scavenger but

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.700 
going along and I find out a really
useful<00:05:51.000> tactic<00:05:51.479> especially<00:05:51.930> with<00:05:52.050> a<00:05:52.200> a<00:05:52.410> big

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
useful tactic especially with a a big

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.860 
useful tactic especially with a a big
heavy<00:05:52.889> slow<00:05:53.310> gun<00:05:53.550> like<00:05:53.760> a<00:05:53.789> light<00:05:54.419> machine<00:05:54.690> gun
