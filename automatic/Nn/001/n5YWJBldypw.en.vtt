I<00:00:08.179> am<00:00:09.179> Martin<00:00:09.660> Lindstrom<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:11.099> author<00:00:11.400> of

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
I am Martin Lindstrom the author of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.930 
I am Martin Lindstrom the author of
biology<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.769> brainwashed<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.670> mean

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
biology and of brainwashed and I mean

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.140 
biology and of brainwashed and I mean
can<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:18.199> think<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.320> very<00:00:19.470> clear<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:19.949> most<00:00:20.939> of

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
can I think it's very clear that most of

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.910 
can I think it's very clear that most of
the<00:00:21.240> decisions<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.080> make<00:00:22.380> every<00:00:22.710> day

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the decisions you and I make every day

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.160 
the decisions you and I make every day
is<00:00:22.980> made<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.550> non-conscious<00:00:24.510> part<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
is made in the non-conscious part of the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.960 
is made in the non-conscious part of the
brain<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.769> really<00:00:26.010> didn't<00:00:26.250> know<00:00:26.279> how<00:00:26.939> much

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
brain and we really didn't know how much

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.240 
brain and we really didn't know how much
of<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> stuff<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:28.050> every<00:00:28.289> day<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.439> made<00:00:28.980> at

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
of the stuff we do every day is made at

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.640 
of the stuff we do every day is made at
our<00:00:29.519> subconscious<00:00:30.150> level<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:31.140> now<00:00:31.349> after

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
our subconscious level but now after

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.069 
our subconscious level but now after
doing<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.430> biology<00:00:33.120> book<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.570> realize<00:00:33.899> that

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
doing the biology book we realize that

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.170 
doing the biology book we realize that
eighty-five<00:00:34.890> percent<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.579> everything<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:36.059> do

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
eighty-five percent of everything we do

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.000 
eighty-five percent of everything we do
takes<00:00:36.510> place<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.989> our<00:00:37.140> subconscious<00:00:37.380> part<00:00:37.890> of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
takes place in our subconscious part of

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.459 
takes place in our subconscious part of
the<00:00:38.070> brain<00:00:38.329> so<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> inspiration<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.230> me<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the brain so the inspiration for me to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.260 
the brain so the inspiration for me to
write<00:00:40.680> biology<00:00:41.250> was<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.550> find<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:41.850> what<00:00:42.059> goes

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
write biology was to find out what goes

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
write biology was to find out what goes
on<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.719> black<00:00:43.079> box<00:00:43.110> how<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:44.040> conduct

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
on in that black box how do we conduct

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.790 
on in that black box how do we conduct
research<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.030> really<00:00:45.270> find<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:45.989> campaigns

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
research to really find out if campaigns

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.369 
research to really find out if campaigns
work<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:47.520> don't<00:00:47.789> work<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.300> most<00:00:48.899> important

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
work or don't work and most important

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.590 
work or don't work and most important
for<00:00:49.530> me<00:00:49.770> how<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.280> appeal<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> consumers<00:00:51.120> in

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
for me how do we appeal to consumers in

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.740 
for me how do we appeal to consumers in
a<00:00:51.840> different<00:00:52.350> more<00:00:52.680> irrational<00:00:53.430> way<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.719> that

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
a different more irrational way so that

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.569 
a different more irrational way so that
was<00:00:55.110> really<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.379> inspiration<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:56.280> me<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
was really the inspiration for me to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.029 
was really the inspiration for me to
write<00:00:56.899> biology<00:00:57.899> I<00:01:00.440> need<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.649> honest<00:01:01.859> with

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
write biology I need to be honest with

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.640 
write biology I need to be honest with
you<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> think<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:03.260> advertising<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.500> know

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
you I think that advertising as we know

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.770 
you I think that advertising as we know
today<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.460> kind<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.850> fading<00:01:06.210> out<00:01:06.299> because

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
today is kind of fading out because

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
today is kind of fading out because
there's<00:01:06.990> no<00:01:07.140> way<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:07.920> prove

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
there's no way we can really prove

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.280 
there's no way we can really prove
things<00:01:08.909> works<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.510> accept<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> sales

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
things works or not accept the sales

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.230 
things works or not accept the sales
numbers<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:11.939> all<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
numbers but what do we do in all the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.179 
numbers but what do we do in all the
stages<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.080> selling<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> product<00:01:14.010> how<00:01:14.130> do

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
stages up to selling the product how do

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.940 
stages up to selling the product how do
we<00:01:14.340> know<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.790> ad<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.299> or<00:01:15.450> wrong<00:01:15.950> so

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
we know if that ad is right or wrong so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.859 
we know if that ad is right or wrong so
asking<00:01:17.759> people<00:01:18.060> questions<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.479> think<00:01:18.689> all<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
asking people questions I think all of

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.399 
asking people questions I think all of
you<00:01:19.110> guys<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.640> answer<00:01:20.820> i

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
you guys know that is not the answer i

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.630 
you guys know that is not the answer i
thoroughly<00:01:22.409> believe<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.220> need<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.430> go

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
thoroughly believe that we need to go

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.789 
thoroughly believe that we need to go
deeper<00:01:23.670> into<00:01:24.299> our<00:01:24.540> brains<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.290> understand<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
deeper into our brains to understand the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.440 
deeper into our brains to understand the
answer<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.520> know<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.850> full<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.299> complete

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
answer do we know the full and complete

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450 
answer do we know the full and complete
answer<00:01:27.990> by<00:01:28.140> scanning<00:01:28.439> people's<00:01:28.799> brains<00:01:29.040> no

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
answer by scanning people's brains no

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.450 
answer by scanning people's brains no
absolutely<00:01:29.790> not<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.079> gives<00:01:31.259> us<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.770> little

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
absolutely not but it gives us a little

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.219 
absolutely not but it gives us a little
bit<00:01:32.610> more<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.909> insight<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.509> fact<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.810> tend<00:01:34.079> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
bit more of insight in fact I tend to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.140 
bit more of insight in fact I tend to
say<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.280> live<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.670> world<00:01:35.820> where

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
say that if you live in a world where

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.210 
say that if you live in a world where
everyone<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.450> blind<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.200> one-eyed<00:01:37.439> is

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
everyone is blind the one-eyed is

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.499 
everyone is blind the one-eyed is
probably<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> one<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:38.970> power<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
probably the one with the power and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.149 
probably the one with the power and
that's<00:01:39.659> really<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> way<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.860> in

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that's really the way I see in

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.130 
that's really the way I see in
neuroscience<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.090> marketing<00:01:42.750> coming

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
neuroscience and marketing coming

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.289 
neuroscience and marketing coming
together<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.090> take<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
together we now see know if I take a

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.600 
together we now see know if I take a
look<00:01:45.390> at<00:01:45.630> my<00:01:45.780> fortune<00:01:46.470> 100<00:01:46.950> brands<00:01:47.220> i<00:01:47.399> work

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
look at my fortune 100 brands i work

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.609 
look at my fortune 100 brands i work
with<00:01:47.850> around<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> world<00:01:48.450> around<00:01:48.990> sixty

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
with around the world around sixty

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.200 
with around the world around sixty
percent<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:50.100> using<00:01:50.430> newer<00:01:50.579> marketing<00:01:51.060> so

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
percent are using newer marketing so

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
percent are using newer marketing so
