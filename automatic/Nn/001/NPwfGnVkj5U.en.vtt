00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:50.820 
that but anyway let's get into it see
what<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.040> says<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.400> tear<00:01:41.610> here

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.270 

that<00:01:51.830> it<00:01:51.980> is<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.220> go<00:01:52.310> around<00:01:52.580> I<00:01:54.160> think<00:01:55.160> that

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
that it is it go around I think that

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.500 
that it is it go around I think that
might<00:01:55.400> be<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:55.580> oh<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:58.250> see<00:01:58.430> that's<00:01:58.970> makes<00:01:59.270> sense

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
might be it oh I see that's makes sense

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.780 
might be it oh I see that's makes sense
that's<00:01:59.630> why<00:01:59.780> this<00:01:59.840> little<00:02:00.170> things<00:02:00.350> here

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
that's why this little things here

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.690 
that's why this little things here
that's<00:02:01.790> cool<00:02:03.040> there<00:02:04.040> it<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.340> then<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.550> just

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
that's cool there it is and then it just

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.270 
that's cool there it is and then it just
fold<00:02:04.910> back<00:02:05.060> down<00:02:05.330> snaps<00:02:06.229> on<00:02:06.440> I<00:02:06.680> guess<00:02:07.070> they<00:02:07.220> do

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
fold back down snaps on I guess they do

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.949 
fold back down snaps on I guess they do
this<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:07.760> don't<00:02:07.910> lose<00:02:08.090> your<00:02:08.240> lid<00:02:08.450> which<00:02:08.840> is

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
this so you don't lose your lid which is

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.260 
this so you don't lose your lid which is
actually<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.440> pretty<00:02:09.619> good<00:02:09.800> idea<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.310> what<00:02:11.209> you

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
actually a pretty good idea and what you

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.320 
actually a pretty good idea and what you
can<00:02:11.390> do<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:11.780> if<00:02:12.020> you<00:02:12.110> need<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.150> even

can do is if you need it to you can even

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.780
