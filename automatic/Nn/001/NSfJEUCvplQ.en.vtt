their biceps other guys not so much so
if<00:00:35.280> there<00:00:35.550> were<00:00:35.670> specific<00:00:36.149> exercises<00:00:36.660> that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
if there were specific exercises that

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.889 
if there were specific exercises that
allow<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.160> change<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.940> shape<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
allow you to change the shape of the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.049 
allow you to change the shape of the
muscle<00:00:40.290> when<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> flexed<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:41.879> could

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
muscle when it flexed then we all could

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.119 
muscle when it flexed then we all could
look<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> same<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.559> not<00:00:43.739> quite<00:00:44.010> that

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
look the same but it's not quite that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.750 
look the same but it's not quite that
way<00:00:44.640> again<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:46.020> size<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.620> your<00:00:46.770> muscles<00:00:47.219> once

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
way again the size of your muscles once

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.639 
way again the size of your muscles once
they're<00:00:48.090> built<00:00:48.360> or<00:00:48.660> made<00:00:48.840> huge<00:00:49.200> again<00:00:49.469> it's

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
they're built or made huge again it's

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.290 
they're built or made huge again it's
gonna<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:49.890> determined<00:00:50.309> by<00:00:50.399> genetics<00:00:50.969> your<00:00:51.149> mom

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
gonna be determined by genetics your mom

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.810 
gonna be determined by genetics your mom
and<00:00:51.480> dad<00:00:51.629> how<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> muscle<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.010> shaped<00:00:53.309> how<00:00:53.640> it

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and dad how the muscle is shaped how it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
and dad how the muscle is shaped how it
flexes<00:00:54.360> how<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:54.840> put<00:00:55.140> together<00:00:55.289> your

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
flexes how your put together your

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.279 
flexes how your put together your
biomechanics<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.539> regards<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> drop

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
biomechanics so with regards to drop

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.650 
biomechanics so with regards to drop
sets<00:00:58.590> not<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> bad<00:00:59.399> way<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.850> creating<00:01:00.210> variety

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
sets not a bad way of creating variety

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.330 
sets not a bad way of creating variety
with<00:01:00.809> your<00:01:00.960> workout<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:02.070> not

gymnastic<00:01:30.180> exercises<00:01:30.750> dude<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:32.100> are<00:01:32.130> you

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
gymnastic exercises dude what are you

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.539 
gymnastic exercises dude what are you
doing<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.180> whole<00:01:33.360> concept<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.430> handle<00:01:35.430> as

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
doing the whole concept is to handle as

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.050 
doing the whole concept is to handle as
much<00:01:35.790> weight<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.780> create<00:01:37.140> an<00:01:37.470> intense

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
much weight so we can create an intense

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
much weight so we can create an intense
muscular<00:01:39.060> contraction<00:01:39.900> that's<00:01:40.470> why<00:01:40.740> muscles

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
muscular contraction that's why muscles

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.340 
muscular contraction that's why muscles
grow<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> intensity<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
grow it's because of the intensity of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.050 
grow it's because of the intensity of
the<00:01:43.439> contraction<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.579> you're<00:01:44.729> jerking

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
the contraction but if you're jerking

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.480 
the contraction but if you're jerking
around<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.720> ball<00:01:46.020> or<00:01:46.380> standing<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.159> foot

feel heavy but they don't create the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.470 
feel heavy but they don't create the
same<00:02:10.470> type<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.739> trauma<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.610> muscle<00:02:12.030> as<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
same type of trauma on the muscle as the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.600 
same type of trauma on the muscle as the
hundreds<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.680> again<00:02:13.980> as<00:02:14.220> long<00:02:14.250> as<00:02:14.430> you're

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
hundreds so again as long as you're

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.240 
hundreds so again as long as you're
lifting<00:02:14.730> safety<00:02:15.330> that's<00:02:15.989> important<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
lifting safety that's important but the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.430 
lifting safety that's important but the
heavier<00:02:17.580> weight<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.270> lift<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.230> more

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
heavier weight you can lift and the more

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.589 
heavier weight you can lift and the more
trauma<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.220> can<00:02:20.400> inflict<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.090> muscle<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
trauma you can inflict on the muscle the

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.650 
trauma you can inflict on the muscle the
more<00:02:21.810> micro<00:02:22.530> tears<00:02:22.830> occur<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.879> more<00:02:24.090> repair

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
more micro tears occur the more repair

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.070 
more micro tears occur the more repair
you<00:02:24.930> get<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.709> bigger<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.640> become<00:02:27.080> the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
you get the bigger you you become the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.710

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
muscle takes time remember it happens at

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.920 
muscle takes time remember it happens at
the<00:04:01.500> cellular<00:04:01.860> level<00:04:02.129> we're<00:04:02.849> fixing<00:04:03.450> muscle

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
the cellular level we're fixing muscle

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.770 
the cellular level we're fixing muscle
fibers<00:04:04.530> at<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:05.250> cellular<00:04:05.670> level<00:04:05.879> so<00:04:06.480> we<00:04:06.599> need<00:04:06.750> a

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
fibers at a cellular level so we need a

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.509 
fibers at a cellular level so we need a
lot<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.049> those<00:04:07.260> changes<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.830> occur<00:04:08.189> before<00:04:08.370> you

improve your muscularity but by doing
shorter<00:05:16.400> more<00:05:16.550> intense<00:05:16.610> cardio<00:05:17.570> you're<00:05:18.289> going

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
shorter more intense cardio you're going

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:19.899 
shorter more intense cardio you're going
to<00:05:18.470> save<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:18.860> energy<00:05:19.159> at<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.340> lift<00:05:19.610> and

systemic changes because for systemic
changes<00:05:34.849> to<00:05:35.000> occur<00:05:35.360> we<00:05:35.599> need<00:05:35.750> to<00:05:35.840> be<00:05:35.930> using<00:05:36.080> the

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
changes to occur we need to be using the

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.279 
changes to occur we need to be using the
big<00:05:36.860> muscles<00:05:37.280> of<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:38.120> body<00:05:38.360> the<00:05:38.659> legs<00:05:38.900> the

hips your rear end okay those are the
ones<00:05:42.050> that<00:05:42.169> create<00:05:42.560> systemic<00:05:43.009> changes<00:05:43.550> that

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
ones that create systemic changes that

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.310 
ones that create systemic changes that
really<00:05:44.180> improve<00:05:44.509> your<00:05:44.659> cardiovascular
