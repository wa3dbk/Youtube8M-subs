00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:17.660
 Now I will tell show you how we do 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:23.750
 there was a walkway on the stretch to 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:26.960
 kill you have these perennial weeds 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.000
 rhizome which destroy represent 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.000
 you for this we do 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:42.170
 I have a density of 60 grams 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:45.760
 so I fold it the city ​​began can 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.760
 be spoiled 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.900
 we fold it 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:57.250
 I would like the floor to go around 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.250
 side therefore 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.270
 people bend a little 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:16.950
 what will be several layers this even 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:18.980
 Well, more precisely, you do not need to say anything 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.640
 do 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.640
 dig not send 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.020
 here we raise higher 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.080
 nec 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.060
 here we already have such a film frame 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.060
 that's really lane 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.040
 fix 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.040
 it is necessary 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.020
 if you live 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.040
 shouted himself 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:55.430
 in this direction then we will also lay 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:59.870
 also film on this track we are with this 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.440
 do further if we have here even 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.140
 surface 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.140
 you can just fall asleep with sand 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:42.410
 and rammer and so on, respectively 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.590
 how much sand do you want ? 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.069
 how much 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.069
 you have 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.069
 here 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:57.980
 current which about two months ago 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:03.260
 flowers lies from the rain and from walking and 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.260
 tamped he stepped on top 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:11.220
 of course shoes that drags the soil 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:18.919
 it's okay Well me 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:21.989
 he doesn't trample down the ground because of the film 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.720
 fixed on the surface and gradually 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:42.600
 just tamped if its 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:45.870
 we are already progressively planning 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.690
 how to fall asleep with sand here 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.960
 just lies feet she lies here it 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.500
 film mission lay can 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:05:00.090
 give way to days during this time 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:04.770
 such changes all the grass died inside 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:10.580
 swept away here is not that the top piece 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.580
 it will be beautiful right here pebbles from each 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.990
 friend was technology at first I 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.660
 laid out on the film large cobblestones 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:25.289
 what things and big skiers 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:30.560
 more flat shape and then between these 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.560
 Cobblestones in the gap I fell asleep scribe 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.460
 here it is all 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:44.070
 At first this firmware was all sand 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:49.400
 rammed here right here and only 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.400
 silhouette covered the sand between the stones 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:11.460
 great track i have nothing xero shaft 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:14.159
 no student account due to the fact that 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.199
 up laid relative to each other 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:21.620
 tight they don't move don't count 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:21.620
 keeps up 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.800
 here here under these large stones 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.350
 along the flower bed that go pick up too 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.370
 the film is sure that we have 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:40.210
 here comes here otherwise he loves nobody 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:44.140
 it does not climb all grow print oil here 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:47.830
 such a simple cheap in my opinion 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:53.740
 effective way to create tracks or 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:56.890
 some grounds are always the garden chief 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:00.060
 plus the fact that weeds will not germinate 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:03.160
 this black film between the stones and 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.260
 that the sand is poured on top 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.820
 it will not heat to the soil 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:13.230
 fade away your tracks like this 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.230
 The main problem I do not know
