00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
revival first off you're going to tie it

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.230 
revival first off you're going to tie it
like<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:24.890> first<00:00:25.890> move<00:00:26.160> very<00:00:26.760> basic<00:00:27.920> next<00:00:28.920> move

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
like so first move very basic next move

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.020 
like so first move very basic next move
not<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.420> basic<00:00:31.610> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> fold<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.480> half

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
not so basic going to fold this in half

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.150 
not so basic going to fold this in half
like<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.469> to<00:00:37.469> form<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> base<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.300> bowtie

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
like so to form the base of the bowtie

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.680 
like so to form the base of the bowtie
going<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.280> get<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.579> as<00:00:41.790> symmetrical<00:00:42.450> as

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
going to get it as symmetrical as

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.119 
going to get it as symmetrical as
possible<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:45.500> then<00:00:46.500> you're<00:00:46.620> going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.920> take

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
possible and then you're going to take

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.439 
possible and then you're going to take
the<00:00:47.820> bottom<00:00:48.149> one<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:49.440> move<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.460> down

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.970 

now<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.870> see<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.590> base<00:00:55.770> has<00:00:56.129> formed<00:00:57.980> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
now you can see the base has formed the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.189 
now you can see the base has formed the
bowtie<00:01:00.350> now<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.649> extra<00:01:02.010> part<00:01:02.809> this<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.019> where

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
bowtie now this extra part this is where

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.460 
bowtie now this extra part this is where
it<00:01:04.260> gets<00:01:04.379> really<00:01:04.769> tough<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:06.840> pull<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
it gets really tough you pull that to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.250 
it gets really tough you pull that to
the<00:01:07.500> side<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.189> has<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> loop<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.260> this

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the side that has the loop in it this

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.590 
the side that has the loop in it this
side<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.650> single<00:01:11.010> over<00:01:11.189> here<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
side is single over here just like a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.570 
side is single over here just like a
little<00:01:12.780> bit<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.890> you're<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> pull<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
little bit so you're going to pull it to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.060 
little bit so you're going to pull it to
the<00:01:14.640> side<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> loop<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.890> then<00:01:16.890> you're

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the side of the loop and then you're

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.999 
the side of the loop and then you're
going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> fold<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.830> can

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
going to fold it like so so that you can

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.950 
going to fold it like so so that you can
see<00:01:20.270> another<00:01:21.270> bow<00:01:21.600> tie<00:01:22.909> like<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.299> bowtie

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
see another bow tie like so so bowtie

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.510 
see another bow tie like so so bowtie
here<00:01:28.229> bowtie<00:01:29.100> here

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
here bowtie here

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.640 
here bowtie here
now<00:01:30.210> you're<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.750> shove<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.290> through

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
now you're going to shove that through

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:46.430 
now you're going to shove that through
the<00:01:31.829> knot<00:01:32.270> which<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.299> difficult

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:55.700 

but<00:01:47.090> rewarding<00:01:52.760> so<00:01:54.080> now<00:01:55.080> we<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.470> pulled

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
but rewarding so now we have it pulled

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.190 
but rewarding so now we have it pulled
through<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> other<00:01:56.460> side<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.180> all<00:01:57.960> that's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
through the other side and all that's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.720 
through the other side and all that's
left<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.160> lot<00:01:59.580> of<00:01:59.820> adjusting<00:02:01.670> tighten<00:02:02.670> or

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
left is a lot of adjusting tighten or

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.840 
left is a lot of adjusting tighten or
not<00:02:05.570> pull<00:02:06.570> both<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.840> sides<00:02:07.460> try<00:02:08.460> and<00:02:08.550> get<00:02:08.670> them

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
not pull both the sides try and get them

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.480 
not pull both the sides try and get them
as<00:02:09.000> symmetrical<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:09.840> possible<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:14.010> perfect

bow tie is going to have a little crease
on<00:02:17.280> both<00:02:17.580> sides

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280
