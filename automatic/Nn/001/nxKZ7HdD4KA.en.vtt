00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.800
 no i am petra you let me be here 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.660
 came to live thirteen years ago 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.880
 then we actually had one 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.430
 completely redesigned into swimming pool 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.480
 we have laid with terraces 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.670
 and directly connected to the kitchen and 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.980
 have chosen that woman who won't 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.779
 have where we also have s tackle 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
 it went really well there 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.719
 because we could choose their other pattern 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.820
 we are not very traditional one 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.030
 major incident was on it 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.280
 wr anti-slip white slime here when we got it 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.649
 swimming pool went for the floor 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.710
 had experience of an ordinary wooden 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.980
 floor after sliding on out and additionally 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.870
 there is a lot of moss on the and 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.070
 then you keep cleaning and I had 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.500
 nothing can see 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.559
 so that's why we have esthec terrace oh 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.879
 they we now have a beautiful pool 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.609
 an aztec floor 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.890
 the children who can do without splinters 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.990
 in their feet the hard eyes and it is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.400
 such a dry them easy to clean 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.200
 and not warm at your feet 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.630
 i yes i am really very satisfied 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.909
 about we wanted those colors and it 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.439
 bring material back 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.140
 then we also applied it in the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.689
 planters and furthermore we have the one 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.780
 bar in combination with it 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.119
 black hold i have no splinters 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.130
 I am not gliding it looks 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.360
 look like yes anyway like actually 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.470
 gray tint you have that beautiful 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.080
 grooves in it 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.930
 it softly feels a bit springy in it 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.480
 on something similar to your feet 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.390
 the hearts I do not think I think you have 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.340
 they call it plastic wood 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.120
 I really like that you can see it too 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.760
 also has more shine going through it 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.740
 seems more plastic and and this material 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.780
 cools down very quickly 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.780
 just over the winter and you're even 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.580
 with a dark color and lost the heat 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.640
 a pattern s check we 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.530
 actually adjusted to the 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.340
 structure of the berglaan so that you 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.770
 whole 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.540
 depth gets vol side 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.330
 the end are three different ones 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.440
 colors because then there are more empty in the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.730
 Wester Klam and you click it on one 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.860
 on a clip and then you pull it off 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.129
 and then you can put it in those grooves 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.989
 weather 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.989
 click on it 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.840
 the sustainable aspect is important for 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.750
 me it is not the cheapest 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.290
 material but then you know that you have the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.340
 next 20 years 30 40 nothing about it 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.330
 have to do 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.340
 I really like the beach 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.920
 feeling what I actually like 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.940
 wanted when you run over it sounds that too 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.849
 so 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.140
 the color is really perfect i 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.260
 know you are really very satisfied 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.450
 I certainly think about this one 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.629
 application but also when you join one 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.870
 want to make a pond and a platform or you 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.730
 have a fairly shady garden than you can 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.650
 I really imagine that this is one 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.299
 super solution is because you have the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.810
 pressure washer is intent 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:25.019
 looks nice the color stays like 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.269
 which is for me has it 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.660
 yes i really like the aesthetic 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.660
 product
