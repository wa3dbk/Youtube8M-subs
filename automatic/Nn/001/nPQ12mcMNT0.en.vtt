00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.930
 Jagr Eugene Onegin by works 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.620
 Pushkin although nothing to do with him she does not 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.850
 has besides alimony the main characters and 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.699
 general plot strings 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.569
 uncle died you drive 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:16.630
 to the village 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.860
 honestly m very often asked me 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.189
 do a review on this game but I don't even know 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.099
 what can I say it's just insane 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.679
 this is a black screen 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.969
 which finally ended me 

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:30.249
 bringing up some kind of Finnish 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.530
 Apparently the gonorrhea museum is starting to look 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.280
 something like a multicast 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.080
 static pictures and more 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.670
 of all states I like to read 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.610
 certainly especially when i'm sitting on may 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.460
 the percentage of places and not so remote 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.080
 from the kitchen usually gave our country tons but 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.610
 forgive me 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.460

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.440
 saw amazon that the attack on this made the markets 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.570
 makes the newspaper reader interesting 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.209
 lyrics but in this case the movie was 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.419
 he even behaved to someone who reads Eugene 

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:04.170
 one in this game is winter and that is boring 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.380
 engaged in fuel his voice expresses 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.180
 discontent pudozhskogo forced 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.220
 do now deputy chairman is happy about it 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.990
 study and you just what they say it 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.659
 what is his feelings over the classics 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.150
 I don't know 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.890
 Date Street remembered Anna's movie well 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.570
 with a blow to the altar suli potap a shakespeare where 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.570
 modern to me like a brother 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.180
 tons under the classic president was 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.650
 changed to modern reality 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.409
 is there let's say I don't remember who what side 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.009
 carat freedom perm in my Negro and so 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:32.469
 Further 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.389
 but still it was funny and they 

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:35.259
 spoke really 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.399
 original absolutely snow solution text 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.959
 no one said his that there is experience 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:41.700
 work with new shakespeare 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.780
 give so in this case, I'm not very 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.450
 I understand what the hell is this process 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.560
 Russian purchases I have already said they called me 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.560
 expert team program where 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.820
 understood barriers asked me 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.660
 assessment when that is generally as I could because 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.850
 what did the graphic novel 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.979
 I first did not understand and leaving to be honest 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.770
 what is this genre because 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.420
 canceled this static picture with 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.810
 text in the second I do not understand why 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.459
 allowed to use the method 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.100
 who owns the brand change that 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.950
 called clean American 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.360
 suburb because the brand belongs to 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.360
 migraine onegin in general why is it so easy 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.510
 gets deadlines for some kind of gate because 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.290
 that if they could test they could not 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.790
 use the name of the day and 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.489
 Onegin This game would be called 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.040
 static they are machine pictures with blue 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.119
 character 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.149
 this is all what this game describes 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:32.639
 why i don't know him 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.109
 I in her sushinsky tricolor was just 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.120
 the dialogue is just every when I am offered 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:39.639
 do something 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.299
 it lasted for a very long time 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.209
 nothing happened why bother to take 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.109
 the name of the day and not what it is designed for 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.439
 I do not think that among the modern 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.579
 schoolchildren to the feelings of eugene onegin as 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.769
 then so scanty 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:52.210
 I know 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.380
 in the second stop classics, he is not very 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.640
 known especially Alexander sergeevich 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.040
 Pushkin is a matter and our state 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.560
 countries they mm but only hairstyles 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.959
 graphic novels 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.530
 it is not our property 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.090

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.909

 base it to sculpt one more not mine missing 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.260
 she's here these who sit all day and 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.700
 watch your naruto it's cool they let u 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.329
 what the hell is playing 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.409
 percent lovers alexander 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.479
 Sergeevich Pushkin debt when I saw 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.229
 this game store I thought in my 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:29.749
 favorite work earlier 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:31.400
 Nbu who wrote to me while composing 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.600
 including introductory 1 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.150
 I will buy this game and again we will see 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.729
 I have three pleasure supposedly 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.369
 because i touched this 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:43.509
 great classics that i finally saw 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:46.209
 here the percentage is the moment when 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.899
 Perm standing Lensk gets up with 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:49.889
 graves you need him once again made 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.489
 in spite of the fact that I am even different 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.279
 moment and doubted that in general the game 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:55.220
 because I already 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.850
 such a 20 minute continuing prank on 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.750
 the picture is not going right yet 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.389
 region 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.019
 wiring but look in the menu 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.569
 womb that that this game with Pushkin but the game 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:06.879
 computer 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.409
 this is not a game this is nonsense
