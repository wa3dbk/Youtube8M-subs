00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.790 

because<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.840> think<00:02:53.900> sometimes<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.560> could<00:02:54.650> be<00:02:54.709> a

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
because I think sometimes it could be a

because I think sometimes it could be a
bit<00:02:54.980> daunting<00:02:55.459> just<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.940> start<00:02:56.450> here's<00:02:57.080> the
