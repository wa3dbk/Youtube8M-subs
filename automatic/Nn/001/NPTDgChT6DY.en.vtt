I was cringing and I was thinking to
myself<00:03:19.050> all<00:03:19.560> right<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.860> started<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.790> break

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
myself all right that started to break

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.310 
myself all right that started to break
the<00:03:21.120> boundaries<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.540> talked<00:03:21.810> about<00:03:22.050> early<00:03:22.290> on

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
the boundaries I talked about early on

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.650 
the boundaries I talked about early on
introduce<00:03:22.830> us<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.940> graphic<00:03:24.330> side<00:03:24.510> of

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
introduce us to this the graphic side of

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.390 
introduce us to this the graphic side of
it<00:03:24.780> well<00:03:24.990> again<00:03:25.080> going<00:03:25.200> back<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.620> what<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.310> think

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
it well again going back to what I think

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.160 
it well again going back to what I think
is<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.000> real<00:03:27.180> best<00:03:27.630> selling<00:03:27.990> point<00:03:28.140> of

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
is the the real best selling point of

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.290 
is the the real best selling point of
the<00:03:28.260> show<00:03:28.380> even<00:03:28.500> beyond<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.980> action<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
the show even beyond the action is the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.330 
the show even beyond the action is the
morality<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.080> hero<00:03:31.440> finding<00:03:32.040> his

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
morality of it is a hero finding his

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.040 
morality of it is a hero finding his
footing<00:03:32.730> deciding<00:03:33.360> what's<00:03:33.510> right<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.750> what's

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
footing deciding what's right and what's

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.280 
footing deciding what's right and what's
wrong

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
wrong

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.560 
wrong
and<00:03:34.590> then<00:03:34.950> he's<00:03:35.760> already<00:03:35.940> made<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> decision<00:03:36.270> to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
and then he's already made a decision to

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.180 
and then he's already made a decision to
do<00:03:36.690> something<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.020> is<00:03:37.110> arguably<00:03:37.500> wrong<00:03:37.800> and

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
do something that is arguably wrong and

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.530 
do something that is arguably wrong and
so<00:03:38.400> we<00:03:38.459> need<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.700> decide<00:03:38.970> for<00:03:39.120> himself<00:03:39.240> where

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
so we need to decide for himself where

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.060 
so we need to decide for himself where
the<00:03:39.660> line<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:39.959> cuz<00:03:40.140> only<00:03:40.380> he<00:03:40.530> gets<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.890> draw

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
the line is cuz only he gets to draw

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.650 
the line is cuz only he gets to draw
that<00:03:41.250> line<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.880> we're<00:03:41.970> gonna<00:03:42.060> see<00:03:42.330> him<00:03:42.480> make

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
that line and we're gonna see him make

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.240 
that line and we're gonna see him make
some<00:03:42.870> mistakes<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.709> is<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.980> think<00:03:44.010> this

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
some mistakes and this is I think this

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.710 
some mistakes and this is I think this
is<00:03:44.370> one<00:03:44.850> thing<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.060> do<00:03:45.120> like<00:03:45.270> about<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.600> show

identity and figuring out what the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.960 
identity and figuring out what the
limitations<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:55.680> idea<00:04:55.950> well<00:04:56.610> I<00:04:56.640> think

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
limitations of that idea well I think

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.910 
limitations of that idea well I think
the<00:04:57.300> whole<00:04:57.480> because<00:04:57.870> they<00:04:58.050> wrap<00:04:58.290> up<00:04:58.530> the

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
the whole because they wrap up the

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.740 
the whole because they wrap up the
battlin<00:04:59.250> Jack<00:04:59.430> Murdock<00:04:59.460> flashbacks<00:05:00.270> in<00:05:00.570> these

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
that we're plowing through it three is

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.590 
that we're plowing through it three is
where<00:05:09.300> they<00:05:09.390> really<00:05:10.220> yeah<00:05:11.220> apex<00:05:11.670> right<00:05:12.180> okay

where they really yeah apex right okay
what<00:05:12.780> more<00:05:12.960> plowing<00:05:13.560> through<00:05:13.710> it<00:05:13.890> is<00:05:14.100> is<00:05:14.550> my

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
what more plowing through it is is my

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.650 
what more plowing through it is is my
point
