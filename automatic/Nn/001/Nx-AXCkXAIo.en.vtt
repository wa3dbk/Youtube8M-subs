thought<00:02:40.640> we<00:02:40.820> would<00:02:41.120> might<00:02:41.299> begin<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:42.170> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
thought we would might begin in the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.430 
thought we would might begin in the
catalogue<00:02:43.010> for<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.280> show<00:02:43.959> mark<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.170> talked

catalogue for the show mark and I talked

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.180 
catalogue for the show mark and I talked
about<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:46.100> this<00:02:46.760> era<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.709> Mark<00:02:48.709> at<00:02:48.829> one<00:02:48.980> point

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
about the this era and Mark at one point

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.060 
about the this era and Mark at one point
says<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:51.110> want<00:02:51.230> me<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.470> own<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.799> to<00:02:51.950> the

says you want me to own up to the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.490 
says you want me to own up to the
sociology<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.790> sexual<00:02:53.209> excess<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.019> 70s

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
sociology and sexual excess of the 70s

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.130 
sociology and sexual excess of the 70s
or<00:02:55.100> indeed<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.430> admit<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.120> as<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.660> repressed

or indeed to admit that as a repressed
Midwestern<00:02:57.799> or<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:57.980> was<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:58.310> completely<00:02:58.459> taken

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
Midwestern or I was so completely taken

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.759 
Midwestern or I was so completely taken
up<00:02:59.120> by<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.299> sheer<00:02:59.660> sexual<00:03:00.200> impact<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.739> that

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
up by the sheer sexual impact of that

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.130 
up by the sheer sexual impact of that
tsunami<00:03:01.400> moment<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:02.390> might<00:03:02.570> work<00:03:02.720> with<00:03:02.959> some

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
tsunami moment that might work with some

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.930 
tsunami moment that might work with some
orgiastic<00:03:03.560> celebration<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.579> it<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.850> I've

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
orgiastic celebration of it and I've

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.580 
orgiastic celebration of it and I've
been<00:03:05.090> forever<00:03:05.420> after<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.900> post-coital<00:03:06.350> II

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
been forever after a post-coital II

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.830 
been forever after a post-coital II
living<00:03:06.859> in<00:03:06.950> its<00:03:07.100> wake

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.530 

both<00:03:11.840> these<00:03:12.110> things<00:03:12.410> are<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.980> course<00:03:13.220> true<00:03:13.670> but

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
both these things are of course true but

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.870 
both these things are of course true but
to<00:03:14.690> me<00:03:14.840> it's<00:03:14.960> too<00:03:15.140> simple<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.770> tidy<00:03:16.190> reading

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
to me it's too simple and tidy reading

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.210 
to me it's too simple and tidy reading
so<00:03:17.660> this<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:18.020> a<00:03:18.050> typical<00:03:18.260> mark<00:03:18.740> move<00:03:18.950> he's

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
so this is a typical mark move he's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.090 
so this is a typical mark move he's
owning<00:03:19.820> up<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.390> disowning<00:03:21.100> simultaneously

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
owning up and disowning simultaneously

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.330 
owning up and disowning simultaneously
to<00:03:23.440> what's<00:03:24.440> going<00:03:24.530> on<00:03:24.770> in<00:03:24.830> these<00:03:25.040> paintings

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
to what's going on in these paintings

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.360 
to what's going on in these paintings
but<00:03:25.610> I<00:03:25.670> wanted<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.150> get<00:03:26.300> back<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.810> this<00:03:27.370> quasi

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
but I wanted to get back to this quasi

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.240 
but I wanted to get back to this quasi
admission<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.470> talk<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.500> little<00:03:30.770> bit<00:03:31.010> about

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
something that had a special utility to

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.940

so the idea that you know and the
sociology<00:04:21.020> of<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.290> never<00:04:21.620> really<00:04:21.830> interested

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
sociology of it never really interested

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.470 
sociology of it never really interested
me<00:04:22.400> I<00:04:22.520> mean<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.820> was<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.360> know<00:04:23.390> just

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
consciously anyway I mean it seems to me

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.510 
consciously anyway I mean it seems to me
that<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:27.370> was<00:04:28.370> making<00:04:28.850> paintings<00:04:29.800> about<00:04:30.800> stuff

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520

were paintings and you know that I was
making<00:04:38.210> things<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:39.080> revealed<00:04:39.710> in<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.040> era

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
making things that revealed in the era

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.040 
making things that revealed in the era
or<00:04:40.700> would<00:04:41.000> be<00:04:41.030> interesting<00:04:41.600> I<00:04:41.660> mean<00:04:41.840> all<00:04:42.020> I

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050

is how crazy it fell to spend a year in
a<00:04:46.880> bedspread<00:04:47.240> so<00:04:47.530> they're<00:04:48.530> mostly<00:04:48.919> but<00:04:49.250> what's

is<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:52.130> pain<00:04:52.460> part<00:04:52.910> is<00:04:53.230> invisible<00:04:54.230> and<00:04:54.820> they

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
is the pain part is invisible and they

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.260 
is the pain part is invisible and they
look<00:04:56.060> perhaps<00:04:56.660> not<00:04:57.020> exactly<00:04:57.500> effortless<00:04:58.270> but

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
look perhaps not exactly effortless but

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.250 
look perhaps not exactly effortless but
but<00:04:59.840> they<00:05:00.080> were<00:05:01.450> things<00:05:02.450> that<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.690> was<00:05:02.870> very

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
but they were things that I was very
