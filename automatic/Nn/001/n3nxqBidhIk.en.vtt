animations

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.540 

also<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.340> get<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.550> idea<00:01:41.580> there<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:43.370> you<00:01:44.370> can

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
also you get the idea there and you can

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.340 
also you get the idea there and you can
use<00:01:44.790> an<00:01:45.660> app<00:01:45.840> shortcut<00:01:46.350> or<00:01:47.810> if<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:49.080> device

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
use an app shortcut or if your device

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.870 
use an app shortcut or if your device
has<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:51.590> dedicated<00:01:52.590> search<00:01:53.190> button<00:01:54.030> which<00:01:54.270> this

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
has a dedicated search button which this

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.120 
has a dedicated search button which this
streak<00:01:56.880> 7<00:01:57.210> doesn't<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.710> you<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.860> long<00:01:59.100> press

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
streak 7 doesn't have you can long press

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:07.420 
streak 7 doesn't have you can long press
the<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:02.369> short<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.869> search<00:02:04.610> when

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
the the short the search when

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:16.190 
the the short the search when
and<00:02:07.970> turn<00:02:08.119> off<00:02:08.240> your<00:02:08.360> device<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.810> way<00:02:08.929> to

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.870 

you<00:02:17.200> can<00:02:17.350> also<00:02:17.760> put<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:20.310> put<00:02:21.310> shortcut<00:02:21.700> in

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
you can also put the put shortcut in

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:31.320 
you can also put the put shortcut in
your<00:02:22.120> notification<00:02:22.660> area<00:02:28.560> then<00:02:30.120> it'll<00:02:31.120> just

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
your notification area then it'll just

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.610 
your notification area then it'll just
be<00:02:31.510> at<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.930> top<00:02:32.200> there<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:35.230> only<00:02:35.380> thing<00:02:35.530> I

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
be at the top there the only thing I

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.010 
be at the top there the only thing I
notice<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.040> sometimes<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.850> doesn't

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:52.470 

show<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:41.080> your<00:02:41.740> chosen<00:02:42.580> animation

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.040 

so<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.050> wouldn't<00:02:53.319> use<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:54.030> shortcut<00:02:55.030> if<00:02:55.930> you

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
so I wouldn't use that shortcut if you

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.990 
so I wouldn't use that shortcut if you
want<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.319> see<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.530> animation

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.470 

it's<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.420> little<00:03:00.630> more<00:03:00.750> more<00:03:01.350> satisfying<00:03:02.480> so

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
it's a little more more satisfying so

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.750 
it's a little more more satisfying so
the<00:03:03.630> app<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.870> called<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.440> screen<00:03:05.220> off<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.610> lock

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the app is called a screen off and lock

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.390 
the app is called a screen off and lock
and<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.570> free<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.440> market<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:07.860> I

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
and it's free in the market and I

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.000 
and it's free in the market and I
believe<00:03:08.910> there's<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.180> donate<00:03:09.600> version<00:03:09.780> two<00:03:10.200> for

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
believe there's a donate version two for

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.200 
believe there's a donate version two for
a<00:03:11.280> dollar<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:13.100> that's<00:03:14.100> thanks<00:03:14.850> for<00:03:14.940> watching

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
a dollar and that's thanks for watching
