00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.440
 well found on our good channel 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.690
 Sunday to all of you guys I am 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.460
 areas that I bring to you today 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.430
 Sunday gameplay what comes out 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.410
 in fact, once every three years boys 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.970
 I was able to give thanks also 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.140
 with the help of the whole team 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.099
 a nuclear charge with c4 plus grenades 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.290
 blinding later you will understand why he has more 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.850
 blinding grenades anyway guys 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.050
 it is more or less the same technique 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.780
 that I had used up in the way to do 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 that of semtex I pulled ic4 around 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.039
 for the map he was playing 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.449
 you're against you're on Afghan domination 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.699
 they made an area where the enemies 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.340
 they sounded they came domain 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.289
 they have three options or they jump down 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.809
 towards the plane they go to the left they go to 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.789
 right where we were the king sparks park 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.930
 then the sniper proceeded, I pulled 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.390
 c4 and then while pulling a c4 I was doing 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.240
 12 kg has no chirco and thanks to the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.490
 bonus man army what kind allows you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.890
 to change the class back into 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.140
 what you want is enough that there was 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.509
 selection and then the spare replaced the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.670
 same with the loose rambling bonus then 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.100
 increase the damage from exclusives here 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.439
 I pulled tc 4 I was a certain team 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.900
 point in a blinding grenade does 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.509
 explode a barrel and I do 2 kg then 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.759
 I put more blinding grenade are 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.920
 girls there is the usual one that maybe says no 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.310
 no it's not just c4 so the boys for 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.850
 consistency let's put 4 more grenade 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.909
 dazzling 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.680
 as regards the charge instead 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.340
 nuclear power is considered one 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.110
 nuclear charge with the weapon you want 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.810
 the killers are considered from zero up to 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.020
 dyer and I used the grenade c4 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.840
 yes thrushes blinding so it is considered 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.630
 a nuclear charge because they are what 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.470
 done without killing with these two things then 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.940
 the tr support and the nuclear charge from 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.340
 always on the first charge 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.740
 nuclear are considered so and therefore 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.170
 don't joke in the comments 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.120
 new there said the last video I had 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.360
 made the friend the r's design with a 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.720
 since you are all mature and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.120
 however consistent with what they have 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.080
 said and with what you have always done 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.930
 in the past 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.730
 the video of the other guys in 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.890
 I congratulate you and I really was 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.550
 very happy not to see that i 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.890
 hourly comments certain his herd re e 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.320
 so this denotes that five ours 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.540
 subscribers are quite intelligent 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.670
 even when explaining something that 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.610
 however it is not 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.430
 all easy i used with certain point 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.580
 before taking the changed support 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.209
 in the class with army man putting 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.800
 the flexible to ask for one less 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.489
 to the nuclear charge even if I have 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.180
 wrong because pro minorities anyway 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.340
 increase them 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.300
 let's say the scope of your door does 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.770
 more damage 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.120
 so for a kill I should have 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.730
 leave of boredom but they are details 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.739
 so you guys didn't have the area 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.319
 made an absurd killing then start 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.350
 which makes it all faster guys I have it 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.819
 made in just 150 seconds 220 meters in 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.280
 this was the gameplay I liked 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.430
 the kick also the burst of the charge 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.060
 a nice 500 600 never decided the football me and 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.060
 boys 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.930
 you don't like ige tft killed
