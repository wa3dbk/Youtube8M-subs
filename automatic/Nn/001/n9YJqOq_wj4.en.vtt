taking corn and it was a very small
field<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:06.030> hard<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> maneuver<00:01:10.580> yeah

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
field so it's hard to maneuver yeah

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.380 
field so it's hard to maneuver yeah
then<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.799> had<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> feel<00:01:14.220> problem<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:17.390> other

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
then we had the feel problem but other

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.469 
then we had the feel problem but other
than<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
than that

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.179 
than that
should<00:01:21.020> work<00:01:21.229> okay<00:01:21.799> but<00:01:23.439> we<00:01:24.439> got<00:01:24.650> something

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
should work okay but we got something

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.899 
should work okay but we got something
