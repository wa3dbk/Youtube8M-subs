00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Today we have a private tour of 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:11.099
 auction today do not work 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.590
 no bidding happens but we 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.779
 We came to the company guys decided 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.439
 show cars please cars and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.769
 motorcycles also want to be sold here 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:29.939
 a lot of cars of different machines is huge 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.600
 choice but what we looked at me 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.780
 I like to tell you a little 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.829
 the advantage of such a purchase as we are now 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.070
 we arrived we arrived on a non-working day 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.170
 auction if we came on the day 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.809
 the jingle worked then the buyer has not 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.710
 more than ten seconds to last 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.280
 buys this car or not in the end for 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.350
 10 seconds you can buy such shit 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:07.970
 what then you can not do anything 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.970
 so buying a car should be done 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.630
 reasonable 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.390
 at auctions it is profitable to buy dealers then 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.520
 have they take not looking particularly at 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.840
 able because they do not know what they have 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.410
 have their workshops 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.600
 they buy as cheap as possible if 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.550
 something to forge repaired and 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.550
 then sell it all to the parking lot 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.750
 several times we were offered to come to 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.880
