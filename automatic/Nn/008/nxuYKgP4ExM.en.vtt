00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.619
 connoisseurs machine tools considering future turners 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.969
 and millers most training 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:31.089
 institutions these technologies 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.609
 hopelessly outdated and now industrial 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:34.850
 businesses need shots from the new 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.120
 generations of Sosnovoborsk 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.969
 automechanical college just for 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.010
 half a year made a breakthrough now scientists 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.260
 those looks like 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.720
 high-tech center in 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.770
 metalworking machinery 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.080
 opened in February 2012 it will allow 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.010
 transfer training to a new 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 level 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200
 and now graduates of Sosnovoborsk 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.890
 automechanical college waiting on 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.650
 such enterprises as information 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.960
 Academician Satellite Systems 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.960
 Sieve-Yenisei plywood factory 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.270
 red mud roots in siberian what 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.370
 construction company 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.500
 it is these industrial 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.489
 corporations supported 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.299
 initiative of the director of the technical school environment 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.320
 ecology and helped create centers in 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.810
 as a basic sector model and 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.409
 creation of the abyss of the technical center 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.320
 chaos 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.820
 each of the three training classes 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.020
 equipped with the latest 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.799
 technology 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.229
 so for example lab room 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.579
 one is equipped with stimulants 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:18.969
 the device was software 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:20.490
 providing an American firm 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399
 Husky computers with connected package 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.130
 for training and debugging managers 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.020
 programs it includes turning 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.409
 milling module which allows 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.530
 prepare 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.270
 control programs as well as in the first 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.929
 approximation to produce and debug 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.759
 finding and fixing technical errors 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.759
 evaluation of the antiquity of workers' conflicts 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.179
 bodies decree istomin crowd snap here 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.609
 students learn to organize 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:40.770
 direct technological 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.829
 process to solve production 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.010
 tasks 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.220
 the second labs are pushing even wider 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.970
 horizons in front of children 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.990
 is studying the technological process 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.930
 programming turning milling 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.190
 machining parts on modern machines 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.100
 PE systems from three manufacturers 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.510
 Siemens friends see them hunting si 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.010
 also in real time 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.790
 students can track and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.950
 control the processing 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.090
 parts using 3d simulation in 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.350
 laboratories are two 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.360
 desktop lathe winners turning 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.800
 managed directly from the workplace 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.639
 to students 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.399
 on this equipment the future operator 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.109
 machine tools with numeric not only masters 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.129
 programming system 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.989
 standard mode and modern system 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:15.430
 dialogue 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.550
 whom programming but 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.770
 has the ability to demonstrate 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.120
 practical skills as board 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.610
 machines are completely identical 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.479
 industrial 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:23.619
 section of machine tools with software 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:25.089
 ruling holy of holies 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:26.359
 Sosnovy Bor center 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:27.519
 machine building and metalworking 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.599
 it is here that students meet 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.849
 equipment on which they will 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.159
 work in the future 10 trade on this 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.679
 chamber winning center and overflowing 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:36.069

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.099
 numeric software 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.760
 the guys are serving their production 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.249
 opportunities acquire skills 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.400
 work besides on these tenders can 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.519
 perform production 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.439
 orders of enterprises of the region so in time 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.909
 work centers have already been made 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.569
 parts for engineering 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:53.289
 factories 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.079
 It should be noted that the center of Sosnovoborsk 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.759
 mechanical engineering and metalworking 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.790
 the only one in the region 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.980
 and time in the industrial sector 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.849
 Our country is acute 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.319
 lack of highly qualified 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.849
 professionals able to work on 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.040
 new generation equipment 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.829
 businesses have to spend 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.489
 time and money to retrain their 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.129
 employees and it is economically 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.349
 so unprofitable graduates 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.849
 Sosnovoborsk Automechanical 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.900
 technical school sure without work they are not 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.659
 will remain moreover they will have 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.220
 opportunity to choose but initially with 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.569
 choice of albums but because the price 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.000
 cars don't engage on the fountain when on 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.359
 the scene passed under the crown 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.589
 I thought that I could also be there 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:29.599
 left a lot actually turned out 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.829
 that the machines are absolutely all honesty visible 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.089
 really like 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:35.129
 further going to satellite systems 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.849
 limbs work out 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.979
 went under the pogroms that will not help 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.939
 get a good job where and in what 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.299
 deadlines because there is no everywhere 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.459
 but since the bands are interpreted 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.799
 blamed the bus from the factories 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.739
 because the product itself which by the words 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.749
 bone workers 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.549
 special stations are therefore out of work 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.499
 he won't leave me 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:00.619
 I am pleased to know that the goals are 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.849
 unusual what kind of miller flew to 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.809
 specialist juice 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:06.139
 now specialty technology 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.359
 engineering is trained 150 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:09.469
 students of Sosnovy Bor 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.029
 Automechanical College 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:12.769
 senya learns to work on modern 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:13.639
 machine tools with numerical software 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.969
 management besides project creation 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:16.519
 regional innovation 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.900
