00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.670
 hi friends from youtube good let's see 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.469
 what is the usb 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.500
 and what good is good health is the gic 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.450
 is this little gadget here and to be able 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.890
 use it we have to turn our 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.720
 terminal good first thing we're going to 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.160
 do then is to turn these three 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.009
 terminals because we 're going to try it on 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.120
 the three of us are going to turn off the one to 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.750
 one 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.750
 to turn off 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.430
 and to pay also we paid the three 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.790
 so that we can do the test in 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.190
 these three terminals 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.980
 that I know only works this gadget 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.930
 in samsung terminals does not work in 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.040
 other brands but well probably yes 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.810
 that works but the one that I have 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.090
 understood only works in terminals 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.930
 samsung well let's see what it's for 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.930
 and how it is used 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.630
 this device serves to force the 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.300
 boot in download mode ie if 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.980
 we have our terminal 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.840
 shone or semi bree created and we can not 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.490
 start it in download mode for example 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.010
 to load a rom through audouin 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.140
 or to load a new kernel through 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.120
 of hate is also to connect to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 our computer and be able to load a rom 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.740
 and be able to save it or simply be able to 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.900
 load a new version 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.119
 well then a way to force that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.440
 Boot in blog mode without need 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.390
 to make key combinations 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.560
 etcetera or in the case that we do not 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.810
 boot like I said because I was 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.619
 locked 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.740
 we connect this gadget and as you see 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.110
 automatically start in download mode 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.689
 this forces through hardware the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.479
 boot in download mode let's 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.670
 try it in this other terminal this 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.369
 would be the galaxy s3 and now we are going to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.740
 try it on the galaxy s2 as you can see 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.560
 just in a simple log mode 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.899
 when the terminal is off, we connect 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.990
 the usb gic and must enter automatically 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.929
 and in this last one also as you can 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.420
 see simply connecting the usb 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.640
 once we have already started it in 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.289
 download mode we can remove it 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.390
 it just has that function does not have 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.970
 other 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.310
 so good is one let's say a 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.410
 lifeguard for our samsung terminal 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.510
 in case it gets stuck 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.250
 this can be found on ebay by 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.510
 example what you can buy through 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.130
 ebay online stores and well I know 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.030
 I was a while ago for a price 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.290
 about four euros a thing like that 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.000
 I even think you behave too 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.770
 because this must be from China 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.260
 oil then the truth that is a 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.510
 very affordable price for a device that 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.250
 it really is so tiny but that we 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.630
 can save you from a big problem in case 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.760
 of brightness of our terminal 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.610
 it does not always work because if a 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.890
 terminal is completely broken 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.440
 of plate because obviously it is not going to 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.390
 start neither with this nor with anything would 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.140
 to replace the plate or take it to 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.100
 technical service but in case 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.440
 have a problem that we can not 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.960
 start it, it will save us from a 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.990
 big problem good friends well here 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:15.080
 I leave the explanation of how the 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.080
 usb jack and until the next video
