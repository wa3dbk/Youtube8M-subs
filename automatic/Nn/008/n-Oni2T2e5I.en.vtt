hello everyone Tecna line in here today
I'll<00:00:02.850> be<00:00:02.879> showing<00:00:03.179> you<00:00:03.419> how<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.600> reduce<00:00:03.929> the

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
I'll be showing you how to reduce the

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.070 
I'll be showing you how to reduce the
vibration<00:00:04.980> on<00:00:05.130> your<00:00:05.460> GoPro<00:00:05.910> Hero<00:00:06.480> 3<00:00:06.600> plus

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
vibration on your GoPro Hero 3 plus

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:20.330 
vibration on your GoPro Hero 3 plus
camera<00:00:17.840> so<00:00:18.840> step<00:00:19.140> one<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.680> reducing<00:00:20.250> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
camera so step one of reducing the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.670 
camera so step one of reducing the
vibration<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:21.119> your<00:00:21.300> GoPro<00:00:21.510> Hero<00:00:22.170> 3<00:00:22.199> plus

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
vibration on your GoPro Hero 3 plus

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.769 
vibration on your GoPro Hero 3 plus
camera<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.880> use<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.240> short<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.689> not

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
camera is to use this short it's not

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.710 
camera is to use this short it's not
possible<00:00:25.439> whilst<00:00:25.859> recording<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.689> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
possible whilst recording so this is a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.200 
possible whilst recording so this is a
prime<00:00:28.019> example<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.680> using<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.039> along<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
prime example of using it along and I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.549 
prime example of using it along and I
think<00:00:31.070> of<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.600> if<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.809> put<00:00:33.989> your<00:00:34.110> GoPro

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
think of it if you put your GoPro

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.709 
think of it if you put your GoPro
directly<00:00:35.130> onto<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.610> you'll<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> lot<00:00:36.570> of

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
directly onto here you'll see a lot of

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.869 
directly onto here you'll see a lot of
vibration<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.350> your<00:00:37.500> videos<00:00:37.920> that's<00:00:38.640> one

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
vibration in your videos that's one

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.000 
vibration in your videos that's one
major<00:00:39.059> downside<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.809> using<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.290> long<00:00:40.500> gooseneck

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
major downside of using a long gooseneck

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.520 
major downside of using a long gooseneck
or<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.730> fact<00:00:41.940> even<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.390> small<00:00:42.719> amounts<00:00:43.079> you'd

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
or in fact even the small amounts you'd

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.950 
or in fact even the small amounts you'd
want<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> use<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> small<00:00:44.539> small<00:00:45.539> mount<00:00:45.809> as

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
want to use a small small mount as

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.380 
want to use a small small mount as
possible<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.950> reduce<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.399> vibration<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
possible to reduce that vibration get it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.479 
possible to reduce that vibration get it
as<00:00:48.480> close<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.050> mount<00:00:49.260> as<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.829> now

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
as close to the mount as you can now

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.100 
as close to the mount as you can now
will<00:00:50.700> overall<00:00:51.239> help<00:00:51.539> reduce<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> vibration

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
will overall help reduce the vibration

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.170 
will overall help reduce the vibration
give<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.680> clearer<00:00:52.980> shots<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.940> want<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
give you clearer shots and I want a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.310 
give you clearer shots and I want a
nicer<00:00:54.390> footage<00:00:55.670> at<00:00:56.670> step<00:00:57.000> two<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.840> use<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
nicer footage at step two it's use the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.709 
nicer footage at step two it's use the
locking<00:00:58.559> plug<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.430> GoPro<00:00:59.670> Hero<00:01:00.210> 3<00:01:00.420> plus

camera so it should have come in the box
many<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.329> wonder<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.989> white

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
many of you or wonder what that white

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.160 
many of you or wonder what that white
plug<00:01:04.500> was<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.729> put<00:01:05.939> when<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.450> when<00:01:07.049> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
plug was it is to put when you when you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.260 
plug was it is to put when you when you
attach<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.650> mount<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.760> put<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.150> in

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
attach your mount you can just put it in

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.880 
attach your mount you can just put it in
the<00:01:09.450> back<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.380> will<00:01:10.530> reduce<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the back here and that will reduce the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.550 
the back here and that will reduce the
vibration<00:01:11.159> coming<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:12.150> your<00:01:12.780> mount<00:01:13.110> into

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
vibration coming from your mount into

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.710 
vibration coming from your mount into
your<00:01:13.680> GoPro<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.610> will<00:01:14.760> reduce<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.240> overall

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
your GoPro that will reduce that overall

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.390 
your GoPro that will reduce that overall
and<00:01:15.960> overall<00:01:16.350> give<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> nice<00:01:16.890> steady<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and overall give you a nice steady a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.280 
and overall give you a nice steady a
shop<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.479> what<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.810> are<00:01:18.930> hoping<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
shop that is what we are hoping to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.120 
shop that is what we are hoping to
achieve<00:01:19.439> by<00:01:19.680> reducing<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> vibration<00:01:22.130> step

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
achieve by reducing the vibration step

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.010 
achieve by reducing the vibration step
three<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.640> lean<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.210> GoPro<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
three is to lean your GoPro on to a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.170 
three is to lean your GoPro on to a
steady<00:01:25.380> object<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.610> example<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.060> you're

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
steady object for example if you're

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.399 
steady object for example if you're
shooting<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> video<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> car<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.350> example

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
shooting a video in the car for example

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.130 
shooting a video in the car for example
and<00:01:28.950> you've<00:01:29.610> got<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> suction<00:01:30.210> cup<00:01:30.540> mount<00:01:30.780> you

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
and you've got a suction cup mount you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.440 
and you've got a suction cup mount you
want<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.409> lean<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.040> something<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.909> has

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
want to lean it to something that is has

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.830 
want to lean it to something that is has
not<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.200> much<00:01:34.500> vibration<00:01:35.189> as<00:01:35.479> your<00:01:36.479> suction

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
not as much vibration as your suction

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.569 
not as much vibration as your suction
cup<00:01:37.170> mount<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.560> for<00:01:37.740> example<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> windscreen

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579

fellini ago programs the windscreen that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.190 
fellini ago programs the windscreen that
will<00:01:41.369> overall<00:01:42.090> help<00:01:42.390> reduce<00:01:42.780> some<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
will overall help reduce some of the
