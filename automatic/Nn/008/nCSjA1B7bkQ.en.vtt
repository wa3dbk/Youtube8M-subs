00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:11.000
 Today is Anthony I am really sorry for the up 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.900
 I 'm taking 50 mm worth now, but according to this 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.440
 I wanted to go through a little while to see what kind of background the background would blur 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:27.170
 Today I arrived luggage from Panasonic's that we have taken in this kind of form 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:29.840
 It is this but overwintering sale of panasonic lumix gh 4 release commemoration 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:38.630
 I was doing the Tteyuu campaign 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:41.430
 In a spare battery if apply for up to g Times selfish Do not the end of the month until the time the end of June and sd 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.060
 I will get a card 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.060
 We try received by 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:54.240
 Endure a box with a simple greeting card and lumix gh purchase commemoration benefits 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.990
 It's red. 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.590
 This is a battery yeah 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.770
 That this is where I thought Do not want the battery to be honest spare in It is of battery Monet 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.020
 There is not yet 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.010
 The gh 4 has a pretty good battery so I have never felt it necessary 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.510
 But 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.650
 I would be glad if I had it, but if I bought this normally, it would cost around 6000 yen, so one more 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.170
 Though it is kore 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.140
 Class 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:41.250
 It is an sd card that supports 10 uhs class 3 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.330
 It is written that 4 types of animation support. This is 90 people read but 45 eyes write 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.970
 Though 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.159
 I can not get a bit rate of 200 mega bits of gh 4 I just do not know it 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.509
 is 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.990
 However, if you buy this too, I am thankful that it is a tall guy that costs around 5000 yen . 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.509
 Ne 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.509
 I've ever been this Shanghai wholesaler 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.710
 This is the cheapest you can afford 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.030
 32 even though I was using giga memory card of 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:13.410
 I can not get that 200 people with this 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:19.250
 I can get up to 100 people, but I want to get a bit rate quickly. 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.250
 I thought the way 32 When you put a giga memory card of 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:31.500
 42 minutes with 4 types of 100 mega 30 p 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.250
 Only of it takes only 21 minutes in the full high-definition of all-intra 100 mega 60 p 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.570
 not 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.290
 1 hour 24 minutes with full high definition 50 mega 60 p 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:45.510
 I can get it, so I can't wait 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:50.909
 Honestly, memory cards will certainly go faster than batteries 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.200
 After all it is not enough with 32 giga, but it is a place that I would like you to bloom about 64 giga 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:58.290
 is not it 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:04.739
 Because it is equivalent to 11,000 yen with this memory card and battery, we buy immediately after release 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.530
 The body of gh 4 is already now because it is feeling that it is equivalent to discount equivalent to 10,000 yen . 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.020
 is not it 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:13.960
 Because it is less than 140,000 yen 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.950
 Well honestly, I think it would be better to buy now if you waited until this time 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.300
 But 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:24.700
 After all, it is because I do not regret even buying early 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:26.260
 Of course, I want to buy cheap as long as anyone can even think Toka to buy from the little drops 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.409
 I think 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:35.140
 But after all the say the camera, unlike other of the pressurized heat transfer world goods still at that time the camera 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:41.630
 I think that are Tsu those that only take 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:46.280
 The other day I gave a video of my daughter, but it was a video I made with just that kind of material 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:50.030
 Well I 'm honest but I'm satisfied 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.710
 I think it's a well done video but everyone 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:58.840
 I because I do not take it had not been for those gh 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.920
 Because I think that another video camera would not be the image up to that point 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.720
 After all 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:10.090
 I felt that it was an ant to buy a camera early 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:15.310
 In that gh 4 sale commemorative campaign get memory card and battery 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:20.139
 Since not a little interesting in was the story than just it just say that was better 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:25.980
 I think I would like to give notice of a video to be released for a while next time 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:30.360
 It is a video to be uploaded next It is a live video of Japanese drum 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.760
 Oh, this is another half month taken about a month ago 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.400
 It took a while to edit 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.030
 I have n't done a lot of editing, but I took about 2 hours in total 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.680
 From 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.810
 I thought it was going to put together in 6 minutes, so after all it's quite time to decide which part to use 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.680
 To choose I is take you 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.700
 Then in this video vfr 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:59.940
 I also use a function called variable frame rate 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:03.870
 That this is slow motion can be taken with this camera alone a feature that is in the gh 4 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.800
 Such a though it's very interesting features 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.470
 Slow taken with variable frame rate 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.590
 While intermingling motion picture in the compilation 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.700
 I'm doing 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:18.060
 Just have to shake very well hand the sorry one point 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:22.620
 In fact, much less there is a reason 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.930
 I thought it would not be possible to use a tripod as it was a live show by the audience 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.840
 It is once have this monopod 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.150
 so 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.300
 Among the Well crowd 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:39.759
 Than Nikki wade through the crowd 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:41.379
 This monopod stretched it eyes full is with stomach doing this by attaching a gh 4 on this 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:44.500
 I took it with support 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:48.610
 This is probably from this high place 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:53.180
 Because it is a place higher than 50 centimeters from my head 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:57.289
 I have taken from a height of about 30 centimeters to the meter 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.220
 Since the results in the camera shake to truly and take in this 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.880
 Oh dear 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:06.890
 It is a story that I took it that way 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:13.460
 In addition But it monopod previous to this mess Tsukai but has also reviewed this child class 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:15.410
 It is cheap is light at the carbon to Well earlier when it is good it is very sense of stability 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.240
 Please also watch the video 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.720
 There is a Anthony of camera chat directly below 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.720
 So hard 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.100
 wh 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.320
 wh 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.940
 me 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:35.940
