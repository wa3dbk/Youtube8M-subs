freedom I think just when they're in
their<00:00:45.210> snaffle<00:00:45.600> bridles<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.110> some<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> them

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
times I mean we've obviously all we rode

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.590 
times I mean we've obviously all we rode
on<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> team<00:01:22.979> together<00:01:23.159> last<00:01:23.490> year<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
on a team together last year it's the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.570 
on a team together last year it's the
same<00:01:24.720> same<00:01:25.680> team<00:01:25.920> from<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> European

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
same same team from the European

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.770 
same same team from the European
Championships<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> only<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.630> only

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
Championships the only the only

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.630 
Championships the only the only
difference<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.170> my<00:01:28.350> horse<00:01:28.680> which<00:01:28.890> has<00:01:29.130> been

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
difference is my horse which has been

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.969 
difference is my horse which has been
swapped<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:30.119> utopia<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> nip<00:01:31.140> tuck<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
swapped from utopia to nip tuck so

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.740 
swapped from utopia to nip tuck so
really<00:01:32.490> i<00:01:32.640> think<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.299> hold<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
really i think if we can just hold the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.330 
really i think if we can just hold the
form<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.200> did<00:01:34.380> last<00:01:34.530> year<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.250> know
