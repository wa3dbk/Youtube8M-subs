00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.500
survive.. And tonight...

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.130
One man is sharing his

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.730
painful fishing tale ...

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.300
KITV4's Lara Yamada has

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.540
the story ... of one,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.970
lucky, fisherman.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.810
20-25 38-40 quick

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.510
A LEISURLY HAWAII FISHING

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.550
TRIP GONE TERRIBLY WRONG.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.110
BRAD WARREN IS RECOVERING

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.210
AT WILCOX HOSPITAL ON

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.850
KAUAI. AFTER A ROUGE WAVE

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.920
CAPSIZED THE BOAT HE AND

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.550
TWO OTHERS WERE ABOARD

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.820
SUNDAY NIGHT OFF NIIHAU.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.890
A POWERFUL WAVE SENDING

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.460
WARREN FLYING, SHATTERING

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.060
HIS LEG IN 3 PLACES,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.620
BREAKING HIS HIP, THEN

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.360
SUBMURGING HIM UNDER

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.960
WATER. I tilted my head

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.660
back to get another last

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.600
gulp of air and a swell

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.170
pushed the vote I took a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.470
big gulp of water and

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.140
started going down it was

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.940
scary. THE CAPTAIN OF THE

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.540
BOAT AND HIS 10 YEAR OLD

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.640
SON WERE SLEEPING IN THE

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.170
BOW OF THE VESSEL AS THE

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.880
BOAT QUICKLY BEGAN

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.510
FILLING WITH WATER. My

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.750
first thought was to grab

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.350
Noah, you know make sure

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.580
I had a hold of him. THE

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.150
MEN CLAMMORING TO THE TOP

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.920
OF THE VESSEL BUT THE

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.550
RELENTLESS WAVES

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.820
CONTINUALLY KNOCKING HIM

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.420
OFF THE BOAT AND BACK

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.690
INTO THE OCEAN. AFTER 4

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.290
HOURS WITH NO HOPE IN

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.520
SIGHT, 10 YEAR OLD NOAH

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.060
HEARD SOMETHING IN THE

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.030
DISTANCE: A PARTY ON

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.660
SHORE PLAYING AN

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.470
INSPIRATIONAL 1981 HIT: I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.070
saw that shooting star

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.530
and I heard the Journey

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.070
song "don't stop

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.670
believing" that was the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.240
lord saying you will be

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.870
fine. THE PAIN GROWING

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.010
TOO TOUGH TO BARE, THE

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.610
THREE HELD ON TO EACH

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.380
OTHER. He was convinced

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.980
the pain was so bad, he

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.750
just wanted to swim in.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.380
WARREN WITH NO USE OF HIS

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.920
RIGHT SIDE, SWIMMING FROM

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.550
THE BOAT FOR 1/2 AN HOUR

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.960
TO DRY LAND. We just felt

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.590
so relieved. WARREN NOW

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.960
SO GREATFUL FOR THE LIFE

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.560
HE THOUGHT HE ALMOST

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.430
LOST. I wanted to make

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.000
sure I made it for my

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.870
wife and my daughters.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.370
The Garden Island

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.900
Newspaper reports -

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.470
Romanak went back to

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.470
"Kikiaoloa Small Boar

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.070
Harbor" in Kekaha last

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.940
night... and found his

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.210
boat had WASHED ASHORE!

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.810
He says he's glad

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.310
everyone's OK -- and is

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.080
considering getting a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.380
BIGGER, SAFER boat.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.880
Time for today's morning

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.290
