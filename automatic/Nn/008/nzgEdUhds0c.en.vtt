00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.240
 or the one that pete is I've come to the 

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:07.400
 panasonic kitchen to see was his 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.050
 last experiment a kitchen of 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.240
 induction and you will say but good 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.580
 what you have again if there are mountains 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.440
 of induction cookers because in this one 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.210
 you do not have a certain area 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.339
 magnetic that you cook but that is you 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.499
 see what you choose the area is this 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:25.779
 all this blue area is where you can 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.779
 place the pot pans 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.400
 and what the induction cooker does is 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.130
 that recognizes the pan and marks the area 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.550
 in which you're going to cook we have another 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.070
 we put the pan and as you see marta 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.950
 also the blue one can be cooked with 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.340
 four pots at the same time what 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.020
 you move and you recognize it 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.690
 We have two ways of cooking 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.880
 food for example this frying pan the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.140
 recognizes and in this panel here it appears 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.950
 a square that is the corresponding 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.040
 to her 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.290
 and we have this part that is with a 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.460
 scale at which we can choose the 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:09.210
 power for example we leave it in 7 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.530
 we also have temperature 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.090
 we choose 230 degrees as one of the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.830
 good things that it has is that it has 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.240
 memory is to say that the temperature that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.240
 we have put for example this frying pan 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.900
 is saved and although we move it in 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.509
 another side and bone is still maintained 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.310
 but how does this get the kitchens of 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.530
 normal invention what they have only 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.690
 so big coils where you have to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.770
 put the pileup yes or yes in this case 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.640
 what we have are small coils 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.310
 electromagnetic and also have 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.100
 sensors so they know perfectly 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.660
 where we have placed the pileup and are 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.280
 able to work unique and 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.009
 exclusively in the area in which 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.280
 they detect our art in the pot with 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.990
 tacos but other things like that good ya 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.850
 you know that induction does not only serve 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.740
 to heat food but also 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.690
 it serves to recharge certain gases 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.789
 if you already know any of the brands that 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.009
 you put the pot logar gaitÃ¡n that is 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.130
 the induction also serves to pass 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.569
 electricity and this also so that it does not 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.400
 it can serve, for example, for 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.989
 our kitchen appliances like 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.850
 for example with this fantastic blender 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.810
 full of pellets 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.810
 and we put it 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.879
 and it starts to beat plus you recognize you have 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.150
 the blender and lights the little light 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.069
 correspondent 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.299
 but let's try another one of the 30 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.269
 we have at home by 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.960
 example a juicer we place here 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:39.600
 over 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.600
 we take this plastic lemon 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.930
 and it works and we can write and everything 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.670
 this without any cable you by 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.590
 example are of tests are individual 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.600
 but of course we could also 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.580
 put our juicer or blender 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.710
 directly in the kitchen that I have 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.690
 taught before where we are cooked 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.240
 the pots and who knows if our 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.160
 mobile is also induction we can 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.540
 Put the phone in the kitchen and leave it 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.819
 loading 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.819
 Well, I do not know if it's a very good idea
