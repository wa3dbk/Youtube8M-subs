00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
next piece of advice is something that

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.240 
next piece of advice is something that
goes<00:01:39.659> hand<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.140> hand<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.500> gathering<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
goes hand in hand with gathering and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
goes hand in hand with gathering and
light<00:01:41.610> gathering<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.299> find<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.869> very

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
light gathering I find it to be very

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.710 
light gathering I find it to be very
simple<00:01:43.560> however<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.700> lot<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.180> people<00:01:45.570> including

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
simple however a lot of people including

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.690 
simple however a lot of people including
most<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.470> my<00:01:46.619> guildmates<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.280> haven't<00:01:47.579> been

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
most of my guildmates I haven't been

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.880 
most of my guildmates I haven't been
doing<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.479> some<00:01:48.659> reason<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:49.530> piece<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
doing this for some reason this piece of

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.069 
doing this for some reason this piece of
advice<00:01:50.159> very<00:01:50.460> clearly<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.390> go<00:01:51.659> ahead<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
advice very clearly is to go ahead and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.899 
advice very clearly is to go ahead and
sell<00:01:52.470> your<00:01:52.710> stuff<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.399> trading<00:01:53.880> post

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
sell your stuff on the trading post

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.719 
sell your stuff on the trading post
instead<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.899> two<00:01:55.079> merchants<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.159> reason<00:01:56.549> for

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
instead of two merchants the reason for

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.639 
instead of two merchants the reason for
this<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.060> because<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.420> lot<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> time<00:01:58.110> even

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
this is because a lot of the time even

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.770 
this is because a lot of the time even
in<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.890> beta<00:01:59.130> you're<00:01:59.700> going<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.149> find<00:02:00.360> people

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
in a beta you're going to find people

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.649 
in a beta you're going to find people
who<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.409> use<00:02:01.439> your<00:02:01.829> product<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.909> what

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
who want to use your product so what

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.300 
who want to use your product so what
this<00:02:03.810> means<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.439> they're<00:02:04.799> going<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> be

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
this means is that they're going to be

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.340 
this means is that they're going to be
paying<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.790> lot<00:02:06.090> more<00:02:06.119> than<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.750> merchants<00:02:07.229> are

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
paying a lot more than the merchants are

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.490 
paying a lot more than the merchants are
it<00:02:07.770> may<00:02:08.099> not<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.310> big<00:02:08.849> increases<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.869> gold<00:02:10.140> but

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it may not be big increases in gold but

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.830 
it may not be big increases in gold but
a<00:02:10.649> lot<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:10.979> small<00:02:11.610> increases<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.480> going<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
a lot of small increases are going to

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.550 
a lot of small increases are going to
add<00:02:13.020> up<00:02:13.050> over

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
add up over

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.220 
add up over
time<00:02:13.770> also<00:02:14.400> similar<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.569> gathering<00:02:16.050> it

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
time also similar to gathering it

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.050 
time also similar to gathering it
doesn't<00:02:16.620> take<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.800> lot<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.190> your<00:02:17.430> time<00:02:17.760> to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
doesn't take a lot of your time to

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.790 
doesn't take a lot of your time to
actually<00:02:18.209> sell<00:02:18.750> things<00:02:18.989> on<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.410> trading<00:02:19.680> post

as many of you probably know you can
actually<00:02:22.470> access<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.280> from<00:02:23.310> anywhere<00:02:23.760> but

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
actually access it from anywhere but

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
that as you're out in gathering you can

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.800 
that as you're out in gathering you can
just<00:02:32.370> sort<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.580> post<00:02:32.849> stuff<00:02:33.090> whenever<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.630> get

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
your part so to me it seems like

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.970 
your part so to me it seems like
something<00:02:41.819> that<00:02:41.970> everybody<00:02:42.450> should<00:02:42.540> do<00:02:42.980> my

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
something that everybody should do my

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.500 
something that everybody should do my
next<00:02:44.310> piece<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.610> advice<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:44.910> actually

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
next piece of advice is actually

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.509 
next piece of advice is actually
something<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.900> I've<00:02:46.170> yet<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.530> do<00:02:46.830> myself<00:02:47.040> but

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
something that I've yet to do myself but

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.759 
something that I've yet to do myself but
I<00:02:47.640> think<00:02:47.940> will<00:02:48.060> be<00:02:48.180> fairly<00:02:48.569> necessary<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.620> do

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
I think will be fairly necessary to do

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.250 
I think will be fairly necessary to do
upon<00:02:50.130> release<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.819> this<00:02:51.330> is<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.690> go<00:02:51.870> ahead<00:02:52.019> and

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260

buy XP boosts some of you may know this
