00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.970
 good morning, the work that I will present 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.130
 The purpose of the continuation is to support 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.360
 learning concepts 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.150
 endemic species in mexico 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.740
 endemism is a term used in 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.259
 biology to indicate that the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.110
 distribution of a taxon is limited to 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.419
 a geographical area determined by 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.060
 it when it is indicated that a species is 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.099
 endemic region appointment means that 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.399
 it is only possible to find it in that place 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.950
 naturally the same can 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.370
 be considered within a wide range 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.739
 of geographical scales so an organism 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.700
 may be endemic to a mountain top 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:47.060
 or a lake and a mountain range or a 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.329
 fluvial system of an island of a country or 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.760
 even from a continent in this sense 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.220
 according to the conabio mexico it 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.880
 distinguished by its large number of these 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.790
 species 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.640
 next we will show some 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.660
 examples of endemic plants and animals 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.660
 from our country 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.520
 rosemary lakes and well-known as 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.150
 teporingo rabbit from osaka volcanoes 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.700
 touche is a species of mammal 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.940
 lagomorph of the family him by idae the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.490
 unique of the typical rosemary monkey 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.570
 lakes was widely distributed in the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.720
 volcanic zone 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.060
 Adj with ixtla popo currently is 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.960
 considered in danger of extinction by 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.979
 the decrease of its habitat 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.830
 canis lupus dancing the Mexican wolf is 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.770
 a subspecies genetically different to 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.670
 what is present in North America is also 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.400
 one of the smallest subspecies 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.550
 reach a length no greater than 135 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.960
 centimeters and a maximum height of 80 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.070
 centimeters approximately lived 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.430
 widely in the eastern mother saw 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.790

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.880
 Extension phocoena sinus la vaquita 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.910
 marine or cochito is a kind of 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.220
 cetacean odontoceto family or 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.460
 community 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.340
 one of the six species of porpoise in 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.430
 total of 150 specimens of vaquita 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.410
 marina in mexico to avoid its 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.900
 extinction has implemented measures 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:34.180
 of conservation have seen more Mexican 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.470
 known as Nawatl Axolotl alone 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:42.130
 of amphibious aquatic mokro caudate is 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.130
 say amphibian with tail belongs to the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.860
 family have been stuck or 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.440
 endemic amphibians that come from the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.150
 ancient lake of the valley of mexico 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.850
 currently in serious danger of 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.450
 extinction by the dramatic reduction in 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.450
 its habitat 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.090
 were I to you 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.569
 pannullo is a deciduous shrub of

 form candelerÃ­a form that grows on 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.720
 the rocky substratum of San pedregal 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:16.540
 angel gets to measure about 2.5 meters 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.860
 height has alternate leaves and flowers 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.079
 yellows in clusters that appear 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:27.239
 during the driest time of the year it is 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.239
 its common name of the suit 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.420
 as we have seen the endemic species 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.780
 of Mexico constitute a wealth 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.480
 invaluable to be protected and 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.960
 presented based on criteria 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:47.520
 scientists , which would allow 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.520
 425 species in extinction period 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.670
 255 of which are endemic are not 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.980
 add to the extinct 49, including the 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.980
 emblematic Mexican wolf
