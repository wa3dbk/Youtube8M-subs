00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 Hi, people, football, is making a video today. 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.730
 very close five years ago and today I 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.740
 make a video showing you taught right 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.960
 It's like I make a nose contour for 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.759
 make the nose thinner more contoured 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.839
 for that impression that we made 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.210
 a surgery 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.859
 only that I will not use produtinhos I 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.350
 I'm always using my videos here 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.850
 which are super cheap product I will use 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.070
 some brushes too but if you do not 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.680
 have at home you can replace up 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.109
 power of the net harbor something you 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.600
 that part may be formed that part of the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.309
 sides are in the area and that's what I hope 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.370
 that you like structurally as 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.100
 This is fine if you want to leave a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.290
 suggestion of video or techniques of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.329
 Makeup super novelty that you 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.070
 Wanna see what I do? 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.590
 just leave it here in the comments here in 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.149
 low the value to do is and there we go 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.170
 I am to teach you how 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:59.070
 let me teach you what I'm going to use 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.649
 I'll use a paintbrush so give it to me. 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.129
 Contour even though he is well flax he is 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.110
 very soft and you get enough 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.390
 precision with it because it is so hard 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.580
 So you can score a lot in the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.710
 time you go is to apply the product 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.479
 so I 'm going to leave not back the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.240
 Like other police officers who 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.280
 I already tested it and it is very good because 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.380
 it has and if this format so in 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.720
 donington little in this new leave 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.060
 pack and I'll wear this brown shadow 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.070
 that I always use to circumvent the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.930
 Eyebrow eyes I'm going to use it too. 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.850
 I was in your house, but you use a 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.100
 brown shadow any you have of 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.780
 Any brand is fine, then. 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.210
 I'll get a little bit like this in the brush. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.790
 take off the excess and then I'll come 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.350
 skirting two stripes like this. 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.619
 naraísa 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:59.369
 I leave here under the eyebrow and 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:02.159
 I've been taking a risk with my nose. 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.880
 the bigger part of him that I want 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.000
 This is the end of this 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.560
 part of here I come with a little more 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.970
 of product 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:22.569
 and reinforce a little more here 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:26.720
 I come here almost drawing O 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:31.520
 this part of the nose you go as if 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:35.959
 had two stripes on this one 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.200
 outline look very straight 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:46.850
 leaves this line exactly 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:49.069
 I think it's good that you're fine. 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.100
 also go around this part under the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.110
 nose which will give the impression that your 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.069
 nose is steeper 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:02.840
 you only deposit the same product as 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:05.780
 then we come there is a next step 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.580
 will be using a paintbrush says to smoke and if 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.170
 from the apothecary, he is also from the 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.519
 same line with initial price of 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.130
 contour 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.829
 he is very cute and you can use 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.290
 For several things, that's it. 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:23.299
 blurring this part of what people 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.100
 I walked around without any product, there you are. 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.769
 comes around behind the 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:34.820
 eyebrow to remove this mark that 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.030
 we deposited the product in another 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.030
 side 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:53.349
 You give that fake smile 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:55.200
 that little smile just for you 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.519
 one World 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.680
 this part of the nose 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.780
 and not to let this effect much 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.489
 very brownish gray 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.719
 I come with a shadow more or less 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.109
 red 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:11.709
 I will use this outline is here 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.530
 almost finished having the tomás 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.939
 brownish that is the tone of my skin 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.019
 tan will use the tan 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.030
 thing like that 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.959
 And then I've been applying some 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.639
 product 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:29.710
 I hit it, I'm just passing over that 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.750
 contour that will leave one more 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.770
 tan 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:43.860
 There you are now the part of the illuminator 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.860
 I'm going to use a pampered people base 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.050
 on that basis the same base that today you 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.280
 You can use any 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.020
 thing you have to be able to light 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.599
 pinch this nose 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.710
 so what I'm going to do a little bit of 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:05.409
 product on my finger falls I'm passing 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.370
 as if it were a line in the center of the 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.930
 nice 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.530
 So I come here from the middle of 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.530

 until there underneath and aquino dot the odom 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:23.039
 Such a prank, like smoking tomorrow. 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:39.080
 there to leave a more natural air 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:45.099

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:47.930
