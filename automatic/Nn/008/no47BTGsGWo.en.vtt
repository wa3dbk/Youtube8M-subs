00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
and not being very quick so what it does

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.610 
and not being very quick so what it does
is<00:03:54.140> just<00:03:54.350> a<00:03:54.470> Raticate<00:03:54.980> trap<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.810> blinding<00:03:57.410> you

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
is just a Raticate trap and blinding you

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.330 
is just a Raticate trap and blinding you
just<00:03:57.830> flow<00:03:58.370> around<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.820> circuit<00:04:00.340> it's

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
just flow around the circuit it's

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.770 
just flow around the circuit it's
exciting

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
exciting

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.400

but<00:04:03.350> it<00:04:03.470> doesn't<00:04:03.770> feel<00:04:03.890> threatening<00:04:05.200> it<00:04:06.200> just

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
but it doesn't feel threatening it just

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.870 
but it doesn't feel threatening it just
feels<00:04:06.620> glorious<00:04:08.709> absolutely<00:04:09.709> chuffing<00:04:10.670> and
