 hi friends welcome for a 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.080
 new video 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.420
 but this time a little different in 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.330
 effect it's a little out of series and yes 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.360
 this is a video of far cry 3 game 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.670
 developed by ubisoft appeared a little 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.240
 close in December I am too 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.119
 keep 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.250
 it was a fps stylus game and where he 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.590
 must shoot everywhere without stopping us this 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.660
 do not stop farting like these 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.660
 see pop where it goes 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.469
 the explosion of noise and if I have you 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.320
 brought to this little paradise on earth 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.730
 we can say with a lush jungle 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.200
 look at this landscape a little 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.329
 beautiful and a beautiful sunset 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.680
 where were the challenges? 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.480
 well if you bring it to make a 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.579
 small mission a mission that I you 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.920
 noted a hunting mission where it takes 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:59.360
 to hunt the shark the shark is there there 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.360
 there it will bleed the tripoter 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.380
 but otherwise I'll make you a little 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.370
 presentation of the game very light this mr 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.229
 what is this game but 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.140
 what is this weird game 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.229
 you have to take a bow to kill 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.150
 shark and this is a game 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.979
 of adventure you play jason brody 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.800
 it's me see you here with our 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.070
 marks and I had left quietly 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.110
 to have a little vacation with my friends 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:34.880
 and my two cantona cant deciding brothers 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.160
 side of the nile in asia well I made the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.780
 parachute jump 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.860
 unfortunately down on this little 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.539
 island what was waiting for me 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.140
 boats only a real nest of 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.700
 pirates 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:51.850
 which was not very nice and 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.830
 and yes and so they stopped my fiancee 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.619
 of bÃ©co potes dresses you but what is 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.600
 what they did they no longer have a name 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.700
 and what makes me there I find myself 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.619
 there one to put me tasks operation 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.020
 left arm to get as bows 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.310
 attract the flashes removes for 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.060
 improve the arrows in the air for 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.060
 still falls on them 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.870
 they do not want all that for what for 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.120
 go hunting for the shark % what life 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.360
 rotten 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.269
 and here I am here I am prisoners 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.349
 we stay power in series I know 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.900
 and you 're going to want me to 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.080
 doped as if I give myself a big 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.650
 role of a big sick I had no 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.650
 touch a drop 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.370
 and there I have to kill a shark in 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:52.569
 particular which is it seems is enough 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:53.140
 nasty it seems that a show then 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.030
 that's what we will do 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.829
 we're just going to kill them with our 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.269
 meaning we know that he is not strong 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.980
 practice at all but then really not 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.049
 because really a bow to kill 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.239
 something that lives under the water I 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:12.190
 think this last solution that 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:14.200
 I will have chosen the last suite but the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.639
 question is how am I going 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:22.340
 do to see them and the shoots and 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.870
 quietly without difficulty 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.040
 I try to get closer to the place 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.099
 parliament plays a few years 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.489
 that is, that thing 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:34.640
 seduced there are others are all in front 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.489
 his arms at home told me how 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.920
 I 'm doing it to shoot him with a 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:46.069
 fucking arc is in serious what is it 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.760
 this mission will you go go go 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.849
 going 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.220
 too much good ben that's good the only one 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.500
 problem is that there are big ones that 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.540
 little everywhere but that's a small 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.610
 problem I reassure you it's not a 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.120
 problem of force majeure just enough 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.340
 simply dear friends to swing in 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.989
 it was the wrong choice to swing 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.129
 some grenades here and there up 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:16.600
 level it's like peace will say to 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:21.310
 banana dishes as I am the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:25.419
 post grenade to touch the key 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.110
 boy or otherwise just I'm going 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.819
 not to tread and I 'll go 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.819
 in play like this 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.230
 come on 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.819
 and when you want it here and the last 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.880
 since I'm a big barbarian and 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:46.380
 archived with a knife I'll kill you at 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.699
 knife 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:54.819
 no no I can not kill him with a knife 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:57.249
 oh no shit at these fairs and to my god 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.499
 what a madman or what is he 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:02.379
 toinon in you are you going to see the 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:06.629
 treatment the treatment in force the 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.629
 wonderful treatment were fine 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:19.950
 where it's about sending it with momentum 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:27.980
 thanks behold you were you were you a 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:27.980
 gift to him 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.180
 and that's how we fish 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.120
 shark children just have 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:41.050
 just a few pounds 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.860
 kilos no less otherwise it's a lot 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.150
 was going on and just go hunt 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.290
 under the moonlight because 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.200
 that obviously like everyone else 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.580
 know the shark it's much easier to 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.870
 to hunt at night 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:06:06.340

 that I represent that it's only 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:17.040

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.760
