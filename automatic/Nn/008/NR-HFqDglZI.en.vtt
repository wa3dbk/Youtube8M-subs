00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:11.219
 It's time for a tool review. 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:16.379
 I prepared a tool called the Glue Clip . 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:22.080
 Easy to say not produced in the country-style company X by country Berkeley yiguyeo 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:26.160
 It's a tool to paint. I'll take a look at the introduction. 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.859
 It is made in the style x that is a comprehensive model supply brand. Excellent 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.010
 The best operation effect with convenient use of performance 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:38.940
 I mean, it's just a clip, and I do not think it's big or big. 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.899
 This pipe needed for the model area needs a little bit of mood 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.520
 Now we need to paint it. I'm using it as a brush set. 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.039
 It looks like this. 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.320
 4 product itself is already a stereotypical wife Hong Te statue of the Black Sword Copper 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.480
 Oriental copper wire covered with cloth 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:02.679
 The front of the crocodile is a little strong, I think the clip. 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.560
 Yesterday, while shooting a paint image 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:11.350
 Chopsticks, I saw Guru called me here sandwiched between the skills 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.799
 And I had to stand edaga made my dad sick now separately state c 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.970
 class 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:20.350
 I used to write about it again. Now , how did you test this guy? 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:25.270
 Geonya see this guy than I geoe made separately how 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:30.880
 Good strength of the copper arc lip divorce is how much you're more powerful than continue 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:36.009
 How long will it hold you? 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:41.440
 I'll try opening the broken item once . I'm in front of him first . 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:43.840
 Now I'm hooking up to the guy who fixed it . 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.920
 Contains three 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.429
 In the book, I bought it for $ 2,200 at O'Reim. 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.560
 So inside the wool 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:02:02.679
 Look at the uniform Silla or Ye Hong Dong line. Yes. 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:07.239
 Now feeling when I saw one catch is very strong ah 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:12.250
 I did mulberry servo brass wire alligator clip 2d do so well 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:18.010
 I have a feeling that I will be able to fix it firmly . 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.879
 If you do not seek to do this at just over 20, it does not seem easy to bend 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.950
 The same 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:27.910
 Well then I will leave my own I used to write 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:32.190
 Here is about sd 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.360
 I'm going to take a look at style management here. 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.360
 Once I plugged clerical script before reporting 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.550
 When I called up 4 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.000
 Because it is a little bit heavy 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.910
 4 Lift up and listen 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.090
 So I'm not squatting a lot of warped times 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:56.460
 Then click on the group copper bronze dagger 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:58.870
 How much how much how much support I'll give you a fit look yogeol 4 parcels 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.960
 I'm curious. 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:06.760
 I do not feel like he's bending at all. 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:10.330
 Standing upright, but more so, at least earlier this tree can I see you in 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.450
 Stronger ads than bars 25g 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.500
 It shows you have a lot more power. 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:23.020
 So let's stare Because I knew once topped hg 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:28.640
 It's a little heavier guys Pen Pen x xh US's four seats are somehow fight this 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:32.050
 Because it's a little itneunge up than I'll do it even lighter 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.050
 And yet 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.310
 9 out of batting is very little so little weight without flaring hg 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.750
 Despite the good standing 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:47.010
 In this state, spraying it like this will not make you sick. 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:53.280
 If I do not give it this strength , I will bend over to the side. 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:57.330
 There is only a slight warpage, but it does not feel very much fall off at all. 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.110
 I can not take it. 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.060
 Let no one put it frankly, and what it's not Buckley Midfield 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.790
 I want to be. 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.900
 Knowing the teoneyi mg can not be absolute sex to try again 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.989
 I'll do it 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:20.320
 How long can I survive this weight? 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:27.250
 Maybe eopjyo settings can only hamstrung because I do not 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:32.010
 However, it seems to be holding a little b, 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:35.160
 You can see what Philip deoraguyo itself is quite Sen strength 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:39.840
 The brass line is also a little stronger The strength of the abbreviation clip 2 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:44.130
 2 fast than to force also increases considerably so do not ignore me 3 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.570
 Compared to what I have, it's almost a big guy, 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.930
 By comparison, 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.490
 The problem is that the little guy has a very high sensitivity 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.780
 I think it's an advantage. 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.660
 And then I will get the performance. 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.800
 Let's take a couple of these three 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.320
 The reason I prepared three deliberately and deliberately , was eating a book and making a fool 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.230
 I prepared for a twist. 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.710
 I do not have 4 days in my apartment. 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.220
 I did not have it . 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.220
 I'll finish it. 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.249
 U 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.770
 Gundam Hollicka 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.520
 Gundam Hollic 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:38.199
 Now it is released in domestic corporate style x 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:42.819
 Put another way, just give me two examples alligator clips gum Province 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:47.650
 I used it once. It's stronger than I thought. 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:51.520
 Because lotus root is so heavy, I think it will be very useful when painting . 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.199
 When I did not get this book to paint so tongjja do not choose to haneunge tongjja bean 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.880
 Because I do it one by one 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:06:02.169
 I think it's the angle I want and the more ike parts are , 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:06.789
 There 's something I want to do. For example, 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:08.919
 Well it does not take books Ido slightly better go to state 3 pieoseo the wall II 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:12.190
 I want to go. 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:15.490
 It is very convenient because you can go in. When you paint 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:18.039
 It was quite a hit. 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:22.570
 The party goes until n For Today 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.960
 I've already mentioned this, but I've reviewed this blacklist clip and it's incredibly convenient. 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.259
 roughness 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.690
 Let me tell you again. I have the Gundam Wing material so far. 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:32.620
 Next time another 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.130
 So I will not confess difference modeling tools derived Have you now 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.080
 bye 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:39.360
