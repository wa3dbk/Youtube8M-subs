00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
now we've got better cameras since the

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.460

but<00:02:59.069> we've<00:02:59.579> got<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.909> good<00:03:00.030> care<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.389> now<00:03:00.569> so

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
but we've got the good care is now so

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.330 
but we've got the good care is now so
why<00:03:01.349> on<00:03:01.530> earth<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.829> it's<00:03:02.010> not<00:03:02.129> been

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
why on earth is it's not been

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.729 
why on earth is it's not been
implemented<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.269> it's<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.019> an<00:03:04.170> idea<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.500> God

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
implemented so it's just an idea of God

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.399 
implemented so it's just an idea of God
and<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.549> think<00:03:05.790> things<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.019> internet

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
and I think things on the internet

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.289 
and I think things on the internet
sometimes<00:03:07.769> gets<00:03:08.250> spread<00:03:08.489> around<00:03:08.549> by<00:03:08.940> quick

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
sometimes gets spread around by quick

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.640 
sometimes gets spread around by quick
it's<00:03:09.690> probably<00:03:09.959> just<00:03:10.109> going<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.319> sell<00:03:10.470> my

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
it's probably just going to sell my

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.229 
it's probably just going to sell my
channel<00:03:10.980> not<00:03:11.129> do<00:03:11.250> anything<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.060> think

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
channel not do anything but I just think

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.699 
channel not do anything but I just think
it's<00:03:12.450> an<00:03:12.510> idea<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.870> should<00:03:13.170> pull<00:03:13.349> out<00:03:13.470> there

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
it's an idea that should pull out there

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.339 
it's an idea that should pull out there
and<00:03:13.950> fingers<00:03:14.489> crossed<00:03:14.730> somebody<00:03:15.269> who<00:03:15.569> is<00:03:15.870> in

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
and fingers crossed somebody who is in

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.470 
and fingers crossed somebody who is in
the<00:03:16.829> industry<00:03:17.459> might<00:03:17.730> pick<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.150> up<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.359> go

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
the industry might pick it up and go

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.800 
the industry might pick it up and go
that<00:03:19.379> kids<00:03:19.650> onto<00:03:19.829> something<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.459> all<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.660> us
