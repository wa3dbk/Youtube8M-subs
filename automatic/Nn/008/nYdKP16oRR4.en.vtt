00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.820 
really stretched out volleys again a
little<00:02:59.920> bit<00:03:00.040> harder<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:01.000> maneuver<00:03:01.590> both<00:03:02.590> of

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
little bit harder to maneuver both of

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.820 
little bit harder to maneuver both of
the<00:03:02.950> rackets<00:03:03.400> except<00:03:04.150> for<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.900> team<00:03:05.260> version

the rackets except for the team version

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.220 
the rackets except for the team version

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
so overall on the volleys I liked the
