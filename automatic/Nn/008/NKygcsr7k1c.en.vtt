00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.940
 [Music] 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:19.020
 I am I want to know which trick applies 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.610
 you could help me all 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.579
 well i will tell you honestly 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.349
 what tricks I knew I know there 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.220
 nothing very much i am not the player 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.220
 as 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.320
 as cabral just about all of those 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.239
 does tricks in the field and does that whole 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.430
 many tricks but I know my fellow player 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.540
 who meets this lake of the Easter lamb 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.370
 to have 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.699
 and the trick is yes only the simple one 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.320
 maybe I can do tricks like the scissors 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.129
 and for the rest I am no no tricks 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.409
 men 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.309
 I can't do the pieces as much as you do 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.019
 well more to act 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.869
 such tricks you do as at desk 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.309
 You don't really tend to be stupid 

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:55.170
 Heart Ball searching 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.659
 yes sure I hope so so little 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.900
 possible with me because then sees will 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.280
 participate then pull him to the ground 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.470
 that will certainly be one thing but yes 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.200
 of course it is always nice to see 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.170
 how how not only program with 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.210
 several players in the team that are good 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.509
 tricks can slide that some people are 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.509
 simply because they send the forest into the forest 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.030
 hi marcel and i want to know if you often 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.960
 eat the patches how is that not allowed because of you 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.120
 at feyenoord that is and that she plays 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.450
 nice questions of course from such a boy 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.250
 yes of course always look around 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.010
 because you always order or at the snack bar too 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.800
 food but no I watched once a week 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.350
 I eat about at the snack bar that is 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.600
 then often just after a match 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.740
 and for the rest it is just more land 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.150
 and 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.670
 and just pretty good on you on you 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.070
 Nutrition that so you get some nutrition too 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.830
 very important for you in need 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.910
 in football because that is something 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.030
 how very bad for you 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.790
 what is your best for the moment and 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.440
 nicest hair dryer and I think is always 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.990
 League match 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.850
 here in the tub against roda at home he can 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.410
 you have n't been that long 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.030
 played here one in the first hour 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.890
 few man I sit here 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.300
 but that is what time where you alone 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.920
 but frankly enjoy it so well 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.770
 goes in the field that the atmosphere is such 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.270
 stadium is that one day will be what 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.890
 I will not soon forget 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.390
 I just look at ease at the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.030
 club first of all boss had won 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.940
 of course always positive and back 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.590
 roda visiting from the first moment 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.260
 we just became very man i want to be there 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.180
 just be in charge of the field and 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.090
 and finally have that with the good ones 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.920
 things win paid out 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.080
 what is your most beautiful phi the moment like 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.510
 been a supporter, especially the 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.220
 uefa cup was so long ago 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.590
 very young 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.120
 because that is something you do not quickly 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.650
 of course forget that would not often 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.320
 happen that feyenoord such a price 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.730
 win such an award and sometimes I'm at home 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.640
 I sometimes just a movie sky cup 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.430
 on youtube and then those movies will come 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.450
 rest are entitled to that final 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.780
 given the excess rent 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.010
 yes that final for the 14 yes that is 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.040
 smart and beautiful of course if you have a like 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.720
 you are into sports and your club is in the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.790
 wind uefa cup 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.459
 so that was just enjoying where that 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.110
 the then idols of yours 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.180
 certainly as a little boy look 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.519
 of course always against such players 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.810
 if you see one of those then time and 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.890
 van hooijdonk 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.380
 you name it being natural 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.540
 the idol or for when you have clay with and now 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.430
 do you play now I actually play in myself 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.319
 the tub and I also hope that Feyenoord is 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.530
 possible to go as much as possible 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.530
 to grab 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.219
 [Music] 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.550
 good midfielder a lot because of that place 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:01.220
 bet good attempt 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:04.430
 just insert a poor person and that is 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.380
 naturally beautiful as a teammates 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.080
 positive that you only talk about that 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.340
 just good things 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.380
 or you say if only think one 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.000
 compliment myself for what he says 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.230
 then a bit correct 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.540
 I know of course what but what my 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.250
 own qualities are to know that 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.180
 that most guys on the team do too 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.980
 so if you fall into the press then 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.860
 question about me will vote 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.240
 most boys and this is what they mention 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.280
 do you want to improve 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.560
 walking capacity I want even more 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.870
 improve my left leg 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.080
 natural physical always slightly stronger 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.080
 to become 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:48.600
 jordy clasie anonymous penny will is perry 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.810
 jan harting choose 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.930
 check you must have a nice plea again 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.580
 intelligent 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.710
 [Music] 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:06.110
 it i think an economically push single thing 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:08.790
 must the farmer yes I speak the ipad between 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.980
 both teams and expressed to feyenoord fans 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.030
 and the 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.460
 know expert getting from heel 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.110
 natural and beautiful and wrath natural 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.570
 Sint Engels him English not so good 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.570
 but men who have numbers tables 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.520
 I stand reasonable and after 10 Allah we 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.380
 I am right and what he says and like it 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.780
 sometimes there with me in peace on so or 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.390
 did not go very well at first 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.150
 also give him regular information 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.790
 I just say in the field what I bit 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.010
 just do it or shape or through whatever I did 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.720
 I like to stand or or just information 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.130
 gives you my that the peak of always 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.200
 him who do you think is the best 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.850
 Referee of the Netherlands I think 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.390
 quite a lot 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.800
 in spite of that, even though i was there 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.180
 little have had little like me 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.230
 matches the option he guess 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.430
 a bit of a good basis in the market 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.290
 of course also make a referee 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.520
 mistakes but if I have a disk 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.580
 then choose 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.200
 then I think it's okay with flowers 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.240
 you a nasty boy for one 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.710
 The referee will consult you a lot against one 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.500
 happie too 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:17.340
 yes i talk regular seems to say 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:20.070
 just whistle offense and and I am 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.740
 three most and then I just saw it 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.110
 to him well I'm not the only one 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.720
 from or team a if you saw the red cards 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.610
 go put if i think one of the 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.140
 First that form stood to say where 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.700
 who was working on it 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.740
 so I do know a lot there are before 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.180
 sloppy tin who is the biggest fan 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.800
 from jordy clasie 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.640
 well i do take a tank anyway 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.440
 dangers I think that stuff a big one 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.660
 from me 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.830
 You also had some tables set with 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.980
 your father's name 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.870
 why it is clean and can pay homage 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.030
 poor father and mother shore for the lot 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.140
 of my mean 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.650
 you no longer have contact with your mother 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:03.120
 no how we went 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:05.850
 yes that will then you can doctor or eight nine 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.040
 ago that comes that case not contact 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.330
 that she said she was leaving our home 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.080
 the 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.430
 since four years or so I think on 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.110
 that moment 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.850
 That's why you have a closer relationship with you 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.920
 brother and with your father 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.420
 yes, of course, actually 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.210
 actually only grew up with them 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.540
 never just anyone 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.540
 taller
