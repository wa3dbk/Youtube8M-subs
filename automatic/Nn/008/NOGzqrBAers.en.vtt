00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
finish but it does come up quite shiny

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.419 
finish but it does come up quite shiny
in<00:01:56.450> some<00:01:56.780> places<00:01:57.080> like<00:01:57.850> especially<00:01:58.850> here<00:02:00.429> it

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
in some places like especially here it

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.460 
in some places like especially here it
looks<00:02:01.670> nice<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.300> if<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.659> was<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.810> gloss<00:02:03.080> finish

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
looks nice and if it was a gloss finish

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.520 
looks nice and if it was a gloss finish
it<00:02:04.340> will<00:02:04.520> just<00:02:04.940> scratch<00:02:05.659> with<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.229> lenticular

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
it will just scratch with the lenticular

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:17.620 
it will just scratch with the lenticular
