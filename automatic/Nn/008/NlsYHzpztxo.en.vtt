Ironman<00:00:11.309> arc<00:00:11.640> reactor<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:13.170> arc<00:00:13.349> reactor<00:00:13.559> is

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
Ironman arc reactor the arc reactor is

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.909 
Ironman arc reactor the arc reactor is
embedded<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.610> Tony<00:00:14.880> Stark's<00:00:15.300> chest<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.080> it

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:16.919 
embedded in Tony Stark's chest and it

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.729 
embedded in Tony Stark's chest and it
actually<00:00:17.279> powers<00:00:17.759> the<00:00:17.999> Ironman<00:00:18.659> suit<00:00:18.960> I'm

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:19.739 
actually powers the Ironman suit I'm

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.979 
actually powers the Ironman suit I'm
gonna<00:00:19.919> be<00:00:20.039> building<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.489> circle<00:00:20.970> arc<00:00:21.239> reactor

00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:21.989

that<00:00:35.010> I've<00:00:35.160> used<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.790> build<00:00:36.150> the<00:00:36.330> arc<00:00:36.510> reactor

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that I've used to build the arc reactor

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.320 
that I've used to build the arc reactor
and<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:37.290> I've<00:00:37.440> done<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.980> far<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:39.210> can

feel free to take my ideas and modify it
to<00:00:41.400> make<00:00:41.610> your<00:00:41.790> own<00:00:41.940> homemade<00:00:42.450> arc<00:00:42.660> reactor<00:00:43.730> so

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
to make your own homemade arc reactor so

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.410 
to make your own homemade arc reactor so
start<00:00:46.740> off<00:00:46.890> I'll<00:00:47.130> go<00:00:47.310> over<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> supplies<00:00:48.060> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
start off I'll go over the supplies and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.060 
start off I'll go over the supplies and
where<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.690> got<00:00:48.840> them<00:00:48.900> and<00:00:49.350> approximately<00:00:49.980> how

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
where it got them and approximately how

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.020 
where it got them and approximately how
much<00:00:50.250> they<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:52.400> for<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.490> housing<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
much they are for the housing for the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.150 
much they are for the housing for the
arc<00:00:54.150> reactor<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.600> use<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> sink<00:00:55.079> train<00:00:55.350> which<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
arc reactor I use a sink train which I

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.280 
arc reactor I use a sink train which I
got<00:00:56.370> from<00:00:56.520> Home<00:00:56.760> Depot<00:00:56.790> it's<00:00:57.780> only<00:00:57.900> about<00:00:58.020> six

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
bucks it's not very expensive in ER for

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.620 
bucks it's not very expensive in ER for
the<00:01:01.860> inner<00:01:02.010> circle<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.579> use<00:01:02.790> some<00:01:03.060> translucent

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
the inner circle I use some translucent

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.469 
the inner circle I use some translucent
tubing<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.290> got<00:01:04.500> from<00:01:04.649> Home<00:01:04.829> Depot<00:01:04.859> it's<00:01:05.670> $3<00:01:06.270> for

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
tubing I got from Home Depot it's $3 for

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.120 
tubing I got from Home Depot it's $3 for
four<00:01:06.659> feet<00:01:06.899> which<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.229> more<00:01:07.530> than<00:01:07.679> plenty<00:01:08.009> but

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
four feet which is more than plenty but

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.010 
four feet which is more than plenty but

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
they only sell in three feet and four

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.080 
they only sell in three feet and four
feet<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:11.069> like<00:01:11.219> 10<00:01:11.369> cents<00:01:11.579> more<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.850> the
