00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.990 
that was supposed to be the iphone as
well<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.140> probably<00:01:13.409> could<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.950> true<00:01:14.189> this

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
well which probably could be true this

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.300 
well which probably could be true this
is<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> inside<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.990> plastic<00:01:16.470> shells<00:01:17.070> as

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
is the inside of the plastic shells as

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.590 
is the inside of the plastic shells as
you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.729> has<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.850> bunch<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.240> room<00:01:18.450> to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you can see it has a bunch of room to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.260 
you can see it has a bunch of room to
hold<00:01:18.689> all<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.080> internals<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.770> iphone

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
hold all the internals of the iphone

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.120 
hold all the internals of the iphone
these<00:01:21.270> are<00:01:21.479> new<00:01:21.659> components<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> internal

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
these are new components the internal

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.830 
these are new components the internal
budget<00:01:23.909> iPhone<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.659> another

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
budget iPhone and this is another

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.020 
budget iPhone and this is another
internal<00:01:25.229> component<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> back

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
internal component and this is the back

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.240 
internal component and this is the back
again<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.930> green<00:01:28.290> model<00:01:28.680> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
again this is the green model so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.800 
again this is the green model so
basically<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:29.729> these<00:01:30.060> photos<00:01:30.420> were<00:01:30.450> leaked

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
basically all these photos were leaked

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.460 
basically all these photos were leaked
and<00:01:31.520> I<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.729> actually<00:01:33.270> think<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.960> true<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and I do actually think this is true the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.499 
and I do actually think this is true the
budget<00:01:34.740> iPhone<00:01:35.070> probably<00:01:35.640> will<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.000> coming<00:01:36.210> in

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
budget iPhone probably will be coming in

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.530 
budget iPhone probably will be coming in
a<00:01:37.290> plastic<00:01:37.710> shell<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.549> probably<00:01:39.030> will<00:01:39.329> have

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
a plastic shell and probably will have

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.940 
a plastic shell and probably will have

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
it's supposed to have a lot of the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.660 
it's supposed to have a lot of the
features<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.229> new<00:01:43.740> iphone<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
features that the new iphone is going to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.499 
features that the new iphone is going to
have<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.939> supposed<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> better

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
have is supposed to have a better

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.990 
have is supposed to have a better
battery<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.229> better<00:01:46.560> internal<00:01:47.130> specs<00:01:47.460> but

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
battery and better internal specs but

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.960 
battery and better internal specs but
let's<00:01:48.210> expect<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.290> new<00:01:49.890> camera<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
let's expect that the new camera on the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.060 
let's expect that the new camera on the
new<00:01:51.180> iphone<00:01:51.630> rather<00:01:52.229> than<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> budget<00:01:52.770> iphone

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
new iphone rather than the budget iphone

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.580 
new iphone rather than the budget iphone
and<00:01:53.220> other<00:01:53.340> features<00:01:53.610> will<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.060> more<00:01:54.590> suited

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and other features will be more suited

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
and other features will be more suited
for<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.130> new<00:01:56.399> iphone<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.939> I'm<00:01:57.000> sure<00:01:57.240> this

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
for the new iphone so I'm sure this

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.999 
for the new iphone so I'm sure this
budget<00:01:57.869> iPhone<00:01:58.140> won't<00:01:58.409> actually<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.860> an

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
budget iPhone won't actually have an

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.260 
budget iPhone won't actually have an
updated<00:01:59.340> processor<00:01:59.850> and<00:01:59.969> stuff<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
updated processor and stuff like that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270 
updated processor and stuff like that
just<00:02:00.420> simply<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> RAM<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.770> battery<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
just simply like the RAM and battery and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.190 
just simply like the RAM and battery and
all<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.520> good<00:02:02.640> stuff<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.930> supposed

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
all that good stuff but this is supposed

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.010 
all that good stuff but this is supposed
to<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.439> design<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.219> budget<00:02:05.579> iPhone

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
to be the design of the budget iPhone
