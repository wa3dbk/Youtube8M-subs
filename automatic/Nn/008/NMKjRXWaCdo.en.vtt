you<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.700> great<00:01:06.000> examples<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.780> film<00:01:07.170> of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
you know as great examples on film of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.679 
you know as great examples on film of
why<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:07.979> little<00:01:08.460> things<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.090> preach<00:01:09.450> all

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
why the little things that we preach all

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.109 
why the little things that we preach all
the<00:01:09.810> time<00:01:10.020> success<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> details<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the time success is in the details and

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.670 
the time success is in the details and
there's<00:01:12.390> little<00:01:12.659> things<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.049> show<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
there's little things to show on that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.670 
there's little things to show on that
film<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.580> take<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.659> step<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> different

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
film you take one step in a different

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.429 
film you take one step in a different
direction<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.450> eyes<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.140> T's

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
direction you have your eyes on your T's

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.140 
direction you have your eyes on your T's
all<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> things<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.430> talk<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.880> time

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
all the things that we talk all the time

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.140 
all the things that we talk all the time
I<00:01:22.049> think<00:01:22.560> sometimes<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.340> need<00:01:23.490> something<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
I think sometimes you need something to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.030 
I think sometimes you need something to
reinforce<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.900> what<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> great<00:01:25.740> example

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
reinforce it and what a great example

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.710 
reinforce it and what a great example
you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.640> speak<00:01:26.909> from<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.210> quarterback's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you can speak from a quarterback's

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
you can speak from a quarterback's
perspective<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> don't<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.250> didn't

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
perspective and I don't know we didn't

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
perspective and I don't know we didn't
get<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.790> win<00:01:29.939> last<00:01:30.150> week<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:30.930> did<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
get the win last week but what did that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.890 
get the win last week but what did that
performance<00:01:31.890> due<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> think<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:33.390> Austin

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
performance due to you think for Austin

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.990 
performance due to you think for Austin
I<00:01:34.110> think<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.890> helps<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> win<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.759> whenever

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
I think it helps in a win and whenever

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.270 
I think it helps in a win and whenever
you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.360> go<00:01:36.479> out<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.689> put<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.470> many<00:01:37.710> points

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
you can go out and put that many points

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.359 
you can go out and put that many points
on<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.579> board<00:01:38.759> throw<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.810> 300<00:01:40.049> yards<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:41.220> got

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
on the board throw for 300 yards we got

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.560 
on the board throw for 300 yards we got
to<00:01:41.490> make<00:01:41.579> sure<00:01:41.640> we're<00:01:41.939> protecting<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
and not really paying any attention to

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.460 
and not really paying any attention to
anything<00:02:56.610> else<00:02:56.910> yeah<00:02:57.450> that's<00:02:57.959> what<00:02:58.140> we<00:02:58.320> do

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
anything else yeah that's what we do

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.979 
anything else yeah that's what we do
every<00:02:58.709> single<00:02:58.920> week<00:02:59.310> we<00:02:59.880> focus<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.480> Vanderbilt

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
every single week we focus on Vanderbilt

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.990

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
can show them examples of 81 double-a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.949 
can show them examples of 81 double-a
