knife<00:00:09.630> tool<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.230> was<00:00:10.290> introduced<00:00:10.769> in

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
knife tool that was introduced in

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.350 
knife tool that was introduced in
blender<00:00:11.519> 2.63

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
blender 2.63

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.930 
blender 2.63
along<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.780> bee<00:00:12.929> mesh<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.400> new<00:00:14.759> knife

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
along with bee mesh so the new knife

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.029 
along with bee mesh so the new knife
tool<00:00:15.210> which<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.929> sometimes<00:00:16.139> referred<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.830> as

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
tool which is sometimes referred to as

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.510 
tool which is sometimes referred to as
the<00:00:17.220> super<00:00:17.880> knife<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.449> very<00:00:19.289> handle<00:00:19.830> be<00:00:19.949> handy

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
the super knife is very handle be handy

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.670 
the super knife is very handle be handy
because<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.939> essentially<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> topology<00:00:22.380> pin

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
because it's essentially a topology pin

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.650 
because it's essentially a topology pin
tool<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.609> i've<00:00:23.880> got<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> real<00:00:24.359> world<00:00:24.539> example

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
tool so i've got a real world example

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.960 
tool so i've got a real world example
here<00:00:25.140> where<00:00:25.439> i<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:26.039> fairly<00:00:26.310> simple

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
here where i have this fairly simple

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.240 
here where i have this fairly simple
model<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.779> makes<00:00:28.019> use<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> several<00:00:28.710> end<00:00:29.010> guns

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
model that makes use of several end guns

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.830 
model that makes use of several end guns
here<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.529> here<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.790> i<00:00:33.570> want

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
here and here here and here and i want

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.950 
here and here here and here and i want
to<00:00:33.960> turn<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.290> into<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.980> quad<00:00:35.579> only<00:00:36.030> mesh<00:00:36.270> so

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
to turn this into a quad only mesh so

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.750 
to turn this into a quad only mesh so
there's<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.620> few<00:00:37.890> ways<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.250> could<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.610> this

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
there's a few ways that I could do this

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.569 
there's a few ways that I could do this
I<00:00:38.940> could<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.600> go<00:00:40.530> through<00:00:40.770> start<00:00:41.160> adding<00:00:41.430> in

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
I could just go through start adding in

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.880 
I could just go through start adding in
my<00:00:41.730> edge<00:00:41.910> loops<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:42.930> oh<00:00:43.230> look<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.860> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
my edge loops and then oh look like I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.260 
my edge loops and then oh look like I
have<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> problem<00:00:44.370> there<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.940> might<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.120> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
have a problem there so I might have to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.959 
have a problem there so I might have to
you<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.260> say<00:00:46.649> subdivide<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.640> piece

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
you know just say subdivide this piece

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.750 
you know just say subdivide this piece
and<00:00:48.500> then<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.649> could<00:00:49.829> go<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.399> could<00:00:50.550> start

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and then I could go in and I could start

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.060 
and then I could go in and I could start
connecting<00:00:50.969> these<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.750> by<00:00:51.840> hitting<00:00:51.989> J<00:00:52.500> with

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
connecting these just by hitting J with

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.610 
connecting these just by hitting J with
the<00:00:53.370> vertex<00:00:53.820> connect<00:00:54.270> tool<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:55.199> then<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.469> can

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
the vertex connect tool but then you can

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680 
the vertex connect tool but then you can
see<00:00:55.800> these<00:00:55.980> are<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.250> lined<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.570> know

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
see these are not lined up and you know

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
see these are not lined up and you know
it's<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.079> little<00:00:58.199> tedious<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.670> knife

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
it's a little tedious so this the knife

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.660 
it's a little tedious so this the knife
tool<00:01:00.120> makes<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.899> lot<00:01:01.320> easier<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
tool makes this a lot easier so the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.100 
tool makes this a lot easier so the
knife<00:01:02.820> tool<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.270> accessed<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.989> two

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
knife tool can be accessed one of two

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.490 
knife tool can be accessed one of two
ways

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
ways

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.620 
ways
the<00:01:04.920> first<00:01:05.280> way<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.489> from<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> tool<00:01:06.150> bar<00:01:06.360> which

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the first way is from the tool bar which

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.380 
the first way is from the tool bar which
you<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.960> knife<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.710> select<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.270> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
you have knife and select now this is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.149 
you have knife and select now this is
not<00:01:09.540> very<00:01:09.689> apparent<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.830> actually

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
not very apparent but this is actually

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.649 
not very apparent but this is actually
basically<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> knife<00:01:12.210> tool<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
basically this is the knife tool and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.080 
basically this is the knife tool and
this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> knife<00:01:13.680> tool<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.280> work<00:01:14.310> only<00:01:14.970> on

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
this is the knife tool to work only on

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090 
this is the knife tool to work only on
the<00:01:15.180> selection<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.470> one<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.770> work<00:01:16.799> on

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the selection so this one will work on

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.609 
the selection so this one will work on
any<00:01:17.400> portion<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> mesh<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.049> actively

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
any portion of the mesh that is actively

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.679 
any portion of the mesh that is actively
in<00:01:19.740> edit<00:01:19.979> mode<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.119> only<00:01:21.240> work<00:01:21.390> on

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
in edit mode and this will only work on

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.719 
in edit mode and this will only work on
your<00:01:21.810> current<00:01:21.990> selection<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:23.400> other<00:01:23.549> way<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
your current selection the other way to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
your current selection the other way to
do<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.180> by<00:01:24.479> simply<00:01:24.810> hitting<00:01:25.020> K<00:01:25.320> or

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
do it is just by simply hitting K or

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.030 
do it is just by simply hitting K or
Shift<00:01:26.220> K<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.509> wanted<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.500> connect

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
Shift K so if I wanted to just connect

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.210 
Shift K so if I wanted to just connect
these<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.369> would<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.880> hit<00:01:30.030> K<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> do

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
these I would just hit K and when I do

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.550 
these I would just hit K and when I do
that<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.579> immediately<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.570> new<00:01:33.840> cursor

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that I immediately have a new cursor

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
that I immediately have a new cursor
icon<00:01:34.770> along<00:01:35.340> with<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.549> little<00:01:35.670> green<00:01:36.060> dot

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
icon along with this little green dot

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.109 
icon along with this little green dot
and<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.530> green<00:01:37.799> dot<00:01:37.979> basically<00:01:38.670> represents

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and this green dot basically represents

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.960 
and this green dot basically represents
where<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> insert<00:01:40.590> my<00:01:40.860> new<00:01:41.130> cut<00:01:41.340> you

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
where I'm going to insert my new cut you

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
so I'm not going to talk about these too

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.360 
so I'm not going to talk about these too
much<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.410> encourage<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.099> play

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
much I do encourage you just to play

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.490 
much I do encourage you just to play
with<00:02:11.520> them<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.450> will<00:02:12.629> be<00:02:12.720> using<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
with them but we will be using the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.530 
with them but we will be using the
eeee for<00:02:14.010> starting<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.370> new<00:02:14.550> cut<00:02:14.820> quite<00:02:15.300> often

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
eeee for starting a new cut quite often

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.540 
eeee for starting a new cut quite often
so<00:02:16.260> let's<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:16.740> take<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> look<00:02:17.070> at<00:02:17.250> if<00:02:17.520> we

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
so let's just take a look at if we

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.670 
so let's just take a look at if we
wanted<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.390> cut<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.990> several<00:02:19.440> new

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
wanted to then just cut in several new

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.220 
wanted to then just cut in several new
faces<00:02:20.100> here<00:02:20.310> or<00:02:20.760> something<00:02:21.570> new<00:02:21.660> edges<00:02:22.080> to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
faces here or something new edges to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.380 
faces here or something new edges to
then<00:02:22.350> give<00:02:22.770> us<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.100> straight<00:02:23.520> edge<00:02:23.700> long<00:02:24.000> here

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
then give us a straight edge long here

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.950 
then give us a straight edge long here
here<00:02:25.230> here<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.340> here<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.750> quite<00:02:27.930> easy

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
here here and here this is quite easy

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.540 
here here and here this is quite easy
because<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.410> can<00:02:28.590> simply<00:02:28.740> move<00:02:28.920> over<00:02:29.310> here<00:02:29.430> you

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
because I can simply move over here you

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.030 
because I can simply move over here you
notice<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.820> as<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.030> hover<00:02:31.020> over<00:02:31.140> an<00:02:31.500> edge<00:02:31.800> or

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
notice that as I hover over an edge or

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.880 
notice that as I hover over an edge or
vertex<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:33.450> edge<00:02:33.720> or<00:02:34.050> vertex<00:02:34.080> becomes

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
vertex that edge or vertex becomes

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.670 
vertex that edge or vertex becomes
highlighted<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:36.270> if<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.750> say<00:02:37.020> click<00:02:37.380> on<00:02:37.530> this

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
highlighted so if I say click on this

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.740 
highlighted so if I say click on this
vertex<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.700> can<00:02:38.730> see<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.030> draws<00:02:39.300> out<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> line

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
vertex you can see it draws out a line

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.050 
vertex you can see it draws out a line
from<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.380> one<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.040> now<00:02:41.190> place<00:02:41.850> this

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
from that one and I can now place this

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.020 
from that one and I can now place this
new<00:02:42.270> cut<00:02:42.510> anywhere<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.440> want<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.760> could

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
new cut anywhere that I want and I could

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.699 
new cut anywhere that I want and I could
snap<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.630> directly<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.230> midpoint<00:02:46.380> by

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
snap this directly to the midpoint by

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.650 
snap this directly to the midpoint by
holding<00:02:46.980> down<00:02:47.010> ctrl<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.820> can<00:02:48.239> snap<00:02:48.390> at<00:02:48.510> any

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
holding down ctrl I can snap at any

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.870 
holding down ctrl I can snap at any
other<00:02:48.870> midpoint<00:02:49.380> or<00:02:49.590> any<00:02:49.800> other<00:02:49.980> vertex<00:02:50.489> by

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
other midpoint or any other vertex by

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.300 
other midpoint or any other vertex by
holding<00:02:51.180> down<00:02:51.270> ctrl<00:02:51.750> or<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:51.989> can<00:02:52.770> simply<00:02:53.130> select

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
holding down ctrl or I can simply select

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.090 
holding down ctrl or I can simply select
this<00:02:53.640> edge<00:02:53.880> left<00:02:54.600> click<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.500> will<00:02:55.530> start<00:02:55.920> a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
this edge left click and it will start a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.640 
this edge left click and it will start a
new<00:02:56.340> cut<00:02:56.550> or<00:02:56.820> excuse<00:02:57.660> me<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.840> know<00:02:57.930> place<00:02:58.230> that

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
new cut or excuse me you know place that

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.010 
new cut or excuse me you know place that
new<00:02:58.830> point<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.670> now<00:02:59.880> I<00:02:59.910> have<00:03:00.270> another<00:03:00.480> line<00:03:00.780> and

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
new point so now I have another line and

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.930 
new point so now I have another line and
I<00:03:01.080> could<00:03:01.230> go<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:02.070> could<00:03:02.220> drill<00:03:02.459> draw

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
I could go in and I could drill draw

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.000 
I could go in and I could drill draw
this<00:03:03.150> out<00:03:03.330> anywhere<00:03:03.840> but<00:03:04.350> maybe<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.590> don't<00:03:04.680> want

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
this out anywhere but maybe I don't want

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.160 
this out anywhere but maybe I don't want
to<00:03:05.100> work<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.970> area<00:03:06.239> just<00:03:06.600> yet<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.900> would

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
to work on this area just yet I would

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.590 
to work on this area just yet I would
rather<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.500> focus<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.190> this<00:03:08.700> next<00:03:08.970> part<00:03:09.150> so

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
rather just focus on this next part so

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.840 
rather just focus on this next part so
this<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.840> where<00:03:10.020> we<00:03:10.140> hit<00:03:10.230> e<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:11.040> start<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.520> new

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
this is where we hit e to start a new

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.330 
this is where we hit e to start a new
cut<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.330> now<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.650> draw<00:03:13.860> out<00:03:13.890> from<00:03:14.070> that

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
cut and now I can draw out from that

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.880 
cut and now I can draw out from that
same<00:03:14.760> vertex<00:03:15.270> or<00:03:15.480> even<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.320> vertex<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.770> I've

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
same vertex or even the vertex that I've

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.259 
same vertex or even the vertex that I've
just<00:03:17.040> added<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.580> still<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.239> not

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
just added that still this is not

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.120 
just added that still this is not
actually<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.660> real<00:03:18.690> vertex<00:03:19.230> yet<00:03:19.440> or<00:03:19.650> real<00:03:19.890> edge

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
actually a real vertex yet or real edge

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.699 
actually a real vertex yet or real edge
because<00:03:20.880> they're<00:03:21.030> only<00:03:21.209> added<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.140> knife

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
because they're only added in the knife

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.320 
because they're only added in the knife
so<00:03:23.010> far<00:03:23.250> these<00:03:23.670> haven't<00:03:23.970> actually<00:03:24.120> been

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
so far these haven't actually been

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.270 
so far these haven't actually been
confirmed<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:24.900> we<00:03:25.019> can<00:03:25.140> still<00:03:25.350> activate<00:03:25.920> or

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
confirmed but we can still activate or

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.000 
confirmed but we can still activate or
work<00:03:26.670> directly<00:03:27.299> on<00:03:27.450> those<00:03:28.230> vertices<00:03:28.739> and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
work directly on those vertices and

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.039 
work directly on those vertices and
edges<00:03:29.100> so<00:03:29.880> now<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.269> just<00:03:30.420> say<00:03:30.570> left<00:03:30.840> click

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
edges so now I can just say left click

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.810 
edges so now I can just say left click
here<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.500> then<00:03:32.040> maybe<00:03:32.220> I'll<00:03:32.340> draw<00:03:32.580> down

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
here and then maybe I'll draw down

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.780 
here and then maybe I'll draw down
select<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.959> maybe<00:03:34.950> that's<00:03:35.220> as<00:03:35.400> far<00:03:35.580> as<00:03:35.640> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
select that and maybe that's as far as I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.370 
select that and maybe that's as far as I
want<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.000> go<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.360> now<00:03:36.480> I'll<00:03:36.570> just<00:03:36.630> hit<00:03:36.900> return

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
want to go so now I'll just hit return

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.800 
want to go so now I'll just hit return
on<00:03:37.650> my<00:03:37.799> keyboard<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:39.030> makes<00:03:39.239> those<00:03:39.480> cuts

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
on my keyboard and it makes those cuts

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.310 
on my keyboard and it makes those cuts
real<00:03:40.080> well<00:03:40.739> that's<00:03:40.920> pretty<00:03:41.400> cool<00:03:41.820> but<00:03:42.630> you

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
real well that's pretty cool but you

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.509 
real well that's pretty cool but you
know<00:03:43.410> there's<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.709> few<00:03:43.890> things<00:03:44.130> here<00:03:44.310> number

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
know there's a few things here number

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.729 
know there's a few things here number
one<00:03:44.760> these<00:03:44.880> are<00:03:45.000> not<00:03:45.120> straight<00:03:45.570> there<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.560> some

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
one these are not straight there is some

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.140 
one these are not straight there is some
ways<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.040> we<00:03:47.130> could<00:03:47.250> get<00:03:47.370> around<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.850> so

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
ways that we could get around this so

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.569 
ways that we could get around this so
you<00:03:48.209> know<00:03:48.450> we<00:03:48.570> could<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:48.780> go<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.170> use<00:03:50.130> vertex

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
you know we could just go in use vertex

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.090 
you know we could just go in use vertex
snapping<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.150> snap<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.630> down<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.950> that

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
snapping and snap that down to that

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.100 
snapping and snap that down to that
vertex<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:54.390> would<00:03:54.540> allow<00:03:54.720> us<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.900> get

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
vertex and that would allow us to get

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.350 
vertex and that would allow us to get
that<00:03:55.290> pretty<00:03:55.829> straight<00:03:56.250> same<00:03:56.670> thing<00:03:56.940> along

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
that pretty straight same thing along

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.949 
that pretty straight same thing along
here<00:03:57.720> or<00:03:57.900> if<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:58.980> wanted<00:03:59.510> you<00:04:00.510> could<00:04:00.630> go<00:04:00.840> ahead

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
here or if you wanted you could go ahead

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.920 
here or if you wanted you could go ahead
and<00:04:01.110> just<00:04:01.380> cut<00:04:02.070> these<00:04:02.570> straight<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.720> first

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
and just cut these straight the first

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.880 
and just cut these straight the first
time<00:04:04.079> now<00:04:04.860> cutting<00:04:05.670> is<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.350> little<00:04:07.350> weird<00:04:07.620> when

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
time now cutting is a little weird when

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.289 
time now cutting is a little weird when
you're<00:04:08.010> doing<00:04:08.250> constraints<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:08.850> let's<00:04:09.150> just

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
you're doing constraints so let's just

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.819 
you're doing constraints so let's just
activate<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.690> knife<00:04:09.840> tool<00:04:10.019> again<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.440> now<00:04:10.709> if

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
activate the knife tool again and now if

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.550 
activate the knife tool again and now if
I<00:04:10.890> hit<00:04:11.010> C<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.730> can<00:04:12.209> activate<00:04:12.510> constrain<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.290> an

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
I hit C I can activate constrain to an

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.680 
I hit C I can activate constrain to an
angle<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.130> let's<00:04:14.310> put<00:04:14.790> our<00:04:14.820> first<00:04:15.180> point<00:04:15.510> and

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
angle so let's put our first point and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.140 
angle so let's put our first point and
now<00:04:16.229> you<00:04:16.290> can<00:04:16.530> see<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:16.919> I<00:04:17.010> have<00:04:17.250> an<00:04:17.459> angle<00:04:18.000> at

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
now you can see that I have an angle at

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.509 
now you can see that I have an angle at
which<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.479> can<00:04:18.630> cut<00:04:18.900> through<00:04:19.140> however<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:20.280> one

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
which I can cut through however the one

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.529 
which I can cut through however the one
thing<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:21.060> note<00:04:21.329> is<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.930> this<00:04:22.560> angle<00:04:22.800> is

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
thing to note is that this angle is

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.600 
thing to note is that this angle is
based<00:04:24.539> on<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.289> view<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.830> there's<00:04:26.190> no<00:04:26.370> way<00:04:26.550> to

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
based on the view and there's no way to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.290 
based on the view and there's no way to
do<00:04:26.970> it

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
do it

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.080 
do it
based<00:04:27.419> on<00:04:27.659> the<00:04:27.930> normals<00:04:28.409> or<00:04:28.710> global<00:04:29.550> axes<00:04:29.940> or

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
based on the normals or global axes or

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.219 
based on the normals or global axes or
anything<00:04:30.240> like<00:04:30.419> that<00:04:30.479> currently<00:04:30.990> it's<00:04:31.110> only

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
anything like that currently it's only

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.070 
anything like that currently it's only
based<00:04:31.590> on<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.949> view<00:04:32.159> and<00:04:32.330> even<00:04:33.330> if<00:04:33.569> I<00:04:33.659> cut<00:04:33.930> this

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
based on the view and even if I cut this

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.469 
based on the view and even if I cut this
here<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.680> then<00:04:34.919> hit<00:04:35.099> enter<00:04:35.280> hit<00:04:36.060> three<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.389> go

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
here and then hit enter hit three to go

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.369 
here and then hit enter hit three to go
to<00:04:36.539> side<00:04:36.720> view<00:04:36.840> you'll<00:04:36.930> notice<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:37.199> it's

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
to side view you'll notice that it's

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:38.629 
to side view you'll notice that it's
still<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.650> little<00:04:37.860> off<00:04:38.220> you<00:04:38.400> know<00:04:38.490> it's<00:04:38.580> not

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
still a little off you know it's not

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.909 
still a little off you know it's not
actually<00:04:38.729> perfectly<00:04:39.270> straight<00:04:39.629> so<00:04:40.199> generally

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
actually perfectly straight so generally

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.430 
actually perfectly straight so generally
if<00:04:41.039> you're<00:04:41.159> using<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.550> knife<00:04:41.699> tool<00:04:42.229> just<00:04:43.229> get

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
if you're using the knife tool just get

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.899 
if you're using the knife tool just get
them<00:04:43.560> pretty<00:04:43.770> close<00:04:44.159> you<00:04:44.610> know<00:04:44.699> assuming

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
them pretty close you know assuming

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.730 
them pretty close you know assuming
you're<00:04:45.150> not<00:04:45.240> using<00:04:45.419> midpoints<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.080> then<00:04:46.500> just

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
you're not using midpoints and then just

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.529 
you're not using midpoints and then just
use<00:04:46.919> your<00:04:47.069> vertex<00:04:47.400> snapping<00:04:47.879> to<00:04:48.150> line<00:04:48.360> things

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
use your vertex snapping to line things

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.839 
use your vertex snapping to line things
up<00:04:48.720> because<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.349> angle<00:04:49.740> constraints<00:04:50.250> really

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
up because the angle constraints really

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.730 
up because the angle constraints really
don't<00:04:51.060> work<00:04:51.300> quite<00:04:51.509> well<00:04:51.629> yet<00:04:52.020> so<00:04:52.500> then<00:04:52.680> I

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
don't work quite well yet so then I

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.950 
don't work quite well yet so then I
could<00:04:52.919> just<00:04:52.949> add<00:04:53.250> in<00:04:53.430> another<00:04:53.699> cut<00:04:53.909> here<00:04:53.960> maybe

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
could just add in another cut here maybe

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.649 
could just add in another cut here maybe
I<00:04:55.110> will<00:04:55.259> just<00:04:55.800> snap<00:04:55.979> that<00:04:56.039> down<00:04:56.370> there<00:04:56.729> I<00:04:57.000> can

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
I will just snap that down there I can

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.089 
I will just snap that down there I can
rotate<00:04:57.840> around<00:04:58.110> one<00:04:58.560> thing<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.710> notice<00:04:58.860> is

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
rotate around one thing you notice is

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.070 
rotate around one thing you notice is
that<00:04:59.129> I<00:04:59.250> can<00:04:59.460> rotate<00:04:59.669> very<00:05:00.300> easily<00:05:00.479> around<00:05:00.870> any

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
that I can rotate very easily around any

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.700 
that I can rotate very easily around any
point<00:05:01.280> as<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.639> do<00:05:02.699> this<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:04.020> I'll<00:05:04.319> just<00:05:04.469> hit

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
point as I do this and I'll just hit

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.149 
point as I do this and I'll just hit
return<00:05:05.370> at<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:05.699> new<00:05:05.909> one<00:05:06.800> every<00:05:07.800> now<00:05:07.889> and<00:05:08.069> then

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
return at a new one every now and then

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:09.499 
return at a new one every now and then
you<00:05:08.310> will<00:05:08.520> see<00:05:08.789> that<00:05:08.819> you'll<00:05:09.090> get<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.240> little

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
you will see that you'll get a little

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.029 
you will see that you'll get a little
buggy<00:05:09.690> like<00:05:09.960> here<00:05:10.199> it's<00:05:10.379> gotten<00:05:10.620> a<00:05:10.680> little

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
buggy like here it's gotten a little

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.879 
buggy like here it's gotten a little
buggy<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.930> but<00:05:12.930> it<00:05:13.169> cleared<00:05:13.530> out<00:05:13.650> as<00:05:13.740> soon<00:05:13.860> as

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
buggy and but it cleared out as soon as

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.740 
buggy and but it cleared out as soon as
I<00:05:14.039> added<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.400> in<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:14.580> new<00:05:14.729> cut<00:05:14.940> but<00:05:15.449> one<00:05:15.599> thing

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
I added it in that new cut but one thing

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.719 
I added it in that new cut but one thing
to<00:05:15.840> note<00:05:15.990> is<00:05:16.139> that<00:05:16.199> the<00:05:16.590> knife<00:05:16.740> tool<00:05:17.039> currently

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
to note is that the knife tool currently

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.689 
to note is that the knife tool currently
is<00:05:17.940> more<00:05:18.780> accurate<00:05:19.379> and<00:05:19.469> more<00:05:19.919> consistent

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
is more accurate and more consistent

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.939 
is more accurate and more consistent
when<00:05:21.120> in<00:05:21.389> perspective<00:05:22.110> mode<00:05:22.319> than<00:05:22.710> in

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
when in perspective mode than in

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.540 
when in perspective mode than in
orthographic<00:05:23.550> mode<00:05:24.500> generally<00:05:25.550> orthographic

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
orthographic mode generally orthographic

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.209 
orthographic mode generally orthographic
mode<00:05:26.580> works<00:05:27.060> quite<00:05:27.330> well<00:05:27.360> but<00:05:28.259> doing<00:05:29.039> it<00:05:29.129> in

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:29.219 
mode works quite well but doing it in

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:31.490 
mode works quite well but doing it in
perspective<00:05:29.789> mode<00:05:29.819> will<00:05:30.569> give<00:05:30.870> you<00:05:31.050> more

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
perspective mode will give you more

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.559 
perspective mode will give you more
consistent<00:05:32.009> behavior<00:05:32.520> if<00:05:32.969> you<00:05:33.389> are

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
consistent behavior if you are

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.899 
consistent behavior if you are
experiencing<00:05:34.169> problems<00:05:34.310> so<00:05:35.310> then<00:05:35.729> I<00:05:35.759> could

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
experiencing problems so then I could

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.700 
experiencing problems so then I could
just<00:05:36.150> go<00:05:36.300> in<00:05:36.419> real<00:05:36.599> quick<00:05:36.779> one<00:05:37.440> of<00:05:37.500> the<00:05:37.590> other

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
just go in real quick one of the other

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.719 
just go in real quick one of the other
cool<00:05:37.830> things<00:05:38.009> with<00:05:38.130> a<00:05:38.190> knife<00:05:38.310> tool<00:05:38.520> is<00:05:38.699> that

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
cool things with a knife tool is that

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.180 
cool things with a knife tool is that
you<00:05:38.880> can<00:05:38.969> really<00:05:39.330> cut<00:05:39.990> through<00:05:40.020> anywhere<00:05:40.860> so

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
you can really cut through anywhere so

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.040 
you can really cut through anywhere so
for<00:05:41.430> example<00:05:41.699> if<00:05:41.759> I<00:05:41.819> want<00:05:41.969> to<00:05:42.000> just<00:05:42.180> add<00:05:42.330> in<00:05:42.599> say

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
for example if I want to just add in say

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.589 
for example if I want to just add in say
like<00:05:43.259> a<00:05:43.289> detail<00:05:43.740> loop<00:05:43.979> around<00:05:44.639> this<00:05:45.120> I<00:05:45.360> can

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
like a detail loop around this I can

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.459 
like a detail loop around this I can
just<00:05:45.800> do<00:05:46.800> something<00:05:47.099> like<00:05:47.250> this<00:05:48.319> start<00:05:49.319> a<00:05:49.349> new

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
just do something like this start a new

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:53.719 
just do something like this start a new
cut<00:05:49.680> with<00:05:49.800> e<00:05:50.659> cut<00:05:51.659> through<00:05:52.130> cut<00:05:53.130> through<00:05:53.460> and

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
cut with e cut through cut through and

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.809 
cut with e cut through cut through and
hit<00:05:54.690> enter<00:05:55.020> and<00:05:55.199> there<00:05:56.009> we<00:05:56.129> go

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
hit enter and there we go

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.029 
hit enter and there we go
you<00:05:57.120> can<00:05:57.270> also<00:05:57.389> even<00:05:57.779> just<00:05:58.110> cut<00:05:58.319> directly<00:05:58.830> in

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
you can also even just cut directly in

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.459 
you can also even just cut directly in
the<00:05:59.129> center<00:05:59.370> of<00:05:59.430> a<00:05:59.490> face<00:05:59.699> so<00:06:00.360> let's<00:06:00.900> just<00:06:01.289> do

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469 
the center of a face so let's just do

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.879 
the center of a face so let's just do
this

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
this

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.629 
this
I'm<00:06:02.789> just<00:06:03.060> cut<00:06:03.300> around<00:06:03.919> just<00:06:04.919> like<00:06:05.069> that<00:06:05.250> hit

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
I'm just cut around just like that hit

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.519 
I'm just cut around just like that hit
enter<00:06:05.909> and<00:06:06.060> you'll<00:06:06.810> notice<00:06:07.020> in<00:06:07.110> this<00:06:07.169> case<00:06:07.229> is

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:07.529 
enter and you'll notice in this case is

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:08.990 
enter and you'll notice in this case is
automatically<00:06:07.919> added<00:06:08.129> two<00:06:08.520> lines<00:06:08.759> here

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
automatically added two lines here

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.930 
automatically added two lines here
because<00:06:09.360> B<00:06:09.599> mesh<00:06:09.810> does<00:06:10.110> not<00:06:10.349> support<00:06:10.860> holes<00:06:11.580> in

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
because B mesh does not support holes in

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.019 
because B mesh does not support holes in
the<00:06:12.360> center<00:06:12.840> of<00:06:12.870> faces<00:06:13.440> and<00:06:14.279> so<00:06:14.550> you<00:06:14.610> have<00:06:14.879> to

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
the center of faces and so you have to

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.420 
the center of faces and so you have to
have<00:06:15.180> at<00:06:15.300> least<00:06:15.330> one<00:06:15.930> edge<00:06:16.169> breaking<00:06:16.830> up<00:06:17.069> that

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
have at least one edge breaking up that

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.240 
have at least one edge breaking up that
complete<00:06:17.789> hole<00:06:18.029> but<00:06:18.690> then<00:06:18.930> we<00:06:19.139> can<00:06:19.289> just<00:06:19.529> you

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
complete hole but then we can just you

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.980 
complete hole but then we can just you
know<00:06:20.340> we<00:06:20.460> can<00:06:20.580> really<00:06:20.759> make<00:06:20.940> this<00:06:21.150> as<00:06:21.389> concise

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
know we can really make this as concise

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.790 
know we can really make this as concise
or<00:06:22.370> whatever<00:06:23.370> we<00:06:23.550> want<00:06:23.669> we<00:06:24.479> can<00:06:24.629> use<00:06:24.870> our<00:06:25.169> new

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
or whatever we want we can use our new

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.309 
or whatever we want we can use our new
cut<00:06:26.099> points<00:06:26.490> as<00:06:26.610> even<00:06:27.389> snap<00:06:27.659> points<00:06:27.990> like<00:06:28.110> this

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 
cut points as even snap points like this

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.249 
cut points as even snap points like this
so<00:06:28.889> I<00:06:28.919> can<00:06:29.099> make<00:06:29.219> a<00:06:29.250> real<00:06:29.520> horrendous<00:06:30.300> mesh

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
so I can make a real horrendous mesh

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.369 
so I can make a real horrendous mesh
very<00:06:31.590> quickly<00:06:32.060> there<00:06:33.060> we<00:06:33.150> go<00:06:33.240> no<00:06:34.050> idea<00:06:34.259> what

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
very quickly there we go no idea what

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:36.290 
very quickly there we go no idea what
that<00:06:34.409> is<00:06:34.650> but<00:06:35.039> it's<00:06:35.639> cool<00:06:35.789> because<00:06:35.940> it<00:06:36.149> does

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
that is but it's cool because it does

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.120 
that is but it's cool because it does
show<00:06:36.539> a<00:06:36.570> little<00:06:36.810> bit<00:06:36.960> of<00:06:37.020> the<00:06:37.139> power<00:06:37.349> of<00:06:37.680> the

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
show a little bit of the power of the

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.230 
show a little bit of the power of the
knife<00:06:38.279> tool<00:06:38.460> where<00:06:38.669> now<00:06:38.789> you<00:06:38.849> know<00:06:39.029> I've<00:06:39.120> just

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
knife tool where now you know I've just

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.879 
knife tool where now you know I've just
got<00:06:39.389> several<00:06:39.659> several<00:06:40.229> different<00:06:40.469> faces<00:06:40.740> in

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
got several several different faces in

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:41.300 
got several several different faces in
here<00:06:41.099> that

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
here that

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.940 
here that
can<00:06:41.430> work<00:06:41.580> with<00:06:41.900> to<00:06:42.900> make<00:06:43.110> whatever<00:06:43.620> I<00:06:43.680> want<00:06:43.890> so

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
can work with to make whatever I want so

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.710 
can work with to make whatever I want so
this<00:06:44.130> is<00:06:44.310> also<00:06:44.490> very<00:06:44.910> handy<00:06:45.060> if<00:06:45.240> you<00:06:45.360> wanted<00:06:45.570> to

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
this is also very handy if you wanted to

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.680 
this is also very handy if you wanted to
say<00:06:46.050> break<00:06:46.920> up<00:06:47.130> a<00:06:47.250> face<00:06:47.460> very<00:06:47.730> quickly<00:06:48.090> for

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
say break up a face very quickly for

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.750 
say break up a face very quickly for
destruction<00:06:49.470> or<00:06:49.590> something<00:06:49.890> you<00:06:50.310> can<00:06:50.460> just<00:06:50.490> go

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
destruction or something you can just go

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.360 
destruction or something you can just go
in<00:06:51.020> quickly<00:06:52.020> cut<00:06:52.260> some<00:06:52.560> kind<00:06:52.860> of<00:06:52.980> jagged

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
in quickly cut some kind of jagged

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.850 
in quickly cut some kind of jagged
angles<00:06:54.060> or<00:06:54.240> whatever<00:06:54.510> and<00:06:54.780> maybe<00:06:55.650> we'll<00:06:55.770> do

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
angles or whatever and maybe we'll do

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.800 
angles or whatever and maybe we'll do
something<00:06:56.100> like<00:06:56.190> that<00:06:56.250> and<00:06:56.760> then<00:06:57.240> maybe<00:06:57.630> I'll

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
something like that and then maybe I'll

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.490 
something like that and then maybe I'll
break<00:06:58.020> this<00:06:58.230> one<00:06:58.440> up<00:06:58.590> a<00:06:58.860> bit<00:06:59.040> more<00:06:59.400> and<00:06:59.670> then

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
break this one up a bit more and then

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.710 
break this one up a bit more and then
this<00:07:01.500> one<00:07:01.740> maybe<00:07:02.700> this<00:07:02.940> one<00:07:03.090> as<00:07:03.180> well<00:07:03.300> so<00:07:03.450> here

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
this one maybe this one as well so here

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.030 
this one maybe this one as well so here
I'm<00:07:03.810> just<00:07:03.840> placing<00:07:04.350> my<00:07:04.590> cuts<00:07:04.800> and<00:07:04.950> then

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
I'm just placing my cuts and then

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.340 
I'm just placing my cuts and then
hitting<00:07:05.280> e<00:07:05.550> to<00:07:05.880> start<00:07:06.180> a<00:07:06.330> new<00:07:06.480> one<00:07:07.670> do<00:07:08.670> that<00:07:08.730> and

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:09.350 
hitting e to start a new one do that and

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.510 
hitting e to start a new one do that and
then<00:07:10.350> that<00:07:11.130> and<00:07:11.810> finally<00:07:12.810> we'll<00:07:13.080> do<00:07:13.520> something

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
then that and finally we'll do something

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.550 
then that and finally we'll do something
like<00:07:14.640> that<00:07:14.880> hit<00:07:15.360> enter<00:07:15.660> then<00:07:16.170> I<00:07:16.230> have<00:07:16.380> all

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 
like that hit enter then I have all

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.160 
like that hit enter then I have all
these<00:07:16.830> nice<00:07:17.250> cracks<00:07:17.820> here<00:07:18.150> where<00:07:18.720> I<00:07:18.750> could<00:07:19.050> go

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.170 
these nice cracks here where I could go

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.340 
these nice cracks here where I could go
ahead<00:07:19.320> and<00:07:19.500> maybe<00:07:20.370> just<00:07:20.670> extrude<00:07:21.300> each<00:07:21.870> one<00:07:22.230> of

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
ahead and maybe just extrude each one of

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.480 
ahead and maybe just extrude each one of
these<00:07:22.500> individually<00:07:24.200> so<00:07:25.200> if<00:07:25.320> I<00:07:25.530> do<00:07:25.590> shift<00:07:26.130> or

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:26.490 
these individually so if I do shift or

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.140 
these individually so if I do shift or
alt<00:07:26.820> e<00:07:27.620> extrude<00:07:28.620> individual<00:07:29.240> take<00:07:30.240> these<00:07:30.450> out

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.150 
alt e extrude individual take these out

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.520 
alt e extrude individual take these out
maybe<00:07:33.150> I'll<00:07:33.300> even<00:07:33.420> just<00:07:33.720> hit<00:07:33.840> P<00:07:34.020> to<00:07:34.170> separate

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:34.530 
maybe I'll even just hit P to separate

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.130 
maybe I'll even just hit P to separate
those<00:07:34.650> and<00:07:35.060> then<00:07:36.060> I<00:07:36.150> have<00:07:36.390> all<00:07:36.600> of<00:07:36.660> these

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:37.140 
those and then I have all of these

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.410 
those and then I have all of these
individual<00:07:37.770> faces<00:07:38.250> that<00:07:38.970> I<00:07:39.030> could<00:07:39.390> very

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:39.420 
individual faces that I could very

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.440 
individual faces that I could very
easily<00:07:39.750> create<00:07:40.560> little<00:07:41.490> broken<00:07:41.760> shards<00:07:42.270> with

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:42.450 
easily create little broken shards with

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.110 
easily create little broken shards with
without<00:07:43.380> much<00:07:43.830> trouble<00:07:44.280> so<00:07:44.430> there's<00:07:44.790> you<00:07:45.090> know

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 
without much trouble so there's you know

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.280 
without much trouble so there's you know
there's<00:07:45.480> a<00:07:45.540> lot<00:07:45.720> of<00:07:45.810> different<00:07:46.050> things<00:07:46.140> you

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.290 
there's a lot of different things you

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.980 
there's a lot of different things you
can<00:07:46.410> use<00:07:46.440> the<00:07:46.650> knife<00:07:46.770> tool<00:07:47.010> for<00:07:47.310> I<00:07:47.760> works<00:07:48.240> quite

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:48.990 
can use the knife tool for I works quite

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.960 
can use the knife tool for I works quite
well<00:07:49.020> it's<00:07:49.500> really<00:07:49.890> it<00:07:50.490> used<00:07:50.730> to<00:07:50.850> be<00:07:50.940> very

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:50.970 
well it's really it used to be very

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.570 
well it's really it used to be very
buggy<00:07:51.390> but<00:07:51.870> anymore<00:07:52.290> it<00:07:52.500> works<00:07:52.680> pretty<00:07:53.460> darn

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.580 
buggy but anymore it works pretty darn

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.420 
buggy but anymore it works pretty darn
well<00:07:53.970> and<00:07:54.270> it<00:07:55.020> can<00:07:55.200> give<00:07:55.380> you<00:07:55.500> very<00:07:55.770> quick<00:07:56.190> and

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:01.470 
I encourage you to play around with it

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.580 
I encourage you to play around with it
it<00:08:02.430> can<00:08:02.820> really<00:08:03.120> speed<00:08:03.870> up<00:08:03.990> your<00:08:04.080> workflow<00:08:04.260> and

is<00:08:04.650> really<00:08:04.890> good<00:08:05.160> when<00:08:05.370> you're<00:08:05.490> working<00:08:05.790> on

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:05.910 
is really good when you're working on

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.550 
is really good when you're working on
complex<00:08:06.240> topology<00:08:06.990> particularly<00:08:07.470> on

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 
complex topology particularly on

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.440 
complex topology particularly on
characters<00:08:07.980> or<00:08:08.190> something<00:08:08.280> like<00:08:08.520> that<00:08:08.580> just

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:09.450 
characters or something like that just

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.080 
characters or something like that just
to<00:08:10.050> really<00:08:10.680> focus<00:08:10.830> in<00:08:11.130> draw<00:08:11.580> out<00:08:11.730> the<00:08:11.850> topology

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.090 
to really focus in draw out the topology

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.210 
to really focus in draw out the topology
how<00:08:12.360> you<00:08:12.420> want<00:08:12.630> just<00:08:13.200> hit<00:08:13.350> enter<00:08:13.650> and<00:08:13.830> you're

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 
how you want just hit enter and you're

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.370 
how you want just hit enter and you're
done
