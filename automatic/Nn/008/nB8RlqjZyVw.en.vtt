occultist I would say there it showed a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.049 
occultist I would say there it showed a
lot<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.279> knowledge<00:00:29.519> lot<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.539> knowledge<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
lot of knowledge lot of knowledge and

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.340 
lot of knowledge lot of knowledge and
she<00:00:33.059> talked<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.450> us<00:00:33.540> about<00:00:33.600> stripping<00:00:34.140> her

hores and fluffing our doors and since

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840 
hores and fluffing our doors and since
then<00:00:37.410> I've<00:00:37.649> learned<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.129> they<00:00:38.280> also<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.700> this

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
then I've learned that they also do this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.690 
then I've learned that they also do this
in<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> Kahuna<00:00:39.629> tradition<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:41.190> Hawaiian

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
in the Kahuna tradition the Hawaiian

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.030 
in the Kahuna tradition the Hawaiian
history<00:00:42.030> tradition<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:43.800> where

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
history tradition but this is not where

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.500 
history tradition but this is not where
I<00:00:44.070> learned<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.640> from<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:45.090> learned<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.480> from

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
I learned it from I learned it from

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.709 
I learned it from I learned it from
heroin<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:47.870> what<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.020> learned<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:50.719> it's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
heroin and what we learned is that it's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.139 
heroin and what we learned is that it's
good<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.020> periodically<00:00:52.980> strip<00:00:53.430> your<00:00:53.579> or<00:00:53.789> down

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
good to periodically strip your or down

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.000 
good to periodically strip your or down
and<00:00:54.510> rebuilt<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.379> easy<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.770> do

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and rebuilt and it's really easy to do

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.549 
and rebuilt and it's really easy to do
especially<00:00:59.039> using<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.239> processes<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.320> talked

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
especially using the processes I talked

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.349 
especially using the processes I talked
about<00:01:01.649> earlier<00:01:01.800> using<00:01:02.460> intention<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
about earlier using intention and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.870 
about earlier using intention and
visualization<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:05.010> also<00:01:05.159> calling<00:01:05.549> upon

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
visualization and then also calling upon

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.100 
visualization and then also calling upon
your<00:01:06.030> guides<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.330> physical<00:01:09.750> motions

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
your guides and the the physical motions

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.359 
your guides and the the physical motions
let's<00:01:10.260> talk<00:01:10.380> about<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> physical<00:01:11.010> emotions

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
let's talk about the physical emotions

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.310 
let's talk about the physical emotions
involved<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> would<00:01:12.479> do<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.900> strip<00:01:13.140> my

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
involved so what I would do to strip my

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.380 
involved so what I would do to strip my
own<00:01:13.439> aura<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.400> strip<00:01:14.610> another<00:01:14.850> person's<00:01:15.240> or

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
own aura or to strip another person's or

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.410 
own aura or to strip another person's or
so<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> would<00:01:16.409> probably<00:01:16.790> start<00:01:17.790> near<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> top

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
so I would probably start near the top

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.590 
so I would probably start near the top
with<00:01:18.689> my<00:01:18.869> palms<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:20.060> at<00:01:21.060> least<00:01:21.180> that's<00:01:21.390> how<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
with my palms down at least that's how I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.969 
with my palms down at least that's how I
was<00:01:21.810> taught<00:01:22.080> now<00:01:22.350> if<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.560> feels<00:01:22.770> more

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
was taught now if it feels more

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.560 
was taught now if it feels more
intuitive<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> flip<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> palms<00:01:24.330> up

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
intuitive for you to flip the palms up

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.660 
intuitive for you to flip the palms up
you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.280> however<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.549> you'll

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
you can do that however I think you'll

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.330 
you can do that however I think you'll
feel<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> fills<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.570> adapt<00:01:27.900> palms<00:01:28.290> down<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
feel it fills in to adapt palms down and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.370 
feel it fills in to adapt palms down and
i'm<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.670> start<00:01:29.880> over<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.900> head<00:01:31.140> way<00:01:31.350> up

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
i'm going to start over my head way up

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.490 
i'm going to start over my head way up
high<00:01:32.150> some<00:01:33.150> people<00:01:33.420> will<00:01:33.479> start<00:01:33.750> closer<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
high some people will start closer to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.539 
high some people will start closer to
the<00:01:34.619> crown<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:36.270> I'm<00:01:36.420> about<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.340> don't<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the crown but I'm about I don't know a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.010 
the crown but I'm about I don't know a
couple<00:01:38.759> feet<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.479> because<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.960> is

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
couple feet out here because this is

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.399 
couple feet out here because this is
where<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.590> crown<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.189> okay<00:01:41.700> my<00:01:42.630> crown<00:01:42.899> chakra

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
where my crown is okay my crown chakra

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.250 
where my crown is okay my crown chakra
is<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.710> only

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
is not only

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.130 
is not only
it's<00:01:45.070> very<00:01:45.310> open<00:01:45.550> so<00:01:46.510> it's<00:01:46.630> up<00:01:46.780> here<00:01:46.960> our

footer if I had longer hours I probably

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.640 
footer if I had longer hours I probably
even<00:01:49.120> go<00:01:49.300> further<00:01:49.510> but<00:01:49.810> this<00:01:49.960> is<00:01:50.110> all<00:01:50.260> that<00:01:50.290> I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
even go further but this is all that I

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.490 
even go further but this is all that I
can<00:01:50.710> really<00:01:51.010> go<00:01:51.160> comfortably<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:53.200> I'm<00:01:53.350> going

can really go comfortably and I'm going
to<00:01:53.560> start<00:01:54.300> working<00:01:55.300> it<00:01:55.630> down<00:01:55.900> I'm<00:01:56.170> going<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.380> do

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.110 
to start working it down I'm going to do
the<00:01:56.620> slow<00:01:56.920> at<00:01:57.070> first<00:01:57.100> because<00:01:57.520> i<00:01:57.730> want<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.030> to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
the slow at first because i want you to

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.110 
the slow at first because i want you to
see<00:01:58.360> but<00:01:58.540> you<00:01:58.570> would<00:01:58.750> actually<00:01:58.930> do<00:01:59.260> it<00:01:59.410> faster

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
see but you would actually do it faster

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.280 
see but you would actually do it faster
I'm<00:02:01.120> going<00:02:01.300> to<00:02:01.390> start<00:02:01.600> working<00:02:01.750> down<00:02:02.110> the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
I'm going to start working down the

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.280 
I'm going to start working down the
energy<00:02:02.710> palms<00:02:03.670> flat<00:02:03.940> see<00:02:04.360> how<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:04.540> palms<00:02:04.870> are

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
energy palms flat see how the palms are

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.969 
energy palms flat see how the palms are
flat<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.980> i'm<00:02:06.970> working<00:02:07.480> in<00:02:07.660> front<00:02:08.380> but<00:02:08.830> you

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
flat and i'm working in front but you

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.370 
flat and i'm working in front but you
can<00:02:09.130> also<00:02:09.250> work<00:02:09.520> inside<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:11.140> you're<00:02:11.290> not

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
can also work inside and you're not

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.020 
can also work inside and you're not
giving<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.740> for<00:02:11.950> myself<00:02:12.100> it's<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.730> unkind

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
giving this for myself it's the unkind

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.660 
giving this for myself it's the unkind
almost<00:02:14.020> doing<00:02:14.290> chicken<00:02:14.650> arms<00:02:14.920> pushing<00:02:15.460> it

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
almost doing chicken arms pushing it

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.510 
almost doing chicken arms pushing it
down<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.740> then<00:02:17.800> i<00:02:17.920> would<00:02:18.100> go<00:02:18.130> down<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:20.520> try

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
down and then i would go down and try

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.620 
down and then i would go down and try
not<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.790> drop<00:02:21.970> on<00:02:22.150> my<00:02:22.240> microphones<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:25.270> push

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
not to drop on my microphones and push

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.810 
not to drop on my microphones and push
it<00:02:25.810> down<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.530> push<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.920> down<00:02:27.160> towards<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
it down and push it down towards the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.620 
it down and push it down towards the
floor<00:02:27.940> I'm<00:02:28.360> just<00:02:28.570> taking<00:02:28.990> it<00:02:29.050> apart<00:02:30.510> now<00:02:31.510> in

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
floor I'm just taking it apart now in

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.540 
floor I'm just taking it apart now in
real<00:02:31.930> time<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.410> could<00:02:32.590> do<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.800> much<00:02:32.920> faster<00:02:32.950> and

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
real time I could do it much faster and

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.490 
real time I could do it much faster and
I<00:02:33.790> would<00:02:34.030> breathe<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.570> exhale<00:02:35.020> walk<00:02:35.260> when<00:02:35.440> I

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
I would breathe and exhale walk when I

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.130 
I would breathe and exhale walk when I
did<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.100> I<00:02:36.340> could<00:02:36.459> something<00:02:36.790> like<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:43.140> now

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
did it so I could something like and now

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.960 
did it so I could something like and now
I'm<00:02:44.590> going<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:44.830> add<00:02:44.950> visualizations<00:02:45.520> I'm

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
I'm going to add visualizations I'm

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.300 
I'm going to add visualizations I'm
singing<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.510> my<00:02:46.660> mind<00:02:46.930> as<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.440> do<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.800> that's

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
singing in my mind as I do it that's

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.070 
singing in my mind as I do it that's
just<00:02:48.520> being<00:02:48.760> totally<00:02:49.180> stripped<00:02:49.420> clean<00:02:49.750> and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
just being totally stripped clean and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.080 
just being totally stripped clean and
clear<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:53.530> can<00:02:53.709> probably<00:02:53.950> feel<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.700> energy

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
clear you can probably feel the energy

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.199 
clear you can probably feel the energy
as<00:02:55.239> i'm<00:02:55.390> doing<00:02:55.540> this<00:02:55.840> shifting<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.910> can't

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
as i'm doing this shifting you can't

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.730 
as i'm doing this shifting you can't
wake<00:02:58.510> up

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.740 

so<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.240> straight<00:03:06.570> part<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:09.570> there

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
so this is the straight part and there

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.620 
so this is the straight part and there
are<00:03:09.840> traditions<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.650> teach<00:03:10.890> theft<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:12.510> they

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
are traditions that teach theft and they

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.820 
are traditions that teach theft and they
don't<00:03:12.810> teach<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.140> other<00:03:13.260> part<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.740> always

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
don't teach the other part that always

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.490 
don't teach the other part that always
perplexes<00:03:14.700> me<00:03:14.700> because<00:03:15.210> you<00:03:15.840> just<00:03:16.020> rip<00:03:16.290> your

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
perplexes me because you just rip your

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.680 
perplexes me because you just rip your
aura<00:03:16.740> and<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.100> need<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> vacuum<00:03:17.640> well<00:03:18.330> nature

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
aura and you need a vacuum well nature

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.680 
aura and you need a vacuum well nature
abhors<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:19.080> vacuum<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.700> whatever's<00:03:21.510> out<00:03:21.630> there

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
abhors a vacuum so whatever's out there

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.270 
abhors a vacuum so whatever's out there
could<00:03:22.050> just<00:03:22.080> come<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.890> we<00:03:22.980> don't<00:03:23.100> want<00:03:23.160> to

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
could just come in so we don't want to

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.660 
could just come in so we don't want to
do<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.880> right<00:03:24.920> so<00:03:25.920> then<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.160> begin<00:03:26.460> to

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
do just that right so then I begin to

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.930 
do just that right so then I begin to
rebuild<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.300> or<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.890> for<00:03:29.160> me<00:03:29.280> personally<00:03:29.490> I

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
rebuild the or and for me personally I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.760 
rebuild the or and for me personally I
start<00:03:30.450> from<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.840> feet<00:03:31.020> up<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.410> might<00:03:31.560> be

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
start from the feet up it might be

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.380 
start from the feet up it might be
easier<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.190> do<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.550> if<00:03:32.700> you're<00:03:32.820> sitting<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.330> know

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
easier to do it if you're sitting I know

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.320 
easier to do it if you're sitting I know
I'm<00:03:33.630> standing<00:03:34.080> as<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.320> do<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:34.710> you<00:03:34.740> might

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
I'm standing as I do it so you might

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.120 
I'm standing as I do it so you might
want<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.360> work<00:03:36.540> sitting<00:03:37.140> down<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.710> you<00:03:37.890> can<00:03:38.040> do

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
want to work sitting down to you can do

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.770 
want to work sitting down to you can do
that<00:03:38.280> as<00:03:38.460> well<00:03:38.490> for<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> rebuilding<00:03:39.390> because

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
that as well for the rebuilding because

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.780 
that as well for the rebuilding because
it'll<00:03:39.960> make<00:03:39.990> it<00:03:40.230> easier<00:03:40.320> for<00:03:40.710> me<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.830> preach

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
it'll make it easier for me to preach

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.780 
it'll make it easier for me to preach
I'm<00:03:42.690> going<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.900> come<00:03:43.050> back<00:03:43.080> out<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.790> standing

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
I'm going to come back out and standing

moving my hands up words notice the
palms<00:03:53.670> are<00:03:53.940> different<00:03:54.330> now<00:03:54.590> palms<00:03:55.590> are<00:03:55.800> now<00:03:55.980> up

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
palms are different now palms are now up

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.280 
palms are different now palms are now up
you'll<00:03:57.210> be<00:03:57.270> able<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.540> see<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.750> as<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:57.930> move<00:03:58.110> it

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
you'll be able to see it as I move it

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.800 
you'll be able to see it as I move it
and<00:03:58.500> I'm<00:03:59.010> doing<00:03:59.250> gentle<00:03:59.610> strokes<00:04:00.000> almost<00:04:00.660> like

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
I'm imagining the light coming in on

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.590 
I'm imagining the light coming in on
pulling<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.420> light<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.870> it's<00:04:07.470> like<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.710> dance

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
pulling the light in it's like a dance

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.990 
pulling the light in it's like a dance
pulling<00:04:09.600> in<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.840> light<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:10.760> see<00:04:11.760> that

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
pulling in the light you see that

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.150 
pulling in the light you see that
pulling<00:04:12.510> in<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.720> light<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.320> then<00:04:13.800> uh<00:04:13.890> put<00:04:14.070> my

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
pulling in the light and then uh put my

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:24.000 
pulling in the light and then uh put my
breath<00:04:14.400> into<00:04:14.610> it<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:19.700> pointed<00:04:20.700> up<00:04:20.820> my<00:04:20.970> own<00:04:21.120> back
