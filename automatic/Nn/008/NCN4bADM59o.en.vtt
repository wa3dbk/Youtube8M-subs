00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.429

 for the one who did not like it and 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.650
 teaching a little bit for which I'm going to 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.650
 show you a couple of little things 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.350
 the first one is that it is adding companions 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.240
 and you can distribute them as you want to 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.240
 that they catch chub in the combats those that 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.970
 you choose what you put there in front and plate 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.769
 plate first the seconds that always 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.480
 you will have naruto and zas that here 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.660
 juntitos so that later you do speaking 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.850
 with them and thinking about your friends 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.660
 if you know what it is to see man 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.240
 you will no longer have to be 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.820
 the third thing is that you can equip yourself 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.290
 and your followers and available from many 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.900
 different places to eat the coconut 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.430
 trying to know what the rooms do 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.900
 who give you initial gifts and 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.700
 then for the activity that you demonstrate 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.130
 watching the game as you notice that 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.170
 they need a little hook 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.610
 and also tell you that there are many 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.830
 combats of options to which he has not 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.510
 accessed by my dissolution 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.780
 handling the fighting honestly 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.390
 they can not do anything 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.230
 and well I will spend now the battles 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.030
 prettiest 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.500
 that the ones that you contrast in the first 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.349
 phase of the game was not worth much 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.040
 but already reaching level 10 they were 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.049
 coolies we were like a little historical what 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.420
 that more than the level 10 we are going to 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.890
 put like that explained a little bit 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.230
 discover it for yourselves suns 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.970
 and if we liked the video game 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.230
 they are to blame so that of islay that 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.230
 you keep it for your whore 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.890

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.900
 so is 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.140
 yes 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:19.069
 before finishing so that we go 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:22.669
 updated with the naruto manga 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.669
