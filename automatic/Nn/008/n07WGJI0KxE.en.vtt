00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 very good girl how are you 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.029
 we are in a new fifa 15 video and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.340
 I wanted to show you a little trick that 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.790
 I discovered in the skill challenge of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.769
 advanced defense I will explain it with 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.719
 you know in this challenge what 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.490
 it's about defending all the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.820
 possible moves and to reach the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.500
 10,000 points probably all the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.199
 actions in which you have to defend there 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.359
 to complete them successfully what is the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.150
 problem that if for example we 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.730
 we play with real madrid we always go 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.010
 to play against players of the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.719
 barcelona in this case in clear or something 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.989
 of players from barcelona is to play 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.690
 against messi neymar luís suárez 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.020
 Iniesta authentic phenomena with the ball 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.660
 even harder still then like 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.660
 we can do 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.120
 to play against defense then we go on 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.130
 this case play against attackers 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.809
 pretty bad having defenses 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.810
 great is very simple we are going to go to 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.870
 game system 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.570
 here in edit teams and we're going to go to 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.590
 Bar to Barcelona 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.600
 very well 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.850
 let's change all these players 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.100
 and how are we going to change it? 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.619
 simple let's take neymar and what 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.630
 let's replace for example by pérez 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:27.619
 3 of gates by the goalkeeper mamés and what 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.649
 let's replace with massive that is the 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.390
 Goalkeeper from the goalkeeper and Claudio 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:38.350
 recorded we are going to change it by Luis Suarez 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.440
 simple we can not also if we want 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.940
 take out a central office that has a 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.810
 little contact with the ball as 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.780
 they can be vermaelen or bartra 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.700
 but I think it's fine now 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.820
 as it is then 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.380
 we keep the changes, we are already in 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.329
 the challenge 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.159
 we select a pantry in this case 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.780
 let's take sergio bouquets 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.850
 probably the best central 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.850
 game and you'll see 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.800
 as you can see more if he is attacking us 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.190
 and the next partner is the other 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.770
 goalkeeper that we have put is not about 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.140
 here the video for I will show you how 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.060
 complete the challenge is simply to 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.250
 it's about a kind of trick that 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.980
 I discovered with which I was able to complete the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.990
 challenge in a much more way 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.090
 satisfactory also pepe and sergio bouquets 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.700
 in this case they are pretty fast 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.410
 they have the ability to enter then 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.050
 at the time of using the square button 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.790
 it works very well and especially the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.410
 fundamentals that I'm playing against 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.780
 players 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.370
 does not have the ball stuck to the foot is a lot 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.470
 easier to steal the ball since we 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.010
 they can make a dribble in the last 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.010
 moment and the most normal thing is that their 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.920
 shots to the door go away no 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.830
 have good aim then it's a 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.450
 pretty interesting option if you like 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.080
 this to complete the challenges of 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.640
 skill and have them all 100% like that 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.390
 that nothing I hope you liked this 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.000
