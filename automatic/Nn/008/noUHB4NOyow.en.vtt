you do this and find out what hardware

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.330 
you do this and find out what hardware
you<00:02:26.050> got<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.410> you've<00:02:26.530> got<00:02:26.560> your<00:02:26.650> patches<00:02:26.950> and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
you got so you've got your patches and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.820 
you got so you've got your patches and
stuff<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:27.850> here<00:02:28.300> custom<00:02:29.290> candles<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.770> stuff

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
stuff like here custom candles and stuff

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.810 
stuff like here custom candles and stuff
I'm<00:02:30.100> going<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.370> leave<00:02:30.520> that<00:02:30.550> as<00:02:30.820> is<00:02:32.250> yeah<00:02:33.250> i'm

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
I'm going to leave that as is yeah i'm

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.760 
I'm going to leave that as is yeah i'm
just<00:02:34.000> going<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.180> leave<00:02:34.360> all<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:35.410> stuff

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
just going to leave all that that stuff

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.880 
just going to leave all that that stuff
and<00:02:36.130> go<00:02:36.370> down<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:38.610> drivers<00:02:39.610> at<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.850> bottom<00:02:40.890> mmm

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
and go down to drivers at the bottom mmm

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.140 
and go down to drivers at the bottom mmm
it's<00:02:42.880> going<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.090> come<00:02:43.150> up<00:02:43.270> with<00:02:43.300> main<00:02:43.630> hardware

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
it's going to come up with main hardware

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.060 
it's going to come up with main hardware
so<00:02:46.150> overlooked<00:02:46.480> what<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.110> sound<00:02:47.500> these<00:02:47.830> side

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
so overlooked what is I sound these side

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.990 
so overlooked what is I sound these side
drivers<00:02:49.800> for<00:02:50.800> sound<00:02:51.130> I'm<00:02:51.430> going<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.640> go<00:02:51.760> for

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
drivers for sound I'm going to go for

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.560 
drivers for sound I'm going to go for
the<00:02:52.030> video<00:02:54.360> blog<00:02:55.360> over<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.690> latest<00:02:55.990> one<00:02:58.620> USB

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
the video blog over the latest one USB

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:10.230 
the video blog over the latest one USB
USB<00:03:01.680> got<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.710> free<00:03:02.890> point<00:03:03.130> l<00:03:07.140> think<00:03:09.060> some<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.090> it

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
USB got a free point l think some of it

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.700 
USB got a free point l think some of it
could<00:03:10.390> be<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.750> hit<00:03:10.930> our<00:03:10.960> gas<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.590> know

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
could be just to hit our gas you know

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.290 
could be just to hit our gas you know
you<00:03:11.770> just<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.280> play<00:03:12.490> bandwidth<00:03:12.910> if<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.120> don't

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
you just you play bandwidth if you don't

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.190 
you just you play bandwidth if you don't
work<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.480> try<00:03:13.750> again<00:03:14.050> with<00:03:14.140> different

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
work you try again with different

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.340 
work you try again with different
hardware<00:03:14.800> like<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:16.420> not<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.600> lot<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:16.960> soft<00:03:17.290> so

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
hardware like it's not a lot so soft so

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.040 
hardware like it's not a lot so soft so
then<00:03:17.500> we're<00:03:17.620> going<00:03:17.710> to<00:03:17.770> use<00:03:17.890> lots<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.160> battery

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.699 

the<00:03:23.050> motherboard<00:03:23.680> hardware<00:03:26.160> cpu<00:03:28.260> for<00:03:29.260> vga

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
the motherboard hardware cpu for vga

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:39.630 
the motherboard hardware cpu for vga
we're<00:03:29.890> going<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.130> use<00:03:32.130> nothing

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.890 

the<00:03:40.360> video<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:42.010> in<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.400> video<00:03:42.520> cpu<00:03:43.240> only<00:03:43.690> click

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
the video is in the video cpu only click

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.570 
the video is in the video cpu only click
one<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.110> each<00:03:44.319> driver<00:03:44.709> by<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.010> way<00:03:45.190> because

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
one of each driver by the way because

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.330 
one of each driver by the way because
that<00:03:46.240> can<00:03:46.360> also<00:03:46.510> cause<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.840> kernel<00:03:47.260> panic<00:03:47.340> for

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
that can also cause a kernel panic for

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.340 
that can also cause a kernel panic for
wired<00:03:48.610> for<00:03:49.180> this<00:03:49.270> for<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.510> ethernet<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.230> we're

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
wired for this for the ethernet so we're

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:58.949 
wired for this for the ethernet so we're
going<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.560> choose<00:03:50.740> the<00:03:53.940> realtek<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.780> can

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
going to choose the realtek and you can

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.600 
going to choose the realtek and you can
use<00:03:59.080> others<00:03:59.410> model<00:04:00.070> more<00:04:00.220> for<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.430> wireless

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
use others model more for the wireless

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.280 
use others model more for the wireless
as<00:04:01.000> well<00:04:01.150> so<00:04:01.480> for<00:04:01.630> the<00:04:01.690> wireless<00:04:01.840> i'm<00:04:02.170> just

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
as well so for the wireless i'm just

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.110 
as well so for the wireless i'm just
going<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.440> use<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:03.550> don't<00:04:03.670> actually<00:04:04.030> know

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
going to use it don't actually know

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.280 
going to use it don't actually know
Taylor<00:04:04.420> back<00:04:04.600> i'm<00:04:04.780> not<00:04:04.870> going<00:04:04.990> to<00:04:05.020> use<00:04:05.170> the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
Taylor back i'm not going to use the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.770 
Taylor back i'm not going to use the
wireless<00:04:05.440> because<00:04:05.980> i've<00:04:06.970> got<00:04:07.270> a<00:04:07.300> driver<00:04:07.570> on<00:04:07.720> a

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
wireless because i've got a driver on a

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:16.050 
wireless because i've got a driver on a
disc<00:04:08.020> for<00:04:08.110> that<00:04:08.350> then<00:04:08.650> just<00:04:09.209> install<00:04:15.060> it's

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
disc for that then just install it's

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.159 
disc for that then just install it's
just<00:04:16.209> gonna<00:04:16.299> take<00:04:16.390> some<00:04:16.600> time<00:04:17.019> so<00:04:18.930> says<00:04:19.930> 12

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
just gonna take some time so says 12

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.509 
just gonna take some time so says 12
minutes<00:04:20.410> but<00:04:20.560> are<00:04:20.650> usually<00:04:20.769> about<00:04:21.100> half<00:04:21.340> hour

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
minutes but are usually about half hour

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.010 
minutes but are usually about half hour
so<00:04:21.910> i'll<00:04:22.060> stop<00:04:22.540> it<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:22.870> combat<00:04:23.260> it<00:04:24.510> okay<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:25.570> it

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
so i'll stop it and combat it okay so it

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.140 
so i'll stop it and combat it okay so it
finished<00:04:26.440> installing<00:04:26.890> and<00:04:27.460> just<00:04:27.610> restarted
