00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.540
 today I am going to tell you one 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.240
 history 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.240
 my story if necessary 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.050
 yes 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.580
 everything starts with me Alejandra 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.810
 i 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.810
 I'm 22 years old 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.280
 in relation to the soil is quite 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.280
 near 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.550
 attached to about 57 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:42.130
 he is my dad she is my mom my little 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.140
 family consists of three but always 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.690
 I thought that three is a good number 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.090
 the three musketeers the three little pigs 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.090
 and sometimes our sides 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.469
 the first memory does when I had 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.920
 6 years accused of a crime that does 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.230
 I did talk maybe too much one day 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.000
 true animalist and I was banished from the 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.500
 classroom put my bench in the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.060
 yard so that if he could not talk to 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.350
 no one 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.230
 then realize that he had begun 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.090
 to talk with colors 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.090
 and then nothing surrendered 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.870
 at 8 years old my life would be divided in two 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.030
 before and after Christ since after 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.130
 of so many hunting Christmass waiting 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.040
 to see the 12 at the end had achieved 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.340
 see the gentleman or what is the same his 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.380
 glow or good what is the same the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.330
 light from the living room of my house that my mother 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.720
 I had quickly turned on and off the 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.720
 hear 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.579
 and jesus jesus 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.620
 but I was sure I saw it and 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.740
 that was the important thing in my mind of 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.040
 read a little bit different a chubby and 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.780
 good-natured pretty hairy and wore a 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.780
 fashionable loincloth 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.670
 good something similar 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.460
 it's in loincloths 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.510
 When I was 13 years old, my family and I 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.140
 we move to a small and distant place 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.140
 south of jalisco 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.069
 famous for having a very large bell 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.390
 and so much 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.390
 and more people tacos 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.360
 It was a place full of characters 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:02.690
 interesting ramiro the engine or the shell 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.690
 the crazy yesenia the balls 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.040
 and me 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.799
 but there was a problem every time 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.709
 I missed the city more then I met 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.319
 to jacques a girl of mixed dialect 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.840
 that just arrived from the USA and that 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.959
 luck felt just as unsuitable as 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.959
 I 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.140
 I am here 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.720
 soon we become nail and 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.270
 dirt 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.270
 good after death 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.970
 Four years later the nail and grime 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.129
 They separated 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.830
 I would go back to the city and finally my 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.830
 lungs breathed the smog again 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.980
 I was ready for adventure and 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.150
 finish high school I went during 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.380
 One year to live in Canada 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.370
 a place with a lot of people 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.370
 but without so many 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.190
 come back again and that's when 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.900

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.949
 red beard and 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.949

 and so we had our first daughter to 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.160
 what we call Moors and over time 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.740

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.490

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.350
