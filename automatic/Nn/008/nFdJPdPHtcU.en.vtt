00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.469
 evil until 3 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.890

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.460

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:23.279

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.620
 of resident evil 3 nemesis for psp but 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.770
 the psc has to be pirated 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.500
 ok I'm going to upload several links with 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.340
 mediafire all will be divided into 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 parts one I did not divide it I tried all 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.579
 the games and if they work 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.920
 I'll make an example first 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.920
 download the links of a game 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.379
 from mediafire once downloaded them 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.689
 will appear some files like this and with the 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.689
 windward program follow these steps 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.070
 a window will open where it will be extracted 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.070
 the file 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.170
 and a folder like this will appear 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.380
 a file does not move anything and now they 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.680
 I will teach how to pass it to your psp but 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.110
 this is just a folder of a game if 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.799
 download all the games there will be four 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.920
 folders so they do not get confused ok 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.549
 now connect your psp and follow these 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.549
 Steps 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.740
 and in the folder game copy the folder 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.769
 of the game wait for it to be copied and there 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.760
 same pass all the folders with the 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.760
 from 'resident evil' 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.319
