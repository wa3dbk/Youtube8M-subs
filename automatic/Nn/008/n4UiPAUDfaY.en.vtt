00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.460
Engineering drawing abbreviations and symbols
are used to communicate and detail the characteristics

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.840
of an engineering drawing. This list includes
abbreviations common to the vocabulary of

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.020
people who work with engineering drawings
in the manufacture and inspection of parts

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.320
and assemblies.
Technical standards exist to provide glossaries

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.640
of abbreviations, acronyms, and symbols that
may be found on engineering drawings. Many

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.860
corporations have such standards, which define
some terms and symbols specific to them; on

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.710
the national and international level, ASME
standard Y14.38 is probably the most widely

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:47.930
used.
