00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.260 
close to the center line of the bolt
pattern<00:01:19.010> so<00:01:19.580> we're<00:01:19.700> going<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.850> do<00:01:19.970> there<00:01:20.120> right

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
pattern so we're going to do there right

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.210 
pattern so we're going to do there right
now<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.260> upend<00:01:21.560> here<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.800> keep<00:01:21.920> things<00:01:22.159> a

little bit square we're going from the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.219 
center of the stud that's farthest from
it<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.460> outside<00:01:41.260> skip<00:01:42.260> one<00:01:42.880> Center<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.229> that

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
it so outside skip one Center and that

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.700 
it so outside skip one Center and that
gives<00:01:45.440> us<00:01:45.590> four<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.040> half<00:01:46.070> inches<00:01:50.560> pad<00:01:51.560> or

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
gives us four and a half inches pad or

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.770 
gives us four and a half inches pad or
template<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.120> easiest<00:01:53.479> way<00:01:53.750> to

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
template this is the easiest way to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.080 
template this is the easiest way to
determine<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.470> this<00:01:55.130> just<00:01:55.370> snaps<00:01:55.610> over<00:01:55.850> the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
determine it this just snaps over the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.260 
determine it this just snaps over the
studs<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:57.740> has<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.670> four<00:01:58.970> most<00:01:59.150> common

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
studs and it has the four most common

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.719 
studs and it has the four most common
bolt<00:01:59.810> patterns<00:02:00.229> on<00:02:00.409> it<00:02:00.530> already<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.610> can

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
bolt patterns on it already and you can

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.210 
bolt patterns on it already and you can
see<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:02.900> each<00:02:03.080> stud<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.500> lined<00:02:03.710> up<00:02:03.830> with<00:02:03.890> four

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
see that each stud is lined up with four

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.880 
see that each stud is lined up with four
and<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.369> half<00:02:04.400> inches
