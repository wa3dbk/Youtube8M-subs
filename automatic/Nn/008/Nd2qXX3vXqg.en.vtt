cameras side by side for the camera wars
now<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> audio<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.949> both<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.430> them<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.699> think

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
now the audio in both of them I think

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:43.700 
now the audio in both of them I think
suck<00:00:29.060> photo<00:00:30.060> contour<00:00:30.570> plus<00:00:30.990> its<00:00:31.949> model<00:00:42.710> we're

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
suck photo contour plus its model we're

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.290 
suck photo contour plus its model we're
just<00:00:43.950> going<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:44.579> one's<00:00:44.850> got<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
just going to see which one's got the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:56.600 
just going to see which one's got the
better<00:00:45.450> video<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:55.199> contour<00:00:55.829> plus<00:00:56.190> has<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
better video the contour plus has a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.609 
better video the contour plus has a
rotating<00:00:57.199> 90<00:00:58.199> degree<00:00:58.910> 180-degree<00:00:59.910> 180<00:01:00.359> degree

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.150 

0<00:01:04.619> degree

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.140 

and<00:01:08.160> it's<00:01:08.310> got<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:08.730> negative<00:01:09.120> 90<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:11.150> then

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and it's got the negative 90 and then

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.800 
and it's got the negative 90 and then
we'll<00:01:12.750> go<00:01:12.900> back<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> zero<00:01:14.330> which<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:15.630> i<00:01:15.660> think

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
we'll go back to zero which now i think

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.550 
we'll go back to zero which now i think
it's<00:01:16.170> straight<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.860> down<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.990> jvc

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
it's straight up and down the jvc

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.370 
it's straight up and down the jvc
doesn't<00:01:19.950> ABC<00:01:20.460> doesn't<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.120> that<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:24.660> JBC<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
doesn't ABC doesn't have that the JBC is

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.540 
doesn't ABC doesn't have that the JBC is
waterproof<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.640> contour<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:29.430> I'm

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
waterproof the contour is not and I'm

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.930 
waterproof the contour is not and I'm
still<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.440> issues<00:01:31.440> with<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> contour<00:01:32.580> plus

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
still have issues with the contour plus

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.750 
still have issues with the contour plus
case<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:36.890> I'm<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.040> going<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> shoot

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
case so for now I'm just going to shoot

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:48.179 
case so for now I'm just going to shoot
the<00:01:40.910> you<00:01:41.910> be<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.240> judge<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.840> video

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.149 

i<00:01:49.189> guaran--<00:01:49.909> in<00:01:50.030> my<00:01:50.210> opinion<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.900> audio<00:01:51.830> on

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
i guaran-- in my opinion the audio on

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.800 
i guaran-- in my opinion the audio on
the<00:01:52.340> JVC<00:01:53.799> absolutely<00:01:54.799> sucks<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:56.210> does<00:01:56.540> not

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
the JVC absolutely sucks it does not

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.859 
the JVC absolutely sucks it does not
have<00:01:57.140> an<00:01:57.290> external<00:01:57.770> microphone<00:01:58.570> input<00:01:59.570> jack

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
have an external microphone input jack

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:10.570 
have an external microphone input jack
input<00:02:00.200> jack<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:07.239> that's<00:02:08.239> it<00:02:08.539> for<00:02:09.580> this

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
input jack so that's it for this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.150 
input jack so that's it for this
comparison
