00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 New York a vibrant city 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.660
 more and more people from all over the world 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.429
 try to come true here and 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.429
 to find her personal happiness 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.340
 for some, it is just a bleak one 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.720
 concrete desert but green oases like these 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.169
 also experience a densely populated 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.180
 millions of cities like new york live their lives 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.829
 over eight million people a hundred 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.660
 they speak different languages 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.860
 above all, it is one thing that connects you with the topic 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.070
 It is definitely living in green space 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.120
 not green enough yet we need more 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.830
 and trees and, above all, a lot out so 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.340
 honestly, sometimes I use those 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.340
 Fire ladder just to get fresh air too calm 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.820
 an ever-growing population 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.030
 Bring a station to your physical 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.890
 growth not to forget the stress 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.720
 in this perhaps most ambitious 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.850
 city ​​of the world an optimal 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.950
 Creating quality of life is what everyone is 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.630
 but how do you get that 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.100
 just do not panic just wait 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.470
 high above the hectic pace of the 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.250
 city ​​you will find countless roof gardens 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.619
 how many new yorkers manage to do that 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.860
 wherever you can your own little one 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.580
 michael michael why are those 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.250
 roof gardens have become so popular lately 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.360
 So I think it brings people 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.009
 you back to nature 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.720
 Such roof gardens are the times 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.929
 only possibility is this longing 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.179
 to fulfill permanently and you see here 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.799
 really nice 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.649
 You can finally see something here again 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.170
 green in this gray concrete must 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.030
 Absolutely that's the case of course 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.250
 The people also like parks but they 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.990
 want something own where they are barefoot 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.250
 Run and the grass between your toes 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.950
 can feel where they have their own 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.290
 Herbs and tomatoes can grow like that 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.760
 something is very unusual here completely 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.670
 what are the advantages of a 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.250
 roof garden in the middle of the city for the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.120
 users mean a profit 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.430
 life quality 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.410
 They can relax here and they 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.010
 enjoy your little private oasis 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.410
 away from the hectic city bustle 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.310
 it just brings more peace in her 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.620
 whole life 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.200
 I can not understand why that 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.870
 do not make more people 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.010
 imagine the entire 80 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.940
 square kilometer roof area of ​​new york 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.620
 green in front 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:51.590
 would not that be a huge 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.549
 roof garden that looks great but must 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.389
 you do not invest a lot of work in it 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.580
 of course, needs such a 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.620
 beautiful garden a lot of care yes 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.190
 the lawn has to be mowed once a week 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.160
 and that over the whole year 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.160
 regardless of whether spring summer or 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.590
 even winter is a beautiful garden 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.270
 does not grow by itself so what costs 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.860
 Time 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.540
 but time is exactly what the new 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.960
 actually do not have yorker 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.510
 no no and when they recover 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.380
 rather yourself for one 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.240
 to take care of the garden 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.680
 Do you know how to care up here? 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.810
 actually on the lawn 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.920
 but it's not just about a bit 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:38.180
 Pour the sheep is in the nature of 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.610
 perfect lawnmower of husqvarna otto 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.470
 Wall is just as quiet and imitated 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.440
 his glass behaves and he is there 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.880
 much easier and to learn more about it 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.459
 We will visit Husqvarna 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.990
 automower research and 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.520
 development center at 6000 kilometers 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.860
 distant sweden 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.560
 here was the husqvarna 20 years ago 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:02.570
 automower develops and is located 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.400
 now in the third generation like this 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.350
 here are more opossums to fulfill 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.610
 exactly the same function as sheep more 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.070
 or tower more 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.080
 after the installation you can do that 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.340
 Just leave them to email 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.209
 show me what he can do 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.209
 Of course 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.450
 the hereby just the lawn so that 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.390
 is ka-news and he is there too 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.400
 really very quiet what happens now 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.440
 rather a comparison in the hedge that belief 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.570
 I do not know how he knows when he will turn off 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.960
 there must be a thin wire at the bottom 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.730
 which gives the device a signal which 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.410
 By the signal he recognizes where the lawn 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:53.030
 ends and reacts accordingly 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.550
 I can see that but somehow it works 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.210
 a little aimless as if he did not know 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.820
 where 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.650
 what he does now helps 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.370
 evenly cut lawn too 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.650
 leave 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.740
 with ordinary more you can still see 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.970
 a strip and a strip there 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.380
 irregular cut we want one 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.060
 carpet look similar therefore 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.620
 but down there was something 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.900
 Keeps him against a tree or 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.580
 to drive stone like this one 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.000
 stop him so he does not bump into it 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.260
 and it will be destroyed on this tree 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.540
 he does not stop at all 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.350
 he feels his way slowly and down 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.690
 and continue 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.820
 We use a very sharp blade Hoßmang 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.250
 automower with every day the whole area 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.080
 but only very little that helps 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.950
 lower effort less 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.630
 power consumption 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.520
 But he will also be through a battery 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.010
 started is battery operated he drives 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.200
 regularly to the charging station only about 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.390
 once an hour 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.180
 he invites himself independently 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.070
 back and forth and he is 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.200
 absolutely environmentally friendly 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.690
 I have to say the lawn sees 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.350
 fantastic 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:59.030
 before really full and green completely 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.360
 unlike the cut of a normal one 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.730
 lawn mower the height is perfect me 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.650
 believe it starts to rain for a moment 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.930
 I thought in the rain you should 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.640
 not at all wrong this device 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.230
 can the lawn in any weather more of the 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.970
 the rain is not a problem 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.790
 I see that comes with small ones 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.000
 bounce well or basically 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.129
 This device can be everywhere more everywhere 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.559
 where you also conventional 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:27.709
 but rather can use the best 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:30.169
 I've seen so far that he 

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:32.569
 works completely independently and 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.580
 you have the freedom to work bath 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.559
 to go and read a book 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.509
 you can do whatever you want completely 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:39.699
 exactly you can do anything you want 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:50.989
 except lawn 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:53.149
 I believe that I could live back 

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:55.369
 in new york i want to know what kind of garden 

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:58.789
 Expert Michael keeps this device 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:07:00.289
 hey michael how do you like that is 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:02.479
 I like it fantastic 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:04.219
 I think this little miracle will happen 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.949
 not only to garden owners absolutely 

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:10.580
 but everyone enjoys a race 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:13.389
 has exactly gives a time and leisure 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:17.119
 to enjoy this wonderful place here 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:20.209
 that's right, how do you like the cut? 

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:22.219
 looks great or I think so too 

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:24.919
 yes at first I thought that's just one 

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:26.990
 useless toy but it looks like this 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:28.099
 as if the grass did not grow and 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.249
 but it is so tight and 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:36.219
 evenly just always looks perfect 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:38.869
 from there convinced in any case 

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:41.389
 we say goodbye where everything 

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:43.159
 started here with a view of the 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:46.729
 skyline of new york 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:49.189
 some see it as a concrete desert 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:51.139
 see in it more a place where green 

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:53.719
 life is possible where the human being is in 

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:56.449
 harmony with nature is wherever he goes 

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:59.240
 also lives the husqvarna automower helps 

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:02.529
 us because he gives us space and time 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.529
 that too little
