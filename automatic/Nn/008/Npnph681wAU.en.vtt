00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.129 
hi i'm jay from real street performance
today<00:00:12.120> we're<00:00:12.300> going<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.480> talk<00:00:12.660> about<00:00:12.809> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
today we're going to talk about the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.890 
today we're going to talk about the
adjustable<00:00:14.009> cam<00:00:14.219> sprocket<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.969> what<00:00:15.809> it

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
adjustable cam sprocket and what it

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.300 
adjustable cam sprocket and what it
means<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:21.590> now<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.650> adjustable<00:00:23.100> cam

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
means to you now the adjustable cam

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.790 
means to you now the adjustable cam
sprocket<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> tool<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.480> often

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
sprocket is a tool that is often

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.259 
sprocket is a tool that is often
inexpensive<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.070> accessible<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:26.939> most<00:00:27.119> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
inexpensive and accessible for most of

inexpensive and accessible for most of
the<00:00:27.359> engines<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.930> sell<00:00:28.140> parts<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.740> it's

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
the engines that we sell parts for it's

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.950 
the engines that we sell parts for it's
something<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.910> recommend<00:00:30.119> based<00:00:30.689> off<00:00:30.929> of

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
something that I recommend based off of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.420 
something that I recommend based off of
the<00:00:31.140> fact<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.949> gives<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the fact that it gives you the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.430 
the fact that it gives you the
opportunity<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.030> optimize<00:00:33.420> your<00:00:33.780> cam<00:00:33.960> timing

retard the timing you will increase

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.710 
retard the timing you will increase
top-end<00:01:07.590> power<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> advance<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.570> cam

this is one of the downfalls of having a
sixth<00:01:21.200> cam<00:01:21.410> timing<00:01:21.680> engine<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.790> when<00:01:22.910> you<00:01:22.970> go

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
sixth cam timing engine so when you go

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.760 
sixth cam timing engine so when you go
to<00:01:23.120> the<00:01:23.300> dyno<00:01:23.510> I<00:01:23.810> recommend<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.410> work<00:01:24.620> in

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
to the dyno I recommend that you work in

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.700 
to the dyno I recommend that you work in
two<00:01:25.070> degree<00:01:25.400> increments<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.450> would

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
two degree increments so you would

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.710 
two degree increments so you would
advance<00:01:27.710> or<00:01:28.010> retard<00:01:28.400> each<00:01:29.090> camshaft

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
advance or retard each camshaft

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.400 
advance or retard each camshaft
independently<00:01:30.610> or<00:01:31.610> together<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.480> work<00:01:33.230> your

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
independently or together and work your

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.950 
independently or together and work your
way<00:01:33.530> through<00:01:33.940> what<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.060> engine<00:01:35.390> likes<00:01:35.630> and

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
way through what the engine likes and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.810 
way through what the engine likes and
how<00:01:36.410> it<00:01:36.560> changes<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:36.980> power<00:01:37.340> band<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.700> the

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
how it changes the power band of the

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.030 
how it changes the power band of the
engine<00:01:38.290> we're<00:01:39.290> going<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.470> post<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:39.860> quick

the<00:02:00.680> case<00:02:00.860> you're<00:02:01.220> going<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.400> want<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.640> check

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
the case you're going to want to check

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.090 
the case you're going to want to check
the<00:02:02.480> valve<00:02:02.660> lash<00:02:02.960> throughout<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.680> process

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
the valve lash throughout the process

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.410 
the valve lash throughout the process
because<00:02:04.490> if<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.700> were<00:02:04.790> dealing<00:02:04.940> with<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.180> large

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
because if you were dealing with a large

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.380 
because if you were dealing with a large
camshaft<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.290> has<00:02:06.410> a<00:02:06.440> lot<00:02:06.710> of<00:02:06.740> overlaps<00:02:07.390> as

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
camshaft that has a lot of overlaps as

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.660 
camshaft that has a lot of overlaps as
you<00:02:08.570> move<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.990> cam<00:02:09.230> lobe<00:02:09.500> around<00:02:09.890> physically

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
you move the cam lobe around physically

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.700 
you move the cam lobe around physically
with<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:10.940> cam<00:02:11.120> sprocket<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.840> can<00:02:12.020> alter<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
with the cam sprocket you can alter the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.070 
with the cam sprocket you can alter the
valve<00:02:12.950> lash<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:13.790> it's<00:02:14.390> good<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.660> check<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
valve lash so it's good to check the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.470 
valve lash so it's good to check the
valve<00:02:15.260> wash<00:02:15.470> throughout<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> process<00:02:16.420> not<00:02:17.420> a
