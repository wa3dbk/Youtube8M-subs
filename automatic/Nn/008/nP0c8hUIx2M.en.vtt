00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.189
 to start the engine is a fairly fast sequence we have to 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:07.390
 check several instruments 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.390
 they are going to fix what we should have 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.069
 light 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:14.639
 of ignition 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.639
 first, when we have action, we have the Pope in heat 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.609
 we are going to have oil pressure rise 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.249
 the ng 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.249
 what is this one here reached 12 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 when it's 12 or a little bit more 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.940
 we move in ciu condition see something to the sixth position touch that they have to 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.640
 beware 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 and when the engine is turning on 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.210
 we have fuel flow between 80 friend seat 10 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.210
 for one hundred thousand pounds per hour 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.300
 all this while holding the starter 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.770
 because when he ng reaches 52% that sixth position 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.670
 there we release the starter 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.670
 very well then let's go on the engine 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.760
 they tell us 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.450
 ciu looking for a weight and chacÃ³n 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.160
 saluted 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.290
 the low pressure light goes out and we do not owe low percent of 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.980
 fuel and we should not have here fuel flow that should be in 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.980
 zero as it is now 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.310
 estate switch estate that starts the sequences that told you 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.400
 the ng begins his life 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.400
 there we have 10 percent 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.520
 it is stable 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.430
 we turn on the engine 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.820
 we wait for it to reach 52% 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.820
 let's go the starter cuts the light 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.510
 from the bench 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.670
 begins to raise the oil pressure 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.180
 the fuel flow between 80 and 110 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.180
 obviously it will stabilize when the engine and even on 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.320
 we check all the instruments that are 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.590
 in green band here the oil pressure will go up as 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.590
 accelerate the engine 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.999
 we turn on the generator 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.459
 and we turn off the fuel pump 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.809
 we no longer have any lusaka 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.809
 avionics whitson masters we know what they know and coss 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.509
 fan that has shown 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:37.899
 percent 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.929
 the suction indicator 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.059
 with that we have completed the ignition of life
