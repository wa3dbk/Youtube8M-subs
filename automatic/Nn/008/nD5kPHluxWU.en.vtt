00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 - come to a very beautiful evening 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.230
 of sport that we start on the side of lyon 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.540
 lyon was receiving the Olympic castres is 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.460
 a new player in blue this new 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.929
 player it's rory kockott you know it 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.790
 we talked about it last week on 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.170
 South African scrum half does well 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.630
 part of the two foreigners who 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.240
 will join the blue squad tomorrow at 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.000
 marcoussis despite an early season 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.519
 his team's frenzy 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.910
 viard obviously we wanted to 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.859
 see 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.669
 after this announcement we had to wait for a 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.530
 little more than expected 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.200
 yes because it was Isabelle the surprise of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.550
 castres coaches leave him on the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.840
 bench maybe for it to be fresh and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.739
 ready to reach the wise men 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.870
 but to see it happen 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.160
 actually at the stage today he 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.570
 looked much more relaxed 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.620
 any case that his teammates very 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.620
 motivated the castrais 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.470
 this is for the motivation of castrais 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.470
 same thing from lyon side maybe 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.820
 not at all olivier azam we will you 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.050
 leave my besides it's the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.670
 castrais perhaps the most brought back to 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.500
 the start of the match with this pretty pass 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.490
 of john beattie for roman martial the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.800
 little kick over and over 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.720
 two defenders of the wolf but he manages 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.010
 to take the best on them the most 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.420
 fast it comes to flatten we play since 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.250
 two minutes the beautiful work of john 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.050
 beattie and here are castres that leads to 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.150
 matmut stadium 5 to 0 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.950
 we see martial that goes in touch but 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.630
 who's back in the air of fair play 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.770
 before flattening is not much 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.730
 else to say about this first 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.170
 period under the eyes of sÃ©bastien 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.990
 chabal who sees his old team 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.310
 led anyway be conducted 11 to 9 the 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.170
 fast exit of the castrais who start 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.090
 in the same way this second period 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.910
 with this pass to contact almost 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.010
 between fans or us and tuatara but 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.690
 finally to the video this essay will be 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.520
 refused for a forward pass 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.990
 we put you both axes so that 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.910
 you make an idea did not seem there 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.400
 have forward anyway the test will be 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.780
 denied net by sir berdos no 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.220
 luck for tuatara a few moments 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.050
 later it is Lyon who also 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.940
 attack with rico jeanne uhari the number 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.920
 9 who is not held who can advance 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.540
 and go beyond the goal line 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.700
 alas this time new 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.649
 video intervention is what there is 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.750
 a reason to refuse the test on this 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.550
 axis there we do not see if the ball is 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.350
 flattened if he crosses the line of the coup 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.570
 offers you another axis as everything to 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.160
 the hour we do not see much 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.720
 more just now a try 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.440
 had been repressed this time and yes 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.140
 he is granted 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.910
 and here 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.610
 the lou who takes the advantage to lead 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.230
 16 to 11 and that suddenly to the dynamics 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.819
 with him and for a few moments more 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.340
 late mark a new test by paul 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.230
 goodfond wilex castrais facing his 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.940
 former coaches rather deputies because 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.330
 that their team is led now 21 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.890
 11 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.630
 but finally with the return of casseroles 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.160
 here is a team that attacks a small 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.990
 little more even if she gets stolen the 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.060
 Recovered balloon behind by Julian 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.830
 puricelli then is not rare at all 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.730
 you kick it over it 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.230
 there are still a lot of pots but 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.790
 the fastest is still good 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.020
 arnold who gets the ball and who goes 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.790
 go flattening alone which he expects 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.440
 support loursac support which 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.270
 comes to mark a new test the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.950
 second try the third try forgiveness 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.690
 for the Lyonnais in the space of 20 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.010
 minutes only at the beginning the beautiful 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.780
 work and lionel nallet 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.930
 the awesome little ratuvou kick 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.030
 toby race a hall for this test 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.250
 heavy bags and here is the wolf that with 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.110
 another quarter of an hour to play leads 28 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.550
 at the vote he finally woke up 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.930
 castrais who are able to attack in 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.700
 first hand for example with this balloon 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.590
 retrieved by richie gray equivalence and 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.590
 john beattie again john beattie for 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.570
 choice tara on his left that resists the 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.610
 back from Lyon and comes to access 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.130
 this time his trial will be validated 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.930
 we love the work of john beattie fo 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.540
 call right to serve left 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.670
 you have it and here are castres that comes back to 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.440
 28.18 with another four minutes 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.000
 only to play a try their 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.769
 would come back in the bonus 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.269
 defensive year that's why not account 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.160
 is for example on martial roman 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.239
 the author of the essay after only two 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.290
 minutes of play the little kick by 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.579
 on it as before the rebound 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.350
 favorable as just now he did 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.640
 more than replant them is the return of 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.930
 the bear who drops it but no they 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.220
 pose to get up and go flat 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.220
 despite the return of ratuvou 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.450
 yes he drops the ball forward you 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.780
 have heard sir berdos but that 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.400
 will be denied just to the video he's 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.240
 vow he wants it racial roma and 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.680
 yet he had done a job 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.570
 beautiful with this little kick the 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.270
 favorable bounce m but it will be 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.530
 finally too just he is prostrate to 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.700
 the end of this martial Roman action 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.940
 because his team finally bow 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.040
 28-18 no defensive bonus for the 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.350
 castrais the lyonnais they finally have to 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.670
 again a victory it was not the 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.840
 full moon today we got right 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.840
 to the cries of the world wow
