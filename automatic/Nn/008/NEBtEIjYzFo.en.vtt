00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
the air with your tongue so take a

the air with your tongue so take a
moment<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.610> practice<00:00:38.060> right<00:00:38.239> now<00:00:38.270> that<00:00:38.720> sound

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
moment to practice right now that sound

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.560 
moment to practice right now that sound
and<00:00:41.950> when<00:00:42.950> you<00:00:43.130> stop<00:00:43.580> the<00:00:43.880> air<00:00:44.090> with<00:00:44.420> your

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
and when you stop the air with your

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.320 
and when you stop the air with your
tongue<00:00:45.460> what<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:46.580> will<00:00:46.760> be<00:00:46.880> doing<00:00:46.910> is

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
tongue what you will be doing is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.870 
tongue what you will be doing is
actually<00:00:47.570> working<00:00:48.020> up<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.460> entire

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
actually working up the entire

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.060 
actually working up the entire
embouchure<00:00:50.660> hole<00:00:50.810> to<00:00:51.500> create<00:00:51.830> that

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
embouchure hole to create that

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.060 
embouchure hole to create that
percussive<00:00:52.820> popping<00:00:53.570> sound<00:00:53.900> it's<00:00:54.230> like<00:00:54.860> you

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
percussive popping sound it's like you

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.870 
percussive popping sound it's like you
would<00:00:55.250> do<00:00:55.520> with<00:00:56.890> a<00:00:57.890> bottle<00:00:58.310> if<00:00:58.490> you<00:00:58.760> were

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
would do with a bottle if you were

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.740 
would do with a bottle if you were
hitting<00:00:59.270> it<00:00:59.360> with<00:00:59.510> your<00:00:59.660> hand

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
hitting it with your hand

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.210 
hitting it with your hand
basically<00:01:02.750> you're<00:01:02.930> making<00:01:03.230> that<00:01:03.440> sound<00:01:03.800> with

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
basically you're making that sound with

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.340 
basically you're making that sound with
your<00:01:04.250> tongue<00:01:04.640> in<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.150> opera<00:01:05.479> hole<00:01:05.750> there<00:01:06.110> are

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
your tongue in the opera hole there are

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.380 
your tongue in the opera hole there are
two<00:01:06.619> things<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.460> keep<00:01:07.610> in<00:01:07.790> mind<00:01:08.030> when<00:01:08.299> you

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
two things to keep in mind when you

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.499 
two things to keep in mind when you
practice<00:01:08.869> your<00:01:09.200> tongue<00:01:09.560> Rams<00:01:09.999> one<00:01:10.999> is<00:01:11.299> that

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
practice your tongue Rams one is that

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.779 
practice your tongue Rams one is that
you<00:01:11.630> should<00:01:11.659> actually<00:01:12.079> feel<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:13.130> edge<00:01:13.310> of<00:01:13.670> the

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
you should actually feel the edge of the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.480 
you should actually feel the edge of the
embouchure<00:01:14.149> hole<00:01:14.359> with<00:01:14.960> your<00:01:15.560> tongue<00:01:16.009> when

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
embouchure hole with your tongue when

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.270 
embouchure hole with your tongue when
you<00:01:16.670> stop<00:01:17.179> the<00:01:17.780> air

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:31.440 

I<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.970> actually<00:01:21.270> feel<00:01:21.510> it<00:01:21.540> right

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.529 

and<00:01:31.539> the<00:01:32.170> second<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:33.130> not<00:01:33.490> use<00:01:33.820> too<00:01:34.119> much

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
and the second is to not use too much

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.510 
and the second is to not use too much
air<00:01:34.899> so<00:01:35.350> even<00:01:35.649> though<00:01:35.770> you're<00:01:35.950> practicing

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
air so even though you're practicing

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.429 
air so even though you're practicing
making<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.939> sound<00:01:37.659> before<00:01:38.079> your<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:40.439> doesn't

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
making a sound before your that doesn't

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.679 
making a sound before your that doesn't
need<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:41.590> be<00:01:41.740> very<00:01:42.039> long<00:01:42.310> or<00:01:42.579> very<00:01:42.909> hard<00:01:43.329> it<00:01:43.570> can

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
need to be very long or very hard it can

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.410 
need to be very long or very hard it can
be<00:01:43.829> extremely<00:01:44.829> light<00:01:45.219> just<00:01:45.670> enough<00:01:45.969> to<00:01:46.210> get

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
be extremely light just enough to get

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.700 
be extremely light just enough to get
the<00:01:46.539> air<00:01:46.689> moving<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:47.380> make<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.799> sound<00:01:52.710> rather

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
the air moving to make that sound rather

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.889 
the air moving to make that sound rather
than<00:01:56.610> sometimes<00:01:57.610> if<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.060> use<00:01:58.240> too<00:01:58.479> much<00:01:58.509> air

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
than sometimes if you use too much air

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.300 
than sometimes if you use too much air
it<00:01:59.079> actually<00:01:59.380> makes<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.679> hard<00:01:59.979> for<00:02:00.189> your

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
it actually makes it hard for your

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:21.540 
it actually makes it hard for your
tongue<00:02:00.549> to<00:02:00.759> stop<00:02:01.000> it

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.610
