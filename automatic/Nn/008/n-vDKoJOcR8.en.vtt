about the ball and hatch combination and

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.169 
about the ball and hatch combination and
for<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.179> sake<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:13.130> example<00:00:14.130> we're<00:00:14.969> going<00:00:15.089> to

490 and 15
that's<00:00:41.540> 505<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.960> problem<00:00:43.290> will<00:00:43.379> fit<00:00:43.590> down

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
that's 505 that problem will fit down

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.190 
that's 505 that problem will fit down
the<00:00:43.920> board<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.820> here's<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> plan<00:00:45.420> you're

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the board but here's the plan you're

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.380 
the board but here's the plan you're
rifling<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.219> gun<00:00:47.430> consists<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.180> two

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
rifling and that gun consists of two

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.389 
rifling and that gun consists of two
parts<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> raised<00:00:49.530> portion<00:00:49.890> which<00:00:50.370> is

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
parts you have a raised portion which is

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.850 
parts you have a raised portion which is
called<00:00:50.760> lands<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.079> then<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.620> shallow

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
called lands and then you have a shallow

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.799 
called lands and then you have a shallow
portion<00:00:53.399> which<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.579> called<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> grooves<00:00:54.420> now

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
portion which is called the grooves now

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.860 
portion which is called the grooves now
those<00:00:55.079> grooves<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.829> generally<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.510> four<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
those grooves will generally be four to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.279 
those grooves will generally be four to
seven<00:00:58.320> eight<00:00:58.620> thousandths<00:00:59.809> shallower<00:01:00.809> than

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
seven eight thousandths shallower than

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.110 
seven eight thousandths shallower than
the<00:01:01.469> lands<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:02.550> you've<00:01:02.699> got<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.879> do

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the lands so what you've got to do

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.119 
the lands so what you've got to do
you've<00:01:03.719> got<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.930> put<00:01:04.080> oversized<00:01:04.530> patch<00:01:04.830> in

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
you've got to put oversized patch in

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.609 
you've got to put oversized patch in
there<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.240> you'll<00:01:06.420> seal<00:01:06.720> those<00:01:07.229> grooves

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
there so that you'll seal those grooves

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.410 
there so that you'll seal those grooves
as<00:01:08.040> well<00:01:08.330> okay<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:10.189> we<00:01:11.189> decided<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.240> that

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
as well okay so we decided with that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.690 
as well okay so we decided with that
combination<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.740> go<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.400> fire

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
combination and we go out and we fire

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.510 
combination and we go out and we fire
over<00:01:15.509> let's<00:01:15.689> say<00:01:15.840> three<00:01:16.200> rounds<00:01:16.710> swab<00:01:17.310> in

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
over let's say three rounds swab in

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.240 
over let's say three rounds swab in
between<00:01:17.880> each<00:01:18.060> shot<00:01:18.090> or<00:01:18.570> every<00:01:18.840> other<00:01:18.960> shot<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
between each shot or every other shot to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.350 
between each shot or every other shot to
reduce<00:01:20.610> our<00:01:20.820> fouling<00:01:21.799> and<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.430> grouping

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
reduce our fouling and it's not grouping

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.560 
reduce our fouling and it's not grouping
real<00:01:24.570> well<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.369> we<00:01:26.369> decide<00:01:26.729> okay<00:01:27.150> let's<00:01:27.420> try

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
real well so we decide okay let's try

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.109 
real well so we decide okay let's try
going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.560> thicker<00:01:28.890> patch<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
going to a thicker patch so we go to the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.330 
going to a thicker patch so we go to the
thicker<00:01:30.329> patch<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.680> seems<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> shoot

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
thicker patch and it seems to shoot

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.090 
thicker patch and it seems to shoot
better<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.450> generally<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.409> round<00:01:34.860> ball

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
better but generally your round ball

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.350 
better but generally your round ball
guns<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.030> grooves<00:01:36.810> will<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.409> deeper<00:01:38.360> because

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
guns the grooves will be deeper because

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.539 
guns the grooves will be deeper because
of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.990> slower<00:01:40.229> twist<00:01:40.680> usually<00:01:41.220> your<00:01:41.340> round

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
of the slower twist usually your round

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.569 
of the slower twist usually your round
ball<00:01:41.790> guns<00:01:42.090> are<00:01:42.860> probably<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.250> one

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
ball guns are probably going to have one

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.630 
ball guns are probably going to have one
and<00:01:44.880> sixty<00:01:45.360> two<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:46.229> high<00:01:46.409> as<00:01:46.470> one<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.189> seventy

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and sixty two as high as one and seventy

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.870 
and sixty two as high as one and seventy
two<00:01:47.670> twists<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.509> what<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.810> means<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:50.130> ball

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
two twists and what that means that ball

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.520 
two twists and what that means that ball
is<00:01:51.360> turning<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:52.229> time<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:53.899> sixty<00:01:54.899> inches<00:01:55.259> or

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
is turning one time in sixty inches or

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.770 
is turning one time in sixty inches or
one<00:01:55.979> time<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.430> 72<00:01:57.000> inches<00:01:57.329> you're<00:01:57.479> thinking

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
one time in 72 inches you're thinking

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.380 
one time in 72 inches you're thinking
well<00:01:57.930> that's<00:01:58.200> that's<00:01:58.619> not<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.860> lot<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.250> spin<00:01:59.490> but

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
well that's that's not a lot of spin but

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.969 
well that's that's not a lot of spin but
you<00:02:00.509> got<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.810> realize<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.890> like

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
you got to realize that it's like

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.649 
you got to realize that it's like

you're<00:03:36.980> burning<00:03:37.250> that<00:03:37.489> patch<00:03:37.730> up<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.440> the

you're burning that patch up and the

you're burning that patch up and the
patch<00:03:39.680> is<00:03:39.950> what<00:03:40.160> grips<00:03:40.600> in<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.959> rifling<00:03:42.350> the

patch is what grips in the rifling the

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.680 
patch is what grips in the rifling the
ball<00:03:43.160> itself<00:03:43.579> it<00:03:43.820> really<00:03:44.030> doesn't<00:03:44.360> grip<00:03:44.480> in

there<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:44.959> patch<00:03:45.170> does<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.430> if<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:46.790> start

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
there the patch does it so if you start

there the patch does it so if you start
and<00:03:47.180> seeing<00:03:47.360> burn<00:03:47.540> spots<00:03:47.930> for<00:03:48.230> a<00:03:48.290> two<00:03:48.380> edges
