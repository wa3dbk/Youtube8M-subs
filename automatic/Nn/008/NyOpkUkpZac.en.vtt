00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:18.300
 from 14:30 this afternoon capra 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:21.600
 terrorist is what was believed m have 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.279
 could infiltrate pass the different 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.580
 checkpoints and after being 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.130
 assured of the arrival of all 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.649
 passengers registered on the flight air france 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.710
 alger paris and so they could 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.250
 to get inside the device 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:49.739
 and they take since that time in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.980
 hostage for 132 passengers and rank 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.980
 hour 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.880
 through the negotiations and the dialogue 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:02.590
 that we have established with them he has 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:05.470
 been possible to free women 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.690
 basically and children in numbers 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.370
 55 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.190
 there are five minutes two other two 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:21.100
 old men a man and a woman were 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:24.910
 released this is so it's a 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.240
 difficult situation difficult for all the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.380
 world 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.030
 we are doing 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.450
 the impossible to bring them back to the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.490
 reason 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:42.009
 to dissuade them from surrendering and I 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:55.030
 think the next hours we 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:57.429
 would achieve this result this 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.130
 are two corpses lying on the 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.719
 landing of the bridge 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.119
 and still glued to the plane and we 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.399
 do not want cleared because that we 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.399
 would attempt a startup
