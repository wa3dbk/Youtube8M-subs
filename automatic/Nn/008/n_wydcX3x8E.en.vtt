00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.960
 surely you have asked yourself where 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.770
 all the photographs come 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.630
 disturbing that are 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.720
 circulating through the network and we see 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.849
 daily on different pages and forums the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.890
 Most of them come out of 4chan a 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.989
 picture board that was created by the 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.410
 New York christopher Paul in the year 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:34.510
 2003 when I was only 15 years old 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.399
 it's about a free content page 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.070
 where they are often filtered 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.399
 images from the web within 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.570
 4chan we found different forums 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.429
 represented with one or several letters 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.940
 of the alphabet each of which 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.350
 is dedicated to a particular topic 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.850
 mainly the strange 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.850
 without more let's start 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.210
 this photograph is already in itself 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.860
 creepy but you've seen what there is 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.140
 located to the left of man 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.270
 hanged 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.580
 there is a possibility that not 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.380
 will be about suicide and therefore the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.080
 which is at his side would be the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.000
 murderous hidden among the shadows another 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.979
 theory is that the figure that is 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.190
 camouflaged is the spirit of the individual 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.930
 who has committed suicide or simply 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.960
 it was about a curious who was passing by 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.730
 there that you think 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.740
 [Music] 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.680
 maybe you think that this is a 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.210
 old photograph of carnival but yes 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.670
 you pay more attention to all 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.770
 details you will notice that there is something strange 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.320
 in it we find ourselves before a 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.480
 post mortem photography the deceased had 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.610
 to be photographed with a mask already 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.530
 that his face was totally deformed 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.170
 after a brutal accident of 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.270
 traffic if the relatives of this lady 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.580
 They decided to leave this sinister 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.990
 mask you can imagine how it would be 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.990
 his appearance if he did not have it 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.899
 how many human bodies have served to 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.610
 the advance of science and medicine 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.830
 here in this image we see a body 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.060
 open and you can see all the bones and 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.190
 muscles 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.480
 the doctors pose for the camera with a 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.480
 unfriendly look 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.280
 This photograph was taken about 10 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.230
 years approximately it is a 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.390
 proof of a paranormal investigator of 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.000
 South America which claimed that a 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.099
 monster inhabited a cave was there with 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.870
 the objective of investigating the place but 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.689
 they never heard from him again 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.760
 after a few days the police went in 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.590
 your search and they did not find it but if 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.720
 his camera was there right on the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.879
 entrance of the cave when revealing the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.230
 reel of the camera they saw that this was 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.180
 the last image that the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.329
 researcher before disappearing from the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.329
 Map 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.110
 what would you do if you saw an album 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.959
 familiar this photograph will be a fault 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.300
 camera I would say certainly not 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.190
 a very terrifying photograph and 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.270
 chilling from some family member 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.270
 apparently a grandmother 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.400
 at first sight it seems innocent 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.660
 photography of a young Asian girl in a 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.030
 Cliff 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.100
 however if you look at your foot 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.960
 right you can notice that a hand 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.330
 he is grabbing 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.820
 the author of this photograph guarantees 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.930
 that at that time there was only him and his 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.930
 girlfriend in that place 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.160
 someone sells this doll for just 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.900
 one dollar the reason for this bargain is the 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.450
 supposed curse that holds the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.330
 porcelain doll the ad says what 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.560
 next my daughter does not love her anymore 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.540
 our dog does not stop barking at him and 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.060
 we never found it in the place where 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.180
 we left her the doll has a very funny laugh 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.440
 linda does not require totally pibas 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.650
 harmless 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.650
 [Music] 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.270
 this reclusive Jewish girl in a field of 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.430
 Nazi concentration was asked to 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.430
 draw your house and this is what he did 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.830
 If a dog tests blood little by little 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.539
 it will turn into a wild animal 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.419
 until being the most dangerous of the 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.430
 predators because this time it seems 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.860
 that the parents of this child did not think 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.030
 well in what they were doing joke of 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.030
 bad taste or ritual 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.449
 a group of friends go on a trip and 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.490
 they decide to take a break and thus be able to 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.060
 stretch his legs without foreseeing what 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.400
 there was there 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.740
 to the right of the guy just behind 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.450
 of the car you can identify a silhouette 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.820
 somewhat peculiar but not 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.340
 unrecognizable it is clear that it is about 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.470
 an alien if we expand the image and 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.980
 we increase the contrast this is what 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.980
 we obtain 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.150
 who uploaded this photograph asked 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.610
 the users if what appeared in it 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.919
 it was a woman or a mannequin the hands of 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.990
 this woman seem very real but other 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.180
 parts of your body not like for example 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.789
 the skin that seems to be made of rubber or 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.120
 latex from my point of view the most 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:31.480
 disturbing is his look
