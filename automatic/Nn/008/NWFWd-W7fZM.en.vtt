also some soldering tips for your iron
the<00:00:12.559> first<00:00:12.770> thing<00:00:12.920> that<00:00:13.039> you<00:00:13.129> want<00:00:13.309> to<00:00:13.400> do<00:00:13.549> is

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
the first thing that you want to do is

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.840 
the first thing that you want to do is
put<00:00:14.990> your<00:00:15.139> pushpins<00:00:15.680> in<00:00:15.920> hold<00:00:16.340> your<00:00:16.520> panel

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
put your pushpins in hold your panel

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.150 
put your pushpins in hold your panel
tightly<00:00:17.210> together<00:00:17.710> next<00:00:18.710> thing<00:00:18.860> that<00:00:18.980> you'll

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
tightly together next thing that you'll

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.900 
tightly together next thing that you'll
do<00:00:19.340> is<00:00:19.900> take<00:00:20.900> your<00:00:21.080> flux<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:21.740> port<00:00:22.280> your<00:00:22.580> cap

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
do is take your flux and port your cap

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.910 
do is take your flux and port your cap
so<00:00:23.390> you're<00:00:23.570> not<00:00:23.720> contaminating<00:00:24.500> your<00:00:24.590> bottle

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
so you're not contaminating your bottle

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.230 
so you're not contaminating your bottle
by<00:00:25.040> putting<00:00:25.370> your<00:00:25.430> flux<00:00:25.700> brush<00:00:25.880> in<00:00:26.120> your

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
by putting your flux brush in your

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.630 
by putting your flux brush in your
bottle<00:00:26.600> and<00:00:26.780> then<00:00:27.500> you<00:00:27.620> want<00:00:27.770> to<00:00:27.860> put<00:00:28.039> flux<00:00:28.400> on

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
bottle and then you want to put flux on

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.180 
bottle and then you want to put flux on
your<00:00:28.940> project<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:29.930> you<00:00:30.560> want<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.830> get<00:00:30.920> enough

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
your project and you want to get enough

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.880 
your project and you want to get enough
on<00:00:31.369> there<00:00:31.760> so<00:00:32.029> your<00:00:32.480> solder<00:00:32.780> will<00:00:33.020> stick<00:00:33.350> if

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
on there so your solder will stick if

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.799 
on there so your solder will stick if
you<00:00:33.980> don't<00:00:34.309> have<00:00:34.520> enough<00:00:34.789> flux<00:00:35.090> on<00:00:35.329> your

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
you don't have enough flux on your

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.810 
you don't have enough flux on your
solder<00:00:36.170> will<00:00:36.379> not<00:00:36.530> stick<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:36.980> your<00:00:37.040> copper

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
solder will not stick to your copper

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.450 
solder will not stick to your copper
foil<00:00:38.320> next<00:00:39.320> thing<00:00:39.470> that<00:00:39.500> you<00:00:39.710> want<00:00:39.829> to<00:00:40.010> do<00:00:40.160> is

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
foil next thing that you want to do is

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.060 
foil next thing that you want to do is
we<00:00:40.730> laufe<00:00:41.000> bout<00:00:41.300> six<00:00:41.630> inches<00:00:42.020> of<00:00:42.260> solder<00:00:42.560> and

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
we laufe bout six inches of solder and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.660 
we laufe bout six inches of solder and
that's<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.210> it<00:00:44.630> stays<00:00:45.079> firm<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:46.220> when<00:00:46.550> you

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
that's so it stays firm so when you

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.889 
that's so it stays firm so when you
press<00:00:46.940> against<00:00:47.300> your<00:00:47.540> iron

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
press against your iron

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.500 
press against your iron
it'll<00:00:48.320> be<00:00:48.440> firm<00:00:48.710> against<00:00:49.070> your<00:00:49.190> iron<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:49.700> then

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
it'll be firm against your iron and then

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.000 
it'll be firm against your iron and then
you<00:00:50.690> want<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:50.930> stay<00:00:51.170> back<00:00:51.200> a<00:00:51.440> little<00:00:51.710> ways<00:00:51.980> from

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
you want to stay back a little ways from

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.389 
you want to stay back a little ways from
the<00:00:52.489> edge<00:00:52.610> of<00:00:52.640> your<00:00:53.410> panel<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:54.620> that's<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:55.340> you

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
the edge of your panel and that's so you

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.049 
the edge of your panel and that's so you
can<00:00:55.640> get<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:55.910> came<00:00:56.149> around<00:00:56.630> your<00:00:56.840> project<00:00:57.200> and

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
can get the came around your project and

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.490 
can get the came around your project and
you're<00:00:59.059> going<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.300> hold<00:00:59.480> your<00:00:59.660> iron<00:00:59.870> upright

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
you're going to hold your iron upright

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.650 
you're going to hold your iron upright
like<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:00.860> bicycle<00:01:01.399> handle<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.180> it<00:01:02.270> needs<00:01:02.450> to<00:01:02.570> be

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
like a bicycle handle so it needs to be

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.530 
like a bicycle handle so it needs to be
like<00:01:02.899> this<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.950> tip<00:01:04.219> will<00:01:04.670> be<00:01:04.850> upright<00:01:05.269> like

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
like this the tip will be upright like

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.380 
like this the tip will be upright like
this<00:01:05.840> that<00:01:06.290> puts<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.680> nice<00:01:06.860> round<00:01:07.189> bead<00:01:07.520> on<00:01:07.729> flat

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
this that puts a nice round bead on flat

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.209 
this that puts a nice round bead on flat
takes<00:01:08.719> it<00:01:08.929> off<00:01:09.079> so<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:09.619> want<00:01:09.889> to<00:01:09.979> remember

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
takes it off so you want to remember

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.059 
takes it off so you want to remember
upright<00:01:10.819> for<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.569> bead<00:01:11.810> flat<00:01:12.409> takes<00:01:12.859> the

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069 
upright for the bead flat takes the

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.910 
upright for the bead flat takes the
solder<00:01:13.310> off<00:01:13.609> so<00:01:14.479> we'll<00:01:14.630> be<00:01:14.780> upright<00:01:15.200> also<00:01:15.679> all

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
solder off so we'll be upright also all

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.999 
solder off so we'll be upright also all
you<00:01:16.039> want<00:01:16.249> to<00:01:16.340> be<00:01:16.459> across<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:18.020> solder<00:01:18.319> line<00:01:18.679> so

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
you want to be across the solder line so

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.050 
you want to be across the solder line so
you<00:01:19.069> don't<00:01:19.159> want<00:01:19.459> to<00:01:19.520> be<00:01:19.609> right<00:01:19.789> on<00:01:19.819> the<00:01:20.029> edge

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
you don't want to be right on the edge

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.480 
you don't want to be right on the edge
of<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.539> you<00:01:20.659> want<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.929> be<00:01:21.020> across<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.709> and<00:01:21.889> try

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
of it you want to be across it and try

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.910 
of it you want to be across it and try
to<00:01:22.520> stay<00:01:22.880> ninety<00:01:23.299> degrees<00:01:23.659> to<00:01:24.109> your<00:01:24.139> solder

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
to stay ninety degrees to your solder

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.449 
to stay ninety degrees to your solder
line<00:01:25.279> and<00:01:26.139> then<00:01:27.139> feed<00:01:27.469> your<00:01:27.649> solder<00:01:27.920> into<00:01:28.219> the

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:28.459 
line and then feed your solder into the

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:31.419 
line and then feed your solder into the
top<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:28.969> your<00:01:29.119> iron<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:30.130> then<00:01:31.130> I'm<00:01:31.279> going<00:01:31.399> to

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
top of your iron and then I'm going to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.459 
top of your iron and then I'm going to
swing<00:01:31.700> my<00:01:31.880> elbow<00:01:32.270> out<00:01:32.479> here<00:01:32.779> so<00:01:32.959> I<00:01:32.990> can<00:01:33.200> stay

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
swing my elbow out here so I can stay

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.859 
swing my elbow out here so I can stay
ninety<00:01:33.859> degrees<00:01:34.249> and<00:01:35.240> I'm<00:01:35.389> also<00:01:35.569> going<00:01:35.810> to

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
ninety degrees and I'm also going to

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.989 
ninety degrees and I'm also going to
watch<00:01:36.079> that<00:01:36.380> pool<00:01:36.619> of<00:01:36.799> solder<00:01:37.069> on<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.549> back<00:01:37.759> of

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
watch that pool of solder on the back of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.169 
watch that pool of solder on the back of
my<00:01:38.179> iron<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:39.130> that'll<00:01:40.130> tell<00:01:40.340> me<00:01:40.549> when<00:01:40.789> I<00:01:40.819> need

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
my iron and that'll tell me when I need

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.539 
my iron and that'll tell me when I need
to<00:01:41.299> pull<00:01:41.539> my<00:01:41.749> solder<00:01:42.109> off<00:01:42.439> and<00:01:42.859> then<00:01:43.399> I'm

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
to pull my solder off and then I'm

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.179 
to pull my solder off and then I'm
coming<00:01:43.789> off<00:01:44.119> with<00:01:44.719> my<00:01:44.869> iron<00:01:45.109> onto<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.920> glass

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
coming off with my iron onto the glass

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.149 
coming off with my iron onto the glass
and<00:01:46.639> lifting<00:01:47.479> up<00:01:47.659> when<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:48.349> pull<00:01:48.619> off<00:01:51.159> onto

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
and lifting up when you pull off onto

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.609 
and lifting up when you pull off onto
the<00:01:52.609> glass<00:01:52.909> what<00:01:53.419> happens<00:01:53.869> is<00:01:54.109> you<00:01:54.259> don't<00:01:54.409> end

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
the glass what happens is you don't end

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.099 
the glass what happens is you don't end
up<00:01:54.770> with<00:01:54.799> a<00:01:55.009> big<00:01:55.219> blob<00:01:55.490> of<00:01:55.700> solder<00:01:55.939> on<00:01:56.419> your

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
up with a big blob of solder on your

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.399 
up with a big blob of solder on your
joint<00:01:57.409> or<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:57.889> where<00:01:58.219> you've<00:01:58.399> ended<00:01:58.520> up<00:01:59.049> so<00:02:00.049> the

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
joint or on where you've ended up so the

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.279 
joint or on where you've ended up so the
next<00:02:00.619> thing<00:02:00.829> that<00:02:00.859> you'd<00:02:01.099> want<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.399> do<00:02:01.609> is<00:02:02.289> melt

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
next thing that you'd want to do is melt

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.889 
next thing that you'd want to do is melt
your<00:02:03.469> joint<00:02:03.829> again<00:02:04.219> and<00:02:05.679> then<00:02:07.330> just<00:02:08.330> feed<00:02:08.690> your

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
your joint again and then just feed your

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.339 
your joint again and then just feed your
solder<00:02:09.170> in<00:02:10.060> again<00:02:11.060> swing<00:02:11.420> your<00:02:11.599> elbow<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.140> or

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
solder in again swing your elbow in or

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.870 
solder in again swing your elbow in or
out<00:02:12.500> as<00:02:12.770> need<00:02:13.100> be<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.900> then<00:02:15.590> come<00:02:16.400> off<00:02:16.580> on<00:02:16.760> the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
out as need be and then come off on the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.920 
out as need be and then come off on the
glass<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.360> lift

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
glass and lift

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.500 
glass and lift
now<00:02:18.590> when<00:02:18.829> you<00:02:18.950> don't<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.459> enough<00:02:19.819> solder<00:02:20.180> on

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
now when you don't have enough solder on

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.660 
now when you don't have enough solder on
it's<00:02:20.900> going<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.170> turn<00:02:21.439> flat<00:02:21.829> like<00:02:22.129> this<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.610> you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
it's going to turn flat like this so you

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.649 
it's going to turn flat like this so you
need<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:23.030> push<00:02:23.269> farther<00:02:24.040> in<00:02:25.040> with<00:02:25.700> your<00:02:25.879> solder

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
need to push farther in with your solder

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.069 
need to push farther in with your solder
to<00:02:27.409> get<00:02:27.620> your<00:02:27.829> bead<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.879> round<00:02:29.209> up<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:29.840> I'll

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
to get your bead to round up so I'll

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.420 
to get your bead to round up so I'll
just<00:02:30.290> press<00:02:30.590> more<00:02:31.099> solder<00:02:31.939> into<00:02:32.329> my<00:02:32.599> iron<00:02:32.840> and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
just press more solder into my iron and

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.039 
just press more solder into my iron and
then<00:02:34.430> remelt<00:02:34.879> that<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.450> come<00:02:35.599> off<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:35.930> my

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
then remelt that and come off on my

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.530 
then remelt that and come off on my
glass<00:02:36.349> and<00:02:36.769> then<00:02:37.340> sometimes<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.879> have<00:02:38.090> extra

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
glass and then sometimes you have extra

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.509 
glass and then sometimes you have extra
solder<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.319> just<00:02:39.560> shake<00:02:39.739> it<00:02:39.769> off<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.430> then

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
solder so you just shake it off and then

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.849 
solder so you just shake it off and then
wipe<00:02:40.730> your<00:02:40.939> tip<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:41.689> don't<00:02:41.930> hit<00:02:42.109> your<00:02:42.260> iron<00:02:42.500> on

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
wipe your tip but don't hit your iron on

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.319 
wipe your tip but don't hit your iron on
your<00:02:42.890> home<00:02:43.250> assault<00:02:43.609> board<00:02:43.849> because<00:02:44.299> that

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
your home assault board because that

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.149 
your home assault board because that
could<00:02:44.870> ruin<00:02:45.140> your<00:02:45.409> iron<00:02:46.030> okay<00:02:47.079> if<00:02:48.079> you<00:02:48.920> have

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
could ruin your iron okay if you have

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.490 
could ruin your iron okay if you have
too<00:02:49.459> much<00:02:49.700> solder<00:02:50.090> on<00:02:50.450> I'll<00:02:50.810> put<00:02:51.200> too<00:02:51.349> much

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
too much solder on I'll put too much

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.149 
too much solder on I'll put too much
right<00:02:51.799> here<00:02:53.079> that's<00:02:54.079> because<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.590> press<00:02:54.920> too

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
right here that's because you press too

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.670 
right here that's because you press too
hard<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:56.209> if<00:02:56.359> you<00:02:56.450> have<00:02:56.659> too<00:02:56.870> much<00:02:57.049> like<00:02:57.349> this

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
hard so if you have too much like this

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.830 
hard so if you have too much like this
there's<00:02:58.040> two<00:02:58.280> things<00:02:58.549> that<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:58.909> can<00:02:59.060> do<00:02:59.239> you

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
there's two things that you can do you

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.470 
there's two things that you can do you
can<00:03:00.079> either<00:03:00.379> move<00:03:00.769> it<00:03:00.920> along<00:03:01.010> by<00:03:01.579> remelt<00:03:02.209> it

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
can either move it along by remelt it

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.349 
can either move it along by remelt it
and<00:03:02.840> just<00:03:03.680> moving<00:03:04.069> it<00:03:04.189> down<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.239> get

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
and just moving it down like this to get

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:11.849 
and just moving it down like this to get
rid<00:03:05.599> of<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.900> or<00:03:07.420> if<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:09.109> have<00:03:09.439> too<00:03:09.650> much<00:03:09.799> again

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
rid of it or if you have too much again

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.319 
rid of it or if you have too much again
you've<00:03:12.859> got<00:03:12.889> a<00:03:13.069> big<00:03:13.280> blob<00:03:13.549> like<00:03:13.819> that<00:03:14.030> wipe

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
you've got a big blob like that wipe

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.339 
you've got a big blob like that wipe
your<00:03:14.540> tip<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.670> then<00:03:16.670> set<00:03:17.150> your<00:03:17.180> tip<00:03:17.720> down<00:03:17.930> flat

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
your tip and then set your tip down flat

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.869 
your tip and then set your tip down flat
because<00:03:18.709> that's<00:03:18.920> going<00:03:19.099> to<00:03:19.159> take<00:03:19.370> your<00:03:19.579> solder

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
because that's going to take your solder

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.449 
because that's going to take your solder
off<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.540> see<00:03:21.260> how<00:03:21.409> you<00:03:21.470> drop<00:03:21.829> solder<00:03:22.129> there

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
off and see how you drop solder there

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.330 
off and see how you drop solder there
wipe<00:03:22.849> your<00:03:23.000> tip<00:03:23.209> again<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.949> just<00:03:24.949> do<00:03:25.129> that

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
wipe your tip again and just do that

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.849 
wipe your tip again and just do that
maybe<00:03:25.609> two<00:03:25.849> or<00:03:25.970> three<00:03:26.000> times<00:03:26.449> and<00:03:26.840> then<00:03:27.500> let

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
maybe two or three times and then let

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.330 
maybe two or three times and then let
your<00:03:28.099> this<00:03:28.669> area<00:03:29.180> cool<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:30.799> solder<00:03:31.069> is<00:03:31.190> a

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
your this area cool the solder is a

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.369 
your this area cool the solder is a
metal<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.030> holds<00:03:32.239> heat<00:03:32.629> so<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:32.989> want<00:03:33.290> to

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
metal and it holds heat so you want to

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.439 
metal and it holds heat so you want to
make<00:03:33.500> sure<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:33.889> that<00:03:34.069> area<00:03:34.310> cools<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.000> you

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
make sure that that area cools and you

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.909 
make sure that that area cools and you
don't<00:03:35.629> work<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:35.989> too<00:03:36.139> much<00:03:36.349> because<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.769> can

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
don't work it too much because that can

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.059 
don't work it too much because that can
crack<00:03:37.099> your<00:03:37.280> glass<00:03:37.599> so<00:03:38.650> after<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.739> finish

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
crack your glass so after you finish

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.770 
crack your glass so after you finish
with<00:03:40.220> your<00:03:40.370> whole<00:03:40.609> panel<00:03:41.090> you'd<00:03:41.269> want<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.599> turn

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
with your whole panel you'd want to turn

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.930 
with your whole panel you'd want to turn
it<00:03:41.930> over<00:03:42.049> and<00:03:42.500> solder<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.190> backside<00:03:43.699> of<00:03:43.730> your

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
it over and solder the backside of your

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.359 
it over and solder the backside of your
panel
