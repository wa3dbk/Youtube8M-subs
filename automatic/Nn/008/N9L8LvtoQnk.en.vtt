the<00:01:45.329> fact<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.320> there<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.829> no<00:01:47.070> excess<00:01:47.960> bulky

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the fact that there is no excess bulky

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.859 
the fact that there is no excess bulky
packaging<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.210> gets<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.840> my

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
packaging because that really gets on my

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.179 
packaging because that really gets on my
nerves<00:01:52.200> when<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.920> can't<00:01:53.990> like<00:01:54.990> match<00:01:55.409> my<00:01:55.710> skin

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
nerves when I can't like match my skin

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.090 
nerves when I can't like match my skin
in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.030> store<00:01:57.380> because<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.469> can't<00:01:58.710> see<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100

excess<00:02:04.829> packaging<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.520> really<00:02:06.060> really

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
excess packaging I really really

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.680 
excess packaging I really really
appreciate<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
appreciate that with the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.070 
appreciate that with the
Foundation<00:02:09.240> also<00:02:10.240> really<00:02:10.750> like<00:02:10.930> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
Foundation also really like the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.110 
Foundation also really like the
consistency<00:02:11.410> now<00:02:12.070> this<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.820> cream

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
consistency now this is a cream

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.000 
consistency now this is a cream
foundation<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:13.930> it's<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.230> little<00:02:14.410> bit<00:02:14.650> thicker

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
foundation so it's a little bit thicker

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.150 
foundation so it's a little bit thicker
than<00:02:15.270> your<00:02:16.270> regular<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:17.050> liquid<00:02:17.530> foundation

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
than your regular like liquid foundation

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.790 
than your regular like liquid foundation
but<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.330> same<00:02:19.540> time<00:02:19.780> it's<00:02:20.110> not<00:02:20.380> heavy

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
but at the same time it's not heavy

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.030 
but at the same time it's not heavy
feeling<00:02:21.460> I<00:02:21.700> really<00:02:22.390> like<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.900> texture<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.770> like

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
feeling I really like the texture I like

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.180 
feeling I really like the texture I like
the<00:02:24.220> coverage<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.970> would<00:02:25.480> say<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.930> has<00:02:26.160> like<00:02:27.160> a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
the coverage I would say it has like a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.550 
the coverage I would say it has like a
strong<00:02:27.670> medium<00:02:28.270> coverage<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.960> wouldn't<00:02:29.380> go<00:02:29.500> so

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
strong medium coverage I wouldn't go so

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.620 
strong medium coverage I wouldn't go so
far<00:02:29.800> as<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.310> say<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.520> it's<00:02:30.820> completely<00:02:31.240> full

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
far as to say that it's completely full

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.110 
far as to say that it's completely full
coverage<00:02:32.140> because<00:02:33.040> your<00:02:33.190> skin<00:02:33.520> does<00:02:33.790> show

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
coverage because your skin does show

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.200 
coverage because your skin does show
through<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:36.070> actually<00:02:36.370> has<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> really<00:02:36.970> pretty

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
through it actually has a really pretty

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.940 
through it actually has a really pretty
finish<00:02:37.690> because<00:02:37.870> your<00:02:38.110> skin<00:02:38.410> still<00:02:38.710> looks

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
finish because your skin still looks

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.060 
finish because your skin still looks
like<00:02:39.040> skin<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:40.540> yeah<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.170> does<00:02:41.380> have<00:02:41.680> really

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
like skin but yeah it does have really

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.730 
like skin but yeah it does have really

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
layers of this and it doesn't kick up or

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.230

this video what it looks like on me

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.449 
this video what it looks like on me
after<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.330> few<00:03:22.390> hours<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.959> wear<00:03:23.170> now<00:03:24.070> as<00:03:24.190> far<00:03:24.400> as

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
after a few hours of wear now as far as

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.860 
after a few hours of wear now as far as
the<00:03:24.760> powder<00:03:24.970> goes<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:26.500> was<00:03:26.770> $2.99<00:03:27.640> so<00:03:28.600> that

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
the powder goes this was $2.99 so that

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.520 
the powder goes this was $2.99 so that
is<00:03:29.050> like<00:03:29.200> an<00:03:29.380> awesome<00:03:29.590> price<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.700> I<00:03:31.530> actually

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
is like an awesome price and I actually

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.330 
is like an awesome price and I actually
think<00:03:32.920> this<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.250> pretty<00:03:33.459> nice<00:03:33.700> powder

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
think this is a pretty nice powder

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.670 
think this is a pretty nice powder
it's<00:03:36.340> very<00:03:36.670> silky<00:03:37.480> smoothing<00:03:40.350> silky<00:03:41.350> smooth

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
it's very silky smoothing silky smooth

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.870 
it's very silky smoothing silky smooth
it<00:03:41.980> has<00:03:42.190> actually<00:03:42.910> pretty<00:03:43.390> good<00:03:43.690> coverage<00:03:44.230> as

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
it has actually pretty good coverage as

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.910 
it has actually pretty good coverage as
you<00:03:45.880> can<00:03:46.060> see<00:03:46.269> right<00:03:46.420> there<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:47.019> it<00:03:47.530> feels

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
you can see right there and it feels

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.360 
you can see right there and it feels
very<00:03:48.070> silky<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:50.110> actually<00:03:50.530> has<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.680> really<00:03:50.769> nice

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
very silky it actually has a really nice

very silky it actually has a really nice
nice<00:03:51.910> texture<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.480> like<00:03:52.570> that<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:54.580> downside<00:03:55.060> to

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
nice texture I like that the downside to

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.530 
nice texture I like that the downside to
this<00:03:55.690> powder<00:03:55.989> is<00:03:56.320> it<00:03:56.500> can<00:03:56.769> be<00:03:57.040> kind<00:03:57.489> of<00:03:57.640> powdery

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
this powder is it can be kind of powdery

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.259
