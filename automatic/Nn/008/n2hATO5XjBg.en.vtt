healthy i said loogan MVC is the deal
with<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> s2<00:00:25.949> last<00:00:26.220> year<00:00:26.519> which<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.060> because

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
with the s2 last year which is because

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.630 
with the s2 last year which is because
they<00:00:27.570> wanted<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.170> global<00:00:28.769> rollout<00:00:29.039> who<00:00:29.400> wanted

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
they wanted a global rollout who wanted

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.510 
they wanted a global rollout who wanted
to<00:00:29.699> roll<00:00:29.939> off<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.420> device<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.949> multiple

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
to roll off this device on in multiple

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.180 
to roll off this device on in multiple
places<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> same<00:00:33.750> time<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.710> forty

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
places at the same time like forty

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.470 
places at the same time like forty
different<00:00:35.219> markets<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> same<00:00:36.210> time<00:00:36.420> i

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
different markets at the same time i

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.240 
different markets at the same time i
think<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.230> what<00:00:37.739> they<00:00:37.890> were<00:00:37.950> saying

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
think that was what they were saying

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.830 
think that was what they were saying
about<00:00:38.340> s3<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.210> that's<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> happen

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
about s3 that that's going to happen

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.369 
about s3 that that's going to happen
with<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.190> last<00:00:41.969> year<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:42.329> had<00:00:42.660> s<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
with that one so last year we had s to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.560 
with that one so last year we had s to
launch<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.760> Europe<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.390> those

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
launch in you know Europe and those

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.990 
launch in you know Europe and those
countries<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:46.110> May<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.250> would<00:00:47.520> make<00:00:47.700> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
countries in May so this would make it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.660 
countries in May so this would make it
one<00:00:48.300> more<00:00:48.450> foster<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.559> an<00:00:50.160> April

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
one more foster if they do an April

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.369 
one more foster if they do an April
launch<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:51.809> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.199> interesting

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
launch but it's going to be interesting

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
foam before the summer but of course we

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.450 
foam before the summer but of course we
have<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.470> know<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> media<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.010> haven't<00:01:11.280> been
