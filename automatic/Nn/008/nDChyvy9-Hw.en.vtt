00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
not as good the problem is that the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.920 
not as good the problem is that the
camera<00:02:44.879> is<00:02:44.940> different<00:02:45.329> than<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.480> normal<00:02:45.780> game

you need to switch players the camera

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.180 
you need to switch players the camera
will<00:02:51.060> slowly<00:02:51.450> pan<00:02:52.049> over<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.650> it's<00:02:52.769> very

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
will slowly pan over and it's very

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.369 
will slowly pan over and it's very
disordered<00:02:53.810> offensively<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.019> much<00:02:55.200> better

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
disordered offensively it's much better

a<00:02:55.680> quarterback<00:02:56.250> can<00:02:56.459> coordinate<00:02:56.879> very<00:02:57.239> well

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
a quarterback can coordinate very well

a quarterback can coordinate very well
with<00:02:57.599> his<00:02:57.720> friend<00:02:57.989> playing<00:02:58.260> running<00:02:58.470> back<00:02:58.620> or

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
with his friend playing running back or

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.800 
with his friend playing running back or
wide<00:02:59.069> receiver<00:02:59.459> for<00:02:59.970> example<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:00.569> much

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
wide receiver for example it's much

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.479 
wide receiver for example it's much
easier<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.379> wide<00:03:01.560> receiver<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.099> carve<00:03:02.340> his

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
easier for a wide receiver to carve his

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.789 
easier for a wide receiver to carve his
own<00:03:02.579> path<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.090> go<00:03:03.269> for<00:03:03.420> an<00:03:03.480> easy<00:03:03.599> catch<00:03:03.900> co-op

own path and go for an easy catch co-op

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.800 
own path and go for an easy catch co-op
is<00:03:04.950> an<00:03:05.069> interesting<00:03:05.430> idea<00:03:05.549> but<00:03:06.000> EA<00:03:06.329> is<00:03:06.599> going

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
is an interesting idea but EA is going

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.030 
is an interesting idea but EA is going
to<00:03:06.870> have<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.049> fix<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.379> camera<00:03:07.560> angle<00:03:07.829> on

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
to have to fix the camera angle on

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.190 
to have to fix the camera angle on
defense<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:09.090> addition<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.599> those<00:03:09.750> two<00:03:09.959> modes

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
defense in addition to those two modes

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.869 
defense in addition to those two modes
there<00:03:10.560> are<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.769> lot<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.040> little<00:03:11.370> tweaks<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.819> the

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
there are a lot of little tweaks to the

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.339 
there are a lot of little tweaks to the
gameplay<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.510> make<00:03:12.720> for<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.959> better<00:03:13.049> match

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
gameplay that make for a better match

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.650 
gameplay that make for a better match
the<00:03:14.069> gameplay<00:03:14.459> has<00:03:14.609> been<00:03:14.760> slowed<00:03:15.090> down<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:15.599> you

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
the gameplay has been slowed down so you

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.000 
the gameplay has been slowed down so you
have<00:03:15.780> more<00:03:15.930> time<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.260> make<00:03:16.410> decisions<00:03:16.560> and

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
have more time to make decisions and

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.069 
have more time to make decisions and
pull<00:03:17.160> off<00:03:17.280> moves<00:03:17.549> actually<00:03:18.450> like<00:03:18.599> this<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
pull off moves actually like this it

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.690 
pull off moves actually like this it
makes<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.440> less<00:03:19.620> like<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:19.859> video<00:03:20.040> game<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.370> more

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
makes it less like a video game and more

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.580 
makes it less like a video game and more
like<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:20.940> real<00:03:21.060> thing<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:22.019> blocking<00:03:22.410> system

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
like the real thing the blocking system

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.620 
like the real thing the blocking system
is<00:03:22.829> also<00:03:23.069> much<00:03:23.340> better<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:24.060> quarterback<00:03:24.450> can

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
is also much better the quarterback can

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.089 
is also much better the quarterback can
actually<00:03:24.870> step<00:03:25.079> into<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.380> pocket<00:03:25.680> now<00:03:25.829> and

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
actually step into the pocket now and

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.530 
actually step into the pocket now and
controlling<00:03:26.519> defensive<00:03:27.000> moves<00:03:27.209> with<00:03:27.419> the
