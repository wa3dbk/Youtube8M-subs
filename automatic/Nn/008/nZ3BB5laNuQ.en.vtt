pain to make because it only makes one

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.629 
pain to make because it only makes one
killable<00:06:41.419> per<00:06:41.630> egg<00:06:42.070> and<00:06:43.070> then<00:06:43.220> you<00:06:43.310> also<00:06:43.430> need

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
killable per egg and then you also need

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:44.800 
killable per egg and then you also need
vegetables<00:06:43.850> you<00:06:44.360> need<00:06:44.510> to<00:06:44.570> have<00:06:44.660> like<00:06:44.750> a

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
vegetables you need to have like a

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.980 
vegetables you need to have like a
garden<00:06:45.229> growing<00:06:45.560> as<00:06:45.830> well<00:06:46.360> so<00:06:47.360> the<00:06:47.630> more

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
garden growing as well so the more

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.930 
garden growing as well so the more
dinosaurs<00:06:48.470> you<00:06:48.620> have<00:06:48.650> the<00:06:49.430> better<00:06:49.639> you'll<00:06:49.880> be

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
dinosaurs you have the better you'll be

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.090 
dinosaurs you have the better you'll be
doing<00:06:50.419> because<00:06:51.050> you'll<00:06:51.260> have<00:06:51.500> more<00:06:51.889> eggs

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
doing because you'll have more eggs
