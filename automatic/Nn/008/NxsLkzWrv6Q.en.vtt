00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
don't know how much power you have left

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.299 
don't know how much power you have left
right<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.139> think<00:00:10.710> you're<00:00:10.830> always<00:00:11.010> just<00:00:11.130> like

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
right I think you're always just like

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.770 
right I think you're always just like
well<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.820> don't<00:00:11.940> know<00:00:12.179> if<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.330> batteries<00:00:12.660> your

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
well I don't know if the batteries your

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.120 
well I don't know if the batteries your
charger<00:00:13.139> my<00:00:13.259> double<00:00:13.530> A's<00:00:13.679> have<00:00:13.920> enough<00:00:14.099> juice

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
charger my double A's have enough juice

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.490 
charger my double A's have enough juice
right<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.509> assume<00:00:16.020> when<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.289> check

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
right so you just assume when you check

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.700 
right so you just assume when you check
in<00:00:16.650> your<00:00:16.740> home<00:00:16.980> tires<00:00:17.220> turn<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:18.090> good<00:00:18.710> well

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
in your home tires turn all good well

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.340 
in your home tires turn all good well
one<00:00:20.220> thing<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.520> bought<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.970> bought<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:22.170> boat

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
one thing I bought I bought the boat

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.700 
one thing I bought I bought the boat
watch<00:00:22.650> from<00:00:23.130> hobbico<00:00:23.600> what<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.810> it's<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
watch from hobbico what it is it's a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.320 
watch from hobbico what it is it's a
voltage<00:00:26.400> meter<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.849> when<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.060> plug<00:00:27.240> your

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
voltage meter so when you plug your

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.080 
voltage meter so when you plug your
battery<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.990> will<00:00:28.199> show<00:00:28.460> green<00:00:29.460> which<00:00:29.939> is

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
battery in it will show green which is

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.420 
battery in it will show green which is
the<00:00:30.269> last<00:00:30.660> Holly<00:00:30.869> d<00:00:31.050> here<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:32.070> then<00:00:32.160> go<00:00:32.189> all

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the last Holly d here and then go all

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.340 
the last Holly d here and then go all
the<00:00:32.489> way<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> red<00:00:33.170> dead<00:00:34.640> look<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.540> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the way to red dead look so it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.380 
the way to red dead look so it
constantly<00:00:37.800> fluctuates<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.520> you're<00:00:38.790> sucking

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
constantly fluctuates as you're sucking

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.590 
constantly fluctuates as you're sucking
voltage<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.379> want<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.739> stay<00:00:40.920> green<00:00:41.600> as

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
voltage but you want to stay green as

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.760 
voltage but you want to stay green as
much<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:42.870> possible<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.739> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
much as possible so if you have a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.729 
much as possible so if you have a
humpback<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> six<00:00:44.820> volt<00:00:44.879> battery

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
humpback like a six volt battery

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.040 
humpback like a six volt battery

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
high-end servos all like if I had my

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.369 
high-end servos all like if I had my
braking<00:00:56.910> at<00:00:57.000> full<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.539> cranked<00:00:57.960> over<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.289> was

braking at full and cranked over I was

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.840 
braking at full and cranked over I was
going<00:00:58.500> through<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> corner<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.340> name<00:00:59.550> stays

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
going through a corner this name stays

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
going through a corner this name stays
great<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.199> soon<00:01:01.289> as<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.559> starts<00:01:01.770> tipping

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
great but as soon as it starts tipping

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.070 
great but as soon as it starts tipping
you<00:01:02.399> know<00:01:02.579> you're<00:01:02.789> done<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.899> always<00:01:03.989> want

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

know look at it okay still good so best
way<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> test<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.430> batteries<00:01:14.460> you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
way to test to see if your batteries you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
way to test to see if your batteries you
get<00:01:14.880> turn<00:01:15.210> full<00:01:15.420> triangle<00:01:15.869> hit<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> brake<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
get turn full triangle hit the brake and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.219 
get turn full triangle hit the brake and
jack<00:01:17.909> will<00:01:18.360> go<00:01:18.450> down<00:01:18.600> because<00:01:18.659> you're<00:01:19.020> running

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
jack will go down because you're running

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.060 
jack will go down because you're running
both<00:01:19.350> servos<00:01:20.180> best<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.330> beste<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> little

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
both servos best I beste just a little

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.910 
both servos best I beste just a little
thing<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> hpi<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
thing to get and get the hpi one that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.530 
thing to get and get the hpi one that
goes<00:01:26.009> right<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.299> too

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
goes right here because it's too

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 
goes right here because it's too
expensive<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.890> only<00:01:29.040> twenty<00:01:29.340> bucks

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
expensive this is only twenty bucks

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.560 
expensive this is only twenty bucks

now<00:01:32.290> there's<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.620> swollen<00:01:32.830> version<00:01:32.980> probably

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
now there's the swollen version probably

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.830 
now there's the swollen version probably
could<00:01:34.000> have<00:01:34.030> fit<00:01:34.270> here<00:01:34.510> so<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:36.640> it's<00:01:37.479> not<00:01:37.630> bad

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
could have fit here so but it's not bad

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.750 
could have fit here so but it's not bad
works<00:01:38.650> good<00:01:38.860> because<00:01:39.070> I<00:01:39.130> like<00:01:39.280> it's<00:01:39.610> on<00:01:39.670> the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
works good because I like it's on the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.340 
works good because I like it's on the
outside<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.330> since<00:01:40.630> my<00:01:40.720> body<00:01:40.900> has<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.080> clear

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
outside and since my body has a clear

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.430 
outside and since my body has a clear
window<00:01:41.530> see<00:01:42.280> it<00:01:42.370> right<00:01:42.520> through<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.760> window

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440
