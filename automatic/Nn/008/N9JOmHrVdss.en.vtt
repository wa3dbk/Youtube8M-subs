while<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.640> is<00:03:09.880> looking<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.270> code<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.690> now

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
while this is looking the code in now

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.590 
while this is looking the code in now
ministers<00:03:11.890> weapon<00:03:12.280> on<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.550> score<00:03:12.820> thermal<00:03:13.360> so

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
ministers weapon on the score thermal so

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.570 
ministers weapon on the score thermal so
we<00:03:13.720> can<00:03:13.810> assume<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.530> it's<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.950> thermal<00:03:15.370> bomb

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
we can assume that it's the thermal bomb

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.550 
we can assume that it's the thermal bomb
maybe<00:03:16.090> it's<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.510> different<00:03:16.660> thermal<00:03:17.200> weapon

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
maybe it's a different thermal weapon

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.520 
maybe it's a different thermal weapon
but<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.800> chances<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:19.080> unlikely<00:03:20.080> or

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
but the chances of that unlikely or

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.190 
but the chances of that unlikely or
created<00:03:20.980> n<00:03:21.100> chill<00:03:21.400> if<00:03:21.610> they<00:03:21.820> are<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:22.209> would

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
created n chill if they are I would

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.990 
created n chill if they are I would
assume<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:23.650> is<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.920> thermal<00:03:24.280> bomb<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.730> if

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
assume this is the thermal bomb and if

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.640 
assume this is the thermal bomb and if
it<00:03:25.090> is<00:03:25.269> then<00:03:25.300> that's<00:03:25.959> gonna<00:03:26.080> be<00:03:26.140> awesome<00:03:26.320> to

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
it is then that's gonna be awesome to

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.140 
it is then that's gonna be awesome to
see<00:03:26.800> that's<00:03:27.070> on<00:03:27.250> them<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.700> game<00:03:27.910> that's

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
see that's on them the game that's

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.030 
see that's on them the game that's
mainly<00:03:28.450> polygon<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.170> be<00:03:29.320> or<00:03:29.800> when<00:03:29.890> you're

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
mainly polygon to be or when you're

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.190 
mainly polygon to be or when you're
blowing<00:03:30.220> up<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.640> moles<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.660> open<00:03:32.019> them

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
blowing up the moles and to open them

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.930 
blowing up the moles and to open them
now<00:03:32.459> won't<00:03:33.459> be<00:03:33.519> up<00:03:33.670> next<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:35.700> new<00:03:36.700> mask

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
now won't be up next is the new mask

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.370 
now won't be up next is the new mask
obviously<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.480> just<00:03:37.660> talked<00:03:37.840> about<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.200> then

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
obviously I just talked about that then

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.770 
obviously I just talked about that then
and<00:03:38.530> we<00:03:38.590> have<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.739> new<00:03:38.920> contact<00:03:39.370> jeff<00:03:40.030> now<00:03:40.750> i

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
contact specifically for heist what he

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.530 
contact specifically for heist what he
does<00:03:47.890> yet<00:03:48.100> we<00:03:48.340> do<00:03:48.489> not<00:03:48.519> know<00:03:48.910> we<00:03:49.360> don't<00:03:49.420> know

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
does yet we do not know we don't know

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.660 
does yet we do not know we don't know
what<00:03:49.720> his<00:03:49.810> rule<00:03:50.019> is<00:03:50.230> butter<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.340> we'll<00:03:51.459> see

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
what his rule is butter and we'll see

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.270 
what his rule is butter and we'll see
what<00:03:51.880> happens<00:03:52.000> about<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.660> future

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
what happens about that in the future

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.770 
what happens about that in the future
next<00:03:54.280> we<00:03:54.370> haven't<00:03:54.670> never<00:03:55.180> occurred<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.630> for

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
next we haven't never occurred in for

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.350 
next we haven't never occurred in for
the<00:03:55.840> Hydra<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:56.950> says<00:03:57.130> Pegasus<00:03:57.820> on<00:03:58.030> walk

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
the Hydra that it says Pegasus on walk

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.509 
the Hydra that it says Pegasus on walk
so<00:03:58.959> we<00:03:59.320> can<00:03:59.440> assume<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.830> we<00:04:00.160> can<00:04:00.280> buy<00:04:00.459> this

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
so we can assume that we can buy this

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.910 
so we can assume that we can buy this
from<00:04:00.790> GTA<00:04:01.209> 5<00:04:01.480> online<00:04:01.690> free<00:04:02.110> roam<00:04:02.320> which<00:04:02.800> is

going to be absolutely crazy you know
enough<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.140> buy<00:04:05.350> this<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.739> drive<00:04:06.100> around<00:04:06.280> in

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
enough to buy this and drive around in

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.100 
enough to buy this and drive around in

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
going to be full of them so it's gonna

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.600 
going to be full of them so it's gonna
be<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.720> says<00:04:13.900> here<00:04:14.080> 1.5<00:04:14.530> million<00:04:15.489> at<00:04:15.580> the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
be it says here 1.5 million at the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.360 
be it says here 1.5 million at the
moment<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.209> that's<00:04:16.359> not<00:04:16.570> that<00:04:16.660> much<00:04:16.720> really

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
moment so that's not that much really

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.920 
moment so that's not that much really
every<00:04:18.370> such<00:04:18.580> overpowered<00:04:19.419> weapon<00:04:19.540> that's

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
every such overpowered weapon that's

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.320 
every such overpowered weapon that's
going<00:04:20.229> to<00:04:20.320> be<00:04:20.440> an<00:04:20.650> interest<00:04:21.190> in<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.549> see

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
going to be an interest in to see

don't<00:04:51.849> know<00:04:52.060> we<00:04:52.300> don't<00:04:52.330> know<00:04:52.539> what<00:04:52.780> that<00:04:52.810> is

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
don't know we don't know what that is

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.779 
don't know we don't know what that is
and<00:04:53.169> so<00:04:53.289> I'm<00:04:53.409> not<00:04:53.530> going<00:04:53.770> to<00:04:53.860> say<00:04:54.129> is<00:04:54.310> this<00:04:54.520> and

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
and so I'm not going to say is this and

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.399 
and so I'm not going to say is this and
start<00:04:55.060> because<00:04:55.389> we<00:04:55.599> don't<00:04:55.780> know<00:04:55.960> yet<00:04:56.110> it's

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
start because we don't know yet it's

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.029 
start because we don't know yet it's
pure<00:04:56.770> speculation<00:04:56.909> at<00:04:57.909> this<00:04:57.969> point<00:04:58.300> now<00:04:59.289> I<00:04:59.319> did

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
pure speculation at this point now I did

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.860 
pure speculation at this point now I did
miss<00:05:00.219> out<00:05:00.400> this<00:05:00.580> but<00:05:00.879> then<00:05:01.030> there<00:05:01.240> is<00:05:01.360> a<00:05:01.569> mother

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
miss out this but then there is a mother

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.020 
miss out this but then there is a mother
coding<00:05:02.259> pilot<00:05:03.039> on<00:05:03.069> the<00:05:03.190> school<00:05:03.430> school<00:05:03.729> on<00:05:04.000> the

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
coding pilot on the school school on the

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.209 
coding pilot on the school school on the
school<00:05:04.330> vehicle<00:05:04.780> underscore<00:05:05.349> Hydra<00:05:05.949> and

school vehicle underscore Hydra and

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.339 
school vehicle underscore Hydra and
that's<00:05:06.729> basically<00:05:07.000> just<00:05:07.780> going<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.110> put<00:05:08.259> the

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
that's basically just going to put the

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.899 
that's basically just going to put the
Hydra<00:05:08.710> into<00:05:08.889> pilot<00:05:09.219> school<00:05:09.490> so<00:05:09.639> you<00:05:09.729> can
