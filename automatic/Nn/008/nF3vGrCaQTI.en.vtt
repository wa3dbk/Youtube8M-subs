I don't think I'm kind of normal in the
way<00:00:42.409> I<00:00:42.440> do<00:00:42.559> things<00:00:42.860> but<00:00:43.190> I<00:00:43.250> certainly<00:00:43.820> defined

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.770 
a few sound effects and a few noises and
stuff<00:01:01.430> but<00:01:01.670> for<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.059> most<00:01:02.180> part<00:01:02.330> it's<00:01:02.600> kind<00:01:02.750> of

drums<00:01:03.610> so<00:01:04.610> we<00:01:04.699> kind<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:04.940> open<00:01:05.210> all<00:01:05.299> these<00:01:05.449> up<00:01:05.600> I

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
drums so we kind of open all these up I

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.780 
drums so we kind of open all these up I
can<00:01:05.869> show<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.140> what<00:01:06.350> I<00:01:06.380> mean

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.730 
so I've got a lot of drums it's pretty
crazy<00:01:10.719> but<00:01:11.719> the<00:01:11.810> reason<00:01:12.079> why<00:01:12.259> it's<00:01:12.530> kind<00:01:12.710> of

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
crazy but the reason why it's kind of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.590 
crazy but the reason why it's kind of
nice<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:12.950> see<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.340> all<00:01:13.430> in<00:01:13.549> audio<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.329> can

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
nice to see it all in audio is I can

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.420 
nice to see it all in audio is I can
really<00:01:14.810> just<00:01:14.899> see<00:01:15.409> what's<00:01:15.619> going<00:01:15.859> on<00:01:16.009> in<00:01:16.189> terms

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
really just see what's going on in terms

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.969 
really just see what's going on in terms
of<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.820> waveform<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.229> sounds<00:01:18.859> and

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
of the waveform and the sounds and

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.130 
of the waveform and the sounds and
what's<00:01:19.430> going<00:01:19.640> on<00:01:19.820> in<00:01:20.299> terms<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.719> the<00:01:20.780> attack

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
what's going on in terms of the attack

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.490 
what's going on in terms of the attack
and<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.189> decay<00:01:22.579> the<00:01:23.210> tales<00:01:23.539> of<00:01:23.840> sounds<00:01:24.409> it

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
and the decay the tales of sounds it

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.929 
and the decay the tales of sounds it
just<00:01:24.740> allows<00:01:24.950> me<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.189> kind<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.399> see<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.670> lot<00:01:25.909> more

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
just allows me to kind of see a lot more

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.550 
just allows me to kind of see a lot more
accurately<00:01:26.509> what's<00:01:26.810> going<00:01:26.960> on<00:01:27.109> also<00:01:27.500> it

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
accurately what's going on also it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.899 
accurately what's going on also it
allows<00:01:27.679> me<00:01:27.829> to<00:01:27.950> chop<00:01:28.159> things<00:01:28.340> up<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.640> lot<00:01:28.759> better

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
allows me to chop things up a lot better

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.060 
allows me to chop things up a lot better
and<00:01:29.689> kind<00:01:29.869> of<00:01:29.899> clean<00:01:30.140> things<00:01:30.380> up<00:01:30.590> as<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:30.979> when

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
and kind of clean things up as and when

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.760 
and kind of clean things up as and when
I<00:01:31.100> need<00:01:31.369> to<00:01:31.810> in<00:01:32.810> terms<00:01:33.049> of<00:01:33.259> just<00:01:33.500> kind<00:01:33.710> of

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
I need to in terms of just kind of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.789 
I need to in terms of just kind of
moving<00:01:34.759> there<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.929> tail<00:01:36.170> bits<00:01:36.439> of<00:01:36.590> snares

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
moving there and the tail bits of snares

just kind of keeping a bit more kind of

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.910 
just kind of keeping a bit more kind of
in<00:01:41.060> control<00:01:41.420> which<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.929> just<00:01:42.320> what<00:01:42.439> I<00:01:42.499> like<00:01:42.710> and

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
in control which is just what I like and

just<00:01:43.850> kind<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.090> seeing<00:01:44.329> exactly<00:01:45.079> what<00:01:45.289> is

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
just kind of seeing exactly what is

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.529 
just kind of seeing exactly what is
going<00:01:45.439> on<00:01:45.710> any<00:01:46.280> particular<00:01:46.820> time<00:01:47.030> there's<00:01:47.359> no

going on any particular time there's no
there's<00:01:48.439> no<00:01:48.590> kind<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.950> imagining<00:01:49.609> what's

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
there's no kind of imagining what's

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.849 
there's no kind of imagining what's
going<00:01:50.060> on<00:01:50.210> or<00:01:50.840> hearing<00:01:51.200> what's<00:01:51.380> going<00:01:51.619> on<00:01:51.740> you

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
going on or hearing what's going on you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.169 
going on or hearing what's going on you
can<00:01:52.009> literally<00:01:52.310> see<00:01:52.609> what<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:52.999> going<00:01:53.149> to

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
can literally see what is going to

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.940 
can literally see what is going to
happen<00:01:53.329> and<00:01:53.960> that<00:01:54.229> just<00:01:54.409> kind<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.590> suits<00:01:54.829> the

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
happen and that just kind of suits the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.429 
happen and that just kind of suits the
way<00:01:55.009> I<00:01:55.039> work<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.549> lot<00:01:55.909> better<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:57.170> I'll<00:01:57.229> show<00:01:57.380> you

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
way I work a lot better so I'll show you

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.830 
way I work a lot better so I'll show you
through<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.740> details<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.310> look<00:01:58.549> out<00:01:58.700> for<00:01:58.840> and

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
through the details I look out for and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.200 
through the details I look out for and
why<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.170> look<00:02:00.619> at<00:02:00.740> things<00:02:01.009> in<00:02:01.130> audio<00:02:01.399> clips<00:02:01.670> so

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
why I look at things in audio clips so

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.559 
why I look at things in audio clips so
the<00:02:02.359> main<00:02:02.630> one<00:02:02.899> is<00:02:03.049> probably<00:02:03.319> gonna<00:02:03.439> be<00:02:03.499> fades

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
the main one is probably gonna be fades

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.539 
the main one is probably gonna be fades
so<00:02:05.569> if<00:02:06.109> I<00:02:06.200> going<00:02:06.439> to<00:02:06.499> bring<00:02:06.679> up<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:06.979> fader<00:02:07.280> that

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
so if I going to bring up the fader that

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.010 
so if I going to bring up the fader that
I<00:02:07.579> did<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.759> whole<00:02:07.850> video<00:02:07.999> on<00:02:08.179> this<00:02:08.390> brush<00:02:08.660> I'll

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
I did a whole video on this brush I'll

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.300 
I did a whole video on this brush I'll
show<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:09.350> now<00:02:10.180> by<00:02:11.180> default<00:02:12.190> you're<00:02:13.190> going

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
show you it now by default you're going

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.640 
show you it now by default you're going
to<00:02:13.430> zoom<00:02:13.850> at<00:02:13.970> live<00:02:14.240> preferences<00:02:15.170> there's<00:02:15.560> an

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
to zoom at live preferences there's an

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.970 
to zoom at live preferences there's an
auto<00:02:15.890> fate<00:02:16.370> setting<00:02:16.909> somewhere

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
auto fate setting somewhere

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.620 
auto fate setting somewhere
yaeko<00:02:18.930> zoom<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.140> or<00:02:20.760> create<00:02:21.760> fades<00:02:22.090> on<00:02:22.360> clip

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
yaeko zoom in or create fades on clip

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.480 
yaeko zoom in or create fades on clip
edges<00:02:22.990> that's<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.710> pretty<00:02:23.950> good<00:02:24.190> thing<00:02:24.340> in

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
edges that's a pretty good thing in

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.580 
edges that's a pretty good thing in
general<00:02:24.640> because<00:02:25.420> what<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.600> does<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:26.200> as<00:02:26.560> you

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
general because what that does is as you

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.210 
general because what that does is as you
can<00:02:26.710> see<00:02:26.830> with<00:02:27.100> this<00:02:27.190> down<00:02:27.490> sweep<00:02:27.880> here<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:29.470> fade

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
can see with this down sweep here a fade

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.890 
can see with this down sweep here a fade
selected<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.940> kind<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.210> just<00:02:31.570> brings<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
selected it kind of just brings the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.080 
selected it kind of just brings the
volume<00:02:32.230> up<00:02:32.380> over<00:02:32.950> like<00:02:33.100> four<00:02:33.370> milliseconds<00:02:33.640> or

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
volume up over like four milliseconds or

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.280 
volume up over like four milliseconds or
something<00:02:34.390> at<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.510> beginning<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.930> each<00:02:35.020> clip

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
something at the beginning of each clip

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.230 
something at the beginning of each clip
and<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.860> stops<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.310> weird<00:02:36.520> clicking<00:02:36.820> sound

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
and that stops a weird clicking sound

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.580 
and that stops a weird clicking sound
that<00:02:37.300> can<00:02:37.450> happen<00:02:37.660> if<00:02:37.930> your<00:02:38.050> samples<00:02:38.470> not

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
that can happen if your samples not

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.860 
that can happen if your samples not
quite<00:02:38.860> not<00:02:39.430> quite<00:02:39.670> perfect<00:02:40.150> which<00:02:40.600> is<00:02:40.690> kind<00:02:40.840> of

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
quite not quite perfect which is kind of

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.230 
quite not quite perfect which is kind of
great<00:02:41.080> like<00:02:42.010> most<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.400> time<00:02:42.550> because<00:02:43.030> you

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
great like most of the time because you

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.060 
great like most of the time because you
don't<00:02:43.390> really<00:02:43.720> hear<00:02:44.320> that<00:02:44.530> this<00:02:44.650> clip<00:02:44.890> that

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
don't really hear that this clip that

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.650 
don't really hear that this clip that
come<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.370> really<00:02:45.670> subtle<00:02:46.060> really<00:02:46.240> quick

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
come this really subtle really quick

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.140 
come this really subtle really quick
fade<00:02:46.900> let's<00:02:47.620> stop<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.980> clicking<00:02:48.370> however

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
fade let's stop the clicking however

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.240 
fade let's stop the clicking however
when<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.810> comes<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.050> drum<00:02:50.380> sounds<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:50.980> lot<00:02:51.100> the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
when it comes to drum sounds a lot the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.800 
when it comes to drum sounds a lot the
time<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.610> don't<00:02:51.820> want<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.240> fade<00:02:52.570> there

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
time you don't want that fade there

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.120 
time you don't want that fade there
because<00:02:53.140> that's<00:02:53.320> kind<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.590> getting<00:02:53.890> rid<00:02:54.100> of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
because that's kind of getting rid of

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.820 
because that's kind of getting rid of
the<00:02:54.340> actual<00:02:54.970> sound<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.470> can<00:02:56.590> see<00:02:56.680> with

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
the actual sound so you can see with

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.650 
the actual sound so you can see with
this<00:02:56.950> bass<00:02:57.130> drum<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.640> made

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
this bass drum that I made

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.780 
this bass drum that I made
there's<00:02:58.959> no<00:02:59.110> fader<00:02:59.380> tool<00:02:59.650> I've<00:03:00.310> kind<00:03:00.520> of<00:03:00.550> zoom

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
there's no fader tool I've kind of zoom

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.970 
there's no fader tool I've kind of zoom
in<00:03:00.910> or<00:03:01.060> something<00:03:01.390> but<00:03:02.140> default<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.770> fade

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
in or something but default the fade

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.729 
in or something but default the fade
would<00:03:03.160> be<00:03:03.280> out<00:03:03.400> here<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:04.570> then<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.780> wouldn't

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
would be out here and then it wouldn't

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:06.990 
would be out here and then it wouldn't
be<00:03:05.830> too<00:03:05.980> big<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.340> deal<00:03:06.520> in<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:06.730> particular

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
be too big of a deal in this particular

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000 
be too big of a deal in this particular
case<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.930> drum<00:03:08.110> was<00:03:08.230> still<00:03:08.440> sound<00:03:08.680> all<00:03:08.830> right

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
case the drum was still sound all right

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.310 
case the drum was still sound all right
but<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:09.970> made<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.300> drum<00:03:10.510> perfectly<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.080> begin

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
but I made the drum perfectly to begin

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.350 
but I made the drum perfectly to begin
with<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:11.770> I<00:03:11.800> don't<00:03:12.130> really<00:03:12.250> want<00:03:12.550> any<00:03:12.820> face<00:03:13.150> to

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
with so I don't really want any face to

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.240 
with so I don't really want any face to
kind<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.600> interrupt<00:03:13.989> things<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.410> bit<00:03:15.070> more

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
kind of interrupt things a bit more

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.250 
kind of interrupt things a bit more
obvious<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.940> an<00:03:16.180> example<00:03:16.480> would<00:03:16.750> be<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:17.080> kind

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
obvious of an example would be this kind

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.290 
obvious of an example would be this kind
of<00:03:17.350> acoustic<00:03:17.650> snare<00:03:18.010> right<00:03:18.370> here<00:03:18.580> where<00:03:19.150> as

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
of acoustic snare right here where as

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.699 
of acoustic snare right here where as
you<00:03:19.390> can<00:03:19.420> see<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.660> pulled<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.200> fade<00:03:20.410> all<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
you can see I pulled the fade all the

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.680 
you can see I pulled the fade all the
way<00:03:20.830> back<00:03:21.040> now<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.670> fade<00:03:22.030> was<00:03:22.269> like<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.570> would

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
way back now the fade was like it would

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.509 
way back now the fade was like it would
be<00:03:22.840> normally<00:03:23.530> there<00:03:23.860> would<00:03:23.920> be<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.220> kind<00:03:24.280> of

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
be normally there would be this kind of

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.610 
be normally there would be this kind of
weird<00:03:24.910> slope<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:26.019> that<00:03:26.140> would<00:03:26.290> get<00:03:26.410> rid<00:03:26.590> of

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
weird slope and that would get rid of

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.990 
weird slope and that would get rid of
some<00:03:26.890> of<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.070> punchiness<00:03:27.519> then<00:03:27.820> with<00:03:27.940> the

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
some of the punchiness then with the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.729 
some of the punchiness then with the
attack<00:03:28.269> of<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.570> snare<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.380> be<00:03:29.470> honest<00:03:29.709> you

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
attack of the snare and to be honest you

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.340 
attack of the snare and to be honest you
just<00:03:30.010> wouldn't<00:03:30.220> see<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.880> if<00:03:31.090> if<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.230> was

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
just wouldn't see that if if it was

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.320 
just wouldn't see that if if it was
in<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.590> kind<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.160> MIDI<00:03:33.370> clip<00:03:33.700> or<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.060> was<00:03:34.180> in<00:03:34.269> a

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
in a kind of a MIDI clip or it was in a

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.570 
in a kind of a MIDI clip or it was in a
drum<00:03:34.570> rack<00:03:34.750> or<00:03:34.959> something<00:03:35.070> now<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.130> could<00:03:36.549> use

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
drum rack or something now you could use

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.460 
drum rack or something now you could use
the<00:03:36.970> kind<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.540> envelopes<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:38.200> kind<00:03:38.410> of

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
the kind of the envelopes and kind of

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.640 
the kind of the envelopes and kind of
the<00:03:38.530> settings<00:03:38.980> in<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.250> drum<00:03:39.459> rack<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.880> kind<00:03:40.060> of

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
the settings in the drum rack to kind of

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.140 
the settings in the drum rack to kind of
do<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.769> same<00:03:41.799> thing<00:03:42.250> kind<00:03:42.640> of<00:03:42.730> have<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:42.970> same

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
do the same thing kind of have the same

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.120 
do the same thing kind of have the same
result<00:03:43.510> as<00:03:43.600> I<00:03:43.750> have<00:03:43.959> by<00:03:44.140> getting<00:03:44.920> rid<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.040> the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
result as I have by getting rid of the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.699 
result as I have by getting rid of the
fade<00:03:45.340> however<00:03:46.090> it's<00:03:46.600> just<00:03:47.019> a<00:03:47.170> lot<00:03:47.350> easier<00:03:47.620> for

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
fade however it's just a lot easier for

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.560 
fade however it's just a lot easier for
me<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:47.860> see<00:03:48.130> things<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.580> visualize<00:03:49.000> things<00:03:49.299> if

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
me to see things and visualize things if

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.360 
me to see things and visualize things if
I<00:03:49.810> kind<00:03:50.110> of<00:03:50.200> see<00:03:50.560> what's<00:03:50.830> going<00:03:51.070> on<00:03:51.160> with<00:03:51.310> the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
I kind of see what's going on with the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.810 
I kind of see what's going on with the
waveform<00:03:51.840> instead<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:53.459> having<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.640> kind<00:03:54.730> of

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
waveform instead of a having to kind of

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.580 
waveform instead of a having to kind of
piece<00:03:55.090> together<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.660> hear<00:03:55.930> or<00:03:56.140> imagine

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
piece together and hear or imagine

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.050 
piece together and hear or imagine
what's<00:03:56.799> going<00:03:56.980> on<00:03:57.160> if<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.489> makes<00:03:57.730> sense

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
what's going on if that makes sense

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.810 
what's going on if that makes sense
it's<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.810> pretty<00:03:58.989> cool<00:03:59.380> I<00:03:59.650> also<00:04:00.340> find<00:04:00.640> it's

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
it's a pretty cool I also find it's

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.130 
it's a pretty cool I also find it's
just<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.269> just<00:04:01.360> quite<00:04:01.630> nice<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.989> see

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
just it's just quite nice to see

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.830 
just it's just quite nice to see
literally<00:04:02.860> exactly<00:04:03.370> what's<00:04:03.760> going<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.120> and

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
literally exactly what's going on and

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.180 
literally exactly what's going on and
there's<00:04:05.290> going<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.440> be<00:04:05.530> no<00:04:05.709> messing<00:04:06.070> about

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
there's going to be no messing about

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.190 
there's going to be no messing about
there's<00:04:07.000> going<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.180> be<00:04:07.269> no<00:04:07.480> plug-ins<00:04:08.019> that<00:04:08.080> are

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
there's going to be no plug-ins that are

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.460 
there's going to be no plug-ins that are
going<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.410> be<00:04:08.470> misbehaving<00:04:09.130> or<00:04:09.400> kind<00:04:09.910> of

going to be misbehaving or kind of

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.870 
going to be misbehaving or kind of
things<00:04:11.470> aren't<00:04:11.680> going<00:04:11.799> to<00:04:11.890> be<00:04:11.920> kind<00:04:12.130> of<00:04:12.220> coming

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
things aren't going to be kind of coming

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.220 
things aren't going to be kind of coming
in<00:04:13.000> at<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.150> wrong<00:04:13.360> time<00:04:13.660> things<00:04:13.959> going<00:04:14.110> to<00:04:14.170> be

in at the wrong time things going to be
literally<00:04:14.650> just<00:04:14.829> happening<00:04:15.190> exactly<00:04:15.790> where<00:04:16.000> I

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
literally just happening exactly where I

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.930 
literally just happening exactly where I
want<00:04:16.329> them<00:04:16.479> because<00:04:16.600> they're<00:04:16.870> an<00:04:16.959> audio<00:04:17.940> and

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
want them because they're an audio and

you<00:04:19.030> can<00:04:19.150> also<00:04:19.239> see<00:04:19.540> kind<00:04:20.019> of<00:04:20.079> subtle<00:04:20.470> subtle

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
you can also see kind of subtle subtle

you can also see kind of subtle subtle
tease<00:04:21.130> with<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.340> volume<00:04:21.790> and<00:04:21.940> stuff<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.240> I

tease with the volume and stuff so I

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.520 
tease with the volume and stuff so I
want<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.419> whenever<00:04:22.540> I<00:04:22.720> can<00:04:22.840> find<00:04:23.080> some<00:04:23.229> snares

apart this is all falling apart this is

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.980 
apart this is all falling apart this is
this<00:04:54.640> is<00:04:54.850> he's<00:04:55.060> still<00:04:55.330> there<00:04:55.540> he's<00:04:55.750> still

this is he's still there he's still

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.430 
this is he's still there he's still
there<00:04:56.410> right<00:04:57.300> rolling<00:04:58.300> snares<00:04:58.600> there<00:04:59.170> you<00:04:59.260> go

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
there right rolling snares there you go

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.350 
there right rolling snares there you go
found<00:04:59.770> them<00:04:59.950> they<00:05:00.100> were<00:05:00.160> great<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:01.060> as<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.240> can

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
found them they were great so as you can

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.590 
found them they were great so as you can
see<00:05:01.420> with<00:05:01.690> some<00:05:01.810> of<00:05:01.930> these<00:05:01.990> snares<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:03.600> can

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
see with some of these snares you can

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.120 
see with some of these snares you can
see<00:05:04.720> like<00:05:04.870> this<00:05:05.050> snare<00:05:05.320> for<00:05:05.500> example<00:05:05.920> it's<00:05:06.070> a

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
see like this snare for example it's a

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.250 
see like this snare for example it's a
slightly<00:05:06.640> lower<00:05:06.940> volume<00:05:07.330> than<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.600> snare<00:05:07.870> and

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
slightly lower volume than the snare and

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.520 
slightly lower volume than the snare and
we<00:05:08.470> can<00:05:08.590> confirm<00:05:08.800> that<00:05:08.980> by<00:05:09.220> clicking<00:05:09.430> it

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
we can confirm that by clicking it

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.050 
we can confirm that by clicking it
loading<00:05:11.530> up<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.860> kind<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.370> sample<00:05:12.730> editor

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
loading up the kind of a sample editor

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.970 
loading up the kind of a sample editor
and<00:05:13.240> seeing<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.690> volumes<00:05:14.080> pulled<00:05:14.380> down<00:05:14.590> -

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
and seeing the volumes pulled down -

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.000 
and seeing the volumes pulled down -
1.86<00:05:15.610> DB<00:05:16.060> that<00:05:16.450> is<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.810> snares<00:05:17.170> so<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:17.890> can

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
1.86 DB that is the snares so you can

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.470 
1.86 DB that is the snares so you can
really<00:05:18.130> see<00:05:18.400> those<00:05:18.550> kind<00:05:18.760> of<00:05:18.820> subtle<00:05:19.150> changes

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
really see those kind of subtle changes

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.750 
really see those kind of subtle changes
that<00:05:19.540> I<00:05:19.660> programmed<00:05:20.140> in<00:05:20.400> just<00:05:21.400> a<00:05:21.460> lot<00:05:21.610> more

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
that I programmed in just a lot more

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.030 
that I programmed in just a lot more
accurately<00:05:22.410> whereas<00:05:23.410> you<00:05:23.650> could<00:05:23.800> definitely

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
accurately whereas you could definitely

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.860 
accurately whereas you could definitely
do<00:05:24.400> that<00:05:24.580> with<00:05:24.730> drum<00:05:24.940> racks<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:25.360> stuff<00:05:25.570> either

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
do that with drum racks and stuff either

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.890 
do that with drum racks and stuff either
using<00:05:26.230> the<00:05:26.260> velocity<00:05:26.740> information<00:05:26.920> or<00:05:27.900> just

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
using the velocity information or just

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.740 
using the velocity information or just
what<00:05:29.080> you're<00:05:29.260> what<00:05:29.860> loads<00:05:30.040> of<00:05:30.130> ways<00:05:30.250> doing<00:05:30.520> it

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
what you're what loads of ways doing it

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.090 
what you're what loads of ways doing it
but<00:05:31.750> I<00:05:31.810> just<00:05:31.990> really<00:05:32.140> like<00:05:32.290> to<00:05:32.410> see<00:05:32.710> exactly

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
but I just really like to see exactly

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.470 
but I just really like to see exactly
what's<00:05:33.490> going<00:05:33.610> on<00:05:33.760> I<00:05:33.820> just<00:05:34.090> find<00:05:34.270> it<00:05:34.390> easier

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
what's going on I just find it easier

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.140 
what's going on I just find it easier
it's<00:05:35.470> pretty<00:05:35.680> cool<00:05:35.830> ship<00:05:36.100> I'm<00:05:36.700> stakin<00:05:37.030> with

it's pretty cool ship I'm stakin with
the<00:05:37.210> main<00:05:37.420> reasons<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:37.990> use<00:05:38.020> kind<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.800> audio

struggling<00:06:00.100> with<00:06:00.310> your<00:06:00.490> CPU<00:06:00.910> so<00:06:01.210> can<00:06:01.690> be<00:06:01.750> nice

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
struggling with your CPU so can be nice

struggling with your CPU so can be nice
just<00:06:02.080> to<00:06:02.140> take<00:06:02.380> some<00:06:02.410> strain<00:06:02.919> off<00:06:04.350> which<00:06:05.350> is

just to take some strain off which is
cool<00:06:05.650> ship<00:06:05.890> now<00:06:06.280> it's<00:06:06.580> not<00:06:06.669> to<00:06:06.850> say<00:06:07.060> drum<00:06:07.930> racks

cool ship now it's not to say drum racks
are<00:06:08.290> kind<00:06:08.590> of<00:06:08.650> pointless<00:06:09.010> there's<00:06:09.370> a<00:06:09.400> lot<00:06:09.520> of

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
reasons why they're really cool I don't

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.690 
reasons why they're really cool I don't
really<00:06:11.500> go<00:06:11.620> into<00:06:11.800> them<00:06:12.010> now<00:06:12.040> because<00:06:12.400> if<00:06:12.610> you

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
really go into them now because if you

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.900 
really go into them now because if you
use<00:06:12.850> them<00:06:13.060> use<00:06:13.270> them<00:06:13.560> they<00:06:14.560> certainly<00:06:15.430> can<00:06:15.820> be
