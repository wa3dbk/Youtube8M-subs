is<00:00:32.669> tutorial<00:00:33.390> number<00:00:33.600> four<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:35.070> would<00:00:35.160> have

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
is tutorial number four we would have

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.220 
is tutorial number four we would have
got<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.430> right<00:00:35.610> hand<00:00:35.940> slide<00:00:36.510> off<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> black

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
got the right hand slide off the black

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.510 
got the right hand slide off the black
key<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.620> gives<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.860> beautiful

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
key it gives a beautiful

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.729 
key it gives a beautiful
bluesy<00:00:39.450> sounding<00:00:40.020> note<00:00:41.180> not<00:00:42.180> too<00:00:42.719> tricky<00:00:42.989> but

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
bluesy sounding note not too tricky but

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.459 
bluesy sounding note not too tricky but
get<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.160> right<00:00:44.399> every<00:00:44.789> time<00:00:45.289> you've<00:00:46.289> got<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
get it right every time you've got a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:01:03.870 
get it right every time you've got a
practice<00:00:46.890> look<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.789> show

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.930 

okay<00:01:04.880> so<00:01:05.360> we<00:01:05.870> had<00:01:05.990> two<00:01:06.140> examples<00:01:06.710> there<00:01:06.920> of<00:01:07.190> a

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
okay so we had two examples there of a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.420 
okay so we had two examples there of a
quick<00:01:08.240> slide<00:01:08.630> offer<00:01:09.050> Blackie<00:01:09.770> onto<00:01:10.160> a<00:01:10.190> white

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
quick slide offer Blackie onto a white

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.880 
quick slide offer Blackie onto a white
key<00:01:10.730> in<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.510> way<00:01:11.660> that's<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.170> piano<00:01:12.410> trying<00:01:12.740> to

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
key in a way that's the piano trying to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.710 
key in a way that's the piano trying to
be<00:01:13.070> like<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> wind<00:01:13.790> instrument<00:01:14.000> where<00:01:14.510> you<00:01:14.600> can

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
be like a wind instrument where you can

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.270 
be like a wind instrument where you can
actually<00:01:14.840> really<00:01:15.290> slide<00:01:15.650> notes<00:01:15.920> we<00:01:16.070> can't

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
actually really slide notes we can't

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.800 
actually really slide notes we can't
actually<00:01:16.400> really<00:01:16.790> slide<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.090> note<00:01:17.330> in<00:01:17.570> because

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
actually really slide a note in because

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.760 
actually really slide a note in because
all<00:01:17.960> fixed<00:01:18.440> as<00:01:18.590> strings<00:01:19.720> there's<00:01:20.720> often<00:01:21.650> that

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
all fixed as strings there's often that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.560 
all fixed as strings there's often that
the<00:01:21.860> way<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.130> taught<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.970> way<00:01:23.090> should<00:01:23.270> do<00:01:23.420> it

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
the way it's taught the way should do it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.840 
the way it's taught the way should do it
is<00:01:23.750> by<00:01:23.900> using<00:01:24.020> your<00:01:24.290> second<00:01:24.650> finger<00:01:24.830> I'll<00:01:25.400> show

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
is by using your second finger I'll show

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.520 
is by using your second finger I'll show
you<00:01:25.910> that<00:01:26.060> in<00:01:26.120> more<00:01:26.300> detail<00:01:26.690> in<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:27.050> minute<00:01:27.170> and

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
you that in more detail in a minute and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.890 
you that in more detail in a minute and
but<00:01:28.310> it's<00:01:28.430> really<00:01:28.610> a<00:01:28.730> slide<00:01:29.150> of<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.690> third

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
but it's really a slide of the third

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.930 
but it's really a slide of the third
finger<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:30.590> we'll<00:01:30.800> we<00:01:31.100> come<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.460> closer<00:01:31.670> shot

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
finger so we'll we come to a closer shot

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.340 
finger so we'll we come to a closer shot
making<00:01:32.180> sure<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.570> classical<00:01:32.960> method<00:01:33.260> of

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
making sure the classical method of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.230 
making sure the classical method of
doing<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.340> slide<00:01:34.550> is<00:01:34.730> often<00:01:34.970> your

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
doing this and the slide is often your

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.210 
doing this and the slide is often your
second<00:01:35.600> finger<00:01:35.750> on<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.170> flap<00:01:36.800> and<00:01:37.010> then<00:01:37.130> the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
second finger on the flap and then the

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.770 
second finger on the flap and then the
third<00:01:37.430> finger<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.000> E<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:38.479> you're<00:01:38.600> doing

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
third finger on the E so you're doing

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.830 
third finger on the E so you're doing
this<00:01:39.970> which<00:01:40.970> case<00:01:41.119> you're<00:01:41.270> very<00:01:41.510> clean

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
this which case you're very clean

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.690 
this which case you're very clean
precise<00:01:42.170> sound<00:01:42.440> just<00:01:42.800> not<00:01:42.950> necessarily<00:01:43.550> what

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
precise sound just not necessarily what

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.359 
precise sound just not necessarily what
you're<00:01:43.790> after<00:01:44.000> in<00:01:44.300> this<00:01:44.450> case<00:01:44.950> now<00:01:45.950> what<00:01:46.070> we<00:01:46.190> do

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
you're after in this case now what we do

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.980 
you're after in this case now what we do
is<00:01:46.430> we<00:01:46.640> use<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:47.060> same<00:01:47.240> thing<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.630> he's<00:01:47.780> both

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
is we use the same thing that he's both

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.290 
is we use the same thing that he's both
to<00:01:48.320> hit<00:01:48.500> both<00:01:48.680> notes<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.700> aim<00:01:49.910> for<00:01:49.940> the

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
to hit both notes and you aim for the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.850 
to hit both notes and you aim for the
very<00:01:50.600> kind<00:01:50.660> of<00:01:50.930> rounded<00:01:51.290> bit<00:01:51.470> on<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.680> black

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
very kind of rounded bit on the black

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.330 
very kind of rounded bit on the black
key<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.250> just<00:01:52.369> slide<00:01:52.760> off<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.979> don't<00:01:55.130> want<00:01:55.280> to

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
key and just slide off you don't want to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.100 
key and just slide off you don't want to
go<00:01:55.700> all<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.910> way<00:01:56.030> down<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.450> black<00:01:56.630> can<00:01:56.840> slide

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
go all the way down the black can slide

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.900 
go all the way down the black can slide
backwards<00:01:57.619> there's<00:01:58.280> far<00:01:58.430> too<00:01:58.460> much<00:01:58.729> effort

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
backwards there's far too much effort

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.640 
backwards there's far too much effort
you<00:01:59.150> just<00:01:59.330> aim<00:01:59.690> for<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.080> edge<00:02:00.170> of<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.470> black

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
you just aim for the edge of the black

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.300 
you just aim for the edge of the black
key<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:02.030> just<00:02:02.240> catch<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.660> edge<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:03.310> that's

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
key and just catch the edge of it that's

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.410 
key and just catch the edge of it that's
the<00:02:04.400> wager<00:02:04.670> when<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.850> Lewis<00:02:05.090> tells<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.360> he

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
the wager when you Lewis tells it he

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.070 
the wager when you Lewis tells it he
doesn't<00:02:05.570> do<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.780> like<00:02:05.900> that

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
doesn't do it like that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.889 
doesn't do it like that
he<00:02:06.290> doesn't<00:02:06.560> like<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:07.149> so<00:02:08.149> what<00:02:08.810> you're

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
he doesn't like that so what you're

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.960 
he doesn't like that so what you're
using<00:02:09.080> here<00:02:09.590> harmonic<00:02:10.280> Lee<00:02:10.429> is<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.640> flattened

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
using here harmonic Lee is the flattened

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.449 
using here harmonic Lee is the flattened
third<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.480> then<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.260> natural<00:02:12.650> third<00:02:13.040> within

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
third and then the natural third within

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:21.360 
third and then the natural third within
the<00:02:13.550> key<00:02:13.700> ring

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.280 

well<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.180> hope<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.629> found<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.870> tutorial
