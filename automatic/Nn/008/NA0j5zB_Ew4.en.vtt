00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
little bit more about Peachtree so we

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.720 
little bit more about Peachtree so we
have<00:00:11.370> here<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.090> Peachtree<00:00:12.690> music<00:00:13.469> box<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.130> we

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
have here the Peachtree music box and we

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.580 
have here the Peachtree music box and we
just<00:00:15.120> heard<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.509> here<00:00:15.750> it's<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.320> very

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
just heard it here it's a very

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.670 
just heard it here it's a very
impressive<00:00:17.300> high-end<00:00:18.410> system<00:00:19.410> that's

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
impressive high-end system that's

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.359 
impressive high-end system that's
perfect<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.850> desk<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:21.600> an<00:00:21.689> office<00:00:22.369> mostly

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
perfect for a desk for an office mostly

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.000 
perfect for a desk for an office mostly
people<00:00:23.609> will<00:00:24.090> take<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.960> hook<00:00:25.140> your<00:00:25.289> computer

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
people will take and hook your computer

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.839 
people will take and hook your computer
up<00:00:26.240> directly<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.599> music<00:00:27.960> box<00:00:28.140> through<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
up directly to the music box through the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.749 
up directly to the music box through the
USB<00:00:29.849> cable<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.920> would<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.340> give<00:00:32.579> you

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
USB cable and that would just give you

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.060 
USB cable and that would just give you
the<00:00:33.000> series<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.960> ones<00:00:34.200> once<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.800> zeros

the series of the ones once and zeros

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.370 
the series of the ones once and zeros
coming<00:00:35.340> off<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.790> computer<00:00:36.120> right<00:00:36.450> into

coming off of the computer right into
our<00:00:37.410> d-to-a<00:00:37.800> converter<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.000> no<00:00:39.329> longer

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
our d-to-a converter so you no longer

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.810 
our d-to-a converter so you no longer
have<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.989> rely<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.280> little<00:00:41.520> headphone

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
have to rely on the little headphone

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.299 
have to rely on the little headphone
jack<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.719> have<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.739> output<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.160> your

jack that you have on the output of your

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.770 
jack that you have on the output of your
computer<00:00:44.879> because<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.210> never<00:00:45.390> really

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
computer because that never really

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.750 
computer because that never really
sounded<00:00:46.170> very<00:00:46.320> good<00:00:46.649> anyway<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.430> was<00:00:47.610> an

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
sounded very good anyway that was an

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.260 
sounded very good anyway that was an
analogue<00:00:48.450> output<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:50.039> using<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> analog

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
analogue output in using the analog

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.510 
analogue output in using the analog
output<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:52.020> would<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
output you would actually have to to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
output you would actually have to to
rely<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.270> power<00:00:54.510> supply<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.289> your

rely on the power supply of your

your computer which if you've ever
really<00:01:00.059> tried<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.620> do<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.829> isn't<00:01:02.010> isn't<00:01:02.399> very

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
really tried to do that isn't isn't very

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.299 
really tried to do that isn't isn't very
good<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.840> actually<00:01:03.870> only<00:01:04.379> take<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> ones<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
good we actually only take the ones and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.420 
good we actually only take the ones and
zeros<00:01:05.700> running<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> music<00:01:06.750> box<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.830> then

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
zeros running to the music box we then

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.690 
zeros running to the music box we then
use<00:01:09.360> our<00:01:09.630> D<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> converter<00:01:10.619> our<00:01:11.130> two

suppose and tell me just remind me a

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.380 
suppose and tell me just remind me a
little<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.369> about<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> files<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.299> were

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
little bit about the files that you were

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.749 
little bit about the files that you were
playing<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> lot<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.950> files<00:01:26.430> on

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
playing we know that a lot of files on

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.539 
playing we know that a lot of files on
the<00:01:26.880> computers<00:01:27.390> are<00:01:27.630> very<00:01:28.100> hard<00:01:29.100> crunched

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the computers are very hard crunched

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.940 
the computers are very hard crunched
even<00:01:29.909> down<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.390> 128<00:01:31.350> kilobits<00:01:31.829> per

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
even down to like 128 kilobits per

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.870 
even down to like 128 kilobits per
second<00:01:32.960> which<00:01:33.960> would<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.299> 10<00:01:37.049> times

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
second which would be you know 10 times

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.390 
second which would be you know 10 times
lower<00:01:38.880> than<00:01:39.509> say<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> CD<00:01:40.530> player<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:41.040> lower

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
lower than say a CD player or lower

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160 
lower than say a CD player or lower
quality<00:01:42.060> well<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.479> knew<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> lot<00:01:43.140> of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
quality well we knew that a lot of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.899 
quality well we knew that a lot of
people<00:01:43.470> had<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.770> kind<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> information<00:01:44.759> on

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
people had this kind of information on

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.789 
people had this kind of information on
their<00:01:45.149> systems<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.170> when<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.380> download

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
their systems because when you download

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.760 
their systems because when you download
music<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.310> lot<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.460> times<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.030> at<00:01:48.210> 128<00:01:48.960> K<00:01:49.259> so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
music a lot of times it is at 128 K so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.460 
music a lot of times it is at 128 K so
we<00:01:49.920> wanted<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.490> able<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.939> make<00:01:51.869> sure<00:01:52.170> that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
we wanted to be able to make sure that

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.899 
we wanted to be able to make sure that
even<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> highest<00:01:54.240> compression<00:01:55.020> rate

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
even if the highest compression rate

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.530 
even if the highest compression rate
