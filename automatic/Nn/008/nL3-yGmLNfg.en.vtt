00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.930
 red 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.270
 if I stand with the chair in front 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.270
 but very strong 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.210
 place in the position that is andrea 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 door

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.180
 placed here convinced of wheels I 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.850
 I go look at the change today for 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.260

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.250
 where the dog is taught 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.340
 if I'm a mediocre coach or because 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.340
 what 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.530
 and lift them always in front 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.030
 when the wheelchair arrives the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.980
 dog will be used to open of 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.490
 front so that it is opposite and we are going to 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.490
 see working 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.520

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.520
 of established 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.690
 qÃ¼etta 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:17.670

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.670
 the bottom of the door certifies open 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.230
 the life of four children 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.640

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.560
 in animation productions by the 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.560
