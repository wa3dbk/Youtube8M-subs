 very fast to do things like for some 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.199
 before if you want to impress someone

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.090
 swallow good wishes and simply 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.650
 you want to pamper your own palate 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.170
 this video is for you also from 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.270
 mountain is super beautiful is very fast 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.270
 make and it's delicious 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.910
 We are going to need sweet cookies 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:52.140
 butter lemons preferably fine 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.329
 juicy milk cream and milk with place 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.910
 as the title says this is a dessert 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.460
 time trial 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.870
 lemon spray obviously can not 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.940
 Missing lemon juice 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.970
 the tip number one so that the juice of 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.070
 lemon is not sour you is that you must cut 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.340
 the slices avoiding the heart of 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.340
 lemon 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.060
 once squeeze five or six lemons and 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.600
 you have your juice and let's start 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.970
 crush cookies 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.610
 I used a kitchen stone 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.710
 It seems that it is much faster and if you 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.710
 gives as the result we need 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.090
 crush and grind until well 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.250
 tiny as well as almost dust now 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.870
 we need to melt the butter myself 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.450
 I recommend you use butter 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.350
 canola or some as the most 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.350
 organic possible 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.210
 and mix it with the cookies until 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.210
 get a mass a little more solid 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.479
 now to the blender here we are going to pour 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.299
 the condensed milk the milk cream and 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.530
 the lemon juice but first let's 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:16.290
 liquefy condensed milk only 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:18.629
 with the cream of milk when they are 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.280
 well mixed these two incorporated and 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.110
 if the lemon juice 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.030
 apenitas not throw you have to start 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.330
 liquefy this is to prevent you from getting 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.130
 go to cut the mixture 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.230
 all this country we are going to put together four 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.510
 two layers of biscuit and two of the mixture 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.430
 of the lemon you have to put the first 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.290
 cookie layer and flatten the well of 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.600
 soon with some spoon as for 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.640
 fill all spaces well after 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.620
 we put a layer of the lemon mixture 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.650
 from heaven it's alright fine to fill 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.510
 all the holes and you repeat the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.870
 procedure a layer of cookies 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:59.270
 flat and the last layer of the mixture and 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.980
 already flat do not worry about the 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.660
 exact amounts of each ingredient 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.290
 same and I'll leave them all in 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.510
 the information box below 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.159
 to decorate because it depends on your 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.230
 imagination or accident that 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.420
 want to give in this case then first 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.769
 we will grate the lemon zest you must 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.719
 be careful when you get to the part 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.370
 white should only scratch the part 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:20.010
 green because white can add you 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.989
 the dessert 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.730
 I helped myself with a saw knife 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.329
 to cut the cookies in the form of 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:35.250
 heart looks very nice after you 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:46.019
 I added candy cookie balls and for 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:48.840
 last some dark chocolate and all 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.180
 this would be in 14 minutes 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.530
 vettel in the minimum minimum refrigerator 20 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.599
 minutes so that the dough 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.190
 solidify more time than that of 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.959
 sally because it depends as you like 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.430
 you can not even stop it one day 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.599
 for the other if you want like that 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.599
 get more palette 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.500
 you will see that the result is exquisite 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.480
 d 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.460
 although you liked it, I know that if 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.400
 they do and they try it they will like the 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.130
 triple the 4 the quintuple is that is 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.900
 delicious 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.820
 personally I think that the details 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.440
 Most beautiful are those that in May 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.760
 we celebrate the day of friendship then 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.710
 let's do like a special 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.870
 details as 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.870
 little gifts I like I can see you 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.240
 alone you alone 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.130
 so they can give you alarm because it is 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.370
 cute to receive something as done by the 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.470
 hands of the other 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.320
 well because if it's very easy to go to the 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.750
 store and we buy that cheesecake 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.820
 rich adam in that perfume is sweet and 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.310
 It's also an accounting wallet 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.840
 It's prettier and the detail is what you do 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.460

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.020
 so will you make a chart is the time 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.550
 we have doing it because obviously 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.980
 during that time you think about the other 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.230

 traditional is made with the eggs of the 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.030
 logo such but good because of 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.940
 it is not enough to make it a 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.590
 exquisite delicious flash dessert 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.510
