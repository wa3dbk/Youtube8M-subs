hi I'm Connor McKinney today we're going

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.730 
hi I'm Connor McKinney today we're going
to<00:00:25.070> talk<00:00:25.280> about<00:00:25.430> developing<00:00:26.060> your<00:00:26.660> film

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.770 

so<00:00:31.519> this<00:00:31.669> video<00:00:31.939> is<00:00:31.970> going<00:00:32.149> to<00:00:32.239> be<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:32.390> little

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
so this video is going to be a little

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.799 
so this video is going to be a little
bit<00:00:32.930> shorter<00:00:33.320> than<00:00:33.469> in<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.040> beginning<00:00:34.340> one

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
bit shorter than in the beginning one

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.410 
bit shorter than in the beginning one
just<00:00:35.809> basically<00:00:36.140> tell<00:00:36.739> you<00:00:36.969> my<00:00:37.969> thoughts<00:00:38.210> on

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
just basically tell you my thoughts on

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.650 
just basically tell you my thoughts on
developing<00:00:39.140> film<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:39.680> my<00:00:40.579> experience<00:00:41.210> and

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
developing film and my experience and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.170 
developing film and my experience and
doing<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:42.739> one<00:00:43.129> of<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.370> downfalls<00:00:43.699> of

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
doing so one of the downfalls of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.569 
doing so one of the downfalls of
shooting<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:44.600> film<00:00:44.840> is<00:00:45.170> that<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:46.129> do<00:00:46.340> have<00:00:46.550> to

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
shooting the film is that you do have to

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.240 
shooting the film is that you do have to
eat<00:00:46.790> your<00:00:46.879> fill<00:00:47.089> develop<00:00:47.480> can<00:00:48.409> be<00:00:48.559> costly<00:00:49.129> and

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
eat your fill develop can be costly and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.079 
eat your fill develop can be costly and
you<00:00:49.909> do<00:00:50.659> lose<00:00:50.930> that<00:00:51.230> immediacy<00:00:51.860> that<00:00:52.339> digital

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
you do lose that immediacy that digital

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.950 
you do lose that immediacy that digital
has<00:00:53.540> to<00:00:53.780> offer<00:00:54.640> but<00:00:55.640> it's<00:00:56.360> not<00:00:56.750> that

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
has to offer but it's not that

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.729 
has to offer but it's not that
complicated

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
complicated

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.530 
complicated
and<00:00:57.920> it's<00:00:58.430> fairly<00:00:59.229> painless<00:01:00.229> in<00:01:00.760> doing<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:01.970> in

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
and it's fairly painless in doing so in

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.329 
and it's fairly painless in doing so in
the<00:01:02.629> first<00:01:02.840> video<00:01:03.019> I<00:01:03.230> mentioned<00:01:03.590> that<00:01:03.859> I<00:01:03.980> said

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
the first video I mentioned that I said

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.150 
the first video I mentioned that I said
might<00:01:04.550> film<00:01:04.850> wait<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:06.110> be<00:01:06.229> developed<00:01:06.619> at<00:01:07.039> a

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
might film wait to be developed at a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.150 
might film wait to be developed at a
place<00:01:07.490> called<00:01:07.520> Photoworks<00:01:08.210> San<00:01:08.570> Francisco

digitally let's talk about that first

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.570 
digitally let's talk about that first
edition<00:02:14.209> just<00:02:14.959> in<00:02:15.140> your<00:02:15.319> film<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:16.430> they

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
take your data as a new processor dome

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.130 
take your data as a new processor dome
and<00:02:18.590> they<00:02:19.099> scan<00:02:19.400> them<00:02:19.550> individually<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.269> chose

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
and they scan them individually I chose

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.320 
and they scan them individually I chose
a<00:02:21.440> medium<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.130> medium<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.180> road

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.880 
say what the native image size of a DSLR
is<00:02:39.290> which<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:40.069> usually<00:02:40.430> liking<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.819> 5k<00:02:41.120> range

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
is which is usually liking the 5k range

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.309 
is which is usually liking the 5k range
but

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
but

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.130 
but
I<00:02:44.349> have<00:02:45.040> much<00:02:45.219> I<00:02:45.610> wasn't<00:02:46.120> sure<00:02:46.329> you<00:02:46.510> know<00:02:46.629> how

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
I have much I wasn't sure you know how

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.509 
I have much I wasn't sure you know how
good<00:02:47.379> they<00:02:47.560> were<00:02:47.590> in<00:02:47.829> a<00:02:47.920> two-month<00:02:48.280> spend<00:02:48.489> a

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
good they were in a two-month spend a

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.069 
good they were in a two-month spend a
lot<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.730> money<00:02:48.879> yes<00:02:49.299> but<00:02:49.719> it<00:02:49.870> was<00:02:49.959> $5<00:02:50.709> per<00:02:51.340> roll

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
lot of money yes but it was $5 per roll

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.390 
lot of money yes but it was $5 per roll
for<00:02:53.079> digitally<00:02:53.379> scanned<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:53.920> here's<00:02:54.310> a

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
for digitally scanned but here's a

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.559 
for digitally scanned but here's a
picture<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:56.739> took<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.909> is<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.480> know

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
picture that I took and that is you know

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.660 
picture that I took and that is you know
at<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.500> resolution<00:02:59.739> I<00:02:59.980> said<00:03:00.189> and<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.609> think

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
at the resolution I said and I think

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.210 
at the resolution I said and I think
they<00:03:01.450> did<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.629> pretty<00:03:01.930> good<00:03:02.140> job<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.680> doing<00:03:03.069> a

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
they did a pretty good job of doing a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.089 
they did a pretty good job of doing a
larger<00:03:03.760> print<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.269> but<00:03:04.689> I<00:03:05.099> probably

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
larger print of it but I probably

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.970 
larger print of it but I probably
wouldn't<00:03:06.519> print<00:03:06.700> higher<00:03:07.000> than<00:03:07.299> you<00:03:07.420> know<00:03:07.980> size

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
wouldn't print higher than you know size

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.649 
wouldn't print higher than you know size
like<00:03:09.189> this<00:03:09.400> since<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.970> know<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.150> do<00:03:10.359> start<00:03:10.599> to

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
like this since you know you do start to

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.160 
like this since you know you do start to
pound<00:03:11.220> lose<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.370> quality<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.879> the<00:03:13.030> image<00:03:13.569> but

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
pound lose the quality of the image but

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.670 
pound lose the quality of the image but
they<00:03:14.829> do<00:03:14.889> do<00:03:15.310> higher<00:03:15.609> quality<00:03:16.269> scans<00:03:16.840> it's

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
they do do higher quality scans it's

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.800 
they do do higher quality scans it's
they<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.370> deluxe<00:03:18.670> version<00:03:18.819> which<00:03:19.120> is<00:03:19.239> $10

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
they have a deluxe version which is $10

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.589 
they have a deluxe version which is $10
per<00:03:19.840> roll<00:03:20.230> they<00:03:20.799> also<00:03:20.950> do<00:03:21.129> custom<00:03:21.400> scans<00:03:21.909> which

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
per roll they also do custom scans which

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.080 
per roll they also do custom scans which
the<00:03:22.720> $20<00:03:23.290> which<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.220> assume<00:03:24.549> can<00:03:24.760> give<00:03:24.909> to<00:03:25.060> a

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
the $20 which I assume can give to a

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.360 
the $20 which I assume can give to a
really<00:03:25.510> ridiculous<00:03:25.840> resolutions<00:03:26.680> like<00:03:26.769> you

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
really ridiculous resolutions like you

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.899 
really ridiculous resolutions like you
know<00:03:27.489> 4k<00:03:28.209> 8<00:03:28.359> 5<00:03:28.540> k<00:03:28.569> 6k<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.319> Sunday<00:03:30.010> all<00:03:30.189> whatever

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
know 4k 8 5 k 6k a Sunday all whatever

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.190 
know 4k 8 5 k 6k a Sunday all whatever
you<00:03:31.120> want<00:03:32.519> but<00:03:33.519> I<00:03:33.790> just<00:03:34.329> didn't<00:03:34.780> want<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.019> pay

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
you want but I just didn't want to pay

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.229 
you want but I just didn't want to pay
that<00:03:35.230> much<00:03:35.379> and<00:03:35.709> that's<00:03:35.829> where<00:03:36.239> developing

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
that much and that's where developing

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.479 
that much and that's where developing
your<00:03:37.359> film<00:03:37.540> can<00:03:37.840> get<00:03:38.019> really<00:03:38.200> expensive<00:03:38.489> it's

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
your film can get really expensive it's

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.940 
your film can get really expensive it's
it's<00:03:40.000> not<00:03:40.239> just<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.510> simple<00:03:40.720> $5<00:03:41.379> for<00:03:41.560> everything

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
it's not just a simple $5 for everything

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.429 
it's not just a simple $5 for everything
it<00:03:42.430> just<00:03:42.579> it<00:03:43.000> seems<00:03:43.269> like<00:03:43.510> it's<00:03:43.659> small<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.290> just

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 
it just it seems like it's small it just

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.440 
it just it seems like it's small it just
adds<00:03:44.680> up<00:03:44.919> so<00:03:45.250> that's<00:03:45.579> why<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:45.849> really<00:03:46.209> do<00:03:46.329> not

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
adds up so that's why you really do not

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.240 
adds up so that's why you really do not
want<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.750> have<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.930> do<00:03:47.079> this<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.439> lot<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.069> the

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
want to have to do this a lot of the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.189 
want to have to do this a lot of the
time<00:03:48.430> okay<00:03:48.819> so<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.269> actual<00:03:49.540> process<00:03:50.079> of

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
time okay so the actual process of

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.509 
time okay so the actual process of
getting<00:03:50.379> your<00:03:50.530> film<00:03:50.829> developed

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
getting your film developed

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.849 
getting your film developed
couple<00:03:52.030> things<00:03:52.180> need<00:03:52.389> to<00:03:52.449> know<00:03:52.709> getting<00:03:53.709> your

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
couple things need to know getting your

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.800 
couple things need to know getting your
film<00:03:54.250> processed<00:03:54.760> whether<00:03:55.359> it's<00:03:55.510> colored

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
film processed whether it's colored

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.420 
film processed whether it's colored
black<00:03:55.959> white<00:03:56.229> is<00:03:56.590> not<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:56.949> same<00:03:57.159> thing

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
black white is not the same thing

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.309 
black white is not the same thing
there's<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.209> different<00:03:58.510> process<00:03:58.540> for<00:03:59.109> color

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
there's a different process for color

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.170 
there's a different process for color
pan<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.889> a<00:04:00.280> different<00:04:00.579> process<00:04:00.879> for<00:04:01.000> black

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
pan and a different process for black

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.780 
pan and a different process for black
and<00:04:01.359> white<00:04:01.479> now<00:04:02.379> black<00:04:02.799> and<00:04:02.829> white<00:04:03.129> is<00:04:03.519> more

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
and white now black and white is more

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.439 
and white now black and white is more
expensive<00:04:04.359> for<00:04:04.780> some<00:04:05.019> reason<00:04:05.409> but<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:07.209> not

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
expensive for some reason but it's not

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.719 
expensive for some reason but it's not
too<00:04:07.629> much<00:04:07.750> more<00:04:07.930> expensive<00:04:08.280> colored<00:04:09.280> film<00:04:09.549> is

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:09.729 
too much more expensive colored film is

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.300 
too much more expensive colored film is
maybe<00:04:10.510> like<00:04:10.690> $5<00:04:11.319> black<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.769> white<00:04:11.859> is<00:04:12.040> six<00:04:12.250> or

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
maybe like $5 black and white is six or

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.640 
maybe like $5 black and white is six or
seven<00:04:12.699> but<00:04:13.569> you<00:04:13.810> have<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:14.019> make<00:04:14.169> sure<00:04:14.199> that

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
seven but you have to make sure that

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.899 
seven but you have to make sure that
whether<00:04:15.040> you're<00:04:15.250> sending<00:04:15.489> in<00:04:15.549> black<00:04:15.729> and

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
whether you're sending in black and

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.719 
whether you're sending in black and
white<00:04:16.000> or<00:04:16.409> colored<00:04:17.409> or<00:04:17.590> both<00:04:17.889> you<00:04:18.220> have<00:04:18.639> to

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
white or colored or both you have to

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.879
