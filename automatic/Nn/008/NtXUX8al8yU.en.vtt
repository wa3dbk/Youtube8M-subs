I've got the first finger bar in here at
five<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:35.800> that<00:02:36.100> captures<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.300> third<00:02:37.540> string

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
five so that captures the third string

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.820 
five so that captures the third string
and<00:02:38.170> then<00:02:38.650> my<00:02:39.220> second<00:02:39.700> finger<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:40.560> my<00:02:41.560> middle

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
sixth fret and you can add this

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.020 
sixth fret and you can add this
basically<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.230> brings<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.560> down<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:51.540> 13th

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
basically it brings it down to a 13th

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.790 
basically it brings it down to a 13th
and<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:55.780> kind<00:02:56.020> of<00:02:56.110> add<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.470> pull<00:02:56.650> off

and just kind of add it and pull off

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.930 
and just kind of add it and pull off
kind<00:02:57.100> of<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.340> suspended<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.620> then<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.820> an

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
kind of like a suspended and then to an

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.660 
kind of like a suspended and then to an
a<00:03:01.060> minor

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
a minor

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.390 
a minor
and<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.569> also<00:03:03.780> lift<00:03:04.350> up<00:03:04.500> my<00:03:04.650> pinky<00:03:05.010> once<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.340> a

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
and I also lift up my pinky once in a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.620 
and I also lift up my pinky once in a
while<00:03:05.750> just<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:07.140> make<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.470> interesting<00:03:07.800> so

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
while just to make it interesting so

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.240 
while just to make it interesting so
it's<00:03:09.630> real<00:03:09.840> jazzy<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.620> they<00:03:10.709> kind<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.010> change

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
it's real jazzy and they kind of change

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.940 
it's real jazzy and they kind of change
it<00:03:11.400> up<00:03:11.520> each<00:03:11.670> time<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.200> just<00:03:13.410> play<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
it up each time so if you just play the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.809 
it up each time so if you just play the
D<00:03:14.400> minor<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:14.970> minor<00:03:15.390> that's<00:03:15.690> fine<00:03:15.990> too

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:32.699 

it's<00:03:22.750> kind<00:03:23.019> of<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.170> swing<00:03:23.469> field<00:03:23.799> so<00:03:24.159> you<00:03:24.189> got

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.110 

so<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:33.769> want<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.099> kind<00:03:34.280> of<00:03:34.430> get<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.790> swing

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
so you want to kind of get a swing

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.830 
so you want to kind of get a swing
rhythm<00:03:35.329> going<00:03:35.719> with<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.200> part<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.739> then

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
rhythm going with that part and then

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.560 

and<00:06:07.440> then<00:06:08.440> they're<00:06:08.590> back<00:06:08.770> into<00:06:09.010> the<00:06:09.570> chorus

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570

and then they're back into the chorus
and<00:06:10.990> at<00:06:11.410> the<00:06:11.530> very<00:06:11.710> end<00:06:11.890> of<00:06:12.100> the<00:06:12.220> song<00:06:12.400> the<00:06:12.700> way

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
and at the very end of the song the way

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.230 
and at the very end of the song the way
it<00:06:12.970> ends<00:06:13.420> is<00:06:13.890> he<00:06:14.890> does<00:06:15.100> a<00:06:15.130> little<00:06:15.340> run<00:06:15.670> down<00:06:15.700> and

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
it ends is he does a little run down and

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.570 
it ends is he does a little run down and
we're<00:06:16.360> doing<00:06:16.510> a<00:06:17.340> to<00:06:18.340> G<00:06:18.580> to<00:06:19.570> F<00:06:20.400> then<00:06:21.400> we're<00:06:21.490> gonna

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
we're doing a to G to F then we're gonna

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.390 
we're doing a to G to F then we're gonna
do<00:06:21.820> a<00:06:21.850> C<00:06:22.210> but<00:06:22.690> we're<00:06:22.810> gonna<00:06:22.960> hit<00:06:23.530> that<00:06:23.590> open<00:06:23.950> E

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
do a C but we're gonna hit that open E

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.870 
do a C but we're gonna hit that open E
on<00:06:24.790> the<00:06:25.300> sixth<00:06:25.630> string<00:06:25.800> and<00:06:26.800> end<00:06:27.280> up<00:06:27.430> on<00:06:27.550> a<00:06:27.610> D

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
on the sixth string and end up on a D

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:35.670 
on the sixth string and end up on a D
minor<00:06:28.180> so<00:06:29.110> it<00:06:29.230> sounds<00:06:29.590> like<00:06:29.620> this

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.010 

and<00:06:35.889> then<00:06:36.520> the<00:06:36.610> very<00:06:36.850> last<00:06:36.970> chord<00:06:37.540> to<00:06:37.690> end<00:06:37.870> the

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
and then the very last chord to end the

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.740 
and then the very last chord to end the
song<00:06:38.229> is<00:06:38.560> a<00:06:38.830> minor

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:52.260 

so<00:06:42.750> again

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.760 

so<00:06:53.270> I<00:06:53.300> hope<00:06:53.480> you<00:06:53.600> enjoy<00:06:53.810> pretty<00:06:54.170> easy<00:06:54.410> and<00:06:54.710> a
