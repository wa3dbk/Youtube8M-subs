board in there they start the saw and

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.139 
board in there they start the saw and
you're<00:00:33.520> slam<00:00:33.970> it<00:00:34.149> into<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.480> cut<00:00:36.030> when<00:00:37.030> you

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
you're slam it into the cut when you

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.880 
you're slam it into the cut when you
slam<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.720> blade<00:00:37.930> in<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:38.230> board<00:00:38.469> like<00:00:38.649> that

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
slam the blade in the board like that

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.889 
slam the blade in the board like that
you<00:00:39.040> take<00:00:39.219> a<00:00:39.280> chance<00:00:39.640> on<00:00:39.880> damaging<00:00:40.450> the<00:00:40.540> board

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
you take a chance on damaging the board

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.200 
you take a chance on damaging the board
the<00:00:41.530> blade<00:00:41.829> the<00:00:42.160> saw<00:00:42.399> and<00:00:42.730> maybe<00:00:43.000> even

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
the blade the saw and maybe even

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.889 
the blade the saw and maybe even
yourself

so<00:00:44.469> give<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:44.920> saw<00:00:45.160> and<00:00:45.399> the<00:00:45.489> blade<00:00:45.670> a<00:00:45.700> chance

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
so give the saw and the blade a chance

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.780 
so give the saw and the blade a chance
to<00:00:46.270> do<00:00:46.420> their<00:00:46.570> work<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.980> second<00:00:48.489> thing<00:00:48.640> I

all it takes is a slightest bit of

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.720 
all it takes is a slightest bit of
sawdust<00:00:59.350> build-up<00:00:59.829> or<00:00:59.980> debris

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
to hold that board a little bit out and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.709 
to hold that board a little bit out and
then<00:01:03.340> your<00:01:03.489> cuts<00:01:03.789> not<00:01:04.030> going<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.329> be<00:01:04.479> accurate

then your cuts not going to be accurate
a<00:01:05.369> great<00:01:06.369> number<00:01:06.579> of<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.819> cuts<00:01:07.060> that<00:01:07.179> I<00:01:07.359> make

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
a great number of the cuts that I make

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.519 
a great number of the cuts that I make
or<00:01:07.840> casing<00:01:08.380> trim<00:01:08.709> I<00:01:10.079> always<00:01:11.079> want<00:01:11.319> to<00:01:11.380> make

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:11.529 
or casing trim I always want to make

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:13.319 
or casing trim I always want to make

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
sure that when I'm cutting a piece of

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.510 
sure that when I'm cutting a piece of
casing<00:01:13.749> trim<00:01:14.020> I'm<00:01:14.289> actually<00:01:14.649> cutting<00:01:15.069> angles

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
casing trim I'm actually cutting angles

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.370 
casing trim I'm actually cutting angles
going<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:15.759> shear<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.420> grain<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.840> wood<00:01:17.020> not

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
going to shear the grain the wood not

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.489 
going to shear the grain the wood not
tear<00:01:17.829> it<00:01:18.359> sometimes<00:01:19.359> I<00:01:19.569> see<00:01:19.810> people<00:01:19.840> turning

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
tear it sometimes I see people turning

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:22.859 
tear it sometimes I see people turning
the<00:01:21.399> board<00:01:21.639> around<00:01:21.759> like<00:01:22.060> this<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.509> making<00:01:22.659> a

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
the board around like this and making a

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.959 
the board around like this and making a
cut<00:01:23.139> from<00:01:23.380> this<00:01:23.560> direction<00:01:23.770> but<00:01:24.729> that's

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
cut from this direction but that's

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.609 
cut from this direction but that's
actually<00:01:25.240> tearing<00:01:25.869> out<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.170> wood<00:01:26.349> fibers

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
actually tearing out the wood fibers

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.339 
actually tearing out the wood fibers
instead<00:01:27.099> of<00:01:27.189> sharing<00:01:27.459> it<00:01:27.840> try<00:01:28.840> this<00:01:28.899> sometime

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:29.349 
instead of sharing it try this sometime

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:32.010 
instead of sharing it try this sometime
make<00:01:30.189> a<00:01:30.219> cut<00:01:30.579> like<00:01:30.609> this<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.419> then<00:01:31.569> run<00:01:31.840> your

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
make a cut like this and then run your

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.260 
make a cut like this and then run your
finger<00:01:32.409> backwards<00:01:33.099> you're<00:01:33.759> going<00:01:33.789> to<00:01:33.969> feel

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
finger backwards you're going to feel

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.899 
finger backwards you're going to feel
all<00:01:34.689> those<00:01:34.929> grain<00:01:35.349> trying<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.249> raise<00:01:36.459> and<00:01:36.819> then

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
all those grain trying to raise and then

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.940 
all those grain trying to raise and then
go<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:37.359> way<00:01:37.599> and<00:01:37.899> you'll<00:01:38.289> see<00:01:38.529> that<00:01:38.740> it's<00:01:38.859> a

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
go this way and you'll see that it's a

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.219 
go this way and you'll see that it's a
lot<00:01:39.159> better<00:01:39.369> to<00:01:39.969> cut<00:01:40.270> this<00:01:40.569> way<00:01:40.840> where<00:01:41.079> you're

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
lot better to cut this way where you're

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.309 
lot better to cut this way where you're
sharing<00:01:41.829> the<00:01:42.130> fibers<00:01:42.549> of<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:42.700> wood

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
sharing the fibers of the wood

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.959 
sharing the fibers of the wood
some<00:01:44.319> people<00:01:44.619> say<00:01:44.859> measure<00:01:45.219> twice<00:01:45.609> and<00:01:45.669> cut

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
some people say measure twice and cut

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.449 
some people say measure twice and cut
once<00:01:46.149> I<00:01:46.689> almost<00:01:47.079> never<00:01:47.529> try<00:01:47.859> to<00:01:47.919> get<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.249> cut

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
once I almost never try to get the cut

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.149 
once I almost never try to get the cut
exact<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.119> first<00:01:49.359> time<00:01:49.630> I'd<00:01:50.169> much<00:01:50.499> rather<00:01:50.529> cut

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
exact the first time I'd much rather cut

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.190 
exact the first time I'd much rather cut
it<00:01:51.279> close<00:01:51.639> and<00:01:52.029> then<00:01:52.149> make<00:01:52.329> a<00:01:52.359> second<00:01:52.899> cut<00:01:53.020> to

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
it close and then make a second cut to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.440 
it close and then make a second cut to
make<00:01:53.380> sure<00:01:53.619> they<00:01:53.799> get<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.159> joint<00:01:54.399> I<00:01:54.520> want<00:01:54.789> try

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450
