plastic<00:04:00.660> tag<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:03.030> on<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.810> Hat<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.200> the

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
plastic tag on the on the Hat on the

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.430 
plastic tag on the on the Hat on the
cover<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.880> it's<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.120> little<00:04:06.330> notch<00:04:06.540> on<00:04:07.019> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
cover and it's a little notch on the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.440 
cover and it's a little notch on the
back<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.920> pulley<00:04:08.190> I'm<00:04:08.970> not<00:04:09.180> sure<00:04:09.390> if

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
back of the pulley I'm not sure if

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.330 
back of the pulley I'm not sure if
that's<00:04:09.630> visible<00:04:09.840> or<00:04:10.200> not<00:04:10.230> but<00:04:10.860> that<00:04:10.890> is<00:04:11.069> the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
that's visible or not but that is the

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.070 
that's visible or not but that is the
timing<00:04:11.580> mark<00:04:11.970> for<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.299> balance<00:04:12.660> for<00:04:12.989> the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
timing mark for the balance for the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.830 
timing mark for the balance for the
lower<00:04:13.200> balance<00:04:13.680> shaft<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.150> wind<00:04:15.360> open

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
lower balance shaft so that is wind open

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.420 
lower balance shaft so that is wind open
and<00:04:15.989> that's<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.320> top<00:04:16.530> dead<00:04:16.799> center<00:04:18.889> now<00:04:19.889> because

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
and that's a top dead center now because

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.039 
and that's a top dead center now because
I'm<00:04:20.579> going<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.790> take<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.060> water<00:04:21.209> pump<00:04:21.570> off<00:04:21.780> I

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
I'm going to take the water pump off I

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.590 
I'm going to take the water pump off I
have<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.410> take<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.979> front<00:04:23.220> crank<00:04:24.030> pulley<00:04:24.330> off

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
have to take the front crank pulley off

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.490 
have to take the front crank pulley off
so<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.380> can<00:04:25.740> get<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:26.100> back<00:04:26.370> cover<00:04:26.960> off<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:28.289> the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
so I can get this back cover off of the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.620 
so I can get this back cover off of the
off<00:04:28.890> of<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.280> engine<00:04:29.610> if<00:04:30.060> you're<00:04:30.210> just<00:04:30.450> doing

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
off of the engine if you're just doing

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.529 
off of the engine if you're just doing
timing<00:04:31.200> belts<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:32.100> won't<00:04:32.280> need<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.520> take<00:04:32.850> the

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
timing belts you won't need to take the

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.210 
timing belts you won't need to take the
pulley<00:04:34.020> off<00:04:34.260> where<00:04:34.470> there's<00:04:34.620> back<00:04:34.800> cover<00:04:35.100> off

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
pulley off where there's back cover off

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.090 
pulley off where there's back cover off
you<00:04:35.970> can<00:04:36.120> just<00:04:36.150> loosen<00:04:36.479> up<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.990> timing<00:04:37.800> belts

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
you can just loosen up the timing belts

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.700 
you can just loosen up the timing belts
ring<00:04:38.760> all<00:04:38.880> over<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.180> car<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.660> show<00:04:40.440> you<00:04:40.500> what

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
ring all over the car and show you what

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.010 
ring all over the car and show you what
it<00:04:40.800> looks<00:04:40.950> like<00:04:41.039> from<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.310> top<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:45.120> here<00:04:45.840> I've

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
it looks like from the top so here I've

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.230 
it looks like from the top so here I've
removed<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.470> top<00:04:46.620> cover<00:04:46.919> as<00:04:47.100> well<00:04:47.310> so<00:04:47.970> you<00:04:48.090> can

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
removed the top cover as well so you can

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.080 
removed the top cover as well so you can
see<00:04:48.510> inside<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.350> timing<00:04:49.590> belt<00:04:49.830> system<00:04:50.310> so

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
see inside the the timing belt system so

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.540 
see inside the the timing belt system so
this<00:04:51.240> double<00:04:51.630> this<00:04:52.440> build<00:04:52.740> has<00:04:53.070> ridges<00:04:53.430> on

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
this double this build has ridges on

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.430 
this double this build has ridges on
both<00:04:53.760> sides<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:54.570> is<00:04:54.720> your<00:04:54.840> balance<00:04:55.200> shaft

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
both sides this is your balance shaft

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.520 
both sides this is your balance shaft
belt<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.039> this<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.150> your<00:04:57.300> top<00:04:57.510> balance<00:04:58.260> shaft

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
belt and this is your top balance shaft

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.320 
belt and this is your top balance shaft
and<00:04:58.740> again<00:04:59.070> you<00:04:59.250> can<00:04:59.400> see<00:04:59.550> this<00:04:59.729> notch<00:04:59.970> on<00:05:00.180> the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
and again you can see this notch on the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.270 
and again you can see this notch on the
back<00:05:00.479> of<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.720> pulley<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.289> lined<00:05:01.950> up<00:05:02.039> with<00:05:02.100> this

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
back of the pulley is lined up with this

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.010 
back of the pulley is lined up with this
notch<00:05:02.490> in<00:05:02.700> the<00:05:02.789> housing<00:05:03.210> it's<00:05:03.479> not<00:05:03.660> lined<00:05:03.870> up

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
notch in the housing it's not lined up

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.590 
notch in the housing it's not lined up
exactly<00:05:04.800> right<00:05:05.070> just<00:05:05.729> because<00:05:06.090> that's<00:05:06.390> the

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
exactly right just because that's the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.630 
exactly right just because that's the
way<00:05:06.720> it<00:05:06.810> falls<00:05:07.080> because<00:05:07.350> of<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:08.160> spacing

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
way it falls because of the the spacing

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.560 
way it falls because of the the spacing
of<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.850> cogs<00:05:09.090> that's<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:10.260> proper<00:05:11.010> position

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
of the cogs that's the proper position

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.409 
of the cogs that's the proper position
so<00:05:12.570> down<00:05:12.840> here<00:05:13.410> inside<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.610> triangle<00:05:15.150> of<00:05:15.270> your

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
so down here inside the triangle of your

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:16.850 
so down here inside the triangle of your
balance<00:05:15.720> shaft<00:05:15.960> belt<00:05:16.200> is<00:05:16.320> your<00:05:16.410> tensioner

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
balance shaft belt is your tensioner

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.830 
balance shaft belt is your tensioner
this<00:05:17.520> is<00:05:17.669> the<00:05:17.820> late<00:05:18.000> style<00:05:18.270> tension<00:05:18.690> or<00:05:18.780> the

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
this is the late style tension or the

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.080 
this is the late style tension or the
automatic<00:05:19.260> tensioner<00:05:19.889> I<00:05:20.100> have<00:05:20.639> checked<00:05:20.940> this

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
automatic tensioner I have checked this

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.730 
automatic tensioner I have checked this
tensioner<00:05:21.510> with<00:05:21.539> a<00:05:21.660> tool<00:05:21.930> when<00:05:22.169> it's<00:05:22.320> right<00:05:22.560> on

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
tensioner with a tool when it's right on

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.830 
tensioner with a tool when it's right on
so<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.250> don't<00:05:23.460> bother<00:05:23.820> using<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.419> tensioning

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
so I don't bother using a tensioning

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.050 
so I don't bother using a tensioning
tool<00:05:24.870> for<00:05:25.200> the<00:05:25.260> timing<00:05:25.470> belt<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.950> just<00:05:26.669> let<00:05:26.910> this

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
tool for the timing belt I just let this

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.270 
tool for the timing belt I just let this
tensioner<00:05:27.539> do<00:05:27.930> its<00:05:28.110> job<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:29.039> then<00:05:29.160> his

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
tensioner do its job and then his

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.040 
tensioner do its job and then his
balance<00:05:29.729> check<00:05:29.940> belt<00:05:30.240> here<00:05:30.479> you<00:05:30.659> want<00:05:30.870> it<00:05:30.930> to

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
balance check belt here you want it to

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.890 
balance check belt here you want it to
be<00:05:31.169> not<00:05:31.680> terribly<00:05:32.220> tight<00:05:32.520> but<00:05:33.330> not<00:05:33.360> floppy

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
be not terribly tight but not floppy

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.019 
be not terribly tight but not floppy
loose<00:05:34.320> this<00:05:34.890> is<00:05:35.070> about<00:05:35.340> the

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.029 
loose this is about the

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.779 
loose this is about the
the<00:05:36.479> right<00:05:36.689> tension<00:05:36.989> for<00:05:37.439> it<00:05:37.589> just<00:05:38.159> just<00:05:38.579> by

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
the right tension for it just just by

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.819 
the right tension for it just just by
feel<00:05:39.089> and<00:05:39.959> kind<00:05:40.079> of<00:05:40.199> give<00:05:40.319> it<00:05:40.379> a<00:05:40.409> little<00:05:40.499> push

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:40.829 
feel and kind of give it a little push

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:42.709 
feel and kind of give it a little push
you<00:05:41.219> can<00:05:41.369> kind<00:05:41.549> of<00:05:41.579> see<00:05:41.759> it<00:05:41.909> see<00:05:42.239> it<00:05:42.269> vibrate

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 
you can kind of see it see it vibrate

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.019 
you can kind of see it see it vibrate
there<00:05:42.959> I'm<00:05:43.619> not<00:05:43.769> using<00:05:43.949> a<00:05:44.129> lot<00:05:44.159> of<00:05:44.309> force<00:05:44.610> to

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
there I'm not using a lot of force to

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:49.100 
there I'm not using a lot of force to
deflect<00:05:45.929> it<00:05:46.849> this<00:05:47.849> is<00:05:48.149> your<00:05:48.629> timing<00:05:49.079> belt

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
deflect it this is your timing belt

from<00:06:08.309> spinning<00:06:08.639> but<00:06:09.479> the<00:06:09.689> built<00:06:09.929> on<00:06:10.110> it<00:06:10.229> has<00:06:10.349> to

00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:10.499 
from spinning but the built on it has to

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:12.169 
from spinning but the built on it has to
move<00:06:10.649> very<00:06:10.679> far<00:06:11.069> to<00:06:11.159> touch<00:06:11.399> it<00:06:11.610> that's<00:06:12.029> the

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:12.179 
move very far to touch it that's the

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:14.869 
move very far to touch it that's the
proper<00:06:12.629> adjustment<00:06:13.169> for<00:06:13.349> this<00:06:13.529> it<00:06:14.369> also<00:06:14.610> spins

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:14.879 
proper adjustment for this it also spins

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:16.639 
proper adjustment for this it also spins
quietly<00:06:15.389> so<00:06:15.719> the<00:06:15.839> bearings<00:06:16.169> are<00:06:16.289> good<00:06:16.469> I<00:06:16.589> don't

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:16.649 
quietly so the bearings are good I don't

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:17.869 
quietly so the bearings are good I don't
need<00:06:16.919> to<00:06:17.039> replace<00:06:17.369> that

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:17.879 
need to replace that

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.449 
need to replace that
it'll<00:06:18.509> get<00:06:18.839> kind<00:06:19.649> of<00:06:19.709> dried<00:06:19.979> out<00:06:20.009> and

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:20.459 
it'll get kind of dried out and

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:23.659 
it'll get kind of dried out and
sometimes<00:06:20.849> sound<00:06:21.360> a<00:06:21.419> little<00:06:21.629> scratchy<00:06:22.669> this

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
sometimes sound a little scratchy this

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.869 
sometimes sound a little scratchy this
pulley<00:06:24.029> in<00:06:24.239> here<00:06:24.689> this<00:06:25.139> is<00:06:25.199> your<00:06:25.849> timing<00:06:26.849> belt
