00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
of pliers that you could position or you

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.290 
of pliers that you could position or you
can<00:00:56.559> mark<00:00:56.830> with<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.040> sharpie<00:00:57.489> marker<00:00:57.879> where<00:00:58.120> you

want your hole to be and just like your
old<00:01:03.190> fashioned<00:01:03.820> hole<00:01:04.030> punch<00:01:04.330> paper<00:01:04.629> punch

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
old fashioned hole punch paper punch

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.610 
old fashioned hole punch paper punch
takes<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.400> little<00:01:06.610> bit<00:01:06.820> of<00:01:06.880> muscle<00:01:07.420> but<00:01:08.320> pokes

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
takes a little bit of muscle but pokes

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.789 
takes a little bit of muscle but pokes
it<00:01:09.090> through<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.299> metal<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:14.590> just

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
it through the metal and then you just

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.910 
it through the metal and then you just
have<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:15.250> wiggle<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.270> out<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:17.470> can<00:01:17.500> create

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
have to wiggle it out and you can create

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.670 
have to wiggle it out and you can create
a<00:01:18.010> hole<00:01:18.280> there<00:01:18.549> so<00:01:18.820> I<00:01:18.850> could<00:01:18.970> actually<00:01:19.650> put<00:01:20.650> a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
a hole there so I could actually put a

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.450 
a hole there so I could actually put a
jump<00:01:21.130> ring<00:01:21.369> or<00:01:21.760> a<00:01:22.270> wire<00:01:22.600> wrap<00:01:22.930> there<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.620> if<00:01:24.310> I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
jump ring or a wire wrap there and if I

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:33.360 
jump ring or a wire wrap there and if I
wanted<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:25.060> do<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:26.190> couple<00:01:27.190> holes<00:01:32.130> could<00:01:33.130> do

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
wanted to do a couple holes could do

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.660 
wanted to do a couple holes could do
that

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:46.399 

and<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.880> wiggle<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.360> out<00:01:45.110> hopefully<00:01:46.110> it

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and just wiggle it out hopefully it

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
and just wiggle it out hopefully it
comes<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.740> easily<00:01:47.030> sometimes<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.450> takes<00:01:48.900> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
comes out easily sometimes it takes a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.780 
comes out easily sometimes it takes a
little<00:01:49.170> time<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.400> have<00:01:50.580> any

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
little time and then if you have any

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.399 
little time and then if you have any
rough<00:01:51.090> edges<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.780> take<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:54.080> file<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.350> just

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
rough edges you can take a file and just

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.469 
rough edges you can take a file and just
file<00:01:55.830> that<00:01:56.009> down<00:01:57.500> but<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:59.479> really

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
file that down but that's a really

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.870 
file that down but that's a really
simple<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.080> creative<00:02:01.500> way<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.640> use

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
simple and creative way that you can use

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.690 
simple and creative way that you can use
some<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.270> these<00:02:03.420> pieces<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.979> make<00:02:05.159> them<00:02:05.430> as

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
some of these pieces to make them as

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.199 
some of these pieces to make them as
connectors<00:02:06.360> or<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:09.149> paint<00:02:10.140> chain<00:02:10.440> from<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.209> and

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
connectors or to paint chain from it and

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.620 
connectors or to paint chain from it and
it's<00:02:12.630> very<00:02:12.900> easy<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.470> do
