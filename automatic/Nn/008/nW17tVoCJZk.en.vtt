00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.040
 and good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.769
 new race by adriana 5 esp today 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.809
 on the US Grand Prix race 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.330
 that has been quite fun for 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.920
 it 's a tilke circuit and it's 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.920
 that in these normally the races 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.460
 They are quite as many bears as they already did in Sochi 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.920
 but good here we have seen enough 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.770
 fights 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.340
 and especially for the victory a 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.280
 victory that morally makes her very 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.470
 strong to hamilton for what remains of 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.920
 championship that are two races and is that 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.360
 and his fifth consecutive victory but 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.410
 the toast meal that he has made 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.180
 today to rosberg I think it is gives more 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.210
 moral strength that the four victories 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.090
 previous together because 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.489
 true that rosberg of half of 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.059
 championship so that it appears that it 's 500 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.379
 and a little bit down and despite being 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.719
 passing the pressure to hamilton since 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.729
 is the leader seems to be able to 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.790
 to him more of that pressure to have him 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.580
 behind as it is seen today and is that he 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.100
 has left a tremendous gap to hamilton for 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.890
 that was to fall and put on first 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.570
 position and good in spite of that then no 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.960
 Nor has he been able to follow him 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.620
 pace so 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.380
 for the two remaining races 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.170
 clear candidate to victory hamilton and 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.710
 even though he wins for example 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.980
 in Brazil and Robert will not score for a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.740
 reliability problem an abandonment the 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.500
 difference would be 49 points and as 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.480
 you know the last race is worth double and if 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.210
 in that last race hamilton abandons 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.760
 and win rosberg would be the champion of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.170
 world despite wearing hamilton with that 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.380
 hypothetical is this victory in Brazil 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.840
 six consecutive races winning the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.250
 victory to rosberg in abu dhabi and the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.770
 abandonment of hamilton would give him the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.570
 championship more than good leaving a 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.000
 side those assumptions that still 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.250
 was missing a little bit and focusing on the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.340
 today's race already as I have commented those 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.950
 two first positions then behind 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.410
 the two mercedes then it has been 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.190
 ricciardo ricciardo that always 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.490
 Take advantage of the opportunities you have 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.260
 with your car 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.650
 and what will also make Williams 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.720
 because williams in many circuits is 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.390
 the second team but is that 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.650
 strategically this year is pulling 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.910
 many podiums overboard and those podiums 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.870
 that throw overboard I think that 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.740
 they come fundamentally for not wanting 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.530
 discriminate against any of your pilots 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.740
 strategically and in the end what they 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.990
 happens is that he eats the toast 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.960
 ricciardo that has already happened in several 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.510
 races and at the end is in that third 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.370
 position is ricciardo and ni williams climbs 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.040
 the podium and I hope for the next 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.850
 season do look for if 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.860
 they still have a top 3 top 4 car 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.460
 for next year with which they can 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.560
 choose to make podiums 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.820
 Well, they can not throw it overboard 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.800
 as long as they have that opportunity by 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.140
 the strategy and they have to do it 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.970
 look at the truth and good in then in 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.980
 fourth and fifth position as I have already 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.380
 said to be the williams by order of 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.420
 felipe massa and boots fifth and sixth 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.300
 position then we have alonso that of 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.900
 new has closed zarra oil 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.770
 who is burdened by himself and then 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.810
 also for having an engine today 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.910
 with a lot of wear and that was 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.860
 penalized in a few tenths for 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.440
 consequence of that excessive mileage 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.800
 that they have decided to use here for 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.960
 save the last new engine for the 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.830
 abu dhabi career and be able to adopt 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.110
 there to that double score and have then 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.540
 more points more options to stay more 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.700
 up and good despite that alonso has 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.920
 stayed in the position that pretty much 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.410
 he corresponds second the car plus the 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.130
 plus he gives and has got a good 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.320
 sixth position 7th vettel that has departed 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.740
 from the pitlane and has made a good 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.780
 race with four stops with four 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.770
 stops and in the end has finished seventh 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.640
 and I stick with alonso so he's done a 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.799
 good paper 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.110
 vettel in this grand prize 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.440
 after eighth position the first 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.130
 mclaren with magnussen 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.590
 in ninth position bernie and in tenth 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.140
 position 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.940
 maldonado shepherd who has got 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.830
 score after I do not know how long and 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.250
 I think it is 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.650
 the point of the season so it seems 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.080
 that has improved a little bit 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.910
 lotus in this final part of the 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.520
 season and I also think that they were going to 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.320
 try a new front wing but at 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.280
 final adopted by wearing the usual 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.680
 but still they have managed to improve the 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.700
 car a little bit maybe with pieces of 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.470
 Looking next year 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.070
 and he has gotten his first shepherd point 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.770
 maldonado and good speaking already in general 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.410
 about the championship because we have two more 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.000
 racing and as I said a lot 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.390
 emotion to see who is the champion of 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.460
 world I bet for hamilton but as 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.920
 I say in that last race he gives me 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.310
 that things are going to happen and maybe we have 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.920
 surprises facing the winner of this 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.360
 season so nothing here ends the 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.380
 video I hope you liked a 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.380
 greeting and until next time 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.500
 O well
