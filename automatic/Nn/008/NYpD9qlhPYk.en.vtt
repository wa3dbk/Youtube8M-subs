 fish hunting 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.010
 pelagics in tropical seas and 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.890
 subtropical especially I 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.449
 my name is philippe gelis hunt in the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.130
 big blue since about a fortnight 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.810
 years ago practiced during 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.940
 several years on the coasts 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 Mediterranean

 a pelagic fish that you can 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.649
 meet in tropical waters and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.110
 subtropical moment identification 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.719
 where it's pretty easy so you see this 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.539
 fish it all in length with a 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.590
 pointed muzzle army of teeth 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.960
 particularly keen on 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.420
 characteristics of this thazar these are 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.620
 vertical stripes that are of 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.620
 dark blue or black color 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.200
 the average weight with the swamp from 20 to 110 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.200
 kg 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.810
 their current content is held by a 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.030
 New Zealand hunter john kerry who 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.350
 last year in 2014 captured a 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:28.210
 62 8 kg specimen in Polynesia 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:31.330
 French where can we meet geese 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.850
 or and usually the waters 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.479
 tropical and subtropical all over the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.630
 planet 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.820
 the most interesting spots are the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.240
 pacific coast of mexico in particular 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.350
 the low-california the pacific coast 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.500
 central jamaica especially the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.310
 ghana matic the floridian coasts of 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.310
 snorkel northeast 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.090
 the African Atlantic coast in 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.430
 particular volcanic islands like the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.020
 cape towards the gulf of guinea in the ocean 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.020
 indian comoros south africa 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.430
 in the western Pacific Ocean and 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.640
 archipelagos like hawaii polynesia 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.680
 french and the fiji this fish like 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.350
 predator that can swim up to 60 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.540
 miles an hour they swim often 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.250
 solitary or with two lovers for 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.100
 will encounter a one- eyed constituted in 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.850
 general of a dozen elements 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.530
 usually the depth where they 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.210
 evolve to be between 30 and 80 m well 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.060
 heard that making incursions on the 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.660
 coast but can also evolve in 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.610
 waters in depth x 4 mm 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.870
 like all the fish that this fish m 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.350
 patrolled around stories submarines 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.970
 bad underwater around 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.070
 debris drifting on the surface 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.550
 whether organized or artificial 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.310
 such as PC and if you 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.930
 have a flash r you will increase 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.920
 the chances of meeting a waggon 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.500
 do not forget that these fish are 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.310
 seasonal and for example in the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.470
 Caribbean 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.610
 it migrates north when the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.610
 waters warms the feet 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.510
 getting closer to the web does not pose a problem 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.320
 problem if you adopt such a young age 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.410
 him in the focused about 3 4 meters you 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.570
 observe that the dorsal fin 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.460
 becomes more prominent the fish you 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.970
 observed 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.710
 more intense shooting is done 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.350
 most often three quarters back 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:01.100
 the line must of course be targeted 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.570
 lateral because it is a fish to his 3 if 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.310
 you are not sure of your shot there 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.540
 better to refrain because if you want 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.310
 that's the point without us being able to 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.520
 not recover it at the moment it goes 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.640
 discover once the shot made on 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.220
 point will therefore be accelerated under the surface 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.720
 water for about a minute in 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.109
 bringing with it the system of 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.520
 flotation after about a minute the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.630
 fish shows signs of exhaustion 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.310
 he will sound to the depths 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.950
 when you recover that fish be 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.180
 careful with the dentition that is 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.180
 particularly sharp 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.670
 so here is for the web or who is a 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.490
 particularly tasty fish I 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.860
