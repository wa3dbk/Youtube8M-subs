okay this is this is communication
breakdown<00:00:10.320> will<00:00:10.889> do<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.240> three<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.450> an

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
breakdown will do the three is an

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.250 
breakdown will do the three is an
explanation<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.380> studio<00:00:13.800> version<00:00:15.260> that's

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
explanation of the studio version that's

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:26.520 
explanation of the studio version that's
in<00:00:16.470> standard<00:00:17.190> tuning<00:00:17.280> of<00:00:17.550> course

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.750 

and<00:00:26.860> it's<00:00:27.070> actually<00:00:27.610> fairly<00:00:27.880> simple<00:00:29.520> it's<00:00:30.520> a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
and it's actually fairly simple it's a

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.140 
and it's actually fairly simple it's a
mostly<00:00:31.540> bar<00:00:31.780> chords<00:00:32.320> and<00:00:32.910> little<00:00:33.910> partial

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
mostly bar chords and little partial

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.660 
mostly bar chords and little partial
chords<00:00:34.660> won't<00:00:34.840> get<00:00:34.960> that<00:00:35.110> so<00:00:36.070> it<00:00:36.160> starts<00:00:36.490> off

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
chords won't get that so it starts off

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.170 
chords won't get that so it starts off
with<00:00:36.730> just<00:00:37.300> I<00:00:37.920> usually<00:00:38.920> hold<00:00:39.100> down<00:00:39.430> in<00:00:40.059> the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
with just I usually hold down in the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.970 
with just I usually hold down in the
live<00:00:40.360> version<00:00:40.600> Jimmy<00:00:41.110> would<00:00:41.230> do<00:00:41.380> this<00:00:41.590> this<00:00:41.860> is

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
live version Jimmy would do this this is

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.810 
live version Jimmy would do this this is
kind<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.220> a<00:00:42.309> lazy<00:00:42.520> way<00:00:42.670> of<00:00:42.790> doing<00:00:43.090> it<00:00:44.820> actually

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
kind of a lazy way of doing it actually

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.270 
kind of a lazy way of doing it actually
he<00:00:46.150> would<00:00:46.300> do

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.160 

but<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.789> studio<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.480> more<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.960> this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
but the studio one is more like this

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.069 
but the studio one is more like this
just<00:00:52.800> cover<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.370> e<00:00:53.640> string<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.390> E<00:00:54.420> string<00:00:54.839> is

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
just cover the e string the E string is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.779 
just cover the e string the E string is
what<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.629> read<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.559> cover<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.309> say

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
what you read so cover that with say

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.119 
what you read so cover that with say
your<00:00:59.969> ring<00:01:00.149> finger<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.769> second

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
your ring finger and on the second

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.789 
your ring finger and on the second
string<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.670> you're<00:01:03.350> basically<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.619> two

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
string so you're basically have two

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.950 
string so you're basically have two
octaves<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.479> go<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
octaves so you can just go with the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.560 
octaves so you can just go with the
strum<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> little<00:01:08.130> bit<00:01:08.310> tough<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.390> takes

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
strum is a little bit tough and it takes

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.180 
strum is a little bit tough and it takes
a<00:01:09.659> little<00:01:09.780> bit<00:01:09.930> practice<00:01:10.320> because<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.680> it's

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
a little bit practice because it's it's

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.219 
a little bit practice because it's it's
all<00:01:11.430> downstrokes<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.100> give<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
all downstrokes and you just give it a

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.200 
all downstrokes and you just give it a
now<00:01:16.229> you're<00:01:16.500> basically<00:01:16.710> doing<00:01:17.130> only<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.939> fat

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
now you're basically doing only the fat

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.930 
now you're basically doing only the fat
east<00:01:18.539> ring<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.080> bottom<00:01:19.409> string<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.490> come

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
east ring the bottom string but I come

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.130 
east ring the bottom string but I come
and<00:01:21.179> then<00:01:21.270> cover<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.289> e<00:01:22.319> above<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.630> cuz<00:01:24.630> you'll

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and then cover the e above it cuz you'll

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.690 
and then cover the e above it cuz you'll
get<00:01:25.289> some<00:01:25.470> spillover<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.369> picking

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
get some spillover with the picking

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.580 
get some spillover with the picking
anyway<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.300> it's<00:01:27.569> just<00:01:29.330> easy<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:30.690> then<00:01:31.259> for

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
anyway so it's just easy and then for

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.669 
anyway so it's just easy and then for
the<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.429> main<00:01:32.610> riff<00:01:32.850> part<00:01:33.229> it's<00:01:34.229> it's

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
the the main riff part it's it's

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:43.280 
the the main riff part it's it's
basically<00:01:35.190> going<00:01:36.440> D<00:01:40.459> so<00:01:41.459> you<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.759> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
basically going D so you do it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
basically going D so you do it
and<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.920> partial<00:01:44.460> core<00:01:44.700> which<00:01:44.910> is<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.240> these

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and a partial core which is just these

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.190 
and a partial core which is just these
three<00:01:50.240> just<00:01:51.240> barred<00:01:51.510> all<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.900> way<00:01:52.020> across

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
three just barred all the way across

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.530 
three just barred all the way across
with<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.560> ring<00:01:52.890> finger<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.640> seventh

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
with your ring finger and the seventh

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
fret seventh fret those uh it's the D G

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.430 
fret seventh fret those uh it's the D G
and<00:02:01.260> B<00:02:01.500> strings<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.930> puts<00:02:04.230> you<00:02:04.410> in

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
and B strings and then that puts you in

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.520 
and B strings and then that puts you in
a<00:02:04.740> nice<00:02:04.950> position<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.670> go<00:02:05.790> straight<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> an<00:02:06.330> A

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.350 

you<00:02:09.039> can<00:02:09.190> hit<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.429> string<00:02:09.789> open<00:02:10.000> if<00:02:10.270> you

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
you can hit the a string open if you

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.620 
you can hit the a string open if you
want<00:02:11.040> it's<00:02:12.040> not<00:02:12.160> really<00:02:12.430> vital<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.880> can<00:02:13.030> go

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630
