00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
first select this point over here and we

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.080 
first select this point over here and we
want<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.760> shift<00:00:24.269> s<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:25.500> snap<00:00:26.099> our<00:00:26.400> cursor<00:00:26.849> to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
want to shift s to snap our cursor to

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.259 
want to shift s to snap our cursor to
selection<00:00:28.130> this<00:00:29.130> will<00:00:29.340> help<00:00:29.429> us<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.849> make<00:00:29.970> our

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
selection this will help us to make our

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.060 
selection this will help us to make our
trim<00:00:30.689> from<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> side<00:00:31.470> view<00:00:31.679> we're<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
trim from the side view we're going to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.530 
trim from the side view we're going to
add<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:33.410> Bezier<00:00:34.410> curve<00:00:35.210> it's<00:00:36.210> not<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> right

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
add a Bezier curve it's not in the right

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.979 
add a Bezier curve it's not in the right
plane<00:00:36.870> rotate<00:00:37.410> Z<00:00:37.920> 90<00:00:38.930> y<00:00:39.930> 90<00:00:41.480> now<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:42.930> here

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
plane rotate Z 90 y 90 now from here

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.619 
plane rotate Z 90 y 90 now from here
just<00:00:43.440> make<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:46.969> outline<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.239> your<00:00:49.070> trim

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
just make the outline of your trim

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.540 
just make the outline of your trim
because<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.800> cursor<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.250> at

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
because we have this cursor right at

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.549 
because we have this cursor right at
that<00:00:53.699> point<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.510> actually<00:00:54.840> select<00:00:55.079> our

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that point we can actually select our

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.869 
that point we can actually select our
point<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.449> snap<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:59.149> to<00:01:00.149> our<00:01:00.719> cursor<00:01:01.879> making

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
point and snap it to our cursor making

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:26.749 
point and snap it to our cursor making
sure<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.329> our<00:01:03.480> house<00:01:03.809> lines<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.920> itself

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.510 

if<00:01:27.759> you<00:01:27.969> hit<00:01:29.070> dubby<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:30.340> can<00:01:30.549> cut<00:01:31.539> it<00:01:32.460> cut<00:01:33.460> a

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
if you hit dubby you can cut it cut a

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.789 
if you hit dubby you can cut it cut a
segment<00:01:34.030> in<00:01:34.090> half<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.659> add<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.840> segment<00:01:35.770> in

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
segment in half and add a segment in

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:44.450 
segment in half and add a segment in
between<00:01:41.429> we'll<00:01:42.429> really<00:01:42.579> talk<00:01:42.909> too<00:01:43.149> much<00:01:43.299> about

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
going to change it to poly and we're

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.880 
going to change it to poly and we're
going<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.290> delete<00:02:17.860> all<00:02:18.549> but<00:02:19.540> four<00:02:19.989> dots<00:02:20.319> so<00:02:20.650> one

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.000 

to<00:02:35.410> get<00:02:35.560> these<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:36.070> align<00:02:37.470> I'm<00:02:38.470> going<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.860> use

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
to get these to align I'm going to use

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.710 
to get these to align I'm going to use
the<00:02:39.160> same<00:02:41.880> snapping<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.030> cursor<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.690> the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
the same snapping the cursor to the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.960 
the same snapping the cursor to the
selection<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.590> then<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:45.370> selection<00:02:45.820> to<00:02:45.910> the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
selection and then the selection to the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:03:23.700 
selection and then the selection to the
cursor<00:02:46.560> method

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:38.950 

you

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.150 

and<00:03:39.230> now<00:03:39.830> that<00:03:40.040> we<00:03:40.100> have<00:03:40.130> our<00:03:41.140> are<00:03:42.140> aligned<00:03:42.890> the

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
and now that we have our are aligned the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.590 
and now that we have our are aligned the
last<00:03:43.340> step<00:03:43.790> we're<00:03:43.940> going<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.090> do<00:03:44.240> we're<00:03:44.390> just

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
last step we're going to do we're just

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.010 
last step we're going to do we're just
going<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.870> type<00:03:45.590> in<00:03:46.660> how<00:03:47.660> we're<00:03:47.840> going<00:03:47.960> to

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
going to type in how we're going to

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.310 
going to type in how we're going to
select<00:03:48.230> this<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.920> hits<00:03:49.330> see<00:03:50.330> to<00:03:50.720> close<00:03:51.020> that

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
select this and hits see to close that

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.410 
select this and hits see to close that
line<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:52.160> now<00:03:52.310> we<00:03:52.370> have<00:03:52.490> one<00:03:52.850> line<00:03:53.090> running

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
line so now we have one line running

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.740 
line so now we have one line running
across<00:03:54.250> running<00:03:55.250> around<00:03:55.520> the<00:03:55.850> whole<00:03:56.000> edge<00:03:56.390> of

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
across running around the whole edge of

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.920 
across running around the whole edge of
the<00:03:56.870> house<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:58.120> I'm<00:03:59.120> going<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.390> select<00:03:59.660> my

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
the house and I'm going to select my

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.610 
the house and I'm going to select my
trim<00:04:00.260> now<00:04:00.550> I'm<00:04:01.550> going<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.820> name<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.000> trim<00:04:02.420> and

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.770 

that<00:04:06.620> edge<00:04:06.890> that<00:04:07.580> we<00:04:07.670> selected<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.300> bevel

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
that edge that we selected and bevel

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.950 
that edge that we selected and bevel
object<00:04:09.260> we're<00:04:09.440> going<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.680> just<00:04:09.950> type<00:04:10.160> in<00:04:10.340> trim

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
object we're going to just type in trim

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.480 
object we're going to just type in trim
now<00:04:11.960> you'll<00:04:12.530> see<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.860> goes<00:04:13.040> around<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.400> whole

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
now you'll see it goes around the whole

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.600 
now you'll see it goes around the whole
house<00:04:14.260> there's<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.320> couple<00:04:15.500> problems<00:04:15.860> we<00:04:16.460> want

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
house there's a couple problems we want

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.660 
house there's a couple problems we want
to<00:04:16.700> turn<00:04:16.880> off<00:04:17.060> back<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.630> front<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.489> then<00:04:19.489> we

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
to turn off back and front and then we

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.040 
to turn off back and front and then we
want<00:04:19.850> to<00:04:20.000> go<00:04:20.300> in<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:21.739> curve<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.400> hit<00:04:22.760> W<00:04:23.270> switch

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
want to go in the curve and hit W switch

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:31.600 
want to go in the curve and hit W switch
direction

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:44.279 

or<00:04:33.939> rotate<00:04:34.939> x<00:04:35.270> 90<00:04:41.560> just<00:04:42.560> play<00:04:42.860> with<00:04:43.039> it<00:04:43.280> until

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
or rotate x 90 just play with it until

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.570 
or rotate x 90 just play with it until
your<00:04:45.289> curve<00:04:46.930> lines<00:04:47.930> up<00:04:48.259> how<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.710> is<00:04:48.979> supposed

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
your curve lines up how it is supposed

00:04:49.580 --> 00:05:32.580 
your curve lines up how it is supposed
to

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.280 

and<00:05:34.890> that's<00:05:36.390> basically<00:05:37.390> how<00:05:37.720> you<00:05:37.840> do<00:05:38.110> the

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
and that's basically how you do the

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.490 
and that's basically how you do the
molding<00:05:39.450> the<00:05:40.450> normals<00:05:40.840> right<00:05:41.110> now<00:05:41.290> are

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
molding the normals right now are

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.640 
molding the normals right now are
actually<00:05:43.230> on<00:05:44.230> the<00:05:44.290> wrong<00:05:44.980> side<00:05:46.050> but<00:05:47.050> you<00:05:47.470> can

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
actually on the wrong side but you can

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.410 
actually on the wrong side but you can
get<00:05:47.800> rid<00:05:47.860> of<00:05:47.980> that<00:05:48.070> once<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:48.700> convert<00:05:49.090> it<00:05:49.240> to<00:05:49.270> a

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
get rid of that once you convert it to a

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.790 
get rid of that once you convert it to a
polygon<00:05:49.930> using<00:05:50.560> alt<00:05:50.800> see<00:05:51.190> and<00:05:52.260> there<00:05:53.260> you<00:05:53.500> see

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
polygon using alt see and there you see

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.940 
polygon using alt see and there you see
that<00:05:54.490> your<00:05:55.290> normals<00:05:56.290> are<00:05:56.500> now<00:05:56.620> on<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.830> right

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
that your normals are now on the right

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.990 
that your normals are now on the right
side<00:05:57.160> and<00:05:57.400> that's<00:05:57.550> basically<00:05:57.940> how<00:05:58.450> you<00:06:00.000> create

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
side and that's basically how you create

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.790 
side and that's basically how you create
trim<00:06:01.360> or<00:06:01.570> molding<00:06:02.250> in<00:06:03.250> blender
