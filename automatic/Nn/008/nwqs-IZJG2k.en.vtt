yes it going he likes potentiometer on

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.170 
yes it going he likes potentiometer on
there's<00:00:45.649> actually<00:00:46.190> I<00:00:46.519> don't<00:00:46.879> know<00:00:46.940> it's<00:00:47.059> not

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
there's actually I don't know it's not

of this pitch yaw blur the edges put us
for<00:00:50.449> like<00:00:50.600> your<00:00:51.260> phone<00:00:51.589> so<00:00:51.860> does<00:00:52.040> five<00:00:52.730> legs<00:00:53.180> on

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
for like your phone so does five legs on

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:04.420 
for like your phone so does five legs on
instead<00:00:53.870> of<00:00:53.930> three<00:00:55.720> it's<00:00:56.720> not<00:00:56.960> six<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.920> do

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
instead of three it's not six and do

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.580 
instead of three it's not six and do
that<00:01:04.670> much<00:01:04.879> ariat<00:01:05.750> really<00:01:06.140> lights<00:01:06.350> up

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
that much ariat really lights up

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.580 
that much ariat really lights up
brightly<00:01:09.940> since<00:01:10.940> I<00:01:11.060> got<00:01:11.240> glued<00:01:11.929> like<00:01:12.289> how<00:01:12.530> it

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
brightly since I got glued like how it

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.300 
brightly since I got glued like how it
is<00:01:13.420> this<00:01:14.420> wood<00:01:15.170> is<00:01:15.200> blocked<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.800> other<00:01:16.009> half

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
is this wood is blocked and other half

is this wood is blocked and other half
the<00:01:16.520> light<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:20.840> can<00:01:20.929> see<00:01:20.990> when<00:01:21.289> I<00:01:21.380> turn<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.710> all

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
the light you can see when I turn it all

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.320 
the light you can see when I turn it all

the way down geez life thank you but um
and<00:01:27.289> this<00:01:27.679> here<00:01:28.009> I'm<00:01:28.100> talking<00:01:28.520> about<00:01:30.340> see<00:01:31.340> that

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
and this here I'm talking about see that

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.480 
and this here I'm talking about see that
a<00:01:33.340> lower<00:01:34.340> voltage<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:35.360> then<00:01:36.220> going<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.340> turn

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
a lower voltage and then going to turn

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.719 
a lower voltage and then going to turn
up<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.789> little<00:01:38.000> bit<00:01:42.220> i'm<00:01:43.220> going<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.429> see<00:01:43.580> which

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
up a little bit i'm going to see which

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.589 
up a little bit i'm going to see which
lights<00:01:44.060> are<00:01:44.270> brighter<00:01:45.759> like<00:01:46.759> these<00:01:47.060> few<00:01:47.420> right

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:47.599 
lights are brighter like these few right

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:53.010 
lights are brighter like these few right
here<00:01:47.899> dimmer<00:01:48.819> this<00:01:49.819> one<00:01:50.060> looks<00:01:50.390> tone<00:01:51.380> greenish

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
here dimmer this one looks tone greenish

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.490 
here dimmer this one looks tone greenish
downs<00:01:54.020> like<00:01:55.450> tone<00:01:56.450> would<00:01:56.750> let<00:01:57.020> me<00:01:57.110> just<00:01:57.319> make

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
downs like tone would let me just make

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.119 
downs like tone would let me just make
it<00:01:57.649> brighter<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.479> now<00:02:02.780> now<00:02:03.319> you<00:02:03.379> can<00:02:03.950> see

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:04.129 
it brighter and and now now you can see

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:05.680 
it brighter and and now now you can see
what<00:02:04.190> i<00:02:04.280> say<00:02:04.489> like<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:04.879> see<00:02:05.179> these<00:02:05.300> when<00:02:05.509> to

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
what i say like you see these when to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.869 
what i say like you see these when to
look<00:02:05.840> blurry<00:02:06.520> these<00:02:07.520> four<00:02:07.849> don't<00:02:09.459> use<00:02:10.459> group

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
look blurry these four don't use group

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.839 
look blurry these four don't use group
this<00:02:11.030> group<00:02:11.150> going<00:02:11.599> here<00:02:11.840> do<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:13.580> one

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
this group going here do this one

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.000 
this group going here do this one
doesn't<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.450> then<00:02:14.750> these<00:02:14.900> two<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.440> those<00:02:15.650> two

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
doesn't and then these two and those two

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.780 
doesn't and then these two and those two
right<00:02:16.190> there<00:02:16.270> one<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.330> those<00:02:17.420> are<00:02:17.599> brought<00:02:17.810> out

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.780 

the<00:02:22.790> ni<00:02:23.090> see<00:02:24.730> these<00:02:25.730> four<00:02:26.030> are<00:02:26.090> not<00:02:27.790> it's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
the ni see these four are not it's

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.290 
the ni see these four are not it's
bright<00:02:29.739> that's<00:02:30.739> because<00:02:31.010> these<00:02:31.129> leds<00:02:31.670> your

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
bright that's because these leds your

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.990 
bright that's because these leds your
mass<00:02:32.510> produced<00:02:33.879> very<00:02:34.879> quickly<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.629> cheaply

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
mass produced very quickly and cheaply

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.640 
mass produced very quickly and cheaply
not<00:02:38.000> all<00:02:38.269> of<00:02:38.300> them<00:02:38.450> are<00:02:38.629> exactly<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.620> same

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
not all of them are exactly the same

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.170 
not all of them are exactly the same
voltage<00:02:40.220> they<00:02:40.730> might<00:02:40.940> be<00:02:41.120> off<00:02:41.420> by<00:02:43.180> two-tenths

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
voltage they might be off by two-tenths

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.899 
voltage they might be off by two-tenths
of<00:02:44.629> a<00:02:44.780> volt<00:02:47.230> two<00:02:48.230> tenths<00:02:48.560> why<00:02:49.340> that'd<00:02:49.579> be<00:02:49.700> one

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
of a volt two tenths why that'd be one

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.890 
of a volt two tenths why that'd be one
fifth

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.740 

whatever<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:56.989> that<00:02:57.230> mad<00:02:57.440> about<00:02:58.750> 3.2

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
whatever but this is that mad about 3.2

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.460 
whatever but this is that mad about 3.2
volts<00:03:01.180> now<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.360> looks<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:02.630> about<00:03:02.900> this<00:03:03.349> year

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
volts now it looks like about this year

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.140 
volts now it looks like about this year
it's<00:03:06.470> all<00:03:06.620> about<00:03:06.860> 3<00:03:07.160> volts<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:07.580> mean<00:03:07.760> I've<00:03:07.880> got

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
it's all about 3 volts I mean I've got

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.130 
it's all about 3 volts I mean I've got
the<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.950> voltage<00:03:10.690> measure<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.840> mean

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
the the voltage measure I mean

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.490 
the the voltage measure I mean
multimeter<00:03:12.620> hooked<00:03:12.890> up<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.220> right<00:03:13.400> now<00:03:13.430> but

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
multimeter hooked up to it right now but

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:32.650 
multimeter hooked up to it right now but
if<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.680> did<00:03:19.000> how<00:03:20.000> much<00:03:20.209> power<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.349> is<00:03:31.299> back<00:03:32.299> up<00:03:32.510> a

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
if I did how much power it is back up a

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.009 
if I did how much power it is back up a
bit<00:03:36.849> earlier<00:03:37.849> today<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.330> took<00:03:38.420> me<00:03:38.599> 20<00:03:38.959> minutes

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
bit earlier today it took me 20 minutes

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.449 
bit earlier today it took me 20 minutes
to<00:03:39.290> actually<00:03:39.470> build<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:42.160> then<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:43.310> took

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
to actually build it then it took

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.289 
to actually build it then it took
another<00:03:43.580> 20<00:03:44.269> minutes<00:03:45.069> maybe<00:03:46.069> 30<00:03:46.400> minutes<00:03:46.670> to

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
another 20 minutes maybe 30 minutes to

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.800 
another 20 minutes maybe 30 minutes to
get<00:03:47.480> find<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:47.959> potentiometer<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:50.360> right<00:03:50.569> one

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
get find the potentiometer the right one

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.710 
get find the potentiometer the right one
said<00:03:51.110> this<00:03:51.230> other<00:03:51.440> one<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:52.760> worked<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.660> worked

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
said this other one it worked it worked

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.860 
said this other one it worked it worked
a<00:03:54.290> little<00:03:54.380> bit<00:03:54.530> more<00:03:54.739> smoother<00:03:58.359> sand<00:03:59.359> away<00:03:59.600> and

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
a little bit more smoother sand away and

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.190 
a little bit more smoother sand away and
stayed<00:04:00.290> dark<00:04:00.920> in<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:01.970> last<00:04:02.209> twenty<00:04:03.049> five

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
stayed dark in the last twenty five

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.640 
stayed dark in the last twenty five
percent<00:04:03.850> increases<00:04:04.959> abruptly<00:04:05.959> but<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.530> other

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
percent increases abruptly but the other

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.440 
percent increases abruptly but the other
one<00:04:07.209> had<00:04:08.209> too<00:04:08.630> much<00:04:09.010> resistance<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.609> the<00:04:11.090> LEDs

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
one had too much resistance and the LEDs

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.880 
one had too much resistance and the LEDs
weren't<00:04:11.720> getting<00:04:11.959> enough<00:04:12.019> power<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:12.859> they

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
weren't getting enough power so they

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.050 
weren't getting enough power so they
weren't<00:04:13.190> as<00:04:13.370> bright<00:04:13.720> so<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.970> probably<00:04:17.239> be

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
weren't as bright so you probably be

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.960 
weren't as bright so you probably be
like<00:04:20.060> that<00:04:20.359> bright<00:04:20.750> with<00:04:21.079> the<00:04:21.350> other<00:04:21.590> one<00:04:21.979> but

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
like that bright with the other one but

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.950 
like that bright with the other one but
yeah<00:04:23.389> this<00:04:23.630> makes<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:24.110> lot<00:04:24.139> different
