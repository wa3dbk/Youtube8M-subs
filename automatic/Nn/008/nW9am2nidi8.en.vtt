just<00:01:22.619> can't<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.890> around<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.220> right<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:23.549> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
just can't get around that right now and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.929 
just can't get around that right now and
he<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.020> set<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.290> chances<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.729> thing

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
he can just set up chances but the thing

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.819 
he can just set up chances but the thing
is<00:01:26.970> he<00:01:27.450> has<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> lot<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.869> attempts<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.500> saying<00:01:28.650> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
is he has a lot of attempts at saying of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.560 
is he has a lot of attempts at saying of
these<00:01:28.920> chances<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.880> you're<00:01:30.119> gonna<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
these chances so you're gonna see the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.850 
these chances so you're gonna see the
ones<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.049> he<00:01:31.110> puts<00:01:31.320> away<00:01:31.409> i<00:01:31.530> probably

should've included some ones that he

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.640 
should've included some ones that he
messes<00:01:33.180> up<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.900> see<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> guy<00:01:34.380> rage
