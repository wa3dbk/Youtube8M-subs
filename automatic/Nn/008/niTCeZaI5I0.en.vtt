all slide in here and they also they all
connect<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:32.430> called<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.850> parallel<00:00:33.390> where

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
connect it's called in parallel where

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.360 
connect it's called in parallel where
all<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> negatives<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:34.950> connected<00:00:35.280> together

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
all the negatives are connected together

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.010 
all the negatives are connected together
and<00:00:35.730> all<00:00:35.820> positives<00:00:36.420> are<00:00:36.540> connected<00:00:36.899> together

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and all positives are connected together

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.979 
and all positives are connected together
so<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.040> thing<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.480> these<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.719> check

so this thing out these all check
together<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.530> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
together and it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.260 
together and it
I'll<00:00:42.149> put<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.360> together<00:00:42.480> first<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:44.309> there<00:00:45.030> it's

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
I'll put it together first so there it's

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.330 
I'll put it together first so there it's
connected<00:00:45.660> together<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.590> does<00:00:46.800> has<00:00:47.129> two

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
connected together what it does has two

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.580 
connected together what it does has two
USB<00:00:47.820> ports<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> front<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.989> these<00:00:49.320> are

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
USB ports on the front and these are

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.319 
USB ports on the front and these are
where<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.070> use<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.579> charge<00:00:51.059> different

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
where you can use to charge different

whatever they can be charged with these

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.290 
whatever they can be charged with these
and<00:00:58.350> because<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.890> got<00:00:59.010> 18<00:00:59.370> 650s<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.149> here

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and because you got 18 650s in here

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.729 
and because you got 18 650s in here
they'll<00:01:00.480> last<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.930> lot<00:01:01.079> longer<00:01:01.140> than<00:01:01.590> your

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
they'll last a lot longer than your

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.310 
they'll last a lot longer than your
doublea's<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:03.090> actually<00:01:04.080> any<00:01:04.199> other

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
doublea's or your actually any other

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.719 
doublea's or your actually any other
battery<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.220> except<00:01:05.489> maybe<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
battery you really have except maybe a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.020 
battery you really have except maybe a
car<00:01:05.970> battery<00:01:06.350> they<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:08.189> output<00:01:08.640> they<00:01:08.939> have

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
car battery they the output they have

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.630 
car battery they the output they have
about<00:01:09.240> 12,000<00:01:09.960> milliamps<00:01:10.439> inside<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.250> them<00:01:11.400> so

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
about 12,000 milliamps inside of them so

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.130 
about 12,000 milliamps inside of them so
they<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:11.909> charge<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.390> iPad<00:01:12.750> probably

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
they can charge it but iPad probably

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.520 
they can charge it but iPad probably
twice<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.189> charge<00:01:14.369> up<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:14.610> cell<00:01:14.850> phone

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
twice they can charge up your cell phone

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.230 
twice they can charge up your cell phone
multiple<00:01:16.530> times<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:17.340> cell<00:01:17.880> phones<00:01:18.090> usually

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
multiple times your cell phones usually

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.289 
multiple times your cell phones usually
have<00:01:18.860> 1800<00:01:19.860> milliamps<00:01:20.460> or<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.180> can

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
have 1800 milliamps or so and so you can

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.910 
have 1800 milliamps or so and so you can
probably<00:01:21.570> charge<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.229> about<00:01:22.380> six<00:01:22.710> times

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
probably charge it up about six times

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.080 
probably charge it up about six times
with<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:24.530> these<00:01:25.530> these<00:01:26.400> ports<00:01:26.790> they're

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
with this these these ports they're

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.270 
with this these these ports they're
adjustable<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.840> their<00:01:28.080> output<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.040> headers

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
will switch here on the side it switches

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.340 
will switch here on the side it switches
from<00:01:31.079> half<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.500> mil<00:01:31.650> amp<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:32.880> milliamp<00:01:33.350> up

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
from half a mil amp to one milliamp up

from half a mil amp to one milliamp up
to<00:01:34.650> 2<00:01:34.890> milliamps<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:36.409> just<00:01:37.409> got<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> switch<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
to 2 milliamps and just got a switch to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.130 
to 2 milliamps and just got a switch to
switch<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.280> switch<00:01:38.490> them<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.659> once<00:01:39.960> the

switch to switch them and then once the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.889 
switch to switch them and then once the
batteries<00:01:40.500> died<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.549> micro<00:01:42.420> USB

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.800 
avoid having to order an 18 650 charger
like<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.399> showed<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.850> other<00:01:54.000> video<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.600> can

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
like I showed in the other video you can

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.690 
like I showed in the other video you can
just<00:01:54.960> use<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.350> instead<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.250> use<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> for

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
just use this instead you can use it for

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.249 
just use this instead you can use it for
charging<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.450> charging<00:01:58.040> them<00:01:59.040> back<00:01:59.189> up<00:02:00.259> so

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
charging and charging them back up so

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.050 
charging and charging them back up so
one<00:02:01.469> thing<00:02:01.649> that's<00:02:01.799> kind<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.070> odd<00:02:02.310> about<00:02:02.729> this

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
one thing that's kind of odd about this

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.789 
one thing that's kind of odd about this
is<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.689> once<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> batteries<00:02:04.619> in

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
is that once you get the batteries in

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.649 
is that once you get the batteries in
and<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.310> can't<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.700> turn<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.420> would

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
and you can't just turn it on that would

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.139 
and you can't just turn it on that would
be<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:06.869> too<00:02:06.899> simple<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.920> know<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.759> have

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
be way too simple for this know you have

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.960 
be way too simple for this know you have
to<00:02:09.270> plug<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.229> micro<00:02:10.560> USB<00:02:10.590> port<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.520> to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
to plug in the micro USB port and to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.760 
to plug in the micro USB port and to
here<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.870> gives<00:02:12.989> us<00:02:13.170> some<00:02:13.349> kind<00:02:13.470> of

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
here and it gives us some kind of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.080 
here and it gives us some kind of
ours<00:02:13.890> or<00:02:14.100> something<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.520> tells<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.970> can

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
ours or something that tells it it can

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.090 
ours or something that tells it it can
turn<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:16.230> push<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.590> button<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.980> little
