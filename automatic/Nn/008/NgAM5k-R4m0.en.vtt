00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
play go on but they never forgot that

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.200 
play go on but they never forgot that
initial<00:00:44.859> challenge<00:00:45.249> it<00:00:45.399> deserved<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:45.940> yellow

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
initial challenge it deserved the yellow

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.360 
initial challenge it deserved the yellow
car<00:00:46.449> now<00:00:46.780> referees<00:00:47.350> have<00:00:47.530> long<00:00:47.710> memories<00:00:47.920> and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
car now referees have long memories and

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.549 
car now referees have long memories and
yet<00:00:48.550> I<00:00:48.579> thought<00:00:48.879> so<00:00:49.179> yellow<00:00:49.899> card<00:00:50.229> for<00:00:50.350> the

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
yet I thought so yellow card for the

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.529 
yet I thought so yellow card for the
file<00:00:50.800> that<00:00:50.829> he<00:00:51.129> played<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.399> advantage<00:00:52.059> on<00:00:52.239> no

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
file that he played the advantage on no

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.299 
file that he played the advantage on no
problem<00:00:52.989> there<00:00:53.170> for<00:00:53.379> me<00:00:53.499> Claud<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:53.949> referee

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
problem there for me Claud the referee

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.369 
problem there for me Claud the referee
was<00:00:54.550> correct<00:00:55.179> he<00:00:55.329> produced<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.809> yellow<00:00:56.109> card

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
was correct he produced the yellow card

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.020 
was correct he produced the yellow card
after<00:00:56.559> trying<00:00:57.129> to<00:00:57.249> rather<00:00:57.429> play<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.819> develop

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
after trying to rather play to develop

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.090 
after trying to rather play to develop
now<00:00:58.569> the<00:00:58.629> referee<00:00:58.929> has<00:00:59.109> pulled<00:00:59.350> playback<00:00:59.829> no

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
now the referee has pulled playback no

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.579 
now the referee has pulled playback no
advantage<00:01:00.699> but<00:01:00.999> he's<00:01:01.569> deemed<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.049> original

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
advantage but he's deemed the original

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.590 
advantage but he's deemed the original
file<00:01:02.799> worthy<00:01:03.249> of<00:01:03.309> a<00:01:03.399> yellow<00:01:03.760> card<00:01:04.089> I<00:01:04.360> thought

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
file worthy of a yellow card I thought

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.969 
file worthy of a yellow card I thought
he'd<00:01:04.839> as<00:01:04.960> she<00:01:05.110> let<00:01:05.260> him<00:01:05.350> get<00:01:05.500> away<00:01:05.620> with<00:01:05.770> that

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
he'd as she let him get away with that

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.710 
he'd as she let him get away with that
club<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:06.400> he'd<00:01:06.490> every<00:01:06.850> right<00:01:07.060> you<00:01:07.240> know<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.420> it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720
