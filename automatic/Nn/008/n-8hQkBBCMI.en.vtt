one's<00:02:32.400> doing<00:02:32.519> its<00:02:32.760> job<00:02:32.909> so<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.239> can<00:02:33.360> see

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
one's doing its job so you can see

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.030 
one's doing its job so you can see
exactly<00:02:33.959> what<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.440> looks<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.739> when<00:02:34.950> it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
exactly what it looks like when it

yourself<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:39.390> wash<00:02:39.629> these<00:02:39.900> off<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.520> when

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
yourself so wash these off and when

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.630 
yourself so wash these off and when
you're<00:02:41.670> finished<00:02:43.010> there<00:02:44.010> are<00:02:44.190> two<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.520> these

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
you're finished there are two of these

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.130 
you're finished there are two of these
again<00:02:44.940> slide<00:02:45.420> one<00:02:45.660> in<00:02:45.810> front

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
again slide one in front

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.470 
again slide one in front
the<00:02:46.170> other<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.430> called<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.730> free<00:02:48.030> filter

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
the other this is called a free filter

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.290 
the other this is called a free filter
and<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.459> just<00:02:50.459> simply<00:02:50.520> means<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.150> is

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
and that just simply means that it is

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.520 
and that just simply means that it is
before<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:53.220> actual<00:02:53.670> self<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:55.050> it's<00:02:55.170> important

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
before the actual self so it's important

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.590 
before the actual self so it's important
to<00:02:55.590> know<00:02:55.709> which<00:02:55.920> way<00:02:56.100> your<00:02:56.280> air<00:02:56.400> flow<00:02:56.600> travels

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
to know which way your air flow travels

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.480 
to know which way your air flow travels
through<00:02:57.870> your<00:02:58.080> heating<00:02:58.380> system<00:02:58.410> in<00:02:59.100> this<00:02:59.220> case

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
through your heating system in this case

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.840 
through your heating system in this case
if<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.970> see<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.390> top<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.690> your<00:03:00.990> furnace<00:03:01.850> in

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
if you see it on top of your furnace in

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.090 
if you see it on top of your furnace in
most<00:03:03.060> cases<00:03:03.300> your<00:03:03.630> air<00:03:03.780> flow<00:03:04.020> is<00:03:04.260> from<00:03:04.470> top<00:03:04.800> to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
most cases your air flow is from top to

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.850 
most cases your air flow is from top to
bottom<00:03:05.370> in<00:03:05.910> other<00:03:06.120> words<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.480> sucks<00:03:06.810> air<00:03:07.050> from

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
bottom in other words it sucks air from

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.010 
bottom in other words it sucks air from
the<00:03:08.010> top<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:08.550> your<00:03:08.700> house<00:03:08.850> goes<00:03:09.390> through<00:03:09.840> the

the top in your house goes through the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.480 
the top in your house goes through the
furnace<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.560> blows<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:10.890> out<00:03:10.980> underneath<00:03:11.310> the

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
furnace and blows it out underneath the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.220 
furnace and blows it out underneath the
house<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.850> will<00:03:12.030> come<00:03:12.180> up<00:03:12.300> under<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.690> floor

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230

house and will come up under the floor
registers<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.910> if<00:03:15.030> that's<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.330> case<00:03:15.420> the

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
registers and if that's the case the

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.960 
registers and if that's the case the
pre-filter<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:16.680> obviously<00:03:17.040> go<00:03:17.220> on<00:03:17.489> top<00:03:17.730> of

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
pre-filter is obviously go on top of

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.210 
pre-filter is obviously go on top of
cells<00:03:18.540> since<00:03:18.840> they<00:03:18.989> are<00:03:19.050> pretty<00:03:19.320> filters<00:03:19.709> so

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
cells since they are pretty filters so

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.890 
cells since they are pretty filters so
once<00:03:20.400> you've<00:03:20.520> washed<00:03:20.700> those<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:21.690> slide

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
once you've washed those you can slide

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.470 
once you've washed those you can slide
three<00:03:22.200> filters<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.700> then<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.030> cells<00:03:24.269> go

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
three filters in and then the cells go

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.590 
three filters in and then the cells go
in<00:03:24.630> one<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.110> from<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.350> other<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.590> find<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.220> and

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
in one and from the other I find it and

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.180 
in one and from the other I find it and
since<00:03:27.600> we<00:03:27.750> now<00:03:27.900> know<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.800> this<00:03:28.980> furnace

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
since we now know that in this furnace

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.600 
since we now know that in this furnace
our<00:03:29.550> air<00:03:30.150> flows<00:03:30.510> from<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.200> top<00:03:31.459> through<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
our air flows from the top through the

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.009 
our air flows from the top through the
furnace<00:03:32.790> on<00:03:33.060> at<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.239> bottom<00:03:33.540> we<00:03:33.630> have<00:03:33.660> air

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
furnace on at the bottom we have air

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.229 
furnace on at the bottom we have air
flow<00:03:34.200> indicators<00:03:34.709> in<00:03:35.640> this<00:03:35.790> case<00:03:35.970> they<00:03:36.090> had<00:03:36.209> a

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
flow indicators in this case they had a

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.970 
flow indicators in this case they had a
handle<00:03:36.570> in<00:03:36.660> front<00:03:36.930> which<00:03:37.290> are<00:03:37.470> tell<00:03:37.650> us<00:03:37.680> that

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
handle in front which are tell us that

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.750 
handle in front which are tell us that
this<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.489> front<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.940> also<00:03:40.040> on<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.519> side

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
this is the front and also on the side

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.310 
this is the front and also on the side
is<00:03:42.239> your<00:03:42.480> connection<00:03:42.840> you'll<00:03:43.019> see<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
is your connection you'll see the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.080 
is your connection you'll see the
electric<00:03:43.590> connections<00:03:43.980> on<00:03:44.130> one<00:03:44.340> side<00:03:44.580> which

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
electric connections on one side which

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.420 
electric connections on one side which
obviously<00:03:45.480> need<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.930> go<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.980> power<00:03:47.220> head

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
obviously need to go to the power head

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.550 
obviously need to go to the power head
which<00:03:47.610> is<00:03:47.730> later<00:03:47.910> switches<00:03:48.420> so<00:03:49.050> there's<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.380> way

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
which is later switches so there's a way

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.380 
which is later switches so there's a way
that<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.800> can<00:03:49.950> tell<00:03:50.130> if<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:50.880> one<00:03:51.269> of

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
that you can tell if you have one of

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.449 
that you can tell if you have one of
these<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.380> mounted<00:03:52.799> on<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.100> side<00:03:53.430> of

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
these and it's mounted on the side of

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.970 
these and it's mounted on the side of
your<00:03:53.850> furnace<00:03:54.500> instead<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.650> horizontal

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
your furnace instead of a horizontal

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.039 
your furnace instead of a horizontal
fashion<00:03:56.400> but<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.790> vertical<00:03:57.269> fashion<00:03:57.450> you

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
fashion but a vertical fashion you

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.460 
fashion but a vertical fashion you
probably<00:03:58.530> have<00:03:58.739> an<00:03:58.860> up<00:03:59.100> flow<00:03:59.549> furnace<00:04:00.320> in<00:04:01.320> this

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
probably have an up flow furnace in this

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.750 
probably have an up flow furnace in this
case<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:01.829> have<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.040> down<00:04:02.310> flow

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
case we have a down flow

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.509 
case we have a down flow
let's<00:04:03.000> slide<00:04:03.239> those<00:04:03.510> in<00:04:04.190> under<00:04:05.190> front<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:05.459> the

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
let's slide those in under front of the

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.460 
let's slide those in under front of the
other<00:04:05.670> if<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.180> try<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.630> do<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:06.900> backwards

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
other if you try and do this backwards

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.270 
other if you try and do this backwards
by<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.769> way<00:04:08.010> they<00:04:08.579> upside-down<00:04:10.100> there<00:04:11.100> is<00:04:11.250> a

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
by the way they upside-down there is a

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.140 
by the way they upside-down there is a
keyway<00:04:15.380> built<00:04:16.380> into<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.519> will<00:04:17.640> hit<00:04:17.820> and

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
keyway built into it and it will hit and

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.479 
keyway built into it and it will hit and
it<00:04:18.239> will<00:04:18.390> go<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.019> fight<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.280> need<00:04:20.400> to

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
it will go to the fight so you need to

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.130 
it will go to the fight so you need to
stop<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.030> say<00:04:21.150> oh<00:04:21.180> wait<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.419> minute<00:04:21.510> my<00:04:21.780> clothes

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
stop and say oh wait a minute my clothes

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.980 
stop and say oh wait a minute my clothes
are<00:04:22.350> on<00:04:22.440> direction<00:04:22.890> most<00:04:23.100> likely<00:04:23.840> pull<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.900> out

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
are on direction most likely pull it out

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.190 
are on direction most likely pull it out
make<00:04:25.290> sure<00:04:25.410> you<00:04:25.500> got<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:25.860> there<00:04:26.510> correctly

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.310 

slide<00:04:31.200> attention<00:04:31.800> going<00:04:31.950> nice<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.400> easy<00:04:33.320> and

the door goes back on don't forget to

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.050 
the door goes back on don't forget to
turn<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.710> switch<00:04:37.830> on<00:04:38.100> don't<00:04:38.669> worry<00:04:38.789> if<00:04:38.970> the

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
turn the switch on don't worry if the

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.640 
turn the switch on don't worry if the
light<00:04:39.270> does<00:04:39.300> not<00:04:39.539> say<00:04:39.900> that<00:04:40.050> it's<00:04:40.169> on<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.500> only

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
light does not say that it's on the only

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.380 
light does not say that it's on the only
time<00:04:40.860> this<00:04:41.130> thing<00:04:41.340> actually<00:04:41.520> works<00:04:42.000> is<00:04:42.270> when

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
time this thing actually works is when

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.630 
time this thing actually works is when
there's<00:04:42.570> air<00:04:42.690> flow<00:04:42.900> going<00:04:42.930> through<00:04:43.640> the

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
there's air flow going through the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.640 
there's air flow going through the
filter<00:04:45.000> itself<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.510> has<00:04:45.660> an<00:04:45.780> air<00:04:45.990> sensor<00:04:46.530> in

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
filter itself it has an air sensor in

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.520 
filter itself it has an air sensor in
there<00:04:46.830> so<00:04:47.930> this<00:04:48.930> light<00:04:49.169> will<00:04:49.289> come<00:04:49.410> on

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
there so this light will come on

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.529 
there so this light will come on
automatically<00:04:50.220> when<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.970> furnace<00:04:51.360> blower

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
automatically when the furnace blower

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.300 
automatically when the furnace blower
comes<00:04:51.810> on<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.169> draws<00:04:52.680> air<00:04:52.890> through<00:04:53.160> the

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
comes on and draws air through the

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.050 
comes on and draws air through the
filter<00:04:53.789> so<00:04:54.750> that<00:04:55.110> should<00:04:55.260> help<00:04:55.289> you<00:04:55.560> identify
