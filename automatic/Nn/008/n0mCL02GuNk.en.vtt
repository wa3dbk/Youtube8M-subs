apart wood pallets like this one right
here<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:18.720> use<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:19.080> firewood<00:00:19.730> well<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> like<00:00:21.510> to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
here to use as firewood well I like to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.200 
here to use as firewood well I like to
burn<00:00:21.840> pallet<00:00:22.410> wood<00:00:22.500> like<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.949> because<00:00:23.460> it's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
burn pallet wood like this because it's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
burn pallet wood like this because it's
almost<00:00:24.900> always<00:00:25.230> very<00:00:25.710> dry<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.580> free<00:00:27.480> it's

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
almost always very dry it's free it's

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.779 
almost always very dry it's free it's
available<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.099> get<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.340> throughout<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
available you can get it throughout the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.939 
available you can get it throughout the
winter<00:00:30.029> usually<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.539> numerous<00:00:31.380> many<00:00:31.619> places

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
winter usually in numerous many places

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.340 
winter usually in numerous many places
but<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.790> also<00:00:32.969> very<00:00:33.360> safe<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:33.989> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
but it's also very safe because it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.350 
but it's also very safe because it
produces<00:00:34.829> little<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.309> no<00:00:35.430> creosote<00:00:36.000> because

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
produces little to no creosote because

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.729 
produces little to no creosote because
it<00:00:36.480> burns<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:36.989> hot<00:00:37.460> now<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:39.320> can<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.350> actually

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
it burns so hot now it can be actually

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.319 
it burns so hot now it can be actually
very<00:00:40.920> difficult<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.460> disassemble<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.149> wood

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
very difficult to disassemble a wood

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
very difficult to disassemble a wood
pallet<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.219> types<00:00:44.460> of

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
pallet like this because of the types of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.270 
pallet like this because of the types of
nails<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.300> uses<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.110> string<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
nails that it uses and the string to the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.119 
nails that it uses and the string to the
wood<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.629> crowbar<00:00:49.170> regular<00:00:49.649> crowbar

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
wood so a crowbar regular crowbar

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.819 
wood so a crowbar regular crowbar
doesn't<00:00:50.789> tend<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.059> work<00:00:51.239> very<00:00:51.270> well<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
doesn't tend to work very well and a

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.760 
doesn't tend to work very well and a
claw<00:00:53.129> hammers<00:00:53.579> almost<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> question

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
claw hammers almost out of the question

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.709 
claw hammers almost out of the question
a<00:00:55.800> lot<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.579> people<00:00:56.879> will<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.000> take<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> skill

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
a lot of people will just take a skill

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.720 
a lot of people will just take a skill
saw<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.410> cut<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:58.980> across<00:00:59.309> like

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
saw and just cut it right across like

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.580 
saw and just cut it right across like
this<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:00.449> they'll<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.899> again<00:01:01.140> here

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
this and then they'll do it again here

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.740 
this and then they'll do it again here
and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.370> they'll<00:01:02.520> cut<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> wood<00:01:03.059> again<00:01:03.300> here

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and then they'll cut the wood again here

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.570 
and then they'll cut the wood again here
then<00:01:04.290> they'll<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> firewood<00:01:05.280> that's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
then they'll have the firewood that's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.980 
then they'll have the firewood that's
great<00:01:07.280> but<00:01:08.280> unfortunately<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.210> also<00:01:09.390> produces

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
great but unfortunately it also produces

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.230 
great but unfortunately it also produces
a<00:01:10.049> lot<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.409> excess<00:01:10.830> sawdust<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.700> uses<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> lot

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
a lot of excess sawdust and uses a lot

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.469 
a lot of excess sawdust and uses a lot
of<00:01:12.330> energy<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.159> now<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.490> decided<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.330> make

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
of energy to do so now I decided to make

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.770 
of energy to do so now I decided to make
my<00:01:15.630> own<00:01:15.659> private<00:01:16.590> pry<00:01:17.159> bar<00:01:17.430> myself<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.630> it's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
my own private pry bar myself and it's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
my own private pry bar myself and it's
very<00:01:18.960> simple<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.650> bought<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.130> tractor

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
very simple I just bought one tractor

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
very simple I just bought one tractor
supply<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.299> bought<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> simple<00:01:21.960> crowbar<00:01:22.409> like

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
supply and bought a simple crowbar like

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.260 
supply and bought a simple crowbar like
this<00:01:23.060> but<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> welded<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.280> cross<00:01:26.280> piece<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.700> steel

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this but I welded a cross piece of steel

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.850 
this but I welded a cross piece of steel
on<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.590> end<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.590> I<00:01:31.590> used

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
on the end of it like that and I used

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.190 
on the end of it like that and I used
ATT<00:01:32.430> welding<00:01:32.850> rod<00:01:33.060> what<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.360> did<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.930> it's

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
ATT welding rod what I did but it's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.870 
ATT welding rod what I did but it's
basically<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.920> an<00:01:35.100> old<00:01:35.250> wrench<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.820> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
basically just an old wrench that I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.429 
basically just an old wrench that I
welded<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:36.840> cut<00:01:37.079> off<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
welded on there and then cut off the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
welded on there and then cut off the
ends<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.890> I'll<00:01:38.280> show<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.520> how<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.820> works<00:01:43.970> if

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
ends and I'll show you how it works if

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.569 
ends and I'll show you how it works if
you<00:01:45.060> notice<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.630> use<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.200> T<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.130> hook<00:01:47.340> onto

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you notice I use the T and to hook onto

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.060 
you notice I use the T and to hook onto
the<00:01:47.790> side<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:49.530> give<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.829> something

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the side like that to give it something

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:04.700 
the side like that to give it something
hang<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:56.930> like<00:01:57.930> that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.260 

of<00:02:05.710> course<00:02:05.980> many<00:02:06.280> times<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.670> just<00:02:06.880> can<00:02:07.000> pry<00:02:07.240> it

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
of course many times I just can pry it

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:28.650 
of course many times I just can pry it
right<00:02:07.510> off<00:02:07.660> like<00:02:07.780> that<00:02:25.560> now<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.680> course<00:02:27.660> some

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
right off like that now of course some

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.510 
right off like that now of course some
wood<00:02:28.900> pallets<00:02:29.380> are<00:02:29.560> easier<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.980> take<00:02:30.190> apart

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
wood pallets are easier to take apart

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.790 
wood pallets are easier to take apart
than<00:02:30.730> others

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
than others

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.170 
than others
some<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.920> whom<00:02:33.070> are<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.310> lot<00:02:33.459> easier<00:02:33.490> than<00:02:34.000> this

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
some of whom are a lot easier than this

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.550 
some of whom are a lot easier than this
one<00:02:35.160> some<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.340> them<00:02:36.430> are<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> lot<00:02:36.790> harder<00:02:37.560> those

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
one some of them are a lot harder those

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.890
