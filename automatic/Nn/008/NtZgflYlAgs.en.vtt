00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.660 
right now but I wait to the end of the
commentator<00:02:42.359> so<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.989> class<00:02:43.260> setup<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.430> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
commentator so the class setup this is a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.809 
commentator so the class setup this is a
golden<00:02:45.349> usas<00:02:46.349> 12<00:02:46.859> I<00:02:47.099> think<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.549> one<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.730> the

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819

golden usas 12 I think it's one of the
best<00:02:47.970> shot<00:02:48.209> guns<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.659> the<00:02:48.810> game<00:02:49.049> if<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.500> have

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
best shot guns in the game if you have

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.470 
best shot guns in the game if you have
to<00:02:49.769> if<00:02:49.889> you<00:02:50.129> have<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.549> obviously<00:02:50.790> get<00:02:51.180> range

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
to if you have to obviously get range

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.539 
to if you have to obviously get range
and<00:02:51.810> extend<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.170> mags<00:02:52.379> and<00:02:52.650> stuff<00:02:52.829> on<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.040> for

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
and extend the mags and stuff on it for

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.080 
and extend the mags and stuff on it for
it<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.909> a<00:02:53.940> decent<00:02:54.239> shot<00:02:54.599> gun<00:02:55.010> but<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.879> time

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
it to be a decent shot gun but the time

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.179 
it to be a decent shot gun but the time
is<00:02:57.359> actually<00:02:57.569> worth<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.079> i<00:02:58.260> will<00:02:58.590> say<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:58.799> is

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189
