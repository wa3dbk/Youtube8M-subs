you<00:04:22.760> what<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:22.970> do<00:04:23.120> on<00:04:23.240> that<00:04:23.390> ok<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.840> next<00:04:23.960> step

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
you what to do on that ok the next step

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.660 
you what to do on that ok the next step
which<00:04:24.350> is<00:04:24.380> pretty<00:04:24.650> obvious<00:04:24.800> is<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.220> plug<00:04:25.520> your

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
which is pretty obvious is to plug your

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.090 
which is pretty obvious is to plug your
USB<00:04:25.730> into<00:04:26.540> your<00:04:26.600> ps3<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.260> part<00:04:27.470> that's<00:04:27.680> not<00:04:27.920> so

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
USB into your ps3 the part that's not so

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.410 
USB into your ps3 the part that's not so
obvious<00:04:28.130> is<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.640> has<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:29.000> be<00:04:29.030> in<00:04:29.300> the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
obvious is it has to be in the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.630 
obvious is it has to be in the
right-hand<00:04:29.870> plug<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.260> your<00:04:30.440> ps3<00:04:30.740> so<00:04:31.190> if<00:04:31.460> you

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
right-hand plug of your ps3 so if you

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.700 
right-hand plug of your ps3 so if you
put<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:31.940> into<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.180> different<00:04:32.450> plug<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:33.080> the

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
put it into a different plug the the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.470 
put it into a different plug the the
application<00:04:33.860> basically<00:04:34.640> won't<00:04:34.910> recognize

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
application basically won't recognize

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.420 
application basically won't recognize
that<00:04:35.780> your<00:04:35.930> USB<00:04:36.440> is<00:04:36.530> plugged<00:04:36.800> in<00:04:36.950> it'll<00:04:37.160> be<00:04:37.250> in

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
that your USB is plugged in it'll be in
