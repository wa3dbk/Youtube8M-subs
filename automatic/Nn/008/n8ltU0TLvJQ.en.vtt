00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.050 

so<00:00:01.350> here<00:00:01.530> we<00:00:01.620> got<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:02.040> shockwave<00:00:02.669> fall<00:00:02.939> of

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
so here we got the shockwave fall of

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.550 
so here we got the shockwave fall of
Cybertron<00:00:03.629> in<00:00:04.009> robot<00:00:05.009> mode<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:06.379> he<00:00:07.379> pretty

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
Cybertron in robot mode and he pretty

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.919 
Cybertron in robot mode and he pretty
much<00:00:07.680> just<00:00:07.849> transforms<00:00:08.849> just<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.179> vehicle<00:00:09.450> and

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
much just transforms just a vehicle and

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.350 
much just transforms just a vehicle and
then<00:00:10.740> back<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.130> robot<00:00:11.400> but<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:11.940> think<00:00:12.240> they

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
then back to a robot but I think they

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.629 
then back to a robot but I think they
should<00:00:12.599> have<00:00:12.750> made<00:00:13.530> him<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.860> triple<00:00:14.400> changer

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
should have made him a triple changer

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.609 
should have made him a triple changer
because<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.660> get<00:00:15.839> pretty<00:00:16.020> much<00:00:16.139> get<00:00:16.440> him

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
because you can get pretty much get him

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.240 
because you can get pretty much get him
close<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.119> original<00:00:18.720> looking

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
close to to the original looking

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.290 
close to to the original looking
shockwave<00:00:20.250> back<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> g1<00:00:22.970> days<00:00:23.970> when<00:00:24.210> you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
shockwave back in the g1 days when you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.109 
shockwave back in the g1 days when you
look<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> gun<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.830> go<00:00:26.789> ahead<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.000> show

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
look like a gun but go ahead and show

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.970 
look like a gun but go ahead and show
you<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.330> couple<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:28.019> configuration<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.920> is

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
you a couple of configuration this is

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.150 
you a couple of configuration this is
pretty<00:00:29.279> easy<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.609> get<00:00:29.820> him<00:00:30.029> there<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
pretty easy to get him there so the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.350 
pretty easy to get him there so the
first<00:00:32.399> thing<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.610> usually<00:00:32.640> do<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.300> go

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
first thing I usually do is just go

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.180 
first thing I usually do is just go
ahead<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.570> stick<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.930> feet<00:00:34.559> together<00:00:34.739> just

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
ahead and stick the feet together just

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.479 
ahead and stick the feet together just
like<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.899> actually<00:00:37.100> that's<00:00:38.100> one<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
like you actually that's one of the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.450 
like you actually that's one of the
first<00:00:38.700> things<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.090> then<00:00:40.370> get<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.550> ready

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
from sticking out at this point up to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.490 
from sticking out at this point up to
this<00:01:23.640> point<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.689> got<00:01:25.380> his

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
gonna go ahead and actually stick this

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.960 
gonna go ahead and actually stick this
up<00:01:35.810> in<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.020> into<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.530> position<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:38.280> we're

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
up in this into this position like we're

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.020 
up in this into this position like we're
getting<00:01:39.119> news<00:01:42.710> ready<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:44.700> his<00:01:44.790> hands

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
getting news ready but then his hands

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.490 
getting news ready but then his hands
are<00:01:45.210> still<00:01:45.420> sticking<00:01:45.659> out<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.259> see

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
are still sticking out as you can see

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.620 
are still sticking out as you can see
and<00:01:47.280> then<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.640> kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> rotated<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> wings

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and then I kind of rotated the wings

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.100 
and then I kind of rotated the wings
back<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.149> legs<00:01:51.360> should<00:01:51.479> still<00:01:51.960> be

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
back so the the legs should still be

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.440 
back so the the legs should still be
stuck<00:01:53.070> together<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.060> got<00:01:54.360> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
stuck together and then you just got to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.429 
stuck together and then you just got to
bring<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.720> down<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:56.930> looks<00:01:57.930> pretty<00:01:58.170> cool<00:01:58.320> up

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
bring that down so looks pretty cool up

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.219 
bring that down so looks pretty cool up
to<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.649> point<00:01:59.000> um<00:02:00.000> let's<00:02:00.630> see<00:02:00.750> me<00:02:00.899> give<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.170> a

it looks cooler for you if you I mean

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.080 
it looks cooler for you if you I mean
you<00:02:13.240> could<00:02:13.390> stick<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:14.500> into<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.010> hand<00:02:15.280> but

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
you could stick this into the hand but

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.820 
you could stick this into the hand but
it<00:02:16.150> looks<00:02:16.270> cooler<00:02:16.570> if<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.780> uh<00:02:16.930> was<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.710> put

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.870 
there so you taking that that rectangle
piece<00:02:26.740> and<00:02:27.010> then<00:02:27.100> just<00:02:27.280> sticking<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.700> right

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
piece and then just sticking it right

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.080 
piece and then just sticking it right
there<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.510> actually<00:02:28.690> does<00:02:29.080> stick<00:02:30.090> pretty

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
there and it actually does stick pretty

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.780 
there and it actually does stick pretty
good<00:02:31.360> let's<00:02:31.600> see<00:02:31.720> we<00:02:31.900> go<00:02:31.990> ahead<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.230> look<00:02:32.760> do<00:02:33.760> a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
good let's see we go ahead and look do a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.490 
good let's see we go ahead and look do a
top<00:02:34.120> view<00:02:34.150> real<00:02:34.540> quick<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:34.870> kind<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.200> align

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
top view real quick and kind of align

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.180 
top view real quick and kind of align
the<00:02:35.710> barrel<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:37.530> I've<00:02:38.530> seen<00:02:38.770> we're<00:02:38.860> gonna<00:02:39.010> give

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
the barrel so I've seen we're gonna give

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.680 
the barrel so I've seen we're gonna give
you<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.340> shot<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.790> how<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.030> looks<00:02:40.210> on<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.420> top

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
you a shot of how it looks on the top

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.170 
you a shot of how it looks on the top
side<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.220> starting<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.550> look<00:02:42.670> like<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.880> gun

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
side so it's starting to look like a gun

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.590 
side so it's starting to look like a gun
at<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:44.050> point<00:02:44.320> right<00:02:44.440> here<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.510> there<00:02:46.510> you

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
at this point right here and there you

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.680 
at this point right here and there you
go<00:02:46.810> but<00:02:47.230> zoom<00:02:47.620> back<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.890> little<00:02:48.100> bit<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.660> that

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
go but zoom back a little bit so that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.380 
go but zoom back a little bit so that
kind<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.080> looks<00:02:50.290> like<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:51.580> old<00:02:51.730> shock<00:02:52.090> wave

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
kind of looks like the old shock wave

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.900 
kind of looks like the old shock wave
there<00:02:52.690> looks<00:02:53.650> really<00:02:53.920> really<00:02:54.160> cool<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.880> can

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
there looks really really cool you can

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.730 
there looks really really cool you can
just<00:02:55.120> sound<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.450> way<00:02:55.600> very<00:02:56.140> good<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.590> see

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
just sound the way very good can you see

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.260 
just sound the way very good can you see
it<00:02:56.860> better<00:02:57.510> really<00:02:58.510> cool<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:59.680> can<00:02:59.800> hold<00:03:00.270> hold

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
it better really cool you can hold hold

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.840 
it better really cool you can hold hold
it<00:03:01.390> pretty<00:03:01.690> good<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:03.130> can<00:03:03.160> kind<00:03:03.460> of<00:03:03.520> use<00:03:03.700> that

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
it pretty good you can kind of use that

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.140 
it pretty good you can kind of use that
little<00:03:04.090> triangle<00:03:04.330> right<00:03:04.540> there<00:03:05.340> as<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.760> trigger

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
little triangle right there as a trigger

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.300 
little triangle right there as a trigger
and<00:03:07.450> that's<00:03:07.840> pretty<00:03:08.080> much<00:03:08.200> what<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.530> would

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
and that's pretty much what it would

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.940 
and that's pretty much what it would
serve<00:03:09.640> for<00:03:10.420> every<00:03:10.660> comfort<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.170> take<00:03:11.410> every

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
serve for every comfort you take every

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.560 
serve for every comfort you take every
configuration<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.730> got<00:03:13.030> transform

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
configuration that you got transform

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.110 
configuration that you got transform
that<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:14.470> little<00:03:14.739> was<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.550> on<00:03:15.670> triangle

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
that that little was it on triangle

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.900 
that that little was it on triangle
conservative<00:03:16.750> sugar<00:03:16.989> pretty<00:03:17.500> much<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:18.760> can

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
conservative sugar pretty much you can

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.090 
conservative sugar pretty much you can
get<00:03:19.230> get<00:03:20.230> into<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.560> different<00:03:20.800> configuration

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
get get into a different configuration

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.930 
get get into a different configuration
where<00:03:21.970> let's<00:03:22.930> say<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:24.190> you've<00:03:24.340> got<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.520> shorter

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
where let's say so you've got a shorter

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.310 
where let's say so you've got a shorter
barrel<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.920> thing<00:03:27.600> actually<00:03:28.600> get<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.780> make

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
barrel on this thing actually get I make

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.720 
barrel on this thing actually get I make
it<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.440> little<00:03:29.470> bit<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.770> a<00:03:29.860> longer<00:03:30.100> barrel<00:03:30.520> and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
it a little bit of a longer barrel and

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.960 
it a little bit of a longer barrel and
by<00:03:31.660> stretching<00:03:31.989> this<00:03:32.290> out<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.590> little<00:03:32.739> bit<00:03:32.970> and

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
by stretching this out a little bit and

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.540 
by stretching this out a little bit and
so<00:03:34.180> I'm<00:03:34.239> gonna<00:03:34.360> go<00:03:34.480> ahead<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:35.160> zoom<00:03:36.160> out<00:03:36.340> and

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
so I'm gonna go ahead and zoom out and

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.740 
so I'm gonna go ahead and zoom out and
show<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:36.790> what<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.180> looks<00:03:37.390> like<00:03:37.450> right

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
show you what that looks like right

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.780 
show you what that looks like right
there<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.200> that's<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.470> longer<00:03:38.800> like<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:39.340> little

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
there so that's the longer like a little

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.600 
there so that's the longer like a little
bit<00:03:39.910> longer<00:03:40.180> barrel<00:03:40.739> bridging<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.280> then<00:03:42.489> you

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
bit longer barrel bridging and then you

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.570 
bit longer barrel bridging and then you
can<00:03:42.760> now<00:03:42.850> also<00:03:43.150> slip<00:03:43.540> this<00:03:44.130> sit<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.250> forward

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
can now also slip this sit and forward

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.850 
can now also slip this sit and forward
like<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:45.970> at<00:03:46.930> that<00:03:46.989> point<00:03:47.290> looks<00:03:47.590> pretty

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
like that at that point looks pretty

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.509 
like that at that point looks pretty
cool<00:03:48.070> so<00:03:48.519> I'm<00:03:48.610> gonna<00:03:49.209> hold<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.600> up<00:03:50.519> Salix

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
cool so I'm gonna hold it up Salix

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.410 
cool so I'm gonna hold it up Salix
really<00:03:51.820> cool<00:03:53.130> yeah

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
really cool yeah

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.270 
really cool yeah
and<00:03:56.420> then<00:03:56.930> there's<00:03:57.170> another<00:03:57.290> configuration

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
and then there's another configuration

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.420 
and then there's another configuration
that<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:59.000> can<00:03:59.120> just<00:03:59.300> actually<00:04:00.340> stiffen<00:04:01.340> up

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
that you can just actually stiffen up

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.880 
that you can just actually stiffen up
the<00:04:01.840> was<00:04:02.840> enough<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:04.100> handle<00:04:04.520> of<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.790> gun<00:04:05.060> by

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
the was enough the handle of the gun by

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.250 
the was enough the handle of the gun by
actually<00:04:06.890> inserting<00:04:07.400> this<00:04:07.600> this<00:04:08.600> barrel

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
actually inserting this this barrel

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.730 
actually inserting this this barrel
piece<00:04:09.910> into<00:04:11.140> where<00:04:12.140> would<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.620> would

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
piece into where would it would

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.569 
piece into where would it would
originally<00:04:13.310> sit<00:04:14.500> if<00:04:15.500> your<00:04:15.740> to<00:04:15.890> transform<00:04:16.430> them

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
originally sit if your to transform them

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.460 
originally sit if your to transform them
into<00:04:16.730> a<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:18.109> ship<00:04:18.920> so<00:04:19.989> go<00:04:20.989> ahead<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.170> show<00:04:21.410> you

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
into a a ship so go ahead and show you

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:34.240 
into a a ship so go ahead and show you
what<00:04:21.709> that<00:04:21.739> looks<00:04:22.100> like<00:04:24.160> be<00:04:25.160> sitting<00:04:25.580> here<00:04:33.250> so

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
what that looks like be sitting here so

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.740 
what that looks like be sitting here so
now<00:04:34.400> it's<00:04:34.550> stuck<00:04:34.790> together<00:04:34.970> looks<00:04:35.900> good<00:04:36.230> a

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
now it's stuck together looks good a

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.840 
now it's stuck together looks good a
little<00:04:38.750> bit<00:04:41.470> looks<00:04:42.470> more<00:04:42.650> like<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.850> 20

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
little bit looks more like a 20

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.580 
little bit looks more like a 20
millimeter<00:04:44.330> or<00:04:44.540> something<00:04:44.900> like<00:04:44.990> that<00:04:45.050> syn<00:04:45.470> at

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
millimeter or something like that syn at

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.100 
millimeter or something like that syn at
the<00:04:45.710> end<00:04:45.830> of<00:04:45.919> that<00:04:46.070> that<00:04:46.820> gun<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:47.930> cool

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
the end of that that gun and the cool

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.720 
the end of that that gun and the cool
thing<00:04:48.320> is<00:04:48.350> that<00:04:48.470> um<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:49.160> actually<00:04:49.190> is<00:04:49.640> a<00:04:49.669> little

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
thing is that um it actually is a little

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.470 
thing is that um it actually is a little
bit<00:04:49.880> sturdier<00:04:50.500> on<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.650> grip<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:53.180> you're<00:04:53.330> not

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
bit sturdier on the grip so you're not

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.720 
bit sturdier on the grip so you're not
worrying<00:04:54.200> about<00:04:54.290> squeezing<00:04:55.040> this<00:04:55.280> too<00:04:55.460> hard

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
worrying about squeezing this too hard

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.920 
worrying about squeezing this too hard
and<00:04:57.040> breaking<00:04:58.040> that<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:59.330> joint<00:04:59.600> right<00:04:59.780> there

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
and breaking that that joint right there

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.010 
and breaking that that joint right there
and<00:05:00.320> stuff<00:05:00.620> but<00:05:00.919> anyways<00:05:01.880> there's<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.720> trigger

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
and stuff but anyways there's a trigger

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.210 
and stuff but anyways there's a trigger
right<00:05:03.229> there<00:05:03.470> you<00:05:04.250> can<00:05:04.400> slide<00:05:04.640> this<00:05:05.890> back<00:05:06.890> like

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
right there you can slide this back like

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.240 
right there you can slide this back like
that<00:05:07.430> so<00:05:08.110> it<00:05:09.110> looks<00:05:09.290> like<00:05:09.350> a<00:05:09.470> scope<00:05:10.040> or

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
that so it looks like a scope or

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.050 
that so it looks like a scope or
something<00:05:10.610> or<00:05:10.910> you<00:05:10.940> can<00:05:12.669> flip<00:05:13.669> it<00:05:13.729> to<00:05:13.940> the

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
something or you can flip it to the

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.140 
something or you can flip it to the
front<00:05:14.380> so<00:05:15.380> you<00:05:15.440> got<00:05:15.620> it<00:05:15.740> cool<00:05:18.910> almost<00:05:19.910> like<00:05:20.120> a

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
front so you got it cool almost like a

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.960 
front so you got it cool almost like a
sight<00:05:20.540> if<00:05:20.780> you<00:05:20.960> will<00:05:21.140> on<00:05:21.979> your<00:05:22.160> target<00:05:22.550> so<00:05:22.910> it

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
sight if you will on your target so it

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.030 
sight if you will on your target so it
looks<00:05:23.090> really<00:05:23.330> cool<00:05:23.479> I<00:05:23.720> showed<00:05:24.620> you<00:05:24.740> a<00:05:24.830> few

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
looks really cool I showed you a few

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.580 
looks really cool I showed you a few
configurations<00:05:25.850> and<00:05:26.060> stuff<00:05:26.210> but<00:05:26.410> really<00:05:27.410> cool

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
configurations and stuff but really cool

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.020 
configurations and stuff but really cool
I<00:05:27.740> would<00:05:28.070> it<00:05:28.160> be<00:05:28.280> pretty<00:05:28.490> cool<00:05:28.669> if<00:05:28.729> they<00:05:28.880> would

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
I would it be pretty cool if they would

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.360 
I would it be pretty cool if they would
have<00:05:29.120> shown<00:05:30.080> this<00:05:30.260> transformation<00:05:31.040> and<00:05:31.250> the

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
have shown this transformation and the

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.350 
have shown this transformation and the
actual<00:05:31.760> instructions<00:05:32.390> and<00:05:32.630> and<00:05:34.210> referred<00:05:35.210> to

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
actual instructions and and referred to

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.240 
actual instructions and and referred to
him<00:05:35.450> as<00:05:35.510> a<00:05:35.630> triple<00:05:35.960> changer<00:05:36.169> but<00:05:37.100> that's

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
him as a triple changer but that's

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.690 
him as a triple changer but that's
shockwave<00:05:38.290> falling<00:05:39.290> Cybertron<00:05:39.800> some<00:05:40.040> hidden

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
shockwave falling Cybertron some hidden

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.000 
shockwave falling Cybertron some hidden
transformations<00:05:41.510> that<00:05:41.600> aren't<00:05:42.530> available<00:05:42.590> to

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
transformations that aren't available to

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.760 
transformations that aren't available to
