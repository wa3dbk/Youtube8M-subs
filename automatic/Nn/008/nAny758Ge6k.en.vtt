00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.880
 what is prima jacks 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.519
 and I have not been using it for a long time 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.280
 time and I really find an option 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.880
 excellent to be able to obtain 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.169
 Paid applications for free 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.449

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.410
 this will work in any 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.410
 iOS or Android device 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.710
 as I told you is a way to get 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.360
 free apps but more than that 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.000
 is what they are really going to get is 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.760

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.640
 once we start we will leave 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.040

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.320

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.510
 See it 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.420
 ready 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.450
 since I already had the premium already 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.700
 here on my ipad then I get it 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.160
 directly this screen as you can 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.060
 see here to the right it generates 530 and 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.840
 I have 536 codes 536 credits sorry 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.400
 which is like saying my balance now in the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.349
 time when you do this 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.150
 first time here in the tab 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.370
 sponsors are going to open a 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.590
 application that is going to have a key like 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.120
 those like the one seen here is the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.040
 first application that you should 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.650
 install to continue installing 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.080
 applications as you 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.480
 install an application the credits are 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.130
 they are going to add but how are you going 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.630
 be installed there will be a list of 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.630
 applications similar to this one 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.790
 as they are listed here they will be 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.440
 listed on the sponsors page only 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.210
 they tell us here zero credits 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.450
 let's say there's going to be an application in 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.340
 sponsors of 100 credits as what 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.720
 we come from this we take the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.820
 application let's imagine that we are in 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.000
 sponsors we do not get a screen 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.930
 exactly like this we are going to give 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.079
 okay 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.079
 and it will take us to our itunes store 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.630
 already in our store this is what 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.700
 he's going to ask us for this, I've already 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.520
 downloaded will ask us to 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.410
 We unload the application once 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.970
 that once we download the 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.670
 application what we have to do is 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.650
 go to the downloaded application imagine 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.650
 that the application you downloaded was this 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.910
 let's go to the application 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.120
 and what we have to do is one time 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.510
 that the application has loaded we have 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.520
 than to use it for 30 seconds once 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.360
 we have already used the application for 30 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.460
 seconds is re is immediately us 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.980
 will generate the credits already in our 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.200
 free page then my apps 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.960
 let's imagine that the 30 seconds passed and 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.820
 we have already used the application really 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.710
 what they have to do is leave it 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.750
 open nothing else if you do not want to use it 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.290
 there are problems there are applications that 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.970
 example the first screen is a 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.790
 Registration screen are applications 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.560
 I know you social media types that you 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.690
 they ask that you register that you put your mail 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.790
 that some of your facebook and so on do not have 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.190
 than doing it with the application being 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.980
 open let's say it is open by 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.300
 30 seconds enough once the 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.760
 application is open to you 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.820
 return the signature and pge 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.320
 go here they go back to sponsors or they do 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.300
 some car for any of the 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.490
 tabs to reload the page 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.370
 and immediately here you will see that they have 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.860
 added to your credits then the 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.420
 first time the first time they open 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.620
 this page 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.540
 they are going to have a good number of 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.520
 applications more or less are going to put together 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.529
 about 1,500 credits which is what I 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.929
 I put together an iphone that I recently acquired 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:54.399
 once they arrive let's say that you 

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:56.709
 They want a $ 10 card 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:58.269
 iTunes once they arrive here at 3 

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:00.129
 thousand credits that is what it costs a 

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:02.579
 itunes card you are going to be 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:02.579
 gifts 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.120
 and we can see that here we have some 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.790
 options 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.100
 nelson mandela red cross foundation 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.500
 We can make good donations to those who 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.050
 which I have always claimed are here 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.380
 $ 10 iTunes cards can 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.930
 reclaim Amazon cards etc. and 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.560
 this one is also very good 400 minutes 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.240
 to make calls from Skype to whom 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.940
 he likes facebook games to which 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.280
 there is credit for facebook and so on 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.010
 there are some some options that you 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.130
 You can quietly check if I 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.199
 I had here three thousand credits could give 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.690
 click here and what will come out here 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.820
 would not this screen be one that already 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.500
 Tell me if I want to exchange here what 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.620
 what comes out is that I have only tweets 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.040
 36 credits and I'm shortly 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.230
 I am going to show you 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.030
 this to see we go here 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.070
 Here he tells me the gifts that I have already 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.530
 claimed and I can see and have 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.590
 claimed one two three four five six 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.000
 seven eight I have claimed eight cards 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.640
 ten dollars totally 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.230
 free ie I received 80 dollars 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.780
 in credits for my itunes account 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.270
 to download music applications 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.620
 movies and so on what I want 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.800
 from the itunes store 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.600
 totally legal then let's say we're going 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.130
 to leave something exactly like this 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.460
 when I had the three thousand 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:30.040
 credits here all this and brings us to this 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.840
 screen here as we can see this is 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.640
 one of the codes that I already claimed like this is 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.180
 that is not going to serve me right now 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.100
 because it is a code already used 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.020
 once we have opened this 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.020
 screen with the three thousand credits already 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.569
 we go to the channel without and it's going to 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.179
 take immediately 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.969
 our app store or iTunes store 

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:52.419
 store 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:55.099
 as we see in the sea ​​a little in loading 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:58.779
 once it is loaded it will ask us 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.779
 that we enter our password 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.060
 As you can see here, well, I 'm not going to 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.350
 enter my password at this time 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.750
 once we enter the password 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.210
 we click here to the right we hit the 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.590
 right face to redeem and ready we have 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.940
 received on our 10 card 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.540
 dollars that we could use it for 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.730
 buy anything as you see the 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.220
 options here at itunes stores are 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:23.020
 really good I have more than 100 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.610
 dollars in store credit only 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.070
 using free mayas so they are 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:31.110
 I recommend any question do not hesitate 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.110
 in doing it and I will answer you thanks
