00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
very important in the canter and the

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
hold your horse up so it's the first way

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.190

that<00:00:34.000> you<00:00:34.090> can<00:00:34.240> ask<00:00:34.360> your<00:00:34.540> horse<00:00:34.630> to<00:00:34.840> slow<00:00:35.020> down

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
that you can ask your horse to slow down

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.230 
that you can ask your horse to slow down
or<00:00:35.590> lengthen<00:00:36.070> his<00:00:36.160> stride<00:00:36.430> let<00:00:36.910> your<00:00:37.030> seat

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 
or lengthen his stride let your seat

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.330 
or lengthen his stride let your seat
move<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:37.750> rock<00:00:37.900> with<00:00:38.110> him<00:00:38.290> or<00:00:38.470> let<00:00:39.070> it<00:00:39.100> wait

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
move and rock with him or let it wait

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.390 
move and rock with him or let it wait
and<00:00:39.610> when<00:00:40.600> you're<00:00:40.720> sitting<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.140> canter<00:00:41.530> the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
and when you're sitting the canter the

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.920 
and when you're sitting the canter the
proper<00:00:42.760> way<00:00:42.850> to<00:00:42.880> do<00:00:43.090> it<00:00:43.180> is<00:00:43.300> actually<00:00:43.450> to<00:00:43.690> let

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
proper way to do it is actually to let

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.470 
proper way to do it is actually to let
your<00:00:44.050> hips<00:00:44.230> almost<00:00:44.590> roll<00:00:45.010> with<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:45.610> canter<00:00:45.970> so

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
your hips almost roll with the canter so

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.210 
your hips almost roll with the canter so
we<00:00:46.600> talked<00:00:46.810> about<00:00:46.930> leads<00:00:47.380> in<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.890> canter

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
we talked about leads in the canter

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.950 
we talked about leads in the canter
video<00:00:48.520> so<00:00:49.030> you'll<00:00:49.150> remember<00:00:49.300> if<00:00:49.540> he's<00:00:49.720> on<00:00:49.870> the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
video so you'll remember if he's on the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.810 
video so you'll remember if he's on the
last<00:00:50.170> lead<00:00:50.440> this<00:00:50.920> leg<00:00:51.190> comes<00:00:51.400> out<00:00:51.520> farther

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
last lead this leg comes out farther

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.120 
last lead this leg comes out farther
forward<00:00:52.180> as<00:00:52.510> leading<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.500> thought<00:00:53.770> stride

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
forward as leading the thought stride

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.910 
forward as leading the thought stride
and<00:00:54.430> so<00:00:55.030> you<00:00:55.090> can<00:00:55.330> let<00:00:55.510> your<00:00:55.600> left<00:00:55.840> hip<00:00:56.200> lead

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
and so you can let your left hip lead

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.010 
and so you can let your left hip lead
that<00:00:57.250> rolling<00:00:57.700> along<00:00:58.030> with<00:00:58.240> that<00:00:58.390> front<00:00:58.660> left

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
that rolling along with that front left

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.440 
that rolling along with that front left
front<00:00:59.350> leg<00:00:59.800> so<00:01:00.280> in<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:00.520> canter<00:01:00.910> it's<00:01:01.090> almost<00:01:01.300> a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
front leg so in the canter it's almost a

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.079 
front leg so in the canter it's almost a
rocking<00:01:01.990> motion<00:01:02.020> like<00:01:02.590> this<00:01:02.880> rolling<00:01:03.880> with

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
rocking motion like this rolling with

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.810 
rocking motion like this rolling with
that<00:01:04.330> front<00:01:04.869> leg<00:01:05.130> and<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.280> can<00:01:06.430> feel<00:01:06.640> almost

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
that front leg and you can feel almost

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.520 
that front leg and you can feel almost
like<00:01:06.970> you're<00:01:07.240> scooping<00:01:07.570> into<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.049> saddle<00:01:08.229> and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
like you're scooping into the saddle and

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.230 
like you're scooping into the saddle and
that<00:01:08.619> will<00:01:08.770> help<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:09.189> stay<00:01:09.759> in<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.060> saddle

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
that will help you stay in the saddle

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.300 
that will help you stay in the saddle
which<00:01:10.810> will<00:01:10.960> also<00:01:11.080> give<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:11.439> a<00:01:11.500> better<00:01:12.010> sense

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
which will also give you a better sense

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.040 
which will also give you a better sense
of<00:01:12.460> control<00:01:12.730> because<00:01:13.000> you're<00:01:13.240> staying<00:01:13.390> put<00:01:13.600> a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
of control because you're staying put a

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.440 
of control because you're staying put a
lot<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.650> people<00:01:14.890> will<00:01:15.040> perch<00:01:15.340> in<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.760> canter

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
lot of people will perch in the canter

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.850 
lot of people will perch in the canter
which<00:01:17.200> is<00:01:17.350> not<00:01:17.620> correct<00:01:18.010> so<00:01:19.410> they'll<00:01:20.410> they'll

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
which is not correct so they'll they'll

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.170 
which is not correct so they'll they'll
sort<00:01:21.070> of<00:01:21.130> not<00:01:21.280> want<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.550> put<00:01:21.760> their<00:01:21.880> button<00:01:22.120> in

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
sort of not want to put their button in

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.670 
sort of not want to put their button in
the<00:01:22.270> saddle<00:01:22.570> because<00:01:22.780> there's<00:01:23.290> all<00:01:23.440> of<00:01:23.470> this

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
the saddle because there's all of this

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.560 
the saddle because there's all of this
rocking<00:01:24.220> motion<00:01:24.640> going<00:01:24.820> on<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.330> that's

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
rocking motion going on and that's

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.480 
rocking motion going on and that's
understandable<00:01:26.080> can<00:01:26.350> be<00:01:26.440> sort<00:01:26.620> of<00:01:26.680> rough<00:01:26.950> but

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
understandable can be sort of rough but

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.530 
understandable can be sort of rough but
it<00:01:27.580> means<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:27.940> can't<00:01:28.180> then<00:01:28.360> use<00:01:28.510> your

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
it means that you can't then use your

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.850 
it means that you can't then use your
seat<00:01:28.900> so<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:29.140> want<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.380> make<00:01:29.470> sure<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.710> your

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
seat so you want to make sure that your

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.770 
seat so you want to make sure that your
butt<00:01:30.040> is<00:01:30.190> firmly<00:01:30.490> in<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.880> saddle<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.390> that

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.200 
forget about your half holes so remember
that<00:01:41.380> your<00:01:41.620> household<00:01:42.070> comes<00:01:42.310> straight<00:01:42.880> up

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
that your household comes straight up

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.320 
that your household comes straight up
you're<00:01:44.170> pulling<00:01:44.470> straight<00:01:44.740> box<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:46.210> you're

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
you're pulling straight box so you're

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.850 
you're pulling straight box so you're
gonna<00:01:46.450> pull<00:01:46.630> straight<00:01:46.960> back<00:01:47.170> like<00:01:47.440> this

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
gonna pull straight back like this

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.070 
gonna pull straight back like this
anyway<00:01:48.430> slight<00:01:48.880> hassles<00:01:49.420> if<00:01:49.630> your<00:01:49.750> horse<00:01:49.870> is

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
anyway slight hassles if your horse is

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.680 
anyway slight hassles if your horse is
getting<00:01:50.290> too<00:01:50.409> quick<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:50.950> just<00:01:51.490> slow<00:01:51.820> down<00:01:52.090> slow

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
getting too quick so just slow down slow

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.310 
getting too quick so just slow down slow
down

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
down

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.930 
down
and<00:01:53.979> then<00:01:54.070> you<00:01:54.159> can<00:01:54.280> let<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.580> reins<00:01:54.760> go<00:01:54.909> a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
and then you can let the reins go a

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.310 
and then you can let the reins go a
little<00:01:55.180> bit<00:01:55.330> before<00:01:55.630> if<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:55.810> want<00:01:55.990> your<00:01:56.110> horse

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
little bit before if you want your horse

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.680 
little bit before if you want your horse
to<00:01:56.380> move<00:01:56.590> before<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.640> I'm<00:01:57.880> gonna<00:01:58.060> do<00:01:58.270> two

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
to move before so I'm gonna do two

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.050 
to move before so I'm gonna do two
exercises<00:01:58.900> which<00:01:59.710> are<00:01:59.830> very<00:02:00.070> helpful<00:02:00.310> for<00:02:00.549> you

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
exercises which are very helpful for you

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.520 
exercises which are very helpful for you
and<00:02:01.150> you'll<00:02:01.510> see<00:02:01.659> no<00:02:01.780> one<00:02:01.930> needs<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.170> practice

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
and you'll see no one needs to practice

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.520 
and you'll see no one needs to practice
with<00:02:02.680> them<00:02:02.860> too<00:02:03.130> both<00:02:03.820> of<00:02:04.000> us<00:02:04.090> do<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.380> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
with them too both of us do and the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.140 
with them too both of us do and the
first<00:02:05.680> one<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.340> be<00:02:06.460> trot<00:02:06.760> canter

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
first one is to be trot canter

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.630 
first one is to be trot canter
transitions<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:08.410> if<00:02:08.860> your<00:02:09.009> horse<00:02:09.220> gets<00:02:09.429> very

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
transitions so if your horse gets very

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.850 
transitions so if your horse gets very
quick<00:02:09.880> in<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.060> canter<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.660> good<00:02:11.110> way<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.319> work

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
quick in the canter a good way to work

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.410 
quick in the canter a good way to work
on<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.220> is<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.520> not<00:02:12.640> let<00:02:12.790> him<00:02:12.910> canter<00:02:13.270> for

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
on that is to not let him canter for

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.699 
on that is to not let him canter for
very<00:02:13.569> long<00:02:13.720> before<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.080> ask<00:02:14.260> them<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.500> trot

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
very long before you ask them to trot

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.440 
very long before you ask them to trot
again<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.459> this<00:02:15.580> way<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.819> work<00:02:16.120> on<00:02:16.270> just

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
again and this way you work on just

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.420 
again and this way you work on just
doing<00:02:16.600> short<00:02:17.020> controlled<00:02:17.410> periods<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:18.069> canter

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
doing short controlled periods of canter

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.699 
doing short controlled periods of canter
with<00:02:19.420> Noah<00:02:19.600> he<00:02:19.810> gets<00:02:19.930> very<00:02:20.020> excited<00:02:20.530> through

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
with Noah he gets very excited through

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.170 
with Noah he gets very excited through
canter<00:02:20.980> transitions<00:02:21.489> so<00:02:21.640> these<00:02:21.790> are<00:02:21.970> helpful

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
canter transitions so these are helpful

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.690 
canter transitions so these are helpful
to<00:02:22.300> keep<00:02:22.540> him<00:02:22.720> mellow<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.319> relaxed<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.100> other

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
to keep him mellow and relaxed the other

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.130 
to keep him mellow and relaxed the other
one<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:24.970> can<00:02:25.150> do<00:02:25.239> is<00:02:25.360> link<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.780> mean<00:02:25.930> and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
one you can do is link the mean and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.530 
one you can do is link the mean and
shortening<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.920> lengthening<00:02:27.360> means<00:02:28.360> that

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
shortening and lengthening means that

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.330 
shortening and lengthening means that
you<00:02:28.630> will<00:02:28.720> allow<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.170> stride<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.739> lengthen

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
you will allow the stride to lengthen

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.290 
you will allow the stride to lengthen
out<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.700> get<00:02:30.880> bigger

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
out and get bigger

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.210 
out and get bigger
whereas<00:02:31.930> been<00:02:32.170> shortening<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.770> ask<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
whereas been shortening you ask the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.830 
whereas been shortening you ask the
horse<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.489> collect<00:02:33.910> in<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.300> make<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.420> shorter

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
horse to collect in and make a shorter

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.960 
horse to collect in and make a shorter
stride<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.769> we<00:02:35.950> have<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.100> terrible<00:02:36.489> arena<00:02:36.760> today

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
stride so we have a terrible arena today

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.220 
stride so we have a terrible arena today
so<00:02:37.090> I'm<00:02:37.239> just<00:02:37.390> going<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.570> have<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.750> do<00:02:37.930> these<00:02:38.080> on

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
so I'm just going to have to do these on

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.870 
so I'm just going to have to do these on
the<00:02:38.320> 20<00:02:38.590> meter<00:02:38.709> circle<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.519> hopefully<00:02:39.790> you'll

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
the 20 meter circle and hopefully you'll

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.220 
the 20 meter circle and hopefully you'll
still<00:02:40.060> be<00:02:40.180> able<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.420> see<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.810> kinds<00:02:41.110> of

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
still be able to see the kinds of

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.979 
still be able to see the kinds of
exercises<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.220> I'm<00:02:42.340> demonstrating<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.360> even

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
exercises that I'm demonstrating so even

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.900 
exercises that I'm demonstrating so even
right<00:02:47.170> from<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.500> beginning<00:02:47.860> you'll<00:02:48.550> notice

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
right from the beginning you'll notice

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.970 
right from the beginning you'll notice
something<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.600> I<00:02:49.750> do<00:02:49.810> with<00:02:50.110> Noah<00:02:50.350> right<00:02:50.650> here

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
something that I do with Noah right here

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.500 
something that I do with Noah right here
when<00:02:51.160> he<00:02:51.280> gets<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.610> little<00:02:51.760> excited<00:02:51.940> in<00:02:52.420> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
when he gets a little excited in the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.690 
when he gets a little excited in the
truck<00:02:52.750> which<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.620> adding<00:02:53.950> even<00:02:54.220> smaller

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
truck which is I adding even smaller

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.420 
truck which is I adding even smaller
circle<00:02:55.239> inside<00:02:55.810> my<00:02:55.959> big<00:02:56.200> circle<00:02:56.560> don't<00:02:57.250> be

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
circle inside my big circle don't be

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.309 
circle inside my big circle don't be
afraid<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.880> use<00:02:57.910> small<00:02:58.420> circles<00:02:58.870> whenever<00:02:59.140> you

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
afraid to use small circles whenever you

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.570 
afraid to use small circles whenever you
feel<00:02:59.470> like<00:02:59.530> your<00:02:59.769> horse<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.130> getting<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.459> little

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
right here I just peel off the big

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.840 
right here I just peel off the big
circle<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.709> do<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:05.799> small<00:03:06.070> circle<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.519> get<00:03:06.700> him

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.750 
circle and do a small circle to get him
listening<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:07.450> paying<00:03:07.600> attention<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:08.170> my<00:03:08.380> 8

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
sit before I ask Noah so canter so I'll

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.710 
sit before I ask Noah so canter so I'll
sit<00:03:14.980> for<00:03:15.220> my<00:03:15.340> trot<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.209> will<00:03:16.360> ask<00:03:16.540> him

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
now Noah sort of leaped into that

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.500 
now Noah sort of leaped into that
transition<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.640> would<00:03:22.880> need<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.120> practice

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
transition so I would need to practice

little<00:03:25.400> bit<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.480> don't<00:03:26.690> let<00:03:26.780> him<00:03:26.960> canter

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650

transition you need his trot to have

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.420

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
transitions is not to lean forward as

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.660 
transitions is not to lean forward as
you<00:04:05.720> ask<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.200> cancer<00:04:06.530> this<00:04:07.010> is<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.250> common

you ask the cancer this is a common

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.460 
you ask the cancer this is a common
mistake<00:04:07.790> because<00:04:08.690> oftentimes<00:04:09.020> people<00:04:09.290> think

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
mistake because oftentimes people think

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.290 
mistake because oftentimes people think
well<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:10.040> horses<00:04:10.310> going<00:04:10.490> faster<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.120> lean

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
well the horses going faster you lean

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.090 
well the horses going faster you lean
forward<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.870> make<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.230> horse<00:04:12.410> go<00:04:12.500> faster<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.070> I

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
forward to make the horse go faster so I

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.160 
forward to make the horse go faster so I
want<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.460> lean<00:04:13.640> forward<00:04:13.820> when<00:04:14.690> I'm<00:04:14.810> doing<00:04:15.050> the
