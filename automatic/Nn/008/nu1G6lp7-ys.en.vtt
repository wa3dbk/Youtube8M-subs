in<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.810> video<00:00:01.140> I'm<00:00:01.500> going<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.920> demonstrate

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:02.600 
in this video I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.510 
in this video I'm going to demonstrate
first<00:00:03.600> prototype<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.500> project<00:00:05.100> I'm<00:00:05.220> working

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
first prototype of a project I'm working

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.760 
first prototype of a project I'm working
on<00:00:05.640> at<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.240> moment<00:00:06.270> it's<00:00:06.600> called<00:00:06.839> some<00:00:07.560> kind

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
on at the moment it's called some kind

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.820 
on at the moment it's called some kind
of<00:00:07.859> book<00:00:08.040> which<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.340> kind<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.670> arbitrary<00:00:09.450> but

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
of book which is kind of arbitrary but

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.490 
of book which is kind of arbitrary but
refers<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.070> project<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.610> did<00:00:11.960> inspired<00:00:12.960> by<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
refers to a project we did inspired by a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.550 
refers to a project we did inspired by a
Frida<00:00:14.070> drawing<00:00:14.880> systems<00:00:15.389> an<00:00:15.809> Austrian<00:00:16.230> artist

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
Frida drawing systems an Austrian artist

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.130 
Frida drawing systems an Austrian artist
and<00:00:17.090> she<00:00:18.090> made<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.420> project<00:00:18.960> where<00:00:19.109> she

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
and she made this project where she

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.300 
and she made this project where she
invited<00:00:19.619> people<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:21.560> create<00:00:22.560> prototypes<00:00:22.859> of

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
invited people to create prototypes of

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.420 
invited people to create prototypes of
new<00:00:23.820> kinds<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> books<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.039> kind<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
new kinds of books so this is kind of a

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.480 
new kinds of books so this is kind of a
prototype<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.000> new<00:00:27.029> kind<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.420> book<00:00:28.340> so<00:00:29.340> what

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
prototype of a new kind of book so what

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.680 
prototype of a new kind of book so what
is<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> book<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.500> book<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:32.399> lettuce<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:32.969> page<00:00:33.180> on

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
is the book a book is lettuce on page on

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.420 
is the book a book is lettuce on page on
pages<00:00:34.640> they<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.329> certain<00:00:36.480> layout<00:00:37.430> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
pages they are in a certain layout and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.790 
pages they are in a certain layout and
they're<00:00:38.969> usually<00:00:39.120> easy<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.750> read<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:39.960> there's

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
they're usually easy to read so there's

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.979 
they're usually easy to read so there's
a<00:00:40.890> well<00:00:41.520> proven<00:00:42.079> technology<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> say<00:00:44.989> and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
a well proven technology so to say and

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
a well proven technology so to say and
of<00:00:46.110> course<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.530> ebooks<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.370> what<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
of course there are ebooks and what is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.450 
of course there are ebooks and what is
an<00:00:48.149> e-book<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.899> my<00:00:49.110> opinion<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:50.250> course

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
an e-book in my opinion it's of course

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.160 
an e-book in my opinion it's of course
it's<00:00:50.610> electronic<00:00:51.120> because<00:00:51.270> that's<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:51.989> AE

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it's electronic because that's what AE

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.720 
it's electronic because that's what AE
stands<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:53.329> it's<00:00:54.410> portable<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.370> can

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
stands for it's portable so you can

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.760 
stands for it's portable so you can
carry<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.690> around<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.140> course<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.530> carry

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
carry it around of course you can carry

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.889 
carry it around of course you can carry
it<00:00:58.859> around<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.219> normal<00:00:59.520> book<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.820> well<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.210> in

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
it around the normal book as well but in

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.680 
it around the normal book as well but in
an<00:01:01.140> e-book<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.800> contain<00:01:02.550> hundreds<00:01:03.510> or

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
an e-book you can contain hundreds or

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.380 
an e-book you can contain hundreds or
thousands<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.350> books<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.850> it's<00:01:08.850> much<00:01:09.240> more

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
thousands of books and it's much more

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.899 
thousands of books and it's much more
flexible<00:01:09.810> than<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.990> normal<00:01:10.290> book<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:11.070> usually

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
flexible than a normal book but usually

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.100 
flexible than a normal book but usually
in<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.240> much<00:01:12.990> worse<00:01:13.580> layout<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.180> there's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
in a much worse layout and there's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.890 
in a much worse layout and there's
almost<00:01:16.290> no<00:01:16.650> interaction<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.400> there's<00:01:17.580> even

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
almost no interaction so there's even

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.300 
almost no interaction so there's even
sometimes<00:01:18.900> less<00:01:19.110> interaction<00:01:19.560> than<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> normal

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
sometimes less interaction than a normal

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.810 
sometimes less interaction than a normal
book<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:22.140> tear<00:01:22.890> pages<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
book you can I know tear pages out of a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.870 
book you can I know tear pages out of a
book<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.210> even<00:01:24.680> burn<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.130> usually<00:01:26.549> don't

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
book or even burn it you usually don't

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.340 
book or even burn it you usually don't
do<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.450> an<00:01:27.570> e-book<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:30.049> what<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.170> this

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
do that with an e-book so what is this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.880 
do that with an e-book so what is this
this<00:01:31.740> prototype<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:34.200> course<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.680> called

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
this prototype of course it's called

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.969 
this prototype of course it's called
some<00:01:35.130> kind<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.460> book<00:01:36.110> it's<00:01:37.110> also<00:01:37.439> electronic

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
some kind of book it's also electronic

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.600 
some kind of book it's also electronic
because<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.400> runs<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.450> iPad<00:01:40.610> it's

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
because it runs on this iPad it's

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.330 
because it runs on this iPad it's
interactive<00:01:42.500> much<00:01:43.500> more<00:01:43.799> than<00:01:44.509> common<00:01:45.509> ebook

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
interactive much more than common ebook

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.550 
interactive much more than common ebook
features<00:01:47.340> animation<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.329> text<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.439> be

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
features animation so text can can be

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.060 
features animation so text can can be
animated<00:01:50.270> it's<00:01:51.270> made<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.380> poetry<00:01:52.799> or

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
animated it's made for poetry or

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.789 
animated it's made for poetry or
concrete<00:01:54.060> poetry<00:01:54.770> less<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.009> for<00:01:56.310> prose<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
concrete poetry less so for prose and

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.690 
concrete poetry less so for prose and
this<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.860> what<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.040> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.310> show<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.670> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
this is what I'm going to show is a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.600 
this is what I'm going to show is a
really<00:02:00.420> early<00:02:00.570> prototype<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:02.100> has<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> lot

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
really early prototype so it has a lot

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.389 
really early prototype so it has a lot
of<00:02:02.640> flaws<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.540> lot<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.259> errors<00:02:04.560> mistakes<00:02:05.100> he<00:02:05.219> can

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
of flaws a lot of errors mistakes he can

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.910 
of flaws a lot of errors mistakes he can
even<00:02:05.520> crash<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.240> hope<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.960> don't<00:02:07.049> see<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.380> in

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
even crash I hope we don't see that in

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.309 
even crash I hope we don't see that in
this<00:02:08.129> video

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.670 

so<00:02:13.319> first<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.550> display<00:02:15.110> lay<00:02:16.110> out<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.380> text

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
so first it can display lay out the text

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.460 
so first it can display lay out the text
of<00:02:16.800> course<00:02:16.830> that's<00:02:17.730> nothing<00:02:18.110> too<00:02:19.110> exciting

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
of course that's nothing too exciting

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.840 
of course that's nothing too exciting
but<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.980> appearance<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> text<00:02:23.610> can

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
but the appearance of the text can

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.570 
but the appearance of the text can
change<00:02:24.540> random<00:02:25.110> can't<00:02:25.620> change<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.250> kind<00:02:26.520> of

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
change random can't change in a kind of

change random can't change in a kind of
random<00:02:26.880> way<00:02:27.030> or<00:02:27.240> can<00:02:27.390> be<00:02:27.740> programmed<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.830> do<00:02:29.040> so

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
random way or can be programmed to do so

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.580 
random way or can be programmed to do so
so<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.850> can<00:02:30.030> change<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.900> size<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.470> letters

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
so it can change the size of the letters

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
so it can change the size of the letters
for<00:02:31.860> example<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.640> very<00:02:32.940> small<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.660> big<00:02:33.870> you

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
for example to very small and big you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.479 
for example to very small and big you
can<00:02:35.610> change<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.970> color<00:02:40.160> but<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:41.370> also

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
can change the color but you can also

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.600 
can change the color but you can also
move<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> screen<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.620> amo<00:02:44.160> can<00:02:44.340> move<00:02:44.459> to

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
move on a screen so this amo can move to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:53.259 
move on a screen so this amo can move to
the<00:02:44.730> side<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.900> move<00:02:46.110> up<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.290> down<00:02:46.520> can<00:02:47.520> rotate

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.259 

but<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:55.110> properties<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.709> these<00:02:56.090> letters<00:02:57.090> or

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
but the properties of these letters or

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.110 
but the properties of these letters or
words<00:02:57.300> can<00:02:58.260> also<00:02:58.380> be<00:02:58.530> animated<00:02:59.040> for<00:02:59.820> example

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
words can also be animated for example

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.970 
words can also be animated for example
that's<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.330> transparency<00:03:01.050> that's<00:03:01.380> animated

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
that's the transparency that's animated

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.900 
that's the transparency that's animated
so<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.459> fades<00:03:02.700> out<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.239> or<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:05.519> character

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
so it fades out and in or the character

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.310 
so it fades out and in or the character
itself<00:03:06.150> can<00:03:06.390> be<00:03:06.510> animated<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.050> can<00:03:07.200> be

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
itself can be animated so it can be

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.790 
itself can be animated so it can be
changed<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.780> color<00:03:09.989> but<00:03:10.320> also<00:03:10.380> other

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
changed and the color but also other

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.640 
changed and the color but also other
properties<00:03:11.340> which<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.820> didn't<00:03:12.060> mention<00:03:12.530> can<00:03:13.530> be

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
properties which I didn't mention can be

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.620 
properties which I didn't mention can be
animated<00:03:14.040> quite<00:03:14.370> freely<00:03:14.580> like<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.150> movement

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
animated quite freely like the movement

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.710 
animated quite freely like the movement
on<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.930> screen<00:03:19.459> but<00:03:20.459> there's<00:03:20.640> more<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.970> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
on the screen but there's more to the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.020 
on the screen but there's more to the
letter<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.170> also<00:03:22.500> some<00:03:23.160> kind<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.430> physics

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
letter is also some kind of physics

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.750 
letter is also some kind of physics
simulation<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:25.560> there's<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.430> kind<00:03:26.700> of

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
simulation so there's a kind of

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.080 
simulation so there's a kind of
Newtonian<00:03:27.299> physics<00:03:27.720> involved

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
Newtonian physics involved

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.940 
Newtonian physics involved
that's<00:03:30.829> reflection<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.040> reaction<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.850> forces

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
that's reflection and reaction to forces

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.319 
that's reflection and reaction to forces
as<00:03:34.950> inertia<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.790> grifts<00:03:36.360> around<00:03:36.980> but<00:03:37.980> also

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
as inertia so it grifts around but also

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.410 
as inertia so it grifts around but also
acceleration<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.510> some<00:03:39.690> simulated<00:03:40.200> gravity

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.140 

and<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:46.200> course<00:03:46.410> it's<00:03:46.530> interactive<00:03:47.100> so<00:03:47.130> if<00:03:48.000> you

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
and of course it's interactive so if you

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.400 
and of course it's interactive so if you
touch<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:49.320> for<00:03:49.530> example<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:49.950> falls<00:03:50.160> down<00:03:50.280> or

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
touch this for example it falls down or

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.130 
touch this for example it falls down or
here<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:53.010> O<00:03:54.110> speeds<00:03:55.110> away<00:03:55.260> or<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:57.750> can<00:03:57.930> change

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
here the O speeds away or you can change

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.580 
here the O speeds away or you can change
the<00:03:58.260> color<00:03:58.470> or<00:03:59.010> even<00:03:59.810> to<00:04:00.810> some<00:04:01.019> things<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.500> the

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
the color or even to some things to the

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:17.120 
the color or even to some things to the
global<00:04:02.310> page<00:04:05.540> but<00:04:06.540> then<00:04:06.690> there's<00:04:06.900> also<00:04:15.979> can<00:04:16.979> he

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
global page but then there's also can he

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.940 
global page but then there's also can he
for<00:04:17.760> example<00:04:20.299> it's<00:04:21.299> that's<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> kind<00:04:22.109> of

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
for example it's that's the kind of

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.690 
for example it's that's the kind of
very<00:04:23.930> ready-made<00:04:24.930> poem<00:04:25.320> it's<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:26.190> start<00:04:26.520> of

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
very ready-made poem it's the start of

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.350 
very ready-made poem it's the start of
the<00:04:26.880> beginning<00:04:27.780> of<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.080> first<00:04:28.410> chromosome<00:04:29.360> as

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
the beginning of the first chromosome as

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.660 
the beginning of the first chromosome as
a<00:04:30.420> sound<00:04:30.780> poem<00:04:32.750> or<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:34.320> very<00:04:34.890> small<00:04:35.070> poem

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
a sound poem or this very small poem

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.050 
a sound poem or this very small poem
that's<00:04:35.850> called<00:04:36.570> presents<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:37.710> it's<00:04:38.000> kind<00:04:39.000> of

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
that's called presents so it's kind of

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.690 
that's called presents so it's kind of
infinite<00:04:39.360> poem<00:04:39.810> that<00:04:40.020> is<00:04:40.290> about<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.340> presence
