as<00:04:45.240> well<00:04:45.680> but<00:04:46.680> other<00:04:47.070> than<00:04:47.250> that<00:04:47.540> marketing

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
as well but other than that marketing

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.190 
as well but other than that marketing
was<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.550> guess<00:04:50.550> pushed<00:04:50.940> for<00:04:51.810> medal<00:04:52.020> of<00:04:52.050> honor

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.930 
was I guess pushed for medal of honor
warfighter<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.740> mean<00:04:52.920> you<00:04:53.100> saw<00:04:53.280> pollsters<00:04:53.760> use

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940

warfighter I mean you saw pollsters use
of<00:04:54.060> commercials<00:04:54.480> everywhere<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.500> the

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
of commercials everywhere so the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.950 
of commercials everywhere so the
marketing<00:04:56.100> department<00:04:56.730> did<00:04:56.940> its<00:04:57.120> job<00:04:57.240> but<00:04:57.780> the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
marketing department did its job but the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.290 
marketing department did its job but the

execution of the final product by EA and

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.700 
execution of the final product by EA and
