Hi everybody!    Hello!

00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:09.447
Today we're going to try making erasers

00:00:09.447 --> 00:00:11.629
in the microwave with this simple kit.

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:17.056
You can make Acorn Squirrel, Sweet Rabbit and Mint Bear!

00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:18.158
Let's see what's inside…

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:21.133
Uh oh, she ripped it…

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:22.323
Can I rip it open?

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:28.560
It's like that eraser kit we did before, but maybe with pencil caps now?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.098
Inside were three pencil caps, instructions, 

00:00:31.178 --> 00:00:36.015
molds and clay.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:43.672
This color is for Sweet Rabbit, this is for Mint Bear, and this is for Acorn Squirrel

00:00:43.672 --> 00:00:46.519
Alright! Let's make 'em!     Let's make 'em!

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.548
Oh my god!!!!!! What is all this?!

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.251
We have to make dark brown and light brown and stuff!

00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:59.448
For real?!

00:00:59.548 --> 00:01:02.956
We'll probably get hungry while making these

00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:04.478
This is really hard!!

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:14.261
I'm making Acorn Squirrel, Aki-chan is doing Sweet Rabbit

00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:17.102
and Mom is doing Mint Bear.

00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:19.541
It's too hard…

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:21.935
Don't give up!

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:28.220
I'm losing to Mom! I'm going to roll it on the table

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.027
What's white plus yellow?     Light yellow.

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:37.794
Blue plus white?    Light blue.

00:01:37.794 --> 00:01:41.030
How do you make black?    I dunno.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.956
Yellow plus blue is green!

00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:46.345
It's ready! Now we put the caps in.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.778
How much is 2 centimeters?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.895
Time to make the mold… Pressing down and squish!!!

00:01:57.015 --> 00:01:58.400
Ooo, that looks good!

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:12.660
Aki's turned out good

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:18.740
It's ready!
Show me…oh my god!!!

00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:31.450
Heating time!

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.720
３，２，１，０！

00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:40.510
Wow, it got harder!

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.560
He's Mean Bear!

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.200
The package says they're easy to make in the microwave,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.300
but they're not easy at all!

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.770
Please try making cute erasers like these!

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.871
Byebye, come watch us again!    See ya!

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:55.960
I'm gonna take mine to school!

00:02:56.263 --> 00:02:58.590
