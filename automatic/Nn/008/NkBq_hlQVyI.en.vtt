 even if it takes a little while I have 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.680
 This concern is the first 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.750
 You would do to show it to you. It's a 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.600
 piece that was very economical in the 1990s 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.810
 and returned there in the style of the 90s 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.850
 in other pieces that is the hooded sweater 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.310
 sweatshirt he comes all who stamped 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.140
 accompanies our channel and our 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.270
 social networks can imply that 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.310
 lately I've been using the sweatshirt there 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.470
 of the Sumerian front 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.450
 It's for you that's basic and if you 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.000
 It's a little more daring you can use there. 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.579
 with a sweatshirt that is fully embossed and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.180
 flashy is the tip if you're a little 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.070
 more daring 11 in the printed sweatshirt 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.649

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.899
 or want to start using Latvian start 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.319
 with frontal detachment and migrating there 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.299
 for something more daring do not limit yourself 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.709
 be only one thing is only the second 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.540
 piece that I've separated is also 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.209
 super versatility combines with a 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.959
 both more serious and more detached and 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.540
 casual 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.299
 depends on the combination is the blazer people 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.519
