00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.730
 hugo girls today we will talk 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 hairstyle so I was asked about 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.280
 youtube in comments or on 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.929
 my blog 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.120
 how did I do to have 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.250
 hair so stiff so that's right 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.100
 that as a rule we girls of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.320
 in colors or mixed or black we have 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 tendency to want to stiffen the hair 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.420
 all the time and we use a lot 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.039
 to proceed so today I'm going 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.260
 to talk to you about my hair routine 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.480
 so to begin what you need to know 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.130
 it's that I was born with curls 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.110
 therefore the two loops not right 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.210
 homeland are really big mouths 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.480
 and that I struggled all my life 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.190
 teen with straightener that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.440
 my hair becomes raid 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.450
 I stopped very very quickly 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.980
 hair straighteners because it started at my 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.420
 life but the hair I had the spikes 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.969
 who had become all white at last 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.199
 it was really hell and I got 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.940
 said that if I wanted straight hair 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.280
 I had to do something else 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.579
 method so the method that I adopt 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.760
 since now pretty much 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.510
 five years so since I was 20 years old is 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.659
 remained the same 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.070
 and in the end actually my hair has finished 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.479
 to reduce itself so that 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.610
 now when I'm doing my shampoo 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.409
 and that I come out of the shower I have the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.869
 hair that is already quite stiff 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.020
 so I'll explain my routine 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.119
 right now so already I'm doing my 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.039
 shampoo always always the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.930
 I never do it in the morning before 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.759
 to leave it always happens in the evening 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.530
 so I used a fructis shampoo 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.240
 or whatever 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.759
 honestly take any field 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.259
 point it's not really the 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.640
 shampoo in itself that is important 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.280
 that's the way you go 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.020
 shampoo hair so what he 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.530
 have to face it's not really necessary 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.630
 to avoid it is to rub his hair in 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.119
 that sense there because you're going to activate 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.819
 your curls what I'm doing is that 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.159
 I'm doing my shampoo backwards I 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.369
 take my nails and I rub everything 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.709
 gently ends up backwards 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.360
 and that's all good then I'm here 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.149
 do my shampoo like that I rinse my 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.890
 hair and once I'm out of 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.810
 the shower immediately that is to say that 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.000
 it's the first thing I do I 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.649
 keep my towel around me and I 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.349
 start right away right now 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.720
 immediately by paying my hair with 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.370
 a traditional loincloth back as 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.680
 a boy I put everything everything everything 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.970
 all the way back if you have bangs 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.700
 or an ex franches that you want 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.860
 hidden or put back and it's a little 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.890
 matter you put everything everything everything 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.920
 all back then second step 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.260
 so I use a cream for 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.110
 hair so it's this one hardly 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.420
 with ong sesame oil conditional 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.960
 so express for dry hair 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.360
 so it's a big blue pot that I 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.500
 bought in a type express store 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.040
 afro after it's a very oil 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.920
 very serious 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.209
 finally it's an oil a kind of gel to 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.640
 these grains that makes a little bit of oil 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.140
 on top so I put it really 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.820
 not much jean-mi true on my two 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.400
 fingers and I go everywhere in my 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.370
 hair by really really insisting 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.080
 really on the spikes and so that's it 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.420
 the hair all the way back the longer the 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.490
 cream in the hair I finish with me 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.800
 smooth hair so with this 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.470
 brush always always in 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.600
 back most importantly for 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.030
 that your hair would stay that's the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.670
 way you will also dry your 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.290
 hair so I do not use anything else 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.360
 to dry my hair that air 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.280
 natural where actually does that I 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.900
 do my shampoo in the evening what I 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.120
 do it is that I take all my 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.420
 hair that has already been back and 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.190
 I unlock with my clip so we turn 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.590
 we turn turning turning your 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.230
 hair and going back with the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.920
 clip it dries that's done so 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.840
 red way drags so it's like that 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.769
 that I do and I let them dry 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.260
 naturally between 1h and 1h30 it's 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.810
 everything I do absolutely nothing else 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.230
 for drying do not use do not use 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.299
 no hair or other because 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.510
 you simply reactivate your 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.110
 loops one should let them dry on the 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.049
 natural I really insist and with this 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:17.090
 kind of pass really pull pull your 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:19.250
 hair when wanted to go back then 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.959
 what I do is I use to 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.130
 finish drying them because they 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.570
 will stay after an hour and a half 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.350
 a little bit wet 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.120
 I put them on a flat iron then this 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.070
 which is very important is to have 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.160
 very very good plate so this is my 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.300
 are babyliss pro so in tikal 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.669
 titanium and gold is what you can in 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.310
 Managed the different temperatures 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.070
 so for when I had hair 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.840
 still quite curly I put them to 230 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.360
 so now I went below 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.280
 I liked it at around 200 and over your 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.380
 hair will be raid in fact and the more you 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.520
 can go down when 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.780
 you rpt tasks and your brush 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.240
 After an hour and a half you will see 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.430
 your hair is already all dreaming and it 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.100
 there will be more than just drying them with 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.200
 with the plates so as 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.620
 traditionally when using 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.229
 plates 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.610
 we start from behind and we go back 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.100
 gently so I start with 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.590
 steps like that and I go back for 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.669
 your bangs I advise you like this 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.620
 are the little hair in front and 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.650
 that they are fragile to get off your 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.389
 minimum plates so at 150 and from 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.590
 start so the propeller is everything 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:29.840
 just forward here so this is 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.060
 everything I do not do anything else what makes 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.210
 that in the end my hair ended up 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.639
 force down to joke pranks everything 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.169
 only after really invest in your 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.090
 plates because that's what he will do in 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.000
 it will give you flexibility 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.220
 in the end to your hair then 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.110
 so that's really a plus 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.770
 finally I do it but after that it's 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:54.349
 do not know what gave my hair this 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.260
 that I use is the little Marseille 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:59.840
 so it's one that eliminates donations 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.580
 this is an aspect that eliminates 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.490
 bad smells in the hair because 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.220
 that milk usually produces for 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.620
 black hair hair not feel 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.420
 very very good and with the plates in 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.820
 plus it really smell I find 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.490
 so ugly so I use the little 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.260
 Marseille who has a fresh taste that 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.940
 sees there flowers cotton flowers and 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.890
 almond trees so it's really all 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.740
 fresh there is no smell I vaporize 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.780
 my hair with is what I do 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.880
 because here I wagged them with 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.770
 bask I'm just using a joke 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.390
 it does not matter how important it is 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.820
 not put a lot of them because your 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.710
 hair will often be a little bit all 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.960
 sticky depending on the brand you are taking 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.690
 so normal fixation that I bought 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.940
 price leader so really a basic and 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:48.170
 it's over so that's all 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.610
 little routine that in the end we do not 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.840
 do not know much but nothing 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.360
 nothing but shampooing 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.340
 back and let them dry 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.370
 naturally is really locked in 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.680
 a pass is really pulled the ied did 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.510
 that in the end my hair stiffened 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.980
 all by itself which makes that if I do not pass 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.210
 not the hair straightener in my hair 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.000
 it's because I really hate it in 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.440
 the wet hair that I do it 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.530
 when you detach your pass your 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.100
 hair is already quite stiff and at the end 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.530
 Account 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.480
 by force and after a certain number 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.670
 still two months according to some 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.710
 girls because I know where according 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.630
 some years 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.510
 someone the hair ends up 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:28.210
 become turek so here is if you have 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.160
 other questions or need more than 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.440
