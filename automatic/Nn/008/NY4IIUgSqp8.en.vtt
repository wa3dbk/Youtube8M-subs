00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
we need to get like a nice little up

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.830 
we need to get like a nice little up
with<00:00:19.470> him<00:00:19.619> just<00:00:19.740> plain<00:00:19.980> hard<00:00:20.510> went<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.779> right

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
with him just plain hard went in right

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.480 
with him just plain hard went in right
way<00:00:22.080> playing<00:00:22.380> hard<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.769> stay<00:00:22.980> mentally<00:00:23.189> tough

way playing hard and stay mentally tough

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.439 
way playing hard and stay mentally tough
I<00:00:23.580> think<00:00:23.730> that's<00:00:23.850> what<00:00:23.939> we're<00:00:24.060> doing<00:00:24.090> that's

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
I think that's what we're doing that's

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.509 
I think that's what we're doing that's
what<00:00:24.990> coachman<00:00:25.439> focusing<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.189> know<00:00:26.220> he

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
what coachman focusing on you know he

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.450 
what coachman focusing on you know he
saw<00:00:26.869> just<00:00:27.869> plenary<00:00:28.170> possession<00:00:28.680> matters<00:00:29.039> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
saw just plenary possession matters and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.260 
saw just plenary possession matters and
and<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.510> seems<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.349> first<00:00:31.590> half<00:00:31.800> was<00:00:31.949> bad

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
and it seems like the first half was bad

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.410 
and it seems like the first half was bad
