hello<00:00:25.700> I'm<00:00:25.910> G<00:00:26.150> Nova<00:00:26.480> neck<00:00:26.660> I'm<00:00:26.869> here<00:00:27.050> with<00:00:27.200> hoof

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
hello I'm G Nova neck I'm here with hoof

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.010 
hello I'm G Nova neck I'm here with hoof
care<00:00:27.920> today<00:00:28.340> and<00:00:28.610> we're<00:00:28.760> gonna<00:00:28.820> revisit<00:00:29.180> and

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
care today and we're gonna revisit and

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.190 
care today and we're gonna revisit and
expand<00:00:30.439> a<00:00:30.590> little<00:00:30.710> on<00:00:31.010> the<00:00:31.279> leverage

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
expand a little on the leverage

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.970 
expand a little on the leverage
reduction<00:00:33.340> portion<00:00:34.340> of<00:00:34.489> our<00:00:34.730> video<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:36.080> I

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
reduction portion of our video and I

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.070 
reduction portion of our video and I
think<00:00:37.220> it's<00:00:37.340> important<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:38.000> go<00:00:38.450> back<00:00:38.720> and<00:00:38.960> take

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
think it's important to go back and take

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.869 
think it's important to go back and take
another<00:00:39.140> look<00:00:39.440> at<00:00:39.890> these<00:00:40.190> structures<00:00:40.730> that

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
another look at these structures that

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.610 
another look at these structures that
are<00:00:41.030> involved<00:00:41.510> in<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.750> horse's<00:00:42.140> foot<00:00:42.410> that

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
are involved in the horse's foot that

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.450 
are involved in the horse's foot that
are<00:00:42.770> being<00:00:42.980> affected<00:00:43.640> by<00:00:43.850> leverage<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:45.460> what

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
are being affected by leverage and what

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.160 
are being affected by leverage and what
I'm<00:00:46.580> going<00:00:46.760> to<00:00:46.820> explain<00:00:47.420> a<00:00:47.480> little<00:00:47.690> bit<00:00:47.930> about

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
I'm going to explain a little bit about

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.290 
I'm going to explain a little bit about
is<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:49.430> fact<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:50.059> foot<00:00:50.270> is

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
is the the fact that the foot is

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.080 
is the the fact that the foot is
designed<00:00:50.900> to<00:00:51.110> accept<00:00:51.440> a<00:00:51.590> lot<00:00:51.800> of<00:00:51.949> force<00:00:52.250> as

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
designed to accept a lot of force as

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.030 
designed to accept a lot of force as
long<00:00:53.330> as<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.600> horse<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:53.989> going<00:00:54.320> in<00:00:54.470> a<00:00:54.559> forward

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
long as the horse is going in a forward

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.600 
long as the horse is going in a forward
plane<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:55.850> if<00:00:56.750> you<00:00:56.900> look<00:00:57.080> at<00:00:57.229> the<00:00:57.440> joints<00:00:58.280> in

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
plane and if you look at the joints in

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.450 
plane and if you look at the joints in
the<00:00:58.909> lower<00:00:59.089> pasture<00:00:59.659> and<00:00:59.809> particularly

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
the lower pasture and particularly

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.310 
the lower pasture and particularly
you'll<00:01:01.460> see<00:01:01.699> that<00:01:01.909> they're<00:01:02.150> primarily<00:01:02.809> hinge

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
you'll see that they're primarily hinge

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.259 
you'll see that they're primarily hinge
joints<00:01:03.800> they're<00:01:03.949> designed<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.489> bend<00:01:04.790> one

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
joints they're designed to bend one

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.149 
joints they're designed to bend one
direction<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:05.810> coffin<00:01:06.229> joint<00:01:06.530> has<00:01:06.860> some

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
direction the coffin joint has some

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.100 
direction the coffin joint has some
lateral<00:01:07.610> capabilities<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.840> I'll<00:01:08.900> talk<00:01:09.080> about

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
lateral capabilities and I'll talk about

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.500 
lateral capabilities and I'll talk about
that<00:01:09.380> later<00:01:09.590> but<00:01:10.549> if<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:10.970> look<00:01:11.150> at<00:01:11.299> the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
that later but if you look at the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.340 
that later but if you look at the
attaching<00:01:12.500> tissue<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:13.280> connects<00:01:13.880> this

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
attaching tissue that connects this

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.960 
attaching tissue that connects this
coffin<00:01:15.350> joint<00:01:15.710> together<00:01:15.979> you'll<00:01:16.520> see<00:01:16.760> that

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
coffin joint together you'll see that

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.350 
coffin joint together you'll see that
these<00:01:17.210> structures<00:01:17.630> are<00:01:18.220> of<00:01:19.220> good<00:01:19.490> size<00:01:19.820> and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
these structures are of good size and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.920 
these structures are of good size and
mother<00:01:21.049> nature<00:01:21.500> built<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:22.130> into<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.930> into

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
mother nature built that into the into

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.110 
mother nature built that into the into
the<00:01:24.080> limb<00:01:24.320> just<00:01:24.650> because<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.400> stresses<00:01:25.909> are

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
the limb just because the stresses are

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.970 
the limb just because the stresses are
likely<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.840> be<00:01:26.990> greater<00:01:27.350> as<00:01:27.710> we<00:01:28.520> look<00:01:28.850> at<00:01:29.060> the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
likely to be greater as we look at the

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.010 
likely to be greater as we look at the
navicular<00:01:30.980> bone<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.820> deep<00:01:32.060> flexor<00:01:32.540> tendon

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
navicular bone that deep flexor tendon

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.700 
navicular bone that deep flexor tendon
and<00:01:34.000> some<00:01:35.000> of<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.360> ligaments<00:01:35.870> in<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.170> back<00:01:36.470> of

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
and some of the ligaments in the back of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.470 
and some of the ligaments in the back of
the<00:01:36.830> pasture<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.430> they<00:01:37.550> all<00:01:37.730> come<00:01:38.180> to

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
the pasture and they all come to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.780 
the pasture and they all come to
attention<00:01:38.990> at<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:40.040> time<00:01:40.280> of<00:01:40.490> break<00:01:40.760> over<00:01:41.210> that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
attention at the time of break over that

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.160 
attention at the time of break over that
actually<00:01:43.790> where's<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.420> front<00:01:44.630> of<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.960> foot

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
actually where's the front of the foot

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.020 
actually where's the front of the foot
out<00:01:45.230> and<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.680> foot<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:45.920> designed<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.730> wear

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
out and the foot is designed to wear

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.900 
out and the foot is designed to wear
back<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:47.690> certain<00:01:48.230> position<00:01:48.860> relative<00:01:49.550> to

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
back to a certain position relative to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.250 
back to a certain position relative to

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
the coffin bone in an optimal form so

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.650 
the coffin bone in an optimal form so
that<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.500> stress<00:01:55.010> to<00:01:55.340> these<00:01:55.540> ligaments<00:01:56.540> and

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
that the stress to these ligaments and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.390 
that the stress to these ligaments and
tendons<00:01:56.720> is<00:01:57.820> held<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:59.120> a<00:01:59.150> minimum<00:02:00.250> when<00:02:01.250> you

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
tendons is held to a minimum when you

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.670 
tendons is held to a minimum when you
increase<00:02:01.850> those<00:02:02.240> forces<00:02:02.690> you<00:02:03.050> increase<00:02:03.470> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
increase those forces you increase the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.390 
increase those forces you increase the
potential<00:02:04.310> for<00:02:04.520> harm<00:02:04.760> and<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:06.050> these<00:02:06.590> all<00:02:07.100> of

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
potential for harm and so these all of

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.790 
potential for harm and so these all of
these<00:02:07.520> structures<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.239> have<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.450> good<00:02:08.869> size

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
these structures that have a good size

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.880 
these structures that have a good size
to<00:02:10.280> them<00:02:10.519> are<00:02:11.209> designed<00:02:11.750> around<00:02:12.319> that<00:02:12.620> concept

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
to them are designed around that concept

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.500 
to them are designed around that concept
now<00:02:13.849> if<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.690> increase<00:02:14.989> that<00:02:15.650> leverage<00:02:16.480> by<00:02:17.480> a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
now if you increase that leverage by a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.690 
now if you increase that leverage by a
margin<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.709> let's<00:02:19.040> say<00:02:19.250> 3/4<00:02:19.940> of<00:02:19.970> an<00:02:20.239> inch

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
margin of let's say 3/4 of an inch

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.030 
margin of let's say 3/4 of an inch
the<00:02:21.270> science<00:02:21.720> that's<00:02:21.930> behind<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.710> shows

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the science that's behind this shows

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.270 
the science that's behind this shows
that<00:02:23.340> that's<00:02:24.110> increasing<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.440> stress<00:02:25.890> and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
that that's increasing the stress and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.390 
that that's increasing the stress and
the<00:02:26.400> strain<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:27.450> joint<00:02:28.020> at<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:29.010> point<00:02:29.250> of

the strain to that joint at the point of

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.780 
the strain to that joint at the point of
break<00:02:29.670> over<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.690> much<00:02:31.050> as<00:02:31.230> 30%<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.340> possibly

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
break over as much as 30% and possibly

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.120 
break over as much as 30% and possibly
more<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.930> thing<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:35.100> even<00:02:35.670> more

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130

the coffin joint the navicular bone

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.440 
the coffin joint the navicular bone
specifically<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.880> when<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.090> increase

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
specifically is that when you increase

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.330 
specifically is that when you increase
it<00:02:45.780> let's<00:02:46.080> say<00:02:46.260> an<00:02:46.410> inch<00:02:46.620> or<00:02:46.860> an<00:02:46.920> inch<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.220> a

half which is not uncommon this strain

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.420 
half which is not uncommon this strain
is<00:02:50.940> monumental<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.620> easy<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.070> see<00:02:53.250> how

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
is monumental it so it's easy to see how

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.970 
is monumental it so it's easy to see how

approach to looking at lameness we know

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.360 
approach to looking at lameness we know
that<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.820> soft<00:03:09.390> tissue<00:03:09.720> around<00:03:10.709> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
navicular bone is in harm's way

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.610 
navicular bone is in harm's way
strictly<00:03:14.370> because<00:03:14.520> of<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.000> extra<00:03:15.330> leverage

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620

strictly because of the extra leverage
that<00:03:16.620> being<00:03:17.010> said<00:03:17.430> we<00:03:17.910> now<00:03:18.090> find<00:03:18.690> our

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
that being said we now find our

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.090 
that being said we now find our
activities<00:03:20.490> our<00:03:20.790> disciplines<00:03:21.360> in<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.100> horses

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
activities our disciplines in the horses

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.390 
activities our disciplines in the horses
that<00:03:23.130> we<00:03:23.570> are<00:03:24.570> involved<00:03:25.110> with<00:03:25.170> today<00:03:25.709> do

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
that we are involved with today do

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.509 
that we are involved with today do
lateral<00:03:26.700> movements<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:28.530> we<00:03:28.830> have<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.160> consider

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
lateral movements so we have to consider

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.830 
lateral movements so we have to consider
the<00:03:29.940> structures<00:03:30.450> around<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:31.200> coffin<00:03:31.410> joint

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
the structures around the coffin joint

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.390 
the structures around the coffin joint
specifically<00:03:33.840> when<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.260> ask<00:03:34.470> horses<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.160> turn

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
specifically when you ask horses to turn

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.699 
specifically when you ask horses to turn
corners<00:03:35.760> because<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.510> joints<00:03:37.080> in<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.500> lower

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
corners because the joints in the lower

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.880 
corners because the joints in the lower
limb<00:03:38.010> are<00:03:38.790> not<00:03:39.239> designed<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.930> take<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.620> kind

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
limb are not designed to take the kind

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.190 
limb are not designed to take the kind
of<00:03:40.980> forces<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.580> we're<00:03:41.910> asking<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.630> horse<00:03:42.780> to

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
of forces that we're asking the horse to

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.270 
of forces that we're asking the horse to
do<00:03:43.860> this<00:03:44.459> day<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.910> age<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:46.500> when<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:46.980> take

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
do this day and age and so when you take

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.720 
do this day and age and so when you take
a<00:03:47.340> horse<00:03:47.670> that's<00:03:47.940> turning<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.720> corner<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.730> you

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
a horse that's turning a corner and you

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.970 
a horse that's turning a corner and you
look<00:03:50.940> at<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.239> forces<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:51.840> are<00:03:52.050> incurred<00:03:52.650> on

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
look at the forces that are incurred on

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.360 
look at the forces that are incurred on
the<00:03:53.489> joints<00:03:54.480> at<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.959> point<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.410> time<00:03:55.590> it's

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
the joints at that point in time it's

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.240 
the joints at that point in time it's
easy<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.880> see<00:03:57.120> then<00:03:57.420> how<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:58.230> lot<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.650> things

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
easy to see then how a lot of things

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.220 
easy to see then how a lot of things
like<00:03:59.489> collateral<00:04:00.090> ligament<00:04:00.540> lesions<00:04:01.019> and

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
like collateral ligament lesions and

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.090 
like collateral ligament lesions and
stuff<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:02.040> occur<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:04.200> think<00:04:04.650> it's<00:04:04.950> a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
stuff like that occur so I think it's a

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.570 
stuff like that occur so I think it's a
wise<00:04:05.390> approach<00:04:06.390> as<00:04:06.870> we've<00:04:07.200> taken<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.980> look<00:04:08.370> at

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
wise approach as we've taken to look at

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.410 
wise approach as we've taken to look at
the<00:04:09.239> things<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:09.989> are<00:04:10.820> being<00:04:11.820> challenged

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
the things that are being challenged

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.850 
the things that are being challenged
today<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.900> structures<00:04:13.350> that<00:04:13.380> are<00:04:13.680> being

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
today the structures that are being

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.420 
today the structures that are being
challenged<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:14.760> taken<00:04:15.630> effort<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.430> minimize

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
the barefoot and we see that the edges

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.700 
the barefoot and we see that the edges
are<00:04:56.120> worn<00:04:56.420> in<00:04:56.630> close<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.230> edge<00:04:57.350> of<00:04:57.560> the

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
shoes do that and I think in the future

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.050 
shoes do that and I think in the future
we're<00:06:18.410> going<00:06:18.500> to<00:06:18.590> see<00:06:18.800> more<00:06:19.100> of<00:06:19.160> that<00:06:19.700> type<00:06:20.030> of

cases of treating lameness that give us

looking deeper into the future of what

looking deeper into the future of what

always looked at the foot is needing to

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.060 
always looked at the foot is needing to
have<00:06:37.490> a<00:06:37.520> very<00:06:37.880> big<00:06:38.150> foot<00:06:38.450> with<00:06:39.050> we<00:06:39.500> now<00:06:39.740> know

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
have a very big foot with we now know

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.650 
have a very big foot with we now know
that<00:06:40.310> that's<00:06:40.550> not<00:06:40.790> a<00:06:40.850> good<00:06:41.090> ideas

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
that that's not a good ideas

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.330 
that that's not a good ideas
particularly<00:06:42.140> with<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:42.590> things<00:06:42.890> that<00:06:43.070> we<00:06:43.160> do

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
particularly with the things that we do

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.730 
particularly with the things that we do
with<00:06:43.490> our<00:06:43.640> horses<00:06:43.910> so<00:06:44.330> I<00:06:44.540> think<00:06:45.110> it's<00:06:45.380> hard<00:06:45.530> to

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
with our horses so I think it's hard to

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.680 
with our horses so I think it's hard to
know<00:06:45.920> exactly<00:06:45.950> where<00:06:46.730> we're<00:06:46.940> going<00:06:47.150> to<00:06:47.240> go

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
know exactly where we're going to go

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.540 
know exactly where we're going to go
I<00:06:47.720> think<00:06:47.990> thoroughbred<00:06:48.440> has<00:06:48.590> given<00:06:48.920> us<00:06:49.040> an

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
I think thoroughbred has given us an

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.990 
I think thoroughbred has given us an
insight<00:06:50.300> into<00:06:51.040> seeing<00:06:52.040> that<00:06:52.370> picture<00:06:52.610> more

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
insight into seeing that picture more

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.320 
insight into seeing that picture more
clearly<00:06:53.330> as<00:06:54.140> they've<00:06:54.620> provided<00:06:55.460> us<00:06:55.820> with<00:06:55.880> the

clearly as they've provided us with the

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.030

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
a ware plate into this shoe allows the

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.460 
a ware plate into this shoe allows the
foot<00:07:03.830> to<00:07:04.270> get<00:07:05.270> to<00:07:05.570> the<00:07:05.690> point<00:07:05.870> where<00:07:06.290> it's

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.470 
foot to get to the point where it's

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.740 
foot to get to the point where it's
really<00:07:06.800> helping<00:07:07.640> our<00:07:07.850> our<00:07:08.210> modern-day

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750 
really helping our our modern-day

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.340 
really helping our our modern-day
athletes<00:07:09.440> and<00:07:09.950> I<00:07:10.040> think<00:07:10.520> that<00:07:10.730> as<00:07:10.880> we<00:07:11.090> look<00:07:11.350> at

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.350 
athletes and I think that as we look at

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.070 
athletes and I think that as we look at
what's<00:07:12.730> what's<00:07:13.730> in<00:07:14.000> front<00:07:14.180> of<00:07:14.360> us<00:07:14.510> as<00:07:14.780> far<00:07:14.960> as

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 
what's what's in front of us as far as

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.990 
what's what's in front of us as far as
technology<00:07:15.470> is<00:07:15.860> concerned<00:07:16.010> I<00:07:16.580> think<00:07:16.610> it's

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 
technology is concerned I think it's

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.520 
technology is concerned I think it's
going<00:07:17.240> to<00:07:17.330> it's<00:07:17.750> going<00:07:17.810> to<00:07:17.960> be<00:07:18.020> a<00:07:18.110> smaller

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
going to it's going to be a smaller

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.610 
going to it's going to be a smaller
foundation<00:07:19.310> and<00:07:19.940> I<00:07:20.450> think<00:07:20.990> that's<00:07:21.230> going<00:07:21.530> to

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:21.620 
foundation and I think that's going to

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:38.750 
foundation and I think that's going to
benefit<00:07:21.980> the<00:07:22.130> horses<00:07:22.520> that<00:07:22.550> we<00:07:22.880> serve

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.820
