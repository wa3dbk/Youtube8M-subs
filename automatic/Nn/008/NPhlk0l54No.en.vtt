00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.410
 what is 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.280
 we all use it 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.740
 you need that to find something 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.249
 we work hard to earn the 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.129
 we save for retirement 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.009
 or if things go wrong 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.799
 we all trust money so why not how it works 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.839
 Therefore it sometimes or too often seems too much of that it cannot prosper 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.489
 seems ceaseless 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:26.819
 and where does all that money come from? 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.969
 and why sometimes suddenly there is no money anymore we suddenly have trouble for people 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.040
 to pay the bills 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.570
 where did all that money go 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.340
 The surprising fact is that most money is created by the market as one 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.510
 magician again the banks money out of the blue 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.740
 provide the new loans 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.750
 but this money is not what it seems 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.240
 this money is credit 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.510
 that one has to live temporarily from the bank 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.280
 we use it as money 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.030
 we believe that real money is also but because it is critical sometime in the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.800
 be repaid in the future 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.180
 and once it is repaid ajax disappears is no trick 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.240
 this is how further 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.270
 all our money is made and destroyed 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.460
 so how reliably ice tries money created by banks that we are so on 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.710
 trust what 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.350
 banks make their profit by calculating the interest on the borrowed amounts 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.420
 so as long as banks have faith in the economy the only one possible 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330
 money out 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.190
 more loans and mortgages 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.350
 means that more and more money is being created 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.439
 and before you know it in its current manner 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.800
 but if the banks provide too many loans 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.610
 the debt mountain is too high and people cannot pay it back 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.080
 and then the banks stop 9 and suddenly there is not enough money 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.730
 more 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.140
 the companies go bankrupt people lose why and houses are executed 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.260
 before 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.150
 this is the cause of the financial crisis 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.010
 and since then they still haven't changed money for still 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.909
 injured 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.520
 the baker and that still disappears more recently 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:12.070
 ratchet band to the brunt of others there can be no stable economic times 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.440
 healthy jobs or affordable houses but it doesn't have to stay that way 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.469
 our money for the campaign on how money is created 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.959
 the change and there we get dead
