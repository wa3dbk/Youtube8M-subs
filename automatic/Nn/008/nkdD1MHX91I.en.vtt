that<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.170> test<00:01:01.260> whether<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that to the test whether that is the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.230 
that to the test whether that is the
case<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.589> there<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.710> is

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
case and there it is

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:12.140

that's<00:01:06.240> pretty<00:01:06.479> fine<00:01:07.369> let's<00:01:08.369> go<00:01:11.000> thought<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
that's pretty fine let's go thought that

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.010 
that's pretty fine let's go thought that
was<00:01:12.210> nope<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:13.369> you<00:01:14.369> buddy<00:01:14.900> if<00:01:15.900> you

liking<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.240> fantastic

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
liking it I think it's a fantastic

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.070 
liking it I think it's a fantastic
addition<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> GTA<00:01:22.860> series<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.689> I<00:01:24.689> think

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
addition to the GTA series and I think

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.260
