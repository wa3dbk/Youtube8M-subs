00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
up and we want to make a straight line

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.230 
up and we want to make a straight line
right<00:01:03.719> at<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.989> corner<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> most

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
right at the corner and the most

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.670 
right at the corner and the most
important<00:01:06.750> thing<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:08.180> get<00:01:09.180> it

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
important thing is to get it

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.359 
important thing is to get it
consistently<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.340> straight<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:11.970> can

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
consistently and as straight as you can

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.999 
consistently and as straight as you can
along<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.549> edge<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> ceiling<00:01:15.830> so<00:01:16.830> we'll

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
along the edge of the ceiling so we'll

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.770 
along the edge of the ceiling so we'll
just<00:01:17.040> do<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> short<00:01:17.700> section<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
just do a short section just to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.670 
just do a short section just to
demonstrate<00:01:19.939> now<00:01:21.259> it<00:01:22.259> doesn't<00:01:22.590> all

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
demonstrate now it doesn't all

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.410 
demonstrate now it doesn't all
necessarily<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> way<00:01:24.270> up

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
necessarily have to be all the way up

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.760 
necessarily have to be all the way up
into<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> corner<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.290> has<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.650> be

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
into the corner just has to be

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.429 
into the corner just has to be
consistently<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.759> same<00:01:27.119> distance<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
consistently that same distance so that

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.249 
consistently that same distance so that
as<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.590> paintin<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.250> paint<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.960> will<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
as we paintin that paint this will get a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.140 
as we paintin that paint this will get a
nice<00:01:31.560> consistent<00:01:32.340> line<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.939> way<00:01:33.060> around

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
nice consistent line all the way around

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.270 
nice consistent line all the way around
the<00:01:36.150> next<00:01:36.450> thing<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.930> do<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.500> you're<00:01:37.890> painting

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the next thing to do as you're painting

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.580 
the next thing to do as you're painting
your<00:01:38.310> ceiling<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.990> make<00:01:40.140> sure<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.470> you

have the right tools and what we will do
is<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:46.670> we<00:01:47.670> will<00:01:47.790> come<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.180> first<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.490> using

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
is that we will come in first and using

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.120 
is that we will come in first and using
our<00:01:50.579> ceiling<00:01:51.060> paint<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:52.079> will<00:01:52.290> actually<00:01:52.500> trim

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
our ceiling paint we will actually trim

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.499 
our ceiling paint we will actually trim
or<00:01:53.549> cut<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.320> want<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.710> about<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
least a couple of inches from your

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.459 
least a couple of inches from your
corner<00:02:00.509> that's<00:02:00.719> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.079> doing<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.409> a
