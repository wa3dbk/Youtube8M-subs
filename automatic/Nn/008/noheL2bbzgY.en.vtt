00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
graceful of a yeah Engineering's but I

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.460 
graceful of a yeah Engineering's but I
mean<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.519> really<00:02:42.090> love<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.420> feet<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:45.440> love<00:02:46.440> a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.979 
mean I really love the feet I love a
little<00:02:46.590> mechanism<00:02:46.859> there<00:02:47.340> if<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.579> can<00:02:47.639> see<00:02:47.730> it

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
little mechanism there if you can see it

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.330 
little mechanism there if you can see it
it's<00:02:48.989> basically<00:02:49.109> a<00:02:49.350> hinge<00:02:49.620> for<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.130> metal

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
it's basically a hinge for the metal

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.120 
it's basically a hinge for the metal
piece<00:02:50.989> rolls<00:02:51.989> back<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.380> forth<00:02:52.650> i<00:02:52.829> love<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
piece rolls back and forth i love the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.090 
piece rolls back and forth i love the
fact<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.670> tank<00:02:53.940> treads<00:02:54.380> actually<00:02:55.380> move

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.730 

so<00:02:58.700> that's<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.210> plus<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.720> lot<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.350> playability

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
so that's a plus a lot of playability

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.800 
so that's a plus a lot of playability
here<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:02.240> for<00:03:02.690> mmm<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.620> think<00:03:04.580> it's<00:03:05.210> kind<00:03:05.600> of<00:03:05.690> a

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
here and for mmm I think it's kind of a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.960 
here and for mmm I think it's kind of a
problem<00:03:06.050> with<00:03:08.410> being<00:03:09.410> gosh<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.610> combiner

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
problem with being gosh the combiner

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.580
