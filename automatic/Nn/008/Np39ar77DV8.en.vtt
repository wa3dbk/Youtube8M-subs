00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.560

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.070

 you do not have this you can be with shadow 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.100
 I can do it 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.710
 with a pencil 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:35.470

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.329
 reconcile that of dark circles because many 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.690
 Sometimes we make the very serious error of 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:20.440
 be wide so development not on the blog 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.039
 we are going to see him bring it here as in 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.039

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.250

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.250

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.200
 correct to apply the mascara girls and 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.640

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.640

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.069
 joint 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:05:00.110
 starts them in the middle towards 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.050

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.800
 let it be one 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.800
 fan 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.680
 there is a trick that exposes them to dust 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.680
 It's dust 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.849
 the train 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.569
 the great message 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:27.830
 apply powder 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.830

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:54.500
 for that you can use the little tip 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.260

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:05.600

 If you feel that you are staining a 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.800
 little bit and they do not love it very much 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.789
 Take a brush and grab your powder and with 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.789
