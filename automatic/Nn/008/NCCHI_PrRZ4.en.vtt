00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
gonna get to see that so yeah this whole

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.280

thing<00:06:59.370> they<00:06:59.490> put<00:06:59.640> together<00:06:59.760> I<00:07:00.300> have<00:07:00.960> to<00:07:01.080> say<00:07:01.230> is

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
thing they put together I have to say is

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.570 
thing they put together I have to say is
probably<00:07:01.560> the<00:07:01.740> coolest<00:07:01.860> things<00:07:02.190> i<00:07:02.370> would<00:07:02.430> have

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
probably the coolest things i would have

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.640 
probably the coolest things i would have
never<00:07:02.790> liked<00:07:03.420> experience<00:07:03.960> or<00:07:04.080> put<00:07:04.200> myself<00:07:04.350> in

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
never liked experience or put myself in

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.870 
never liked experience or put myself in
that<00:07:04.710> situation<00:07:04.800> where<00:07:05.460> i<00:07:05.490> would<00:07:05.610> have<00:07:05.700> done

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
that situation where i would have done

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.670 
that situation where i would have done
this<00:07:06.030> and<00:07:06.300> so<00:07:06.780> this<00:07:06.960> is<00:07:07.080> like<00:07:07.170> a<00:07:07.230> one-time

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
this and so this is like a one-time

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.990 
this and so this is like a one-time
chance<00:07:07.920> where<00:07:08.130> i<00:07:08.160> got<00:07:08.310> a<00:07:08.370> chance<00:07:08.640> to<00:07:08.790> do<00:07:08.880> that

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
chance where i got a chance to do that

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.520 
chance where i got a chance to do that
and<00:07:09.150> I'm<00:07:09.270> really<00:07:09.480> appreciative<00:07:09.870> of<00:07:10.170> it<00:07:10.320> I'm

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530
