considerably<00:01:55.250> more<00:01:56.659> repellent<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.960> absorbing

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
considerably more repellent to absorbing

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.850 
considerably more repellent to absorbing
moisture<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.670> keeps<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.119> down<00:02:00.780> drier<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.590> I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
moisture it keeps the down drier and I

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.730 
moisture it keeps the down drier and I
think<00:02:02.040> they<00:02:02.130> call<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.430> ultra<00:02:02.579> dry<00:02:03.210> down<00:02:03.740> it

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
think they call it ultra dry down it

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.179 
think they call it ultra dry down it
works

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
works

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.580 
works
it's<00:02:05.369> keeps<00:02:06.240> if<00:02:06.420> you've<00:02:06.570> ever<00:02:06.719> had<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.899> clumpy

lightweight here's what they do they

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.750 
lightweight here's what they do they
will<00:03:34.069> either<00:03:34.220> make<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:35.410> nylon<00:03:36.410> shell<00:03:36.760> thinner

do whatever you need to do there now the

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.240 
do whatever you need to do there now the
weight<00:05:59.960> of<00:06:00.110> this<00:06:00.169> bag<00:06:00.409> and<00:06:00.770> don't<00:06:00.949> quote<00:06:01.099> me

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.649 
weight of this bag and don't quote me
because<00:06:01.520> I'm<00:06:01.669> pulling<00:06:02.089> this<00:06:02.180> out<00:06:02.330> of<00:06:02.479> the<00:06:02.539> top

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
because I'm pulling this out of the top

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.930 
because I'm pulling this out of the top
of<00:06:02.779> my<00:06:02.870> head<00:06:03.020> here<00:06:03.259> I<00:06:03.440> think<00:06:04.159> it's<00:06:04.279> it's<00:06:04.639> a<00:06:04.729> hair

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
of my head here I think it's it's a hair

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.439 
of my head here I think it's it's a hair
over<00:06:05.210> a<00:06:05.240> kilogram<00:06:05.659> something<00:06:05.960> like<00:06:06.580> 1035<00:06:07.580> or

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
over a kilogram something like 1035 or

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.610 
over a kilogram something like 1035 or
so<00:06:09.550> grams<00:06:10.550> a<00:06:10.900> little<00:06:11.900> bit<00:06:11.990> over<00:06:12.199> a<00:06:12.229> kilogram

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
so grams a little bit over a kilogram

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.469 
so grams a little bit over a kilogram
and<00:06:12.979> I<00:06:13.129> believe<00:06:13.490> it<00:06:13.849> takes<00:06:14.060> you<00:06:14.150> down<00:06:14.240> to<00:06:14.300> about

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
and I believe it takes you down to about

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.980 
and I believe it takes you down to about
minus<00:06:14.539> seven<00:06:15.289> something<00:06:15.589> like<00:06:15.710> that

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
minus seven something like that

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.300 
minus seven something like that
so<00:06:17.990> it's<00:06:18.139> a<00:06:18.199> very<00:06:18.349> light<00:06:18.560> weight<00:06:18.589> bag<00:06:18.979> it's<00:06:19.250> a

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
so it's a very light weight bag it's a

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.680 
so it's a very light weight bag it's a
very<00:06:19.490> efficient<00:06:19.940> bag<00:06:20.120> it's<00:06:20.449> a<00:06:20.509> very

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
very efficient bag it's a very

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.689 
very efficient bag it's a very
comfortable<00:06:20.930> bag<00:06:21.409> it<00:06:21.860> does<00:06:22.039> come<00:06:22.250> with<00:06:22.279> its

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699
