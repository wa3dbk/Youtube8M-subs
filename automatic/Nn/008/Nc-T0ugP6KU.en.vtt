00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
similar to harvesting but what makes our

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.769 
similar to harvesting but what makes our
part<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.580> different<00:00:20.939> from<00:00:21.060> everybody<00:00:21.330> else's

now<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.440> some<00:00:52.739> people<00:00:52.769> use

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
now I know that some people use

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.200 
now I know that some people use
construction<00:00:53.640> some<00:00:54.089> people<00:00:54.390> actually<00:00:54.480> use

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
construction some people actually use

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.310 
construction some people actually use
powdered<00:00:57.210> sugar<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.839> that<00:00:58.170> would<00:00:58.289> be

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
powdered sugar that that would be

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.799 
powdered sugar that that would be
totally<00:00:58.710> preference<00:00:59.539> there<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.659> no

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
totally preference there is no

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
totally preference there is no
difference<00:01:01.229> what<00:01:01.500> you'll<00:01:01.680> find<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.159> if<00:01:02.969> you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
difference what you'll find is if you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.520 
difference what you'll find is if you
use<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.269> little<00:01:03.539> bit<00:01:03.629> too<00:01:03.780> much<00:01:03.870> corn<00:01:04.170> starch

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
use a little bit too much corn starch

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.190 
use a little bit too much corn starch
it'll<00:01:05.309> dry<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> product<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
it'll dry the product of it just a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.230 
it'll dry the product of it just a
little<00:01:07.229> bit<00:01:07.619> quicker<00:01:07.890> than<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.340> would<00:01:08.520> there's

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
little bit quicker than it would there's

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.810 
little bit quicker than it would there's
a<00:01:09.330> powdered<00:01:09.690> sugar<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.039> you<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.490> can

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
a powdered sugar so as you as you can

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.690 
a powdered sugar so as you as you can
see<00:01:12.030> were<00:01:12.210> needing<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> product<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.640> that

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
see were needing the product and that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.969 
see were needing the product and that
basically<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.570> activates<00:01:16.440> all<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.770> comes

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
basically just activates all that comes

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.510 
basically just activates all that comes
in<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> project<00:01:17.789> and<00:01:17.940> makes<00:01:18.180> pilot<00:01:19.340> view<00:01:20.340> is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
in the project and makes pilot view is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.219 
in the project and makes pilot view is
what<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> want<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.539> is<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.720> want<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.020> take

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
your time and put a few minutes into the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.580 
your time and put a few minutes into the
media<00:01:26.300> once<00:01:27.300> you've<00:01:27.479> activated<00:01:27.840> those<00:01:28.229> guns

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
media once you've activated those guns

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.249 
media once you've activated those guns
it<00:01:28.860> makes<00:01:29.069> it<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.280> lot<00:01:29.399> easier<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:30.240> roll<00:01:30.720> out<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
it makes it a lot easier to roll out and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.340 
it makes it a lot easier to roll out and
and<00:01:32.030> becomes<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.119> little<00:01:33.270> more<00:01:33.420> pliable<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and becomes a little more pliable and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.190 
and becomes a little more pliable and
stretching<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:36.450> line<00:01:36.600> looks<00:01:36.810> pretty<00:01:37.020> good

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
stretching on the line looks pretty good

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.120 
stretching on the line looks pretty good
that's<00:01:37.679> what<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:37.950> want<00:01:38.509> do<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.810> here
