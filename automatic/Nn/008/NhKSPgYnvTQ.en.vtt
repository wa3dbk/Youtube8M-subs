00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.350
 in the afternoon we made the pressure of noon then we know that not all 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.070
 they are in that same position but what they are in that position without a doubt 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.149
 per cent we can only condemn 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:11.569
 that situation that reject it 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.379
 and ask the authorities to take the measures 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.970
 We also condemn that another journalist has been assaulted 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.680
 over the past few days we condemn that he has adhered to nicolás de 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.069
 Navarre riverside of her 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:27.049
 We condemn that there are new defendants who have beaten other journalists 

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:29.009
 channel 4 television 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.050
 and so we also condemn all acts of violence against in the press 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.620
 national and the international press and as we mentioned the unemployment also 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.420
 we are against the rights of citizens who are not 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.670
 directly involved in this situation are violated by 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.810
 we are effectively retreating for grace always more 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.440
 If each of the criteria 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.420
 main actors 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.230
 claim in this way ccoo defends its right in this way its consumption its 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.900
 vote in this way there would be no side 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.900
 I think we entered had several experiences 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.160
 match you want 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.380
 kikín according to him any case the Sandinista front has said we have said 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.650
 we recognized 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.270
 in our defeat in 90 96 in 2001 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.910
 we notice this way but maybe not with the elections but it has acted 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.180
 it detects how they come to vote vocations 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.830
 then the when sgs maybe in it 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.110
 is done situations like this have arisen 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.910
 for transportation 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.060
 for another series of 20 events 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.050
 that what is counted 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.780
 in solving on a table 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 and this is what it is I think political leaders 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.570
 is the responsibility in which all this was possible on the one hand 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.550
 in itself a 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.850
 some statements where sent 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.800
 can be left stone on stone in this country and on the other hand also that 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.820
 the demonstrations continue 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.690
 i invented this type of tea 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.930
 of situations of one and another side time is going to arrive 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.850
 an understanding 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.640
 of tolerance for a country that has suffered so much 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.729
 of natural disasters 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.969
 of physical violence due to situations such as these, an area 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:14.629
 yes I saw 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.629
 I hit 79-80 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.189
 well, it's very difficult 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.199

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:51.119
 the Sandinista front 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.119
 we have 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.029
 they wanted info 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:14.319
 closing 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.219
 and gagging in the light 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.169
 broadcast media

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:22.889
 account of what is going to happen 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.189
 that's what I wanted there to be hours 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.139
 because Mr. Daniel Ortega 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.409
 does not face 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.979
 in should face 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:33.209
 and for the people but it seems that to them 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.209
 how is a government 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.079
 instead of a form of payment 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:46.419
 acting well 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.909
 then they have like 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.229
 cover with a smoke screen 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.539
 as a vandalism 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.419
 the inefficiency 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.159
 the government pipe 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.159
 the same 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.149
 roberto rivas 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:07.069
 kerviel according to apple 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.359
 who really have dignity 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.609
 who signs person who has principles 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.309
 should be 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:15.059
 a popular restaurant 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:16.889
 three of the four magistrates 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.889
 sandrita 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.659
 because it has no moral quality 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.559
 for Navarre, noting that to that effect 

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:28.710
 with sweat one for 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.729
 to feed 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.529
 let's destroy 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.020

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.479
 the south of alicante 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.979
 because I am gay 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.499
 but for his work 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:01.499
 Rodríguez Cubero participated in the march 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:05.400

 I do not want to tell you that we do not get out of here 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.360
 we do not have to do 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.360
 we basically 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.729
 we left 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.180
 I politician would pay the same commitment to speak 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.180
 in that line we are saying to the government 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:39.990
 goal play 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.990
 and if you have to reach old age, get ahead 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.360
 the violence that would be great 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.210
 without repressing taxes the media 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.119
 ii 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:59.229

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.479
 you have to wake up because no government 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.809
 that we were not afraid 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:07.300
 always the same 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.770
