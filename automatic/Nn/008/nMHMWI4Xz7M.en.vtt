00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.080
 This morning we will take to cook 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.170
 or great that if there is not much 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.339
 perfect 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.789
 Onions I do not think I can trade very much 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.789
 all day 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.880
 I would cry and not only for the eyes 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.599
 tomato read 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.440
 yesterday's food that is already wrong that no 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.090
 are 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.079
 Butter jams and nothing is very 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.350
 edible 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.159
 but I think that over there we do not have 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.159
 those people 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.090
 then 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.800
 with an egg 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.910
 with chile 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.910
 we crap 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.490
 good as you will see and examined at dinner 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.960
 There are many things in the fridge and some of 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.210
 the things that were there already had 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.330
 taken out and I got up with souls and I'm going to 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.210
 cook this great variety but we will see 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.280
 that occurs to me and I already have an idea 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.800
 sketch not how I'm designed everything 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.650
 handled with with sketches and I do ct the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.020
 food now and well anyway let's 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.880
 start ok as I know you are going to see 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.409
 this video I'm going to moderate the language of 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.149
 trailer 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.080
 then in the refrigerator what 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.450
 I found they were nopales 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.310
 also green tomatoes of those with the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.230
 that you made your sauce and it was all 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.820
 bitter not because he does not have 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.130
 feeling that I have clear 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.020
 I found them also in the pantry something 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.940
 of amaranth and oatmeal and with this amaranth 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.120
 and the oatmeal I'm going to make I'm going to change 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.000
 this potato pancakes 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.710
 with egg and I'm going to make pancakes 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.650
 oatmeal with potatoes not to see how they are 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.510
 and fry the first practices and then 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.370
 so that it increases its cooking and is more 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.930
 fast and the potatoes cry and come back with 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.730
 a mashed potatoes 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.630
 so is the egg also with this I'm going to 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.759
 mop 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.110
 and well I was recently the greengrocer and 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.360
 where I told you it 's the central 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.430
 supplies so it's called that it's like a guy 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.590
 of has is huge 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.659
 and they told me that they park chayotes to 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.840
 I get a pumpkin but then the 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.950
 guy this one told me that remotely they were 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.950
 chayote if I believe you we will want 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.750
 I will explain the nopales so that 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.190
 also boil fast and be easy 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.770
 eating too I will not put 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.540
 pallets there in the green sauce 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.120
 also previously I had in the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.530
 freezer there is some chicken already here 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.319
 is it so 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.930
 in my super express that I do not know how to use or 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.319
 even pocito is quite annoying 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.599
 hot we had already 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.400
 I did not know and the little steamer flew 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.709
 when the whole spine was coming out 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.420
 when all the steam and I'm going to prizes 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.720
 and I even got scared because that did not 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.000
 It gave weird 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.650
 the beans are already raining 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.270
 and I hope they remain after making a 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.270
 tutorial of how the gijoneses are made 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.069
 but do not tell him 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.780
 but we are living 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.780
 I will see much where 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.520
 Well, I'm going to explain to you how I'm going to get 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.690
 my parents if you have a great technique 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.680
 Now that I have one, you can not live 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.569
 spicy 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.569
 built up I just do this 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.040
 stroke we mark here what is a vector 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.629
 they nopales 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.629
 and well this is this 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.319
 and we get 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.319
 a heart 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.439
 well at last they will apply it 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.290
 that is, with the normals 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.569
 I have left 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.569
 is this kitchen today 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.860
 and good to say goodbye with this figure a 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.860
 I kiss a kiss and parsley 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.940
 Well, I have here what are the 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.699
 by fans and you're done 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.080
 they saw they look pretty nice and what 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.660
 what I'm going to do is that then add 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.030
 Pepper 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.440
 and a little salt travel 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.440
 well here move away a little 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.520
 we have the eggs 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.650
 We have them here to start changing 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.559
 this band I hope they remain 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.860
 experiments and do not remain as per 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:06.860
 vote 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.880
 Well what I'm going to do is crush the 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.210
 potatoes 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.020
 and here I have an elector brand tv and here 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.500
 what we need apart from 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.090
 this 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.640
 of knowing how to cook is that we need 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.100
 effort also because there are some that 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.900
 they are more sophisticated and books have 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.110
 up to some markers with the tick 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.249
 one who is poor because he needs 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.409
 I need one of these not 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:39.399
 but poor thing does not stop me from being the 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.399
 leisure ingenuity 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.659
 good well crushed 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.319
 because these potatoes are going to serve for 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.319
 Pancakes 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.869
 mixed medium 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.960
 let's do all this relaxation of the 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:13.789
 tortillas 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.509
 and I'm going to learn the oil so that 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.509
 go to the state 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.630
 and this we are going to start doing the 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.540
 tortillas we put a piece 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.350
 we're going to give you a pancake shape 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.090
 balls or something like 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.090
 a chubby rice 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.610
 it's fine so it's already boiling 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.610
 Seeing the answer 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.209
 I do not remember if you have to put the flour 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.369
 but it's going to be the first attempt and 

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:50.809
 let's hope it stays but first you 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.809
 put flour after this one 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.530
 Be well filled with egg 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.500
 and the oatmeal 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:10.129
 I have seen but it is lever 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.160
 when I eat the pancakes as they are 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:14.780
 stranger they look like that but not cooked 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.529
 I like how 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:21.499
 although in pieces and this will remain 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:22.669
 adhered to what is the amaranth and the 

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:24.739
 of the oats but what I'm going to do 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:27.039
 right now it's with the egg when I was 

00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:29.539
 beating I'm going to make like nougat 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:31.579
 to see if this sticks a little 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:33.919
 more in the balance and I will continue 

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:37.009
 experimenting until they get more 

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:39.259
 cool concede be beautiful golden 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:43.389
 no but I do go there are some that 

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:43.389
 lack is perfect 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:49.789
 Well, definitely they were better 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.550
 be more beautiful and good chic 

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:55.699
 we conclude our recipe for 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:58.139
 gorditas of potatoes with 

00:07:55.699 --> 00:08:03.499
 they will call perfect touch good but you 

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:03.499
 like it or not I love you much valencia
