00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 Hello, I want to show you today how 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.700
 you make such a small treasure chest 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.150
 You can easily do what you want 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:20.180
 one year a pencil is needed 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:23.670
 maybe even a scissors and tesafilm 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.740
 of course a square paper 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.130
 I have a4 paper here so completely 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.390
 normal printer paper should be the whole 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.000
 look like this later 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.829
 You can now stop the video around you 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.120
 to mark the dimensions 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.610
 I will do this too you have 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.210
 now everything is marked it is important 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.480
 to draw the right angles here 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.270
 to avoid any gaps in the case later 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.860
 to have technology 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.010
 we have beautiful closed here 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.449
 knew 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.449
 I have the right angles now 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.379
 marked for the one more 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.850
 closure wish can such a 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.150
 art once closed the whole can after 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.330
 be painted at will and later 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.530
 cut out 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.689
 then we start with the fold 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.350
 I have now cut out my template 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.600
 Now we can start folding 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.869
 folded all the lines after the lines 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.270
 should be outside so so yours 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.270
 painted so if you have painted it 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.360
 we can see everyone 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.360
 lines after 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:02:12.790
 and another line forget this 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:17.380
 line so maybe you can already 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:20.290
 realize that it should be a box 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.700
 So now you have to do that 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.970
 corner they take fold and this 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.610
 take right angle inward 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:36.130
 and once you open the edge 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:40.450
 have and have just been nice you could do that 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.270
 press right angle and you have 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:52.140
 even an edge that you do with all 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:03:00.390
 four, that the edge is beautiful and carefully 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:00.390
 fold it to a ridge right here 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:12.329
 also here so if you have the box now 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.819
 take and to a bit 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.099
 you can really compress 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.950
 realize that this is a treasure chest 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.930
 the whole thing is not going to last now 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.670
 I thought so great 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.500
 you just take the tesafilm with the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:35.280
 it really works the easiest and sticks 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:38.400
 small stripes in here and sticks so 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.909
 the right angle in your treasure chest 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.409
 stuck with all four angles it 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.199
 No matter which side you go to 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:53.810
 sticks these should just be fixed 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:53.810
 However, be 1 point 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:09.329
 But this corner can hold the box 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.189
 Let's fold it and look there 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.139
 really everything works if I have 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:17.190
 exactly measured had drawn exactly 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:20.880
 if that is the case, the 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.590
 hold box and you can already see clearly 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.199
 who would paint the box now 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.090
 whole look a little bit awesome though 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:32.630
 I guess that's nice too 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.630
 have fun while tinkering
