line<00:00:30.770> Kevin<00:00:31.160> I<00:00:31.340> like<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:31.939> odds<00:00:32.090> for<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.419> away

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
line Kevin I like the odds for the away

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.259 
line Kevin I like the odds for the away
win<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.170> that's<00:00:33.260> priced<00:00:33.620> at<00:00:33.829> 2.1<00:00:34.610> but<00:00:35.210> the

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
win and that's priced at 2.1 but the

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.729 
win and that's priced at 2.1 but the
question<00:00:35.570> is<00:00:35.690> is<00:00:35.809> why<00:00:36.050> are<00:00:36.109> they<00:00:36.350> as<00:00:36.500> high<00:00:36.679> as

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
question is is why are they as high as

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.319 
question is is why are they as high as
that<00:00:37.010> considering<00:00:37.760> their<00:00:37.879> performance

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
that considering their performance

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.569 
that considering their performance
against<00:00:38.629> letting<00:00:38.960> Madrid<00:00:39.440> are<00:00:39.620> they<00:00:40.219> factor

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
against letting Madrid are they factor

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.619 
against letting Madrid are they factor
in<00:00:40.670> Marlo's<00:00:41.059> home<00:00:41.239> advantage<00:00:41.539> I<00:00:42.550> think<00:00:43.629> that's

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
in Marlo's home advantage I think that's

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.329 
in Marlo's home advantage I think that's
obviously<00:00:45.079> you're<00:00:45.289> going<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.500> always<00:00:45.649> figure

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
obviously you're going to always figure

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.160 
obviously you're going to always figure
in<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.609> home<00:00:46.760> advantage<00:00:46.940> in<00:00:47.420> soccer<00:00:47.989> and

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
in the home advantage in soccer and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.049 
in the home advantage in soccer and
football<00:00:48.679> very<00:00:49.129> heavily<00:00:49.519> and<00:00:49.699> I<00:00:49.760> think<00:00:49.940> that's

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
football very heavily and I think that's

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.419 
football very heavily and I think that's
the<00:00:50.120> reality<00:00:50.420> here<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:51.350> fact<00:00:51.980> that<00:00:52.039> they<00:00:52.219> beat

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
the reality here the fact that they beat

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.560 
the reality here the fact that they beat
that<00:00:52.699> let<00:00:52.910> it<00:00:53.030> go<00:00:53.179> is<00:00:54.760> probably<00:00:55.760> worth<00:00:55.969> 50<00:00:56.390> to

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
that let it go is probably worth 50 to

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.110 
that let it go is probably worth 50 to

one<00:01:11.750> that's<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.110> real<00:01:12.320> toy<00:01:12.530> I<00:01:12.560> was<00:01:12.770> thinking

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
one that's a real toy I was thinking

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.090 
one that's a real toy I was thinking
about<00:01:13.159> that<00:01:13.520> i<00:01:13.549> think<00:01:13.729> i<00:01:14.090> would<00:01:14.240> probably<00:01:15.140> it

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
about that i think i would probably it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.889 
about that i think i would probably it
would<00:01:16.220> depend<00:01:16.549> honestly<00:01:17.210> would<00:01:17.420> depend<00:01:17.630> on<00:01:17.810> my

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
would depend honestly would depend on my

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.330 
would depend honestly would depend on my
bankroll<00:01:18.320> at<00:01:18.469> that<00:01:18.619> point<00:01:18.829> in<00:01:18.950> time<00:01:18.979> but<00:01:19.250> i

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
bankroll at that point in time but i

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.620 
bankroll at that point in time but i
think<00:01:19.549> this<00:01:19.610> is<00:01:19.759> a<00:01:19.790> game<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:20.060> i<00:01:20.240> might<00:01:20.450> lay

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
think this is a game that i might lay

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.810 
think this is a game that i might lay
off<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:21.049> because<00:01:21.229> it's<00:01:21.649> so<00:01:22.189> tough<00:01:22.460> even<00:01:22.640> though

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
off of because it's so tough even though

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.149 
off of because it's so tough even though
i<00:01:22.850> have<00:01:22.939> an<00:01:23.060> opinion<00:01:23.509> on<00:01:23.719> olympiakos<00:01:24.439> it's

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
i have an opinion on olympiakos it's

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.770 
i have an opinion on olympiakos it's
just<00:01:25.399> a<00:01:25.520> tough<00:01:25.729> handicap<00:01:26.329> in<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.630> whole

gives me at home against a team that was

gives me at home against a team that was

supposed<00:02:19.299> to<00:02:19.450> win<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.659> group<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.409> then<00:02:20.590> going

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
supposed to win the group and then going

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.320 
supposed to win the group and then going
and<00:02:21.040> playing<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.370> worst<00:02:21.580> team<00:02:21.849> in<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:22.060> group

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
and playing the worst team in the group

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.030 
and playing the worst team in the group
I<00:02:22.540> think<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:23.110> there's<00:02:23.470> going<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.709> be<00:02:23.739> goals

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
I think that there's going to be goals

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.920 
I think that there's going to be goals
in<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.310> game<00:02:24.549> and<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.760> think<00:02:25.000> knowing<00:02:25.780> that

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
in this game and I think knowing that

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.270 
in this game and I think knowing that
you<00:02:26.080> work<00:02:26.230> backwards<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:26.950> say<00:02:27.129> who's

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
you work backwards and you say who's

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.880 
you work backwards and you say who's
going<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.519> score<00:02:27.700> those<00:02:27.940> goals<00:02:28.500> then<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.680> think

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
going to score those goals then I think

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.680 
going to score those goals then I think
olympiakos<00:02:30.580> should<00:02:30.910> at<00:02:31.030> least<00:02:31.120> have<00:02:31.299> two<00:02:31.540> or

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
olympiakos should at least have two or

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.990 
olympiakos should at least have two or
three<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.989> those<00:02:32.080> goals<00:02:32.349> therefore<00:02:33.220> with<00:02:33.760> two

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
three of those goals therefore with two

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.280 
three of those goals therefore with two
halves<00:02:34.239> you're<00:02:34.720> hoping<00:02:34.959> they're<00:02:35.110> going<00:02:35.230> to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
halves you're hoping they're going to

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.110 
halves you're hoping they're going to
get<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.440> goal<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:35.769> each<00:02:35.830> half<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.340> that's<00:02:36.910> where

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
get a goal in each half and that's where

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.050 
get a goal in each half and that's where
that<00:02:37.239> came<00:02:37.660> from<00:02:37.720> mm-hmm<00:02:38.620> now<00:02:39.099> I'm<00:02:39.459> based<00:02:39.790> on

mmhmm<00:03:34.419> yeah<00:03:34.540> now<00:03:35.410> olympiakos<00:03:36.220> has<00:03:36.400> quite<00:03:36.579> a

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
mmhmm yeah now olympiakos has quite a

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.250 
mmhmm yeah now olympiakos has quite a
tough<00:03:36.880> defense<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.569> last<00:03:37.780> five<00:03:38.019> matches

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
tough defense and the last five matches

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.620 
tough defense and the last five matches
they've<00:03:38.620> kept<00:03:38.889> a<00:03:38.980> clean<00:03:39.220> sheet<00:03:39.250> twice<00:03:39.880> could

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
they've kept a clean sheet twice could

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.210 
they've kept a clean sheet twice could
we<00:03:40.780> see<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.019> clean<00:03:41.319> sheet<00:03:41.530> from<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.769> visitors

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
we see a clean sheet from the visitors

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.190 
we see a clean sheet from the visitors
or<00:03:42.489> can<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:42.819> see<00:03:43.000> Marlo<00:03:43.329> scoring<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:43.989> their

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
or can you see Marlo scoring on their

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.699 
or can you see Marlo scoring on their
home<00:03:44.410> turf<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:45.359> think<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.569> says<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.440> clean

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
home turf I think that says the clean

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.440 
home turf I think that says the clean
sheet<00:03:48.040> would<00:03:48.160> be<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.340> tough<00:03:48.639> bed<00:03:48.970> in<00:03:49.120> this<00:03:49.239> one

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
sheet would be a tough bed in this one

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.190 
sheet would be a tough bed in this one
because<00:03:50.730> Momo<00:03:51.730> still<00:03:52.150> has<00:03:52.299> to<00:03:52.480> play<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:52.720> let<00:03:53.079> it

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
because Momo still has to play I let it

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.349 
because Momo still has to play I let it
go<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:53.560> Ventus<00:03:53.919> at<00:03:54.040> home<00:03:54.220> it's<00:03:55.090> going<00:03:55.329> to

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
go and you Ventus at home it's going to

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.970 
go and you Ventus at home it's going to
be<00:03:55.450> tough<00:03:55.630> for<00:03:55.810> them<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.049> get<00:03:56.139> a<00:03:56.200> goal<00:03:56.500> let

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
be tough for them to get a goal let

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.629 
be tough for them to get a goal let
alone<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.400> win<00:03:57.609> at<00:03:57.790> home<00:03:57.940> against<00:03:58.329> that<00:03:58.930> big

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
alone the win at home against that big

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.580 
alone the win at home against that big
differentiation<00:04:00.639> in<00:04:00.840> quality<00:04:01.840> that's<00:04:02.349> just<00:04:02.530> a

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
differentiation in quality that's just a

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.229 
differentiation in quality that's just a
huge<00:04:02.829> step<00:04:03.069> up<00:04:03.190> for<00:04:03.370> them<00:04:03.519> now<00:04:03.700> in<00:04:03.819> this<00:04:04.000> game

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
huge step up for them now in this game

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.210 
huge step up for them now in this game
olympiakos<00:04:04.989> at<00:04:05.379> least<00:04:05.650> we're<00:04:05.829> going<00:04:05.919> to<00:04:06.040> think

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
olympiakos at least we're going to think

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.129 
olympiakos at least we're going to think
they<00:04:06.340> can<00:04:06.370> win<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:06.940> therefore<00:04:07.690> they<00:04:08.079> should

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
they can win and therefore they should

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.020 
they can win and therefore they should
probably<00:04:08.709> want<00:04:08.889> to<00:04:09.010> treat<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.310> home<00:04:09.459> fans<00:04:09.730> to

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
probably want to treat the home fans to

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.879 
probably want to treat the home fans to
at<00:04:10.120> least<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.419> goal<00:04:10.599> right<00:04:10.870> let<00:04:11.319> me<00:04:11.470> test<00:04:11.680> some

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
at least a goal right let me test some

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.009 
at least a goal right let me test some
some<00:04:12.669> hope<00:04:12.849> along<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.299> way<00:04:13.419> so<00:04:13.480> if<00:04:13.720> they<00:04:13.840> get

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
some hope along the way so if they get

some hope along the way so if they get
if<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.530> get<00:04:14.709> shut<00:04:15.010> out<00:04:15.040> here<00:04:15.400> against<00:04:15.639> your

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.590 
yeah I think that they could get a goal
here<00:04:34.919> now<00:04:35.550> there's<00:04:35.729> only<00:04:35.759> wanting<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.330> be<00:04:36.419> able

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
now Winnington ill that's priced at 3.6

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.969 
now Winnington ill that's priced at 3.6
here<00:04:42.150> both<00:04:42.449> teams<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:42.990> score<00:04:43.020> as<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.770> sort<00:04:43.949> of

here both teams to score as you sort of

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.430 
here both teams to score as you sort of
think<00:04:44.039> well<00:04:44.250> may<00:04:44.400> happen<00:04:44.610> there<00:04:44.850> is<00:04:45.030> 1.96<00:04:45.840> or

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
think well may happen there is 1.96 or

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.770 
think well may happen there is 1.96 or
you<00:04:46.740> can<00:04:46.919> combine<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.699> olympiakos<00:04:48.300> win<00:04:48.570> and

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
you can combine the olympiakos win and

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.570 
you can combine the olympiakos win and
both<00:04:49.169> teams<00:04:49.410> to<00:04:49.620> score<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.979> guess<00:04:50.310> you're<00:04:50.430> very

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
both teams to score I guess you're very

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.240 
both teams to score I guess you're very
nice<00:04:50.729> of<00:04:50.759> odds<00:04:51.060> of<00:04:51.530> 4.74<00:04:52.530> what<00:04:52.979> do<00:04:53.039> you<00:04:53.100> think

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
over two and a half goals is a priced

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.450 
over two and a half goals is a priced
around<00:05:35.490> 2.15<00:05:36.500> now<00:05:37.500> you<00:05:37.560> can<00:05:37.770> combine<00:05:38.039> alien

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
around 2.15 now you can combine alien

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.100 
around 2.15 now you can combine alien
vehicles<00:05:38.880> win<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:39.330> over<00:05:39.660> two<00:05:39.780> and<00:05:39.900> a<00:05:39.960> half

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.379 
vehicles win and the over two and a half
goals<00:05:40.440> less<00:05:41.039> odds<00:05:41.370> but<00:05:41.729> maybe<00:05:42.030> people<00:05:42.360> think

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
goals less odds but maybe people think

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:43.490 
goals less odds but maybe people think
this<00:05:42.599> you<00:05:42.750> know<00:05:42.870> if<00:05:42.930> you<00:05:43.169> think<00:05:43.320> that

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
this you know if you think that

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.230 
this you know if you think that
olympiakos<00:05:43.979> can<00:05:44.130> keep<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.310> clean<00:05:44.490> sheet<00:05:44.520> then

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
olympiakos can keep a clean sheet then

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.339 
olympiakos can keep a clean sheet then
maybe<00:05:45.389> this<00:05:45.570> is<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.780> bet<00:05:45.900> that<00:05:46.020> you<00:05:46.110> would<00:05:46.199> go

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
maybe this is the bet that you would go

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.649 
maybe this is the bet that you would go
towards<00:05:46.849> olympiakos<00:05:47.849> I'm<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.180> over<00:05:48.449> two<00:05:48.570> and

towards olympiakos I'm the over two and
a<00:05:48.720> half<00:05:48.840> goals<00:05:49.080> and<00:05:49.229> that's<00:05:49.349> priced<00:05:49.530> at<00:05:49.740> 3.3

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
a half goals and that's priced at 3.3

a half goals and that's priced at 3.3
what<00:05:51.449> do<00:05:51.510> you<00:05:51.570> think<00:05:51.690> of<00:05:51.720> that<00:05:51.810> combination

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
what do you think of that combination

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.770

bet<00:05:52.430> that's<00:05:53.430> interesting<00:05:53.909> too<00:05:54.120> that's<00:05:54.419> that

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
bet that's interesting too that's that

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.939 
bet that's interesting too that's that
makes<00:05:54.930> me<00:05:55.050> think<00:05:55.260> about<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.620> other<00:05:55.770> one

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
makes me think about the other one

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.860 
makes me think about the other one
because<00:05:56.250> it<00:05:56.460> both<00:05:56.580> teams<00:05:56.880> to<00:05:57.030> score<00:05:57.060> I<00:05:57.449> just<00:05:57.659> it

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
because it both teams to score I just it

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.750 
because it both teams to score I just it
comes<00:05:58.080> down<00:05:58.229> to<00:05:58.380> that<00:05:58.409> little<00:05:58.650> skinny<00:05:59.190> reality

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
comes down to that little skinny reality

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.120 
comes down to that little skinny reality
of<00:06:00.150> giving<00:06:00.539> Malmo<00:06:00.990> you<00:06:01.560> know<00:06:01.650> being<00:06:01.889> being

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
of giving Malmo you know being being

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.500 
of giving Malmo you know being being
negative<00:06:02.520> from<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:02.729> mama<00:06:02.909> point<00:06:03.270> of<00:06:03.330> view<00:06:03.419> but

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
negative from a mama point of view but

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.969 
negative from a mama point of view but

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
giving them that home courtesy goal

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.830 
giving them that home courtesy goal
against<00:06:05.669> the<00:06:05.789> one<00:06:06.000> team<00:06:06.030> that<00:06:06.300> they<00:06:06.599> could

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
against the one team that they could

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.980 
against the one team that they could
possibly<00:06:07.349> draw<00:06:08.010> could<00:06:08.340> possibly<00:06:08.729> beat<00:06:09.000> and

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
possibly draw could possibly beat and

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.770 
possibly draw could possibly beat and
expected<00:06:10.680> to<00:06:11.370> give<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:11.639> fans<00:06:11.849> a<00:06:12.000> good<00:06:12.150> game

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
expected to give the fans a good game

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.670 
expected to give the fans a good game
from<00:06:13.050> but<00:06:13.760> yeah<00:06:14.760> that's<00:06:15.150> uh<00:06:15.270> I<00:06:15.720> think<00:06:16.380> I'd<00:06:16.500> be<00:06:16.650> a

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
from but yeah that's uh I think I'd be a

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.260 
from but yeah that's uh I think I'd be a
little<00:06:16.889> riskier<00:06:17.400> and<00:06:17.580> I'd<00:06:17.699> go<00:06:17.849> with<00:06:17.970> the<00:06:18.090> both

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
little riskier and I'd go with the both

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.089 
little riskier and I'd go with the both
teams<00:06:18.539> to<00:06:18.690> score<00:06:18.720> assuming<00:06:19.409> that<00:06:19.560> Momo<00:06:19.770> gives

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
teams to score assuming that Momo gives

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.000 
teams to score assuming that Momo gives
the<00:06:20.280> goal<00:06:20.490> now<00:06:20.909> watch<00:06:21.650> olympiakos<00:06:22.650> so<00:06:22.830> beat

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
the goal now watch olympiakos so beat

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.930 
the goal now watch olympiakos so beat
him<00:06:23.099> 3<00:06:23.310> nothing<00:06:23.460> and<00:06:23.639> I'll<00:06:23.789> be<00:06:23.909> embarrassed

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
him 3 nothing and I'll be embarrassed

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.710 
him 3 nothing and I'll be embarrassed
but<00:06:24.800> but<00:06:25.800> yeah<00:06:26.400> I<00:06:26.460> think<00:06:26.789> the<00:06:27.150> riskier<00:06:27.510> one

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
but but yeah I think the riskier one

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.180 
but but yeah I think the riskier one
sounds<00:06:28.110> better<00:06:28.169> but<00:06:28.409> for<00:06:28.680> a<00:06:28.710> smaller<00:06:28.979> amount

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
sounds better but for a smaller amount

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.610 
sounds better but for a smaller amount
of<00:06:29.370> money<00:06:29.580> uh-huh<00:06:30.180> yeah<00:06:30.510> very<00:06:30.720> true<00:06:30.810> now<00:06:31.470> what

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
of money uh-huh yeah very true now what

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.260 
of money uh-huh yeah very true now what
would<00:06:31.710> you<00:06:31.830> say<00:06:32.099> we<00:06:32.310> discuss<00:06:32.610> a<00:06:32.699> few<00:06:32.729> bets<00:06:33.060> here

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
would you say we discuss a few bets here

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.790 
would you say we discuss a few bets here
what<00:06:33.780> would<00:06:33.900> you<00:06:33.960> say<00:06:34.020> the<00:06:34.110> top<00:06:34.320> tip<00:06:34.530> man<00:06:34.650> is<00:06:34.770> a

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
what would you say the top tip man is a

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.580 
what would you say the top tip man is a
plane<00:06:35.039> as<00:06:35.219> much<00:06:35.460> I<00:06:35.779> think<00:06:36.779> the<00:06:36.870> top<00:06:37.080> tip<00:06:37.380> after

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
plane as much I think the top tip after

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.779 
plane as much I think the top tip after
everything<00:06:37.979> we<00:06:38.099> said<00:06:38.310> it<00:06:38.370> would<00:06:38.460> just<00:06:38.580> be<00:06:38.760> the

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
everything we said it would just be the

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.320 
everything we said it would just be the
simple<00:06:39.330> over<00:06:39.659> two<00:06:39.900> and<00:06:40.020> a<00:06:40.080> half

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
simple over two and a half

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.719 
simple over two and a half
goals<00:06:40.539> plus<00:06:41.020> a<00:06:41.169> dollar<00:06:41.349> 14<00:06:41.979> yeah<00:06:42.310> get<00:06:42.520> a<00:06:42.550> nice

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:42.729 
goals plus a dollar 14 yeah get a nice

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:44.580 
goals plus a dollar 14 yeah get a nice
little<00:06:42.939> plus<00:06:43.210> on<00:06:43.389> at<00:06:43.509> the<00:06:43.599> idea<00:06:43.930> oddsmakers

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
little plus on at the idea oddsmakers

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.649 
little plus on at the idea oddsmakers
think<00:06:45.490> differently<00:06:45.879> than<00:06:46.090> I<00:06:46.180> do<00:06:46.240> about<00:06:46.360> this

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:46.659 
think differently than I do about this

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:48.089 
think differently than I do about this
one<00:06:46.870> if<00:06:46.990> they're<00:06:47.110> putting<00:06:47.409> a<00:06:47.500> plus<00:06:47.710> on<00:06:47.979> the

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:48.099 
one if they're putting a plus on the

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:49.559 
one if they're putting a plus on the
over<00:06:48.340> two<00:06:48.490> and<00:06:48.610> a<00:06:48.699> half<00:06:48.819> do<00:06:49.210> you<00:06:49.270> think<00:06:49.449> there's

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:49.569 
over two and a half do you think there's

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:51.450 
over two and a half do you think there's
going<00:06:49.659> to<00:06:49.750> be<00:06:49.780> no<00:06:50.169> scoring<00:06:50.560> low<00:06:50.830> scoring<00:06:51.189> and

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
going to be no scoring low scoring and

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.010 
going to be no scoring low scoring and
those<00:06:52.150> are<00:06:52.210> going<00:06:52.330> to<00:06:52.389> be<00:06:52.449> few<00:06:52.750> and<00:06:52.780> far

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
those are going to be few and far

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.170 
those are going to be few and far
between<00:06:53.229> I<00:06:53.860> think<00:06:54.400> just<00:06:54.729> because<00:06:54.849> it's<00:06:55.120> the

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
between I think just because it's the

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.209 
between I think just because it's the
two<00:06:55.419> of<00:06:55.569> the<00:06:55.719> lesser<00:06:56.469> kings<00:06:56.710> it's<00:06:56.949> going<00:06:57.069> to<00:06:57.129> be

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:57.219 
two of the lesser kings it's going to be

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:59.189 
two of the lesser kings it's going to be
a<00:06:57.250> little<00:06:57.430> more<00:06:57.610> open<00:06:57.939> olympiakos<00:06:58.900> is<00:06:59.050> going

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 
a little more open olympiakos is going

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.689 
a little more open olympiakos is going
to<00:06:59.259> have<00:06:59.349> a<00:06:59.379> little<00:06:59.500> confidence<00:06:59.889> from<00:07:00.490> their

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
to have a little confidence from their

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:02.249 
to have a little confidence from their
last<00:07:00.849> game<00:07:01.060> I'm<00:07:01.180> going<00:07:01.270> to<00:07:01.360> try<00:07:01.539> to<00:07:01.569> go<00:07:01.780> 2<00:07:01.840> and<00:07:02.169> 0
