00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.480
 carmen and is that as they are Swiss 2 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.760
 Celtic and well he welcomes you to 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.310
 one more motorcycle radio milestone for the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.380
 version 0 point 9.5 of pi minecraft 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.020
 ok this time we are using the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.130
 launcher pro 1.7 point 5 here below is 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.769
 in the description because I also already 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.509
 you have and well then I'll also 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.759
 leave these mini game for anything 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.980
 carnal and good with a sad account of 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.720
 review of the boat mod so it is already 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.550
 they finally updated the mold this for 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.829
 this version of minecraft and that go 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.180
 that are going to be very useful in this in this 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.800
 update because the monkeys are already 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.629
 infinite and sometimes you run into that 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.980
 you are in the middle of an island or you do not want 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.140
 you're not going through the sea, and so 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.420
 well this is something something that was pretty 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.329
 remember this is just a version 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.829
 Well, you can say beta the boats of wine 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.410
 They are made of wood but it is a minecraft 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.340
 let's see how how is this not what 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.920
 only thing we need to do is 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.480
 obviously you can have everything already 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.920
 had said so much the version of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.390
 minecraft as the block launcher and good 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.050
 to capture what we need in the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.550
 kraft table eo we're going to need 55 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.410
 iron ingots that and I tell them we're going 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.610
 to give what is the main card the 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.049
 minecraft you will be able to continue using 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.950
 in the villas all normal not you 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.780
 worry 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.430
 the only difference is that good as 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.619
 let's do as a boat is simple and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.810
 having in hand we are going to go here 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.280
 on one side of the island there has to be 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.140
 a block of difference that I do not know if I 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.729
 I locate with that has to see a block and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.219
 then a block of water and there you put it 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.720
 ok, well, I do like to put it here 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.640
 well more to the bottom but it has to 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.979
 to be something like that then good and you put 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.920
 you give a touch and to this cube of 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.509
 sand or wherever you are and what 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.460
 only thing you wear is a label 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.170
 contrast to the boat and you will be able to follow 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.030
 So this walk is like the version in 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.159
 tico wants to be has happened to be able 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.929
 move between then now that between the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.670
 river between the sea where it is simply 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.289
 it's a matter of and moving the camera ok 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.720
 the keys not because as you can see 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.179
 there are no buttons ok we show those two 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.939
 if you squeeze equipment here up here 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.920
 this button here you will assault ok and 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.239
 you're going to get out of minecraft then 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.340
 well the only thing you have to do to 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:01.409
 guiding you is to move the camera towards 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.939
 sides, well, I think yes, you turn it around 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.450
 totally up either 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.340
 vertically up you stop 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.959
 because it's the only thing you can stop t 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.880
 without leaving the minecraft turn towards 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.739
 up then then the channel is 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.760
 just that before he forgets 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.140
 carnal the link 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.670
 describes know is down here in the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.950
 description and good is the only thing 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.930
 have to do is go to that link 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.310
 they go to the direct port and there it is in 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.620
 this image is showing up in this 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.510
 moment a red box that is in that 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.829
 box the last one to give him a 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.329
 touch goes because it is that they then tell me 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.590
 that are lost and I do not know what they put 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.360
 the direct links and well I can not 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.739

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.260
 Complicated too much but good at least 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.150
 success is that carnal think anyone 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.530
 had brought study here pretty 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.329

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.159

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.239
 find here seek me maybe there's 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.620
 some that and that you have not noticed 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.540
 because you're new to the channel and 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.459
 investigates what aministia that in the channel 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.959
 that there is too much content 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.090
