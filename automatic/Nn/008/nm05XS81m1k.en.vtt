00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
so what I really like about this wig is

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.940 
so what I really like about this wig is
that<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.790> does<00:02:11.000> cover<00:02:11.720> up<00:02:11.870> his<00:02:12.020> eyebrows<00:02:12.590> which

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
that it does cover up his eyebrows which

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.340 
that it does cover up his eyebrows which
I<00:02:13.130> don't<00:02:13.190> particularly<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:15.020> video

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
I don't particularly like and this video

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.900 
I don't particularly like and this video
is<00:02:15.410> not<00:02:15.590> really<00:02:15.980> supposed<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.370> be<00:02:16.490> about<00:02:16.760> the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
is not really supposed to be about the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.240 
is not really supposed to be about the
wig<00:02:17.060> but<00:02:17.390> I<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:18.440> know<00:02:18.530> it's<00:02:18.830> hard<00:02:19.010> not<00:02:19.190> to

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
wig but I you know it's hard not to

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.210 
wig but I you know it's hard not to
mention<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.790> because<00:02:19.910> it's<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.360> pretty

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
mention it because it's so pretty

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.610 
mention it because it's so pretty
anyhow<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:23.000> Jax<00:02:23.720> my<00:02:24.140> Taeyang<00:02:24.710> Natsume<00:02:26.620> in

a<00:02:28.130> pair<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:29.620> kendall<00:02:31.540> surfer<00:02:32.540> shorts<00:02:32.570> and<00:02:33.940> it's

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
a pair of kendall surfer shorts and it's

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.490 
a pair of kendall surfer shorts and it's
interesting<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.720> note<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.230> shoes

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
interesting to note that the shoes

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.920 
interesting to note that the shoes
definitely<00:02:37.430> fit<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.030> flip-flops<00:02:38.480> do<00:02:38.720> it's

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
definitely fit the flip-flops do it's

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.720 
definitely fit the flip-flops do it's
easy<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.380> flip<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:40.040> fit<00:02:40.280> flip-flops<00:02:40.850> on<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.150> doll

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
easy to flip to fit flip-flops on a doll

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.270 
easy to flip to fit flip-flops on a doll
his<00:02:43.730> heels<00:02:44.630> go<00:02:45.310> right<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.640> end<00:02:48.040> his<00:02:49.040> toes

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280

hang<00:02:49.520> over<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.820> little<00:02:50.000> bit<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:50.240> it's<00:02:50.540> hard<00:02:50.690> to

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
hang over a little bit so it's hard to

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.460 
hang over a little bit so it's hard to
say<00:02:51.020> how<00:02:51.740> shoes<00:02:52.430> would<00:02:52.700> fit<00:02:52.910> I'll<00:02:53.090> try<00:02:53.330> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
say how shoes would fit I'll try the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.160 
say how shoes would fit I'll try the
actual<00:02:54.470> shoes<00:02:55.060> beside<00:02:56.060> looking<00:02:56.480> very<00:02:56.690> out<00:02:56.990> of

actual shoes beside looking very out of

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
place in these in this outfit I think it

little bit of give if you pulled it it

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.040 
little bit of give if you pulled it it
would<00:03:04.040> probably<00:03:04.070> pull<00:03:04.640> down<00:03:04.850> but<00:03:05.180> they<00:03:05.750> seem

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.190 
would probably pull down but they seem
to<00:03:06.200> fit<00:03:06.350> him<00:03:06.590> they<00:03:06.920> look<00:03:07.160> fine<00:03:07.430> on<00:03:07.490> him<00:03:07.990> so<00:03:08.990> I'm

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
on I would say that this outfit actually

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.210 
on I would say that this outfit actually
fits<00:03:43.850> my<00:03:44.840> Taeyang<00:03:45.260> doll<00:03:45.500> quite<00:03:45.830> a<00:03:45.860> bit<00:03:46.040> better

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
fits my Taeyang doll quite a bit better

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.490 
fits my Taeyang doll quite a bit better
than<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.760> fits<00:03:46.940> Ken<00:03:47.510> although<00:03:48.020> I<00:03:48.050> guess<00:03:48.200> it's

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
than it fits Ken although I guess it's

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.270 
than it fits Ken although I guess it's
supposed<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.980> be<00:03:49.130> tight<00:03:50.200> anyhow<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.500> would<00:03:52.040> say

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
supposed to be tight anyhow I would say

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.390 
supposed to be tight anyhow I would say
that<00:03:52.720> Taeyang<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:54.020> probably<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.860> little<00:03:55.190> bit

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
that Taeyang is probably a little bit

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.150 
that Taeyang is probably a little bit
smaller<00:03:55.730> than<00:03:56.030> Ken<00:03:56.270> but<00:03:56.870> Ken's<00:03:57.260> clothes<00:03:57.770> seem

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
smaller than Ken but Ken's clothes seem

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.530 
smaller than Ken but Ken's clothes seem
to<00:03:58.370> fit<00:03:58.580> him<00:03:58.850> fine

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
to fit him fine

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.949 
to fit him fine
so<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.020> pants<00:04:00.500> go<00:04:00.739> right<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.310> his<00:04:02.120> waist<00:04:02.480> where

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
so the pants go right to his waist where

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.110 
so the pants go right to his waist where
you<00:04:03.110> would<00:04:03.350> I'm<00:04:04.340> just<00:04:04.550> kind<00:04:04.820> of<00:04:04.850> trying<00:04:05.090> to

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
you would I'm just kind of trying to

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.699 
you would I'm just kind of trying to
think<00:04:05.360> about<00:04:05.570> if<00:04:05.750> these<00:04:05.989> were<00:04:06.140> two<00:04:06.350> separate

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
think about if these were two separate

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.310 
think about if these were two separate
pieces<00:04:07.280> would<00:04:07.670> they<00:04:07.850> both<00:04:08.030> fit<00:04:08.330> and<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:09.080> think

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
pieces would they both fit and I think

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.860 
pieces would they both fit and I think
they<00:04:09.470> would<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:10.250> because<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.330> pants<00:04:11.540> go<00:04:11.810> to

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
they would so because the pants go to

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.380 
they would so because the pants go to

the waist and the shirt kind of comes to

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.690 
the waist and the shirt kind of comes to
where<00:04:14.540> it's<00:04:14.660> supposed<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:15.050> go<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:16.310> it<00:04:16.400> seems<00:04:16.609> to

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
where it's supposed to go so it seems to

where it's supposed to go so it seems to
be<00:04:16.789> proportioned<00:04:17.419> properly<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:18.169> could<00:04:18.680> not<00:04:18.890> get

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
be proportioned properly I could not get

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.520 
be proportioned properly I could not get
his<00:04:19.400> feet<00:04:19.700> into<00:04:20.000> these<00:04:20.419> shoes<00:04:20.840> his<00:04:21.229> feet

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
eight are the same length as Ken's but

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.830
