00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and your fingers and thumbs go all the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.779 
and your fingers and thumbs go all the
way<00:00:50.640> down<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> end<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:52.320> very<00:00:52.410> light<00:00:52.860> you

way down to the end it's very light you
can<00:00:53.910> still<00:00:54.149> hear<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.020> some<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> grip

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
can still hear you know some of the grip

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.060 
can still hear you know some of the grip
but<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.879> very<00:00:57.149> light<00:00:57.570> love<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.710> part<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
but it's a very light love this part is

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
but it's a very light love this part is
leather<00:00:59.309> this<00:01:00.059> part<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> breathable<00:01:01.379> fabric

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
leather this part is a breathable fabric

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.429 
leather this part is a breathable fabric
but<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> really<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.570> aspect<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.229> about

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
but I really like that aspect of about

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.500 
but I really like that aspect of about
it<00:01:04.790> when<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> compared<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> my<00:01:06.810> Nike<00:01:07.560> gloves

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
it when I compared it to my Nike gloves

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.820 
it when I compared it to my Nike gloves
one<00:01:09.510> thing<00:01:09.689> that's<00:01:09.869> hard<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
one thing that's hard here is that you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.000 
one thing that's hard here is that you
really<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.750> struggle<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.530> kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:13.890> them

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
really have struggle to kind of get them

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
really have struggle to kind of get them
in<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.909> gotta<00:01:15.060> pull<00:01:15.270> them<00:01:15.360> tight<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
in you gotta pull them tight you know to

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.490 
in you gotta pull them tight you know to
get<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.680> fingers<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.790> end<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:19.229> they

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
get your fingers at the end and they

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.899 
get your fingers at the end and they
feel<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> little<00:01:19.920> bit<00:01:20.070> heavier<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.700> leather

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
feel a little bit heavier the leather

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.880 
feel a little bit heavier the leather
here<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.780> synthetic<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.409> fake<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> course

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
here is synthetic it's fake of course

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.120 
here is synthetic it's fake of course
just<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.490> armor<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.750> thick

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
just like on armor but it's really thick

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.219 
just like on armor but it's really thick
your<00:01:26.130> fingers<00:01:26.520> don't<00:01:26.939> feel<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:27.540> mobile<00:01:28.049> as

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
your fingers don't feel as mobile as

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.370 
your fingers don't feel as mobile as
they<00:01:28.290> are<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.820> Under<00:01:30.390> Armour<00:01:30.600> gloves<00:01:30.840> if

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
they are in the Under Armour gloves if

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.740 
they are in the Under Armour gloves if
you<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.740> other<00:01:31.920> Nike<00:01:32.310> video<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.630> know

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
you see my other Nike video you know

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.480 
you see my other Nike video you know
that<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> pro<00:01:34.439> models<00:01:34.799> those<00:01:35.340> are

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that I like the pro models those are

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.260 
that I like the pro models those are
hard<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> find<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.119> store<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:37.820> that<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
hard to find in store so that is the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.340 
hard to find in store so that is the
reason<00:01:39.450> why<00:01:39.540> I'm<00:01:39.659> comparing<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> vapor

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
reason why I'm comparing it to the vapor

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499 
reason why I'm comparing it to the vapor
carbons<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.729> thing<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.270> Under

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
carbons so one thing is that Under

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.149 
carbons so one thing is that Under
Armour<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.899> better<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.409> terms<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.890> your

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
Armour is better in terms of your

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.679 
Armour is better in terms of your
overall<00:01:44.280> flexibility<00:01:44.970> until<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> really

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
overall flexibility until you really

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.819 
overall flexibility until you really

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.960 

so<00:02:05.100> let's<00:02:05.250> see<00:02:06.230> all<00:02:07.230> right<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.920> one<00:02:08.729> thing

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
so let's see all right so one thing

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.720 
so let's see all right so one thing
about<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.360> cuffs<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.710> when<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.400> buckle

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
about the cuffs is that when you buckle

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.350 
about the cuffs is that when you buckle
these<00:02:11.880> tight<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:14.280> notice<00:02:14.520> highs<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:14.880> be<00:02:15.000> you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
these tight you notice highs can be you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.030 
these tight you notice highs can be you
could<00:02:15.510> tell<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.720> here<00:02:16.350> it's<00:02:16.710> tight<00:02:16.950> around

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.910 
could tell that here it's tight around
my<00:02:17.250> wrists<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:18.600> prevents<00:02:19.080> my<00:02:19.230> wrists<00:02:19.560> from

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
my wrists it prevents my wrists from
