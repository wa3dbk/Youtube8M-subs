00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 telma and sorry if the video is a small 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.529
 little bad quality so just not 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:14.509
 a super super super video 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:18.570
 the cougar to tell you that you have two 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:21.630
 lucky people among you who are going 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.670
 to be able to go back to the round with audrey 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.029
 and I have two tickets so it's 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.420
 free I invite two people from 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.880
 you with me in the round 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.800
 so I want I would like that there was in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.980
 weekend in this week there we 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.399
 is how much hate levitt 20 weeks 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.629
 it knows it knows it knows it on the 11th and 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.770
 October 12, 2000 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.899
 so I wish there was maybe Saturday 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.039
 maybe Sunday his defense he does 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.539
 beautiful it depends on your availability to you 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.489
 so the way I did it for 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.180
 choose these two lucky people 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.280
 so that's understood you do not have to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.240
 pay your ticket for the round I do not 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.890
 do not pay for restaurants and stuff 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.549
 that you want to spend on the spot so 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.259
 it's really a day ticket for 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.040
 another round robin 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.810
 so you personal expenses for a 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.869
 q the slab 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:33.030
 I say it to causes or a personal game if 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:37.259
 I had so if this game via the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.850
 unavoidable because the 18-19 I 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.439
 can not really on the 25th and the 26th I can 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.500
 not really able to appreciate the round his 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.869
 so close to choose these two 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.159
 people there all you have to 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.829
 to do is to write to me why is it 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.450
 that I should choose you and I will 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.790
 be very selective in changing the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.820
 people so who wants me and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.100
 beautiful things shown less than you 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.270
 are people fun because we have 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.899
 still spent my whole day 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.479
 together 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.860
 so that's either saying well that I do not want 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.220
 give these tickets the time 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.610
 two people who will take ball and 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.910
 running away I'm not someone who 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.760
 wants to participate in that to win 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.850
 only tickets so this is a 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.560
 opportunity to meet and 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.160
 talk together about making rides 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.590
 together to spend a day together 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.190
 and so that's why I really want 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.990
 choose two nice people who have 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.990
 not spoken in the rides because I 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.959
 I must absolutely everything so you 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.290
 have the sensitive heart maybe get 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.170
 or maybe I know what I 'm going 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.180
 really found that people with 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.100
 stop the bit then with my best 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.239
 saint-just friend really a beginning and I 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.010
 want it to be two people who are 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.260
 as comfortable in front of the camera because 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.170
 that obviously I'm going to make a blog there 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.750
 you're going to be in my blog so otherwise 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.850
 and not really conditions 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.170
 if you are a minor I speak to you want 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.320
 that you come with me and I do not want 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.209
 necessarily spend the day with 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:24.010
 your dad or your toddler so that's 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:26.380
 really two people who are 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.790
 able who have permission from their 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.470
 paranoid who are capable themselves 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.799
 become long 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.510
 alone or does not matter so understand you 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.799
 not what I did I do not want to go 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.799
 in the dragon all day 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.630
 that's what I know and I did not feel 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.019
 to be in the Ferris wheel if all the 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.230
 day 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.459
 so you do not support if I do 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.670
 understand why 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.470
 discrimination nor nothing but the time has 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.600
 spent the day with two people 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.280
 great and just to my iphone 1 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.830
 it's my day it's your day 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.660
 then I think after a great opportunity 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.000
 to get to know 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.900
 so if you are interested and if you 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.590
 go back to my little ones 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.079
 specific characteristics of 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.840
 potential candidates 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.500
 Ben is really a country I will choose 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.730
 two people 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.820
 I am going to choose 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.710
 these two people obviously have the 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.240
 I will choose a person but I 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.830
 would not choose two people who do not 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.050
 do not know who is so I'm going this 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:34.090
 evening as well as two two friends 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.930
 maybe do not play the game to create 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.010
 sick 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.500
 short or otherwise if you are alone and that 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.910
 you still want to participate 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.810
 write me sprocket to auch we had 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.060
 maybe another person are 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.170
 individual no matter but I think 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.820
 that the majority of you would like 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.780
 mute accompanied by a friend and that I 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.580
 so understand it with me write me 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.110
 why should I choose 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.360
 why should we spend the 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.540
 day together in the round 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.400
 so that's all i 'm doing a video 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.070
 of a minute and I really failed 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.340
 so I'm going to choose the people do not 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.740
 Friday and then together you 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.540
 decide if it's Saturday or if it's 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.600
 Sunday we see it so Saturday the 11th 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:26.500
 i sunday the 12th of october 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:30.370
 so I hope you like this 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.040
 little idea and of course a game must 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:38.950
 reside in quebec only in the surrounding area 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:42.100
 of Montreal German Here 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.650

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.970
 number and I put me things to 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.680
