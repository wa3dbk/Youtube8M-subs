00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
to use that to place down my first layer

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.190 
to use that to place down my first layer
of<00:02:36.750> cake

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
of cake

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.620 
of cake
a<00:02:37.230> very<00:02:38.040> thin<00:02:38.460> layer<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:38.880> ganache<00:02:39.150> goes

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
a very thin layer of ganache goes

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.030 
a very thin layer of ganache goes
straight<00:02:39.870> on<00:02:40.020> top<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.650> just<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.920> make

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
straight on top and this is just to make

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.040 
straight on top and this is just to make
it<00:02:41.070> like<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> little<00:02:41.460> bit<00:02:41.850> sticky<00:02:42.210> but<00:02:42.510> not<00:02:42.540> too

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it like a little bit sticky but not too

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.330 
it like a little bit sticky but not too
much<00:02:43.350> because<00:02:43.560> there's<00:02:43.800> going<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.950> be<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.130> fair

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
much because there's going to be a fair

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.590 
much because there's going to be a fair
bit<00:02:44.460> of<00:02:44.520> frosting<00:02:44.850> going<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.210> with<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.390> cake

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
bit of frosting going on with this cake

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.540 
bit of frosting going on with this cake
and<00:02:45.840> then<00:02:46.290> I've<00:02:46.410> got<00:02:46.560> some<00:02:46.710> of<00:02:46.800> my<00:02:46.830> second<00:02:47.400> ash

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
and then I've got some of my second ash

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.880 
and then I've got some of my second ash
in<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:48.120> piping<00:02:48.510> bag<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.260> for<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.740> want

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
in a piping bag so for this you want

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.950 
in a piping bag so for this you want
quite<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.160> thick<00:02:50.580> tip<00:02:50.940> cut<00:02:51.270> out<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> end<00:02:51.720> and

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
quite a thick tip cut out of the end and

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.900 
quite a thick tip cut out of the end and
we're<00:02:52.650> going<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:52.830> pipe<00:02:53.250> almost<00:02:53.790> like<00:02:53.880> a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
we're going to pipe almost like a

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.910 
we're going to pipe almost like a
sausage<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.630> ganache<00:02:54.900> all<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.560> way<00:02:55.650> around

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
sausage of ganache all the way around

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.310 
sausage of ganache all the way around
that<00:02:56.070> outside<00:02:56.100> layer<00:02:56.670> like<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.900> do<00:02:58.170> need

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
that outside layer like so you do need

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
back down to room temperature they are

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.890 
back down to room temperature they are
really<00:03:56.370> quite<00:03:56.580> easy<00:03:56.790> just<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.210> break<00:03:57.390> apart<00:03:57.540> so

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
really quite easy just to break apart so

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.030

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
they're not going to be too bad to cut

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.160 
they're not going to be too bad to cut
through<00:03:59.280> another<00:04:00.120> handful<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.660> cookie<00:04:00.930> crumbs
