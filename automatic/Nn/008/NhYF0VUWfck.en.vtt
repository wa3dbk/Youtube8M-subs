00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
know that's obviously pretty hard for

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.980 
know that's obviously pretty hard for
any<00:01:19.770> athlete<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.490> experience<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
any athlete to experience and but you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
any athlete to experience and but you
know<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> think<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.409> grew<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> lot<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
know I think I grew a lot as a as a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
know I think I grew a lot as a as a
person<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.049> player<00:01:25.369> experiencing<00:01:26.369> that

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
person and as a player experiencing that

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.240 
person and as a player experiencing that
and<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.380> obviously<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:28.770> anything

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and so it's it's obviously not anything

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.920 
and so it's it's obviously not anything
that<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.520> want<00:01:29.700> any<00:01:29.970> my<00:01:30.119> teammates<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.810> to

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.790 
each offseason and you know keep doing
off<00:03:03.430> off-ice<00:03:04.240> training<00:03:04.300> sorry<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.709> know

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
just keep trying to get stronger and I

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.040 
just keep trying to get stronger and I
think<00:03:07.330> it's<00:03:07.450> just<00:03:07.480> come<00:03:07.720> pretty<00:03:07.900> naturally

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
think it's just come pretty naturally

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.729 
think it's just come pretty naturally
but<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.040> has<00:03:09.160> taken<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:10.120> lot<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:10.989> extra<00:03:11.290> work<00:03:11.320> and

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
but it has taken a lot of extra work and

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.759 
but it has taken a lot of extra work and
you<00:03:12.550> know<00:03:12.670> it's<00:03:12.850> um<00:03:13.120> it's<00:03:13.690> been<00:03:13.930> it's<00:03:14.680> been

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
you know it's um it's been it's been

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.680 
you know it's um it's been it's been
tough<00:03:15.070> but<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.310> think<00:03:15.580> it's<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.820> pretty<00:03:16.540> big

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
tough but I think it's a pretty big

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.630 
tough but I think it's a pretty big
aspect<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.170> my<00:03:17.260> game<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.739> it's<00:03:17.860> important<00:03:18.280> for
