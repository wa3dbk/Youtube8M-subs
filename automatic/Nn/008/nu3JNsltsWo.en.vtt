00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.050
 in the morning 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.619
 here 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:24.530
 oh yeah do not see flying Th for crap gets along 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.560
 what is it I do n't know mallet so not 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:33.160
 flying prince it its squadron 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.890
 drove here still fly away what it is 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.500
 surprisingly does not flicker 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:44.930
 like flying eye plates see shoot 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.120
 take off now still fly here up 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.790
 houses 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.670
 closer who is just about entering here but she 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.580
 just if i zoom in here it is on 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.900
 when it is strengthened by it I am maximum Ilyich 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.940
 water for a moment the world . 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.739
 but just a little that she could see 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.120
 just flickers minutes it's flickering 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.269
 another. just all that is when 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.269
 flew entire squadrons at 11 49 hours 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.640
 minutes worth this look oh fuck so not 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.709
 the plane is not yet it is not at all 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.930
 the planes they themselves are flying such 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.700
 hasten eternally approaching 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.450
 defocusing so much so that it is clear that 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.920
 this is the biggest point in the middle of it 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.859
 what is generally incomprehensible to him 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.510
 unidentified flying objects 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:37.609
 as a result of autumn this is definitely not listening 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:41.480
 the plane is generally human and such as 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:43.299
 Helicopters are not right for you 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:52.609
 trying to bring 1 in 1 like a 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:55.280
 focused did not lead wedge there 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.350
 here's a bunch of straight was not I then began to 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.730
 slowly there is no top going out and everything is straight 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.220
 by the chaotic trajectory that is it is not 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.430
 airplanes. 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:08.750
 today is the sixth meaning of June 2015 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.549
 Saturday and at 23 hours 47 minutes we were 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.260
 seen here are the blue dots in 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.880
 the sky that flickered 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.100
 yes but it is not a helicopter and because 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.690
 helicopters are more so 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.900
 not a plane and because the plane is the same 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.190
 you they they would just hang the plane 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.760
 do not know how to hang change trajectory 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.740
 so save so not but they are very closed 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.330
 no fireflies in sizes of 20 to 30 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.330
 50 centimeters
