00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.500
 Hello everyone, they have asked me to give them 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.090
 show some more wire play and 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.630
 then this is another 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:26.599
 gadget another contraption that I have for 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.669
 make a series of them and just 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:33.890
 is to bend what wire is here 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:37.670
 a lot of them done 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.390
 and this is just going past what 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.700
 is the wire between one another and go 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.200
 doing the combinations 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.320
 that they want 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.320
 There are countless ways to do it 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.840
 and each one can be given the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.940
 difficulty the amount of wire and everything 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.940
 what we want 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.830
 here some out there for the suitcases 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.770
 I have some more 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.600
 and what I 'm going to show you is the most 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.990
 normal what I usually do 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.960
 and what I did for the first time is 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.690
 to do what are hearts then 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.460
 we have a piece of wire 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.970
 for example not 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.970
 That's how big we fold it in half 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.220
 and more or less with this opening or with 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.530
 this closing is with which we are going to 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.670
 work we put it in the center 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.540
 and we calculate more or less the distance to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.590
 what we want to do 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.750
 the heart 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.840
 this hand is very easy to do too 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.600
 but good with this the only thing that 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.909
 we get is to make all the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.179
 pieces are the same just give it a 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.179
 bit 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.470
 and once we have decided the size 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.740
 because we simply double one of the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.740
 sides 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.750
 we press it well against the other 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.470
 wire 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.470
 we cut 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:35.180
 the leftovers and we have 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:38.720
 a heart this the simplest thing of the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.180
 what it is about is that with this little 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.580
 contraption and with others that I have done 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.070
 so let's go do the different 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.280
 wire games that we want to do there 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:54.010
 infinite combinations 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.010
 smaller I just wanted to show 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.140
 hello everyone well I show you some of 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.200
 the wire games that I have 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.190
 here 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.190
 stored 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.990
 the tools also that I use and 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.840
 any 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.140
 some of the materials that I need 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.140
 as well 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.910
 I have already uploaded it, they are simply 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.760
 pieces of iron that 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.780
 counted in a special way and with 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:37.340
 the slots measurements and the east pivot 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:41.920
 because it can make different folds with 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:46.209
 this what I get to do is 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.710
 a lot of game possibilities 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.550
 different 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:56.569
 and all based on what it is to do 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:59.049
 Folds through the four pivots 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.190
 mostly what I have of games are 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:05.090
 sketches 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.300
 and what I use is a fine wire 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.940
 White green color depends on what 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.320
 have at that time I also have 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:18.549
 lots of balls of different 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.549
 different sizes of wood 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:27.940
 and what I do is mess up because I like it 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.220
 study of doing a lot of games and 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.230
 when one is 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.910
 as they say a little inspired 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:40.420
 he does not get and he gets it he asked me for a 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:45.570
 friend that you do one related to 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.570
 something from wing aviation 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.540
 and I'm not capable of doing it 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.910
 trying it for a while 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.000
 and although more or less have the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.640
 idea but I've done it several times and I have not 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.550
 just convince me therefore to see 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.490
 if at any time I have a little bit of 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.920
 inspiration as they say and I get with 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.750
 she 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.990
 very well, I just wanted him 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.420
 to show 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:17.850
 some of the gadgets or gadgets that 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.940
 materials that I have to do the 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.360
 wire games 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.360
 two
