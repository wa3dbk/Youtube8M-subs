extra one here I 10 feet long and this

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.279 
extra one here I 10 feet long and this
runs<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.359> about<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.510> dollar<00:00:30.720> eighty<00:00:31.050> eight

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that at and I also went ahead and bought

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.920 
that at and I also went ahead and bought
some<00:00:48.510> 3.5<00:00:49.469> mil<00:00:49.920> plastic<00:00:50.430> sheeting<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.660> one

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
some 3.5 mil plastic sheeting this one

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.110 
some 3.5 mil plastic sheeting this one
is<00:00:52.110> 10<00:00:52.469> feet<00:00:52.500> by<00:00:52.890> 25<00:00:53.579> feet<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.520> garden

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
is 10 feet by 25 feet so for this garden

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.900 
is 10 feet by 25 feet so for this garden
here<00:00:57.859> actually<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.100> make<00:00:59.250> probably<00:00:59.670> two<00:00:59.879> or

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
here actually I can make probably two or

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.619 
here actually I can make probably two or
three<00:01:00.289> because<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.890> only<00:01:02.180> roughly<00:01:03.180> seven

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
three because this is only roughly seven

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.620 
three because this is only roughly seven
feet<00:01:03.870> by<00:01:04.019> three<00:01:04.290> feet<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.949> at<00:01:05.159> least<00:01:05.220> get

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
feet by three feet so I can at least get

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.789 
feet by three feet so I can at least get
you<00:01:06.630> know<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.960> least<00:01:06.990> two<00:01:07.350> or<00:01:07.439> three<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:07.770> of

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you know at least two or three out of

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.120 
you know at least two or three out of
that<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.900> plastic<00:01:10.110> sheeting<00:01:10.650> was

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that one and the plastic sheeting was

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.130 
that one and the plastic sheeting was
right<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> dollar<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.180> not<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.689> terrible

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
right on a dollar so not not terrible

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.800 
right on a dollar so not not terrible
either<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.939> did<00:01:15.150> try<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> couple<00:01:15.689> different

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
either and I did try a couple different

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.850 
either and I did try a couple different
designs<00:01:16.409> first<00:01:17.210> kind<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:18.930> kind

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
designs first kind of one that was kind

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.270 
designs first kind of one that was kind
of<00:01:19.890> crisscross<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:22.950> didn't<00:01:23.220> work

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
of crisscross and that just didn't work

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
of crisscross and that just didn't work
out<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.960> kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> half<00:01:25.409> circle

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
out for kind of like the half circle

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.730 
out for kind of like the half circle
that<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.299> luckily<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.140> had<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> bunch<00:01:28.590> of

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
that I have so luckily I had a bunch of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.940 
that I have so luckily I had a bunch of
these<00:01:28.890> elbows<00:01:29.549> laying<00:01:29.850> around<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.680> a<00:01:31.680> bunch

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
these elbows laying around and a bunch

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.440 
these elbows laying around and a bunch
of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> t's<00:01:32.310> laying<00:01:32.610> around<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.240> gave

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
of the t's laying around so I just gave

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.710 
of the t's laying around so I just gave
this<00:01:33.630> design<00:01:34.020> real<00:01:34.290> quick<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.030> that's<00:01:36.030> why<00:01:36.329> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
this design real quick and that's why I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.810 
this design real quick and that's why I
have<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> middle<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.430> because

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
have one here in the middle just because

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
have one here in the middle just because
I<00:01:39.060> had<00:01:39.270> some<00:01:39.450> little<00:01:39.659> scrap<00:01:39.960> left<00:01:40.200> over<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I had some little scrap left over and I

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.429 
I had some little scrap left over and I
wanted<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.070> frame<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.270> pretty<00:01:42.450> good<00:01:42.659> so

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
wanted to frame it up pretty good so

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.109 
wanted to frame it up pretty good so
what<00:01:43.590> my<00:01:43.710> goal<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:45.079> winter<00:01:46.079> time<00:01:46.409> is

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
what my goal is for this winter time is

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.969 
what my goal is for this winter time is
to<00:01:48.119> keep<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.450> plants<00:01:48.780> alive<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
to keep the plants alive in here and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.940 
to keep the plants alive in here and
also<00:01:50.340> try<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.759> grow<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.360> some<00:01:52.229> strawberries

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
also try and grow like some strawberries

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.139 
also try and grow like some strawberries
and<00:01:53.460> see<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.119> can't<00:01:54.710> produce<00:01:55.710> some<00:01:56.189> fruit

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and see if I can't produce some fruit

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.319 
and see if I can't produce some fruit
during<00:01:57.450> wintertime<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.909> I'm<00:02:00.000> going<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.180> try

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
during wintertime so I'm going to try

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.840 
during wintertime so I'm going to try
this<00:02:00.390> design<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:02.250> how<00:02:02.340> well<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.579> works

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
this design and see how well it works

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.100 
this design and see how well it works
and<00:02:03.090> i'll<00:02:03.180> probably<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.540> an<00:02:03.659> update<00:02:03.930> video

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and i'll probably do an update video

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.800 
and i'll probably do an update video
here<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.040> there<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> let<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.549> know<00:02:05.719> you<00:02:06.719> know

here and there to let you know you know

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.270 
here and there to let you know you know
what<00:02:06.960> kind<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.229> temperatures<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.860> keeping

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
what kind of temperatures are keeping

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.190 
what kind of temperatures are keeping
and<00:02:08.610> all<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.819> good<00:02:08.940> stuff<00:02:09.000> help<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:10.020> some

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
and all that good stuff help have some

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.350 
and all that good stuff help have some
temperature<00:02:10.560> gauges<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:11.069> here<00:02:11.340> running<00:02:12.060> up<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
temperature gauges in here running up to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.120 
temperature gauges in here running up to
you<00:02:12.810> know

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
you know

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.940 
you know
top<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.520> deck<00:02:13.670> there<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.560> do<00:02:15.620> have<00:02:15.830> a

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
top of the deck there and I do have a

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.490 
top of the deck there and I do have a
question<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:19.160> I'm<00:02:19.400> not<00:02:19.580> sure<00:02:19.850> if<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.210> is

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
question and I'm not sure if this is

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.240 
question and I'm not sure if this is
practical<00:02:21.500> or<00:02:21.590> now<00:02:21.710> but<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:21.950> was<00:02:22.040> going<00:02:22.190> to

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
practical or now but I was going to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.880 
practical or now but I was going to
throw<00:02:22.280> some<00:02:22.730> big<00:02:23.330> rocks<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:24.020> here<00:02:24.320> it's<00:02:24.800> a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
throw some big rocks in here it's a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.520 
throw some big rocks in here it's a
really<00:02:25.160> big<00:02:25.400> rock<00:02:25.750> would<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.870> actually<00:02:26.930> help

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
really big rock would that actually help

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.100 
really big rock would that actually help
keep<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.190> heat<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.670> there<00:02:28.850> longer<00:02:29.120> or<00:02:29.780> should

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
keep the heat in there longer or should

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.950 
keep the heat in there longer or should
I<00:02:30.200> try<00:02:30.440> something<00:02:30.770> like<00:02:31.630> containers<00:02:32.630> filled

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
I try something like containers filled

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.010 
I try something like containers filled
with<00:02:33.200> sand<00:02:33.530> or<00:02:34.180> even<00:02:35.180> containers<00:02:35.660> filled<00:02:35.840> with

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
with sand or even containers filled with

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.340 
with sand or even containers filled with
water<00:02:36.260> if<00:02:36.620> anyone<00:02:36.920> has<00:02:37.100> any<00:02:38.350> previous

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
water if anyone has any previous

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.920 
water if anyone has any previous
knowledge<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:41.000> could<00:02:41.240> let<00:02:41.600> me<00:02:41.630> know

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
knowledge of that you could let me know

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.340 
knowledge of that you could let me know
is<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.040> helpful<00:02:44.000> at<00:02:44.270> all<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:45.020> wasting

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
is that a helpful at all I just wasting

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.410 
is that a helpful at all I just wasting
your<00:02:45.440> time<00:02:45.620> does<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.010> not<00:02:46.100> work<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.340> well<00:02:46.700> and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
your time does it not work that well and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.120 
your time does it not work that well and
I<00:02:47.840> probably<00:02:48.050> try<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.500> couple<00:02:48.740> different<00:02:48.860> things

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
I probably try a couple different things

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.890 
I probably try a couple different things
and<00:02:49.720> see<00:02:50.720> how<00:02:50.930> well<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.170> works<00:02:52.390> okay<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:53.450> here's

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
and see how well it works okay so here's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.060 
and see how well it works okay so here's
just<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.820> close-up<00:02:55.820> view<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.180> frame<00:02:57.070> and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
just a close-up view of the frame and

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.190 
just a close-up view of the frame and
you<00:02:58.280> can<00:02:58.520> tell<00:02:58.700> there's<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.090> it's<00:02:59.900> pretty

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
you can tell there's a it's pretty

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.160 
you can tell there's a it's pretty
simple<00:03:00.470> but<00:03:01.210> I'm<00:03:02.210> hoping<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.840> will<00:03:02.990> be

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
simple but I'm hoping that will be

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.280 
simple but I'm hoping that will be
effective<00:03:04.010> for<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.250> wintertime<00:03:05.290> hopefully

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
effective for the wintertime hopefully

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.710 
effective for the wintertime hopefully
it'll<00:03:06.410> hold<00:03:06.440> together<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.890> did<00:03:07.160> screw<00:03:07.720> together

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
it'll hold together I did screw together

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.550 
it'll hold together I did screw together
the<00:03:09.170> joints<00:03:10.100> there<00:03:10.960> because<00:03:11.960> we<00:03:12.110> do<00:03:12.230> get<00:03:12.410> some

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
the joints there because we do get some

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.150 
the joints there because we do get some
crazy<00:03:12.920> crazy<00:03:13.550> wind<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.900> want<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:15.920> thing<00:03:15.980> to

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
crazy crazy wind and want this thing to

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.460 
crazy crazy wind and want this thing to
stay<00:03:16.400> together<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:17.930> that's<00:03:18.110> what<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.260> looks

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
stay together so that's what it looks

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.710 
stay together so that's what it looks
like<00:03:18.650> let's<00:03:19.580> open<00:03:19.970> let<00:03:20.150> me<00:03:20.240> show<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.480> what<00:03:20.660> it

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
like let's open let me show you what it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.360 
like let's open let me show you what it
looks<00:03:20.750> like<00:03:20.930> when<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:21.200> closed<00:03:21.470> okay<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:22.190> i

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
looks like when it's closed okay so i

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.120 
looks like when it's closed okay so i
went<00:03:22.610> ahead<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.260> sealed<00:03:24.260> up<00:03:24.470> all<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.860> ends

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
went ahead and sealed up all the ends

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.390 
went ahead and sealed up all the ends
there<00:03:25.340> pretty<00:03:26.030> much<00:03:26.180> i<00:03:26.300> just<00:03:26.330> removed<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.400> top

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
there pretty much i just removed the top

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.360 
there pretty much i just removed the top
stone<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.750> stucco<00:03:30.440> plastic<00:03:30.920> underneath<00:03:31.130> it

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
stone and stucco plastic underneath it

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.910 
stone and stucco plastic underneath it
and<00:03:31.430> set<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.640> back<00:03:31.790> down<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:33.200> seems<00:03:33.830> to

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
and set it back down and it seems to

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.880 
and set it back down and it seems to
make<00:03:34.010> a<00:03:34.070> really<00:03:34.370> tight<00:03:34.550> seal<00:03:34.820> on<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.710> and<00:03:36.710> let

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
make a really tight seal on it and let

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.430 
make a really tight seal on it and let
me<00:03:37.010> show<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.160> walking<00:03:37.610> around<00:03:37.700> here<00:03:41.170> as<00:03:42.170> you

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440

can<00:03:42.560> see<00:03:42.770> in<00:03:42.830> some<00:03:43.040> spots<00:03:43.310> of<00:03:43.520> plex<00:03:43.730> plastic<00:03:44.660> is

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
can see in some spots of plex plastic is

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.710 
can see in some spots of plex plastic is
kind<00:03:45.080> of<00:03:45.170> hanging<00:03:45.380> out<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:47.330> makes<00:03:47.510> a

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
kind of hanging out so that makes a

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.320 
kind of hanging out so that makes a
really<00:03:48.050> good<00:03:48.110> seal<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.860> when<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.310> want<00:03:49.580> to<00:03:49.790> open

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
really good seal and when I want to open

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.210 
really good seal and when I want to open
it<00:03:50.390> up<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.570> water<00:03:51.230> it<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:51.740> i'll<00:03:51.920> let<00:03:52.040> good
