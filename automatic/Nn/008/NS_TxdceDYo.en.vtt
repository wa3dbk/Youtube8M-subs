I<00:00:00.299> think<00:00:01.110> it's<00:00:01.229> important<00:00:01.680> for<00:00:01.709> pharmacists

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:02.430

to be members because community pharmacy
in<00:00:04.499> particular<00:00:04.829> I<00:00:05.099> think<00:00:05.459> can<00:00:05.759> be<00:00:05.939> practiced

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
in particular I think can be practiced

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.600 
in particular I think can be practiced
in<00:00:06.660> professional<00:00:07.289> isolation<00:00:07.979> and<00:00:08.460> that

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
in professional isolation and that

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.909 
in professional isolation and that
doesn't<00:00:08.969> need<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.210> be<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.599> case<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.769> raw

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:10.919 
doesn't need to be the case the raw

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.220 
doesn't need to be the case the raw
pharmaceutical<00:00:11.669> society<00:00:11.849> can<00:00:12.540> help<00:00:12.809> connect

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
pharmaceutical society can help connect

goals and shared aspirations for
practice<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.769> I<00:00:20.010> would<00:00:20.279> say<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.910> any

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
practice so I would say that any

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
of the professional building I think

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.559 
of the professional building I think
it's<00:02:02.310> important<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.819> pharmacists<00:02:03.359> to<00:02:03.450> be

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
it's important for pharmacists to be

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.959 
it's important for pharmacists to be
members<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.139> the<00:02:04.289> societies<00:02:04.799> at<00:02:05.639> this<00:02:05.819> present

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
members of the societies at this present

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.330 
members of the societies at this present
time<00:02:06.209> is<00:02:06.359> a<00:02:06.539> huge<00:02:06.869> change<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.499> on<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.829> NHS

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
time is a huge change going on the NHS

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.880 
time is a huge change going on the NHS
and<00:02:09.260> pharmacy<00:02:10.260> really<00:02:10.440> doesn't<00:02:10.770> need<00:02:10.860> a

orders of power and like any association
these<00:02:16.450> society<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.050> only<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:17.320> strong<00:02:17.350> as<00:02:17.560> its

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
these society is only as strong as its

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.650 
these society is only as strong as its
members<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.940> needs<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.240> support<00:02:19.390> of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
members and it needs the support of

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.690 
members and it needs the support of
pharmacists<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.680> give<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.890> legitimacy<00:02:20.980> and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
strengthen its voice if you want to go

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.740 
strengthen its voice if you want to go
into<00:02:24.040> community<00:02:24.430> pharmacy<00:02:24.880> I'd<00:02:25.210> say<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:25.660> you

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
into community pharmacy I'd say that you

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.360 
into community pharmacy I'd say that you
really<00:02:25.930> do<00:02:26.050> need<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.260> stay<00:02:26.980> ahead<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.190> the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
really do need to stay ahead of the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.130 
really do need to stay ahead of the
curve<00:02:27.580> understand<00:02:28.480> what's<00:02:28.690> happening<00:02:28.960> in<00:02:29.080> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
curve understand what's happening in the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.990 
curve understand what's happening in the
marketplace<00:02:29.500> keep<00:02:30.310> abreast<00:02:30.490> of<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.820> things

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
marketplace keep abreast of the things

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.670 
marketplace keep abreast of the things
that<00:02:31.090> are<00:02:31.180> happening<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.810> really<00:02:32.470> get

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
that are happening and really get

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.050 
that are happening and really get
involved<00:02:32.920> with<00:02:33.100> associations<00:02:33.580> like<00:02:33.910> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
involved with associations like the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.510 
involved with associations like the
society<00:02:34.600> because<00:02:35.410> unless<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.920> participate

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
society because unless you participate

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.920 
society because unless you participate
you<00:02:36.610> won't<00:02:36.760> have<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.910> voice<00:02:37.150> where<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.600> matters

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
you won't have a voice where it matters

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.220 
you won't have a voice where it matters
so<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:39.760> society<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.420> an<00:02:40.600> important

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
so the society is an important

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.220 
so the society is an important
organization<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:42.340> its<00:02:43.270> importance<00:02:43.870> is

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
organization and its importance is

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.680 
organization and its importance is
partly<00:02:45.100> defined<00:02:45.490> by<00:02:45.700> how<00:02:45.970> many<00:02:46.030> members<00:02:46.390> it's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
partly defined by how many members it's

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.140 
partly defined by how many members it's
got<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.830> if<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.010> want<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.310> strong<00:02:48.580> profession

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
got so if you want a strong profession

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.130 
got so if you want a strong profession
then<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.450> really<00:02:49.660> need<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.840> strong

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
then you really need a strong

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.170 
then you really need a strong
professional<00:02:50.320> body<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:51.910> think<00:02:52.060> it's

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
professional body and I think it's

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.610 
professional body and I think it's
important<00:02:52.600> therefore<00:02:52.750> for<00:02:53.050> pharmacists<00:02:53.560> to

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
important therefore for pharmacists to

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.490 
important therefore for pharmacists to
be<00:02:53.740> members<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.070> this<00:02:54.250> one
