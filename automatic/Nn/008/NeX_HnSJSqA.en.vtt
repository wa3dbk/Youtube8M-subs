00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440
 sale of 131 meters in 2 minutes and 50 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:13.320
 second emanuela twins 131 meters of 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.320
 depth reached in two minutes and 50 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.080
 second the world record of apnea in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.810
 regulated variable asset has it 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.240
 established homar leuci Milanese athlete 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.070
 with sea of ​​Calabria in the heart months of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.710
 workouts the choice of the bay of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.199
 overwhelmed for his attempt a place 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 with features considered special 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.730
 as special and the technique used 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.430
 from uci to win the challenge 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.739
 a technique that refers to the companies of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.160
 great Enzo Majorca and today has shown 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.500
 that man and can even go to 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.820
 head down in variable position, yes 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 had been going upside down since 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.780
 majorca we say that it was a road that is 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.329
 it was a little bit abandoned by all 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.530
 I brought it back into fashion and then a 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.930
 upside down is much more difficult 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.620
 compensate because the slide goes to 2 meters 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.960
 per second 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.129
 in fact to get to 131 meters I have 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.750
 put a minute is 05 and the rest for 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.820
 get to 250 I traveled with 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.860
 I use my monofin on the ascent 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.229
 so let's say we're a bit 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.140
 precursors of a new technique of 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.490
 descent with the variable attitude that 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.350
 remember means to come down with 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.900
 the use of a weight with this case is 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.790
 30 kg is then left on the bottom and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.509
 the athlete goes back with the use of 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 own forces 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.310
 a discipline that allows you to arrive 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.320
 at truly abyssal depths vi 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.560
 I assure you that the below is really now 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.189
 why 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.710
 in the Mediterranean at 130 meters there is darkness to 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.320
 dark and cold and does not end here 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.210
 weather conditions permitting homar 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.220
 a second danger arises 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.979
 infringement in the coming days of 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.979
 bring the apnea record back to Italy 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.220
 in constant trim that in 2011 with 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:59.460
 minus 87 compared to its previous of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.090
 86 minus a burke athlete 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 next Monday
