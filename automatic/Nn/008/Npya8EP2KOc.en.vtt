00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
by looking at your surroundings and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.420 
by looking at your surroundings and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.590 
that you can be and they take that into
multiplayer<00:02:26.580> as<00:02:26.970> well<00:02:27.150> because<00:02:27.450> in

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
multiplayer as well because in

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.080 
multiplayer as well because in
multiplayer<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.320> kind<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.709> like<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.860> horde<00:02:29.400> game

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
multiplayer is kind of like a horde game

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.020 
multiplayer is kind of like a horde game
type<00:02:30.770> it's<00:02:31.770> called<00:02:31.920> Anarchy<00:02:32.550> that's<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.880> only

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
type it's called Anarchy that's the only

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.940 
type it's called Anarchy that's the only
one<00:02:33.180> I've<00:02:33.270> really<00:02:33.600> seen<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.050> far<00:02:34.350> but

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
one I've really seen so far but

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.949 
one I've really seen so far but
basically<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.880> start<00:02:35.940> off<00:02:36.239> with<00:02:36.450> waves<00:02:36.690> of

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
basically you start off with waves of

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.110 
basically you start off with waves of
people<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:37.680> not<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.190> much<00:02:38.250> about<00:02:38.430> can<00:02:39.090> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
people it's not so much about can you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.030 
people it's not so much about can you
complete<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.989> wave<00:02:40.200> or<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.800> kill<00:02:41.010> all

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
complete the wave or can you kill all

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.270 
complete the wave or can you kill all
the<00:02:41.340> enemies<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:43.019> reach<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.890> score

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
the enemies it's can you reach the score

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.699 
the enemies it's can you reach the score
limit<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.239> wave<00:02:45.540> has<00:02:45.840> set<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
limit that that wave has set so the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.290 
limit that that wave has set so the
enemies<00:02:47.220> do<00:02:47.400> get<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> little<00:02:47.820> tougher<00:02:48.030> you

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
enemies do get a little tougher you

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.610 
enemies do get a little tougher you
might<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.630> like<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.840> sniper<00:02:49.080> way<00:02:49.410> or

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
there's more facets along the way than

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.939 
there's more facets along the way than
just<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.720> one<00:04:27.780> level<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.560> they<00:04:28.710> give<00:04:28.919> you

just<00:04:38.340> like<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.610> did<00:04:38.820> in<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.180> demo<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:39.810> go

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
just like you did in the demo and go

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.620 
just like you did in the demo and go
through<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:40.710> from<00:04:41.160> point<00:04:41.520> A<00:04:41.669> to<00:04:41.699> point<00:04:41.880> B<00:04:42.180> and

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
it a epic games that would give it about

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.439 
it a epic games that would give it about
an<00:05:18.449> 8<00:05:18.599> out<00:05:18.780> of<00:05:18.810> 10<00:05:19.280> as<00:05:20.280> far<00:05:20.610> as<00:05:20.639> what<00:05:21.060> they<00:05:21.210> did

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
an 8 out of 10 as far as what they did

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.180 
an 8 out of 10 as far as what they did
there<00:05:21.599> are<00:05:21.690> some<00:05:21.840> wonky<00:05:22.080> controls<00:05:22.680> and<00:05:22.949> stuff

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
there are some wonky controls and stuff

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.420 
there are some wonky controls and stuff
like<00:05:23.400> that<00:05:23.930> so<00:05:24.930> it's<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.830> little<00:05:25.949> bit<00:05:26.070> hard<00:05:26.370> to

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
like that so it's a little bit hard to

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.800 
like that so it's a little bit hard to
get<00:05:26.639> used<00:05:26.849> to<00:05:27.120> and<00:05:27.270> there's<00:05:27.479> certain<00:05:27.780> things

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
get used to and there's certain things

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.370 
get used to and there's certain things
that<00:05:28.199> you<00:05:28.380> that<00:05:28.949> you<00:05:29.250> that<00:05:30.000> you<00:05:30.750> should<00:05:31.139> be

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
that you that you that you should be

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.560 
that you that you that you should be
doing<00:05:32.070> a<00:05:32.130> lot<00:05:32.159> easier<00:05:32.460> like<00:05:32.849> jumping<00:05:33.270> over

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
doing a lot easier like jumping over

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
doing a lot easier like jumping over
climbing<00:05:34.080> over<00:05:34.320> some

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
climbing over some

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.860 
climbing over some
I<00:05:34.620> find<00:05:35.430> is<00:05:35.640> redundant<00:05:36.210> it's<00:05:36.390> just<00:05:36.570> not<00:05:36.690> as

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
I find is redundant it's just not as

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.170 
I find is redundant it's just not as
smooth<00:05:37.650> or<00:05:37.890> fluid<00:05:38.280> is<00:05:38.400> something<00:05:38.790> like<00:05:38.910> Call

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180
