00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
was in the short zone there was some

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.490 
was in the short zone there was some
intermediate<00:03:51.600> routes<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.140> there<00:03:52.260> was<00:03:52.350> some

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
intermediate routes and there was some

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.740 
intermediate routes and there was some
deep<00:03:52.709> routes<00:03:52.950> not<00:03:53.310> many<00:03:53.670> receivers<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.450> this

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
deep routes not many receivers in this

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.080 
deep routes not many receivers in this
conference<00:03:55.170> or<00:03:55.350> in<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:56.130> kind<00:03:56.489> of<00:03:56.580> offense

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
conference or in that kind of offense

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.210 
conference or in that kind of offense
that<00:03:57.269> can<00:03:57.780> give<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.110> guy<00:03:58.440> like<00:03:58.470> Alan<00:03:59.040> Robinson

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220

that can give a guy like Alan Robinson
all<00:03:59.730> those<00:04:00.090> different<00:04:00.630> options<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.530> think

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
all those different options and I think

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:02.990 
all those different options and I think
that<00:04:01.890> was<00:04:02.040> one<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.370> things<00:04:02.519> along<00:04:02.850> with

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
that was one of the things along with

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.610 
that was one of the things along with
his<00:04:03.150> talent<00:04:03.330> that<00:04:03.810> made<00:04:03.989> him<00:04:04.110> special<00:04:04.230> and

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
his talent that made him special and

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.930 
his talent that made him special and
they<00:04:04.680> trusted<00:04:05.190> him<00:04:05.250> that's<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.700> thing<00:04:05.910> about

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
they trusted him that's the thing about

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.400 
they trusted him that's the thing about
it<00:04:06.269> thinking<00:04:06.450> about<00:04:06.630> Christian<00:04:06.959> Hackenberg

the young quarterback he would throw it

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.940 
the young quarterback he would throw it
up<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.390> Robinson<00:04:09.900> would<00:04:09.959> find<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.500> way<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.709> go

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950
