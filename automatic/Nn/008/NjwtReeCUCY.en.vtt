00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 welcome to mom channel 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.049
 today we will do 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.890
 beautiful flower hyacinth from 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.890
 corrugated paper 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:18.439
 take a strip of corrugated paper 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.580
 approximately 10 centimeters wide 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:28.470
 50 centimeters we fold it 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:31.590
 several layers to cut faster 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.430
 and cut into such enough 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.010
 thin stripes without cutting can 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.350
 be about a centimeter or a little 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.250
 slightly less 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.250
 to end 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:58.310
 we will have a tape with a lot of 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:02.220
 There are now cut petals now 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:06.660
 on some stick I have this 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:11.850
 skewer we wind each petal 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:14.690
 so that he spun here in such 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.690
 spinner 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.580
 this is done fairly quickly 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.280
 so what kind of turntables are they ? 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:40.720
 will all be different do not have to strive 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:46.210
 make them 7 the same 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:51.600
 whirling tape is obtained and here's the whole 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:55.470
 make this ribbon so whirling 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.390
 then take the skewer that will be with us 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.429
 the stem of our hyacinth 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:07.470
 and on the tip is their skewers we glue 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:10.479
 double sided tape can in principle 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.959
 smear the tip of skewers with some good 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.260
 glue 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:20.549
 which will keep corrugated 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:26.489
 paper and now our prepared 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:30.970
 curly tape we start to stick 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.390
 wrap the tip and glue 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:41.579
 double sided tape and then just 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:45.910
 we reel our curly ribbon on a skewer 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:52.600
 then we will beautifully spread all these 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:57.989
 whorls until the main thing is to wind all 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.989
 our 50 centimeters tight enough 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.989
 we press 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.159
 so we clocked up at the end 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:14.549
 the ribbon was again double-sided 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.829
 scotch and take the thread will 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.810
 wrap the stem if you have 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.609
 Corrugated green paper can 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.049
 quickly wrap the stem 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.040
 corrugated paper 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:30.689
 paper we had only thread 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:34.170
 green so we're on a two-way 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:38.849
 Scotch at first we wind this carefully 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.730
 our green thread and then along the whole 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:47.250
 skewers sticks we wind this 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:50.639
 the thread at first will slowly can 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.189
 be a job to progress but then you 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:59.189
 light you will twist this wand and 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:04:04.159
 quickly wind the thread here so quickly 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:07.530
 and not beautifully wound . 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:12.169
 at the end of the wand we will use again 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:17.310
 double sided tape or 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:23.250
 we glue it and fix it 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:26.930
 way the thread at the end of the stick 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:33.630
 can be used as a stem 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:37.260
 ballpoint paste or perhaps 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:41.750
 you have strong wire 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:45.090
 I had this 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:50.310
 skewer now we are preparing a pot for 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.830
 of our hyacinth we take a jar of me 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.040
 a jar of baby food a piece 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.780
 plasticine we crush it a little 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.140
 not necessary because we will be in it 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.810
 stick our hyacinth and prepare leaves 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.190
 better if you have double sided 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.410
 colored paper 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.990
 but we only had one party 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.290
 cut 2 leaves one bigger one another 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:24.360
 smaller and wrap the stalk like this 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:28.680
 Hyacinth and stick plasticine plasticine 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.729
 then it will harden and the hyacinth will 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.380
 nice to keep in shape 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:39.240
 fill the jar with dry flowers 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:43.169
 balls can soft wrapping paper 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.350
 put there and wrap to 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:49.940
 turned out beautiful 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:52.820
 pot the next video we will do 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.950
 2 flower 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.020
