00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:15.439
 use and touch 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.480
 a quarter of the population 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.529
 and of Italian origin 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.050
 the immigrants arrive with the promise of work and they meet 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.050
 with a harsh reality 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.499
 bid 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.499

 They also fight for the development of a modern art in Argentina 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 reinaldo giúdici chile 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.920

 It is exposed in 1887 in the bossi house of buenos aires 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.430
 the fight is a success 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.430
 yuri chillán wants great prestige 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.920
 the work represents 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 urban poverty 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.660
 around a charity bonfire 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.150
 they congregate 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.150
 it was possible 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.080
 covered with suits with patches 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.430
 leaning against peace 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.440
 and very far from a home with amenities 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.400
 despite the subject 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.520
 From the first moment 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 while it is considered that the work is destined 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.190
 but nevertheless 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.440
 ends exposed in the presidential office 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.440

 Ernesto de la Carcova 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.640
 begins to paint his work without bread and without work 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.670
 in Italy 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.690
 and the good air ends 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.690
 the work is exhibited in 1894 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.789
 between the sketch made in europe 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.129
 and the finished work in Argentina 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.839
 you can notice intentionality 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.619
 mikati who was broken 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:22.809
 in the grosseto 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:28.069
 the worker looks with frustration thus even more fluid where appears a 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.069
 factory in operation 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.379
 in the finished version 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.569
 bad pay without work 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.309

 inside a room 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.810
 the man looks out the window at a factory yard 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.789
 a hazy exterior 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.789
 lets intuit that a strike is taking place 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.439
 and that there are forces that want to prevent 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:04.519
 the worker has the fist of his hand closed 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.519
 with an energetic gesture he said 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.100
 While 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.209
 used to work 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.209
 the Nicaraguan poet rubén darío ortiz 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.579
 beyond the Carcova 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.509
 I am a socialist 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:26.019
 his staff does not explain it to me because of the passion for the new ones and he kisses him 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.400
 his socialism revealed by vigorous and courageous activity 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.659
 without bread and without work it has its origin and then gave innate 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:38.389
 the intellectual 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.829
