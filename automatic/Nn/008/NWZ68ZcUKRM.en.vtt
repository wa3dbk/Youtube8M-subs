00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.300
 in between i had when i present i 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.379
 and then a few chokers came across 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.660
 I don't have people who say that 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.090
 done so that would be the disadvantaged 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.570
 Must be people who job that way 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.490
 pathetic people there are people who like that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.050
 boy as no sports athletes 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.009
 a bit poorly dressed nowhere 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.440
 go there but is very enjoyable with 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.219
 boys is like a crossroads 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.920
 and what not immediately 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.430
 able to cross 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.280
 then then stop that I assume 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.219
 but that is not yet with your eyes and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.030
 sisters our care double hearing purpose 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.410
 done what it is that men can and 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.239
 how the light to red easier on 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.390
 a light already standing still so that I 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.859
 the function should be like that but it is 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.689
 very pleasant because if done with the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.250
 lotto bases then have to stop 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.900
 you have to stop so stop and tenderness 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.159
 stick over and then give gas to him 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.630
 don't drive 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.009
 who they he the words words that show 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.720
 once done the earth down 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.330
 and the employee comes in 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.890
 and tissue boxes can say they stun 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.350
 bed in the room so you can ie yes yes yes 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.360
 No but if an axis for my deaf 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.060
 Deaf people who come sometimes 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.799
 arrogant or a bit ambitious about that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.259
 is yes yes i know but i know 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.600
 meanwhile why most deaf 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.310
 we can understand that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.680
 nick you this from most deaf people 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.110
 herman lived so who walked that room 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.390
 can understand us as we simply 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.100
 all a bit would tidy 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.140
 articulate pipa monument 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.490
 reason it is very normal that if they 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.590
 also have something to say 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.689
 if they are the answer he is on that 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.759
 moment also think of tomorrow then I will 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.170
 make it once difficult and basic 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.229
 just check how it works 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.300
 this is it is whole or imagine the kon 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.550
 the new employee inside and it is one 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.390
 The oboe the good who always see 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.390
 can always check 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.599
 no i just ask ask one 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.560
 fart left because the 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:28.140
 you can go to the gay on the eleventh 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.480
 so I want to come be one too 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.310
 number of older employees who redo it 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.680
 can come to the workplace in that 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.739
 Case must on as those people can sometimes 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.019
 not much against my grandma 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.550
 which took about every week until last week 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.640
 day he took the bus 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.640
 took the bus every day but once her 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.120
 Broken 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.200
 really really ff they check those things 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.480
 ladies and gentlemen it is very important 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.459
 that you promote diversity in your 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.410
 syndical effect ensure that it still 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.780
 Really never want to bart the weaver 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.700
 yes yes yes guests cast she goes off with the 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.470
 constitution men much different metal look 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.299
 probable because the constitution is mo 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.459
 30 clash then that goes from bart him 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.079
 just help 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.090
 so we start an inverted pinocchio 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.650
 we know the more edible he is 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.670
 the more time his face lies 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.670
 glowed above the nose 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.480
 but so you can really really cheap 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.209
 promoting diversity is important 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.799
 to create support because with 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.200
 diversity with a diversity policy 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.540
 it is just the opposite as with 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.010
 crocs and three-quarter trousers 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.620
 so very important that it is worn 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.790
 you will have to hang on slogans 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.680
 posters 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.519
 is quite cheap and there but should 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.230
 slogans are what everyone thinks yes 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.790
 so that is ambitious because you see the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.620
 me all people who work floor 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.150
 think different things and then 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.640
 must make the slow of which 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.780
 everyone thinks yes i have shoes slogan 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.910
 fallen wrong gays because the gay haters 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.530
 they have something like yes indeed and the 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.530
 gays think good 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.819
 also a very cool slogan for the 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.459
 workplace is also good for everyone there 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:21.280
 no prejudices against it 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:24.070
 dumb women and beauty who 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.490
 those by naked women understand that anyway 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.490
 to 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.050
 swolgen li forget a checklist yet 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.050
 to fill in once
