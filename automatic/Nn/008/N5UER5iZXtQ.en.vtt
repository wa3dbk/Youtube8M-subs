improving that my time and my focus was
on<00:01:20.830> two<00:01:21.310> things<00:01:21.610> that<00:01:21.790> were<00:01:21.850> really<00:01:21.880> important

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
on two things that were really important

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.820 
on two things that were really important
to<00:01:22.600> me<00:01:22.720> that<00:01:22.750> I<00:01:22.960> didn't<00:01:23.290> have<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.410> whole<00:01:23.620> lot<00:01:23.800> of

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
to me that I didn't have a whole lot of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.980 
to me that I didn't have a whole lot of
time<00:01:24.100> for<00:01:24.790> hanging<00:01:25.150> out<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:25.600> doing<00:01:25.750> things

time for hanging out and doing things

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.690 
time for hanging out and doing things
that<00:01:26.260> was<00:01:26.380> not<00:01:26.590> right<00:01:26.830> so<00:01:27.250> I<00:01:27.310> always<00:01:27.580> encourage

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
that was not right so I always encourage

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.670 
that was not right so I always encourage
kids<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.450> play<00:01:28.720> sports<00:01:29.080> because<00:01:29.410> you're<00:01:29.560> more

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
kids to play sports because you're more

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.410

not<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.810> get<00:01:32.110> incarcerated<00:01:32.410> or<00:01:32.890> go<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.100> jail

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
not to get incarcerated or go to jail

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.010 
not to get incarcerated or go to jail
you're<00:01:33.670> more<00:01:33.820> likely<00:01:34.000> not<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.390> go<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:34.570> juvenile

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
wanted to represent my family my mom and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
my sisters and I didn't want to do

anything that will damage my family name

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.150 
anything that will damage my family name
I<00:02:26.910> think<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> other<00:02:27.810> thing<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:29.010> want

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
I think the other thing is that you want

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.830 
I think the other thing is that you want
to<00:02:29.250> be<00:02:29.340> successful<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.090> can't<00:02:30.510> do<00:02:30.690> that

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
to be successful and you can't do that

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:39.290 
to be successful and you can't do that
if<00:02:30.990> you're<00:02:31.020> doing<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.440> wrong<00:02:31.590> things

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.570 

when<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.900> comes<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.500> sacrificing<00:02:41.400> like

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
when it comes to sacrificing like

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.670 
when it comes to sacrificing like
partying<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.630> hanging<00:02:42.810> out<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.290> drinking

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
partying and hanging out and drinking

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.200 
partying and hanging out and drinking
alcohol<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.430> things<00:02:44.610> like<00:02:44.760> that

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
alcohol and things like that

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.120 
alcohol and things like that
that's<00:02:45.540> things<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.170> cannot<00:02:46.590> do<00:02:46.830> if<00:02:46.980> you

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
that's things that you cannot do if you

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.160 
that's things that you cannot do if you
want<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.400> truly<00:02:47.550> be<00:02:47.790> successful<00:02:47.820> my<00:02:48.690> cousin

you<00:02:49.350> know<00:02:49.430> uncle's<00:02:50.430> different<00:02:50.820> people<00:02:51.090> have

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
you know uncle's different people have

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.140 
you know uncle's different people have
chosen<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.960> do<00:02:52.170> drugs<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.670> hasn't<00:02:54.030> been<00:02:54.090> a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
chosen to do drugs and it hasn't been a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.210 
chosen to do drugs and it hasn't been a
positive<00:02:54.420> effect<00:02:54.990> so<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.440> would<00:02:55.830> just<00:02:55.980> say

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
positive effect so I would just say

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.420 
positive effect so I would just say
don't<00:02:56.670> try<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:58.110> think<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.740> does<00:02:58.770> really

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
don't try it I think it does really

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.250 
don't try it I think it does really
affect<00:02:59.610> your<00:02:59.970> life<00:03:00.240> in<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.600> very<00:03:00.630> negative<00:03:01.020> way

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
