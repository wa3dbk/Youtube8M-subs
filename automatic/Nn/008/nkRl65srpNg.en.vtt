 paranaguá is known to me for incredible 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.430
 It seems I do not know Paraguay. 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.400
 I really do not believe, but I already wondered. 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.670

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.900
 We knew it was for a lifetime. 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:17.360
 paths take different paths 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.720
 It had to be you, the love, found us. 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:27.740
 but one day the river meets the sea 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.740
 I'm here for us to continue. 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:39.810

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:42.840
 braun wanting it seemed forbidden 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:49.630
 Only God had written long ago.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:58.810
 today the course of time made sense for 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.690
 to want it seemed forbidden 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:08.190
 Only God had written long ago. 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.190
 time we would be the leaf 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.409

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.209
 and give a hug 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:32.760
 in July paranaguá registers can yield 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.770
 Speak now, watch out, it's not there. 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.190
 like nothing, do not like nobody 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.960
 Single is thank goodness came out of the closet 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.510
 the bit will not come out that 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.300
 That's history was traveling at carnival 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.060
 It hurts, it was traveling at carnival. 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.220
 accompanied with whom it has good because 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.060
 You started playing the ball but in 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.830
 Bragança is playing. 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.260
 doing what I can not do in that 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.510
 schedule 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.880
 I can not speak the afternoon program, no. 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.480
 go to the register 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.540
 my dear to rafael steps 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:14.280
 it starts like this it goes flashes I do not have 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:19.830
 doubt that you may become 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:24.870
 a good singer is not the moment 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:33.260
 because because you are do not do this 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:33.260
 same axis to you from the kiss of my boredom 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:44.520
 rafael our the facim we dream kinetic 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.530
 balanced than rafael because you 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.980
 not yet a good singer because you 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:53.370
 commits a series of slips in terms of 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:58.830
 tonality and especially its 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:01.260
 marked defect is in the extension of the 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.500
 end of a sentence for example when 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.750
 you speak the green word in the air you give 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.560
 this prolongation and you leave outside 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.840
 semitons of course my opinion of mine 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.240
 expensive raul gil is also successful in 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.670
 dream word you commit this same 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.310
 Allen then so mistakes are things that 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.920
 you will correct when you have made a 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:27.180
 singing course for about a 14 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.120
 15 years nor ary toledo valley toledo speak 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.800
 he is I want is the following noé 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.740
 at first it was bad then it was 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.650
 improving a little and what the régis spoke 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.770
 I'm so sorry, I agree with him and you. 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.440
 has 1 70 mins to continue then continue 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.120
 that your voice is pleasant and 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.020
 the first time he introduced himself and 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.060
 in me for example a good impression 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:58.340
 So I also found it very 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:58.340
 cool I think I found it there too
