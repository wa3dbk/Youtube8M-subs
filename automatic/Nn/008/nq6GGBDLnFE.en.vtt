00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.529
 in the warm stadium the 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.840
 single game against blue cross tie at 0 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.430
 goals what set off the passion of the 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.230
 screamed goal in the warm stadium 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.850
 let's go here with the declare write 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.800
 our part of the technicians Daniel 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.160
 normal on the part of your good has 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.290
 skipping triples by cross or if 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.079
 it will be a very tight game two teams 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.530
 well-placed very orderly 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.050
 and dynamic 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.930
 the match locked the midfield was the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.750
 match of a goal goes away on the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.610
 I scored the winning goal but there were few 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.070
 goal options really and the few 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.870
 that there were not so clear was locked 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.880
 the midfield match defensively the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.600
 teams behaved well 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.150
 and I think in the end it's just the draw 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.770
 that you give a little for tijuana with the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.140
 quality of games that live 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.060
 and they wrote down we could not leave any 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.950
 space to go they also knew that 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.799
 we have very players 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.689
 dangerous and also definitely 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.539
 they behaved very well very neat 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.619
 then unfortunately for the festa 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.390
 with the match it got stuck and it tends to be 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.020
 a game that we have to have a lot 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.310
 patience when attacking if they saw 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.920
 we control the ball from 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.500
 our departure wanting to take that 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.939
 initiative and that protagonism and attack 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.759
 in an orderly manner but without 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.590
 to neglect us back and it felt I think 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.380
 that about 90 minutes was a great suspense 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.959
 until the same bench and I felt I was going to 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.310
 to be a goal or to commit a 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.579
 mistake I think the rival was going to 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.530
 capitalize and I think that was what 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.750
 spent 90 minutes we wanted to make the goal 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.720
 but without neglecting back what they 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.780
 they have skillful quick players 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.030
 well nothing was missing something good without a doubt 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.590
 always when one comes to play from 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.810
 local has the illusion of getting the three 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.670
 nearby points on our court like 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.590
 we did it at the time in the match 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.350
 passed against saints the rival also 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.580
 account if you do not get the points of 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.860
 local you have to go and look for 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.470
 visitor against monterrey on paper 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.050
 It looked impossible but what I felt 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.420
 inside this dressing room we have the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.490
 illusion of going to stop in Monterrey and 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.810
 draw the three points in what 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.810
 We need to wait for a 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.700
 rating by Javier Güemes 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.320
 he talked about his call to the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.270
 national team under the command of 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.550
 miguel el piojo herrera because it showed 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.200
 pleased the different player others with 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.989
 his statements 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.840
 thank you very much happy is a great 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.870
 illusion and we take it in the best way 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.170
 we are prepared for that 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.909
 for me it's the best time I think 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.230
 this is a great football moment and 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:05.480
 comes for me at the right time 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.489
 obviously with great joy and calm 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.780
 because it's something I 've worked for 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.650
 a lot and that's a better goal I 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.630
 I did not speak with Miguel 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.900
 the opportunity but 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.820
 I think that at the time I will do it and I will try 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.150
 to adapt to the city of fire at 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.130
 that what he seeks from me the same as 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.320
 has been contributing with only one javier 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.490
 güemes hardened cairns that is not a 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.470
 ball for lost 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.750
 and that will defend the shirt of his 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.150
 country to death really is a 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.960
 very big responsibility represent 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.060
 your country 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.690
 and I think it will also represent your 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.970
 club in national team is double the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.690
 commitment and we have to do it from the 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.690
 better way 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.610
 inculcate what 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.590
 show us here values ​​what is 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.380
 the identity of this club brought to 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.450
 conducted by Blue Cross spoke 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.610
 mariana for mona near the next 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.380
 He holds meeting in team 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.240
 celestial machine against the team the 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.760
 america classic young championship 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.950
 Mexican knows to beat America 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.989
 It will be vital because it puts them back 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.549
 account also in fight in a position by 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.139
 the day then the hunger that year 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.889
 find classified to 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.889
 eliminatory 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:29.030
 for close what is the eighth can 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:34.820
 find is what we could not achieve 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:37.230
 but we know that it is difficult and for 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.110
 that the point is not 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.540
 or know little we do not have to beat them 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.820
 America is going to be a tough opponent because 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.440
 well, it 's super-leader but if we want 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.750
 make it good this point we have thought 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.300
 that today we had one with our point 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.890
 because we came from winning Leon and 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.840
 we wanted to continue in this uprising but 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.850
 good also knew that I had going 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.470
 to be easy to connect almost the same 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.270
 feeling that we as to point 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.840
 in terms of wanting to classify the 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.950
 liguilla so beyond that 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.020
 we wanted the three points we are also 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.910
 conscious that it was like very even and what 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.910
 more fair was the tie as it was not 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.430
 imparted to us very important 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.380
 we do not know how difficult it is to superlider 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.180
 but beyond that we have to 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.820
 stay with the three points if 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.120
 we want to have a chance to classify the 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.130
 Anyway liguilla then we have to 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.950
 go out and win the game with images of 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.700
