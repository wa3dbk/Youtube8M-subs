00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.589
 like i thought it is a battle hall sixth 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.329
 the book of the main cycle is my favorite book 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.140
 a succession wrote aluminum and on real 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.619
 great everything is just wonderful 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.970
 interesting story and my favorite scenes 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.050
 deaths are words that are business 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.899
 gets 9 life leader it was 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.289
 the triumph of life itself if we talk about 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.000
 favorite characters it is probably worth 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.710
 econometrics book the whole secret is like 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.879
 rule children became cats abandoning 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.600
 their children to be able to 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.339
 satisfy your ambitions and there was 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.230
 are there so many real feelings 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.409
 sad and then I thought that if 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.769
 I'll ever write a bigger scene 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.620
 people just extraordinary 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.170
 I tried to bring you to life 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.880
 had difficulty writing scenes in 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.250
 which heroes perish or 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.499
 mutilate when never in my life 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.100
 this is the most interesting 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.229
 No, of course it does not kill the present 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.400
 the practice of equipped cats cosmetics 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.770
 such a huge source of sadness 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.750
 source of feelings 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.220
 have we have going on is not easy 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.000
 and for various reasons sometimes for 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.540
 plot development to the same do not forget 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.870
 that there are private clinics even with such 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.100
 example he disappears forever after 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.740
 still used in plot 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.560
 will just play for my benefit 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.340
 what is the scene in the books and what is the saddest 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.820
 I think closely by the author of Pete cyc 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.159
 himself the beginning of the book but when unknown 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.630
 the window will know that the famous will die soon 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.570
 the coach is also upset by this they say we are not 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.400
 can you help we will be there for me too 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.160
 really got this scene 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.670
 I wrote that moment when they put me 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.860
 very serious diagnosis if she has 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.869
 even the subtleties of feeling that experienced 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.550
 then I was petrified and nothing 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.540
 I feel the detachment of ships are powerless 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.479
 understand how stunned I am and 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.500
 looted 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.940
 all this I wrote in the book fortunately neither 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.920
 it became better a gangster and a murderer she lived 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.630
 I know a whole book will die soon if it 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.400
 nobody suffered about it and then died 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.180
 I understand that it is inevitable 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.950
 guys beautiful death idea to lean 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.849
 major trends 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.969
 what will happen next in cash 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.260
 when still playing chooses turns neither 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.999
 it's not a secret to anyone that I am already starting to write 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.079
 fourth church signs spears on 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.629
 in fact the first two books are already finished I 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.219
 already much ahead of those books that 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.650
 consider lays very sophisticated 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.769
 often these cameras are a book written 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.519
 about 17 months ago i always forget what 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.739
 well there occurs a replacement known in 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.780
 half generation census 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.760
 and in the bridge of Monsara activities 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.840
 and Australian as the main character 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.770
 but at the same time it is others 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.840
 characters team already turns out that 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.890
 there is a gap between cycles but it is not 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.140
 as big as between the rest and 300 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.920
 there are so many unsolved mysteries
