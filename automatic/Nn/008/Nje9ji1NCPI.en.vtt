00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.559
 You will complain about the concrete problem . 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.269
 but it's the first step he needs 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.010
 choose what to see with the most 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.180
 program's face can run the acts of the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.170
 doctor 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.390
 at the time I found it and a half- contradictory rhythm 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.510
 from within to get used to a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.340
 travel with the aerial worker 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.790
 and work of about 30 people of the same 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.800
 coherence posture since nelson will know 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.420
 he said the quality is a can is in 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.629
 latest information about july 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.629
 But we think it's a speck. 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.430
 on the page of the newspaper and material of the mother 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:58.230
 think more on rains come to the championship 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:06.960
 hope we are even more prepared 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:11.310
 one will be the rap and the value yes will 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.610
 ask him is the difference of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.520
 basketball schools 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.540
 You have already been chosen. 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.540
 I'm Basque 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.520
 what worries us and this difference is 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.890
 he thought that the Brazilian teams 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.890
 mainly pine trees had a volume 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.950
 Three - point is so high is a style 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.430
 that they have not gone so far as to 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:44.140
 my sincere because since it's apple 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:47.470
 natalie all the autos 11 3 points 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:53.320
 amy and just did not know or not 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:56.080
 children of my color around us 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.620
 previous January this difference however 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.930
 is about pruning and if it really was a 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.590
 difference we did not expect 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.360
 understanding points of three points in the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.890
 cutting board to finance the liberation 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.230
 Y our desire in the call is a type of game 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:20.340

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:24.010
 hard to stop them canada and the dumb dump 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.610

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.300
 here complete should wait this is a day 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.180
 very good this is a sample used 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:39.280
 in latin america is a great example 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:44.170
 play better with capital increase of the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.170
 and the game was a slower pace 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:56.680
 aimar plays against the team came time 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.680
