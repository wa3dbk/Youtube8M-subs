exercise you see my muscles my cheek
muscles<00:02:51.850> moving<00:02:52.850> that's<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.870> exercise<00:02:54.140> so

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
muscles moving that's the exercise so

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.560 
muscles moving that's the exercise so
let's<00:02:54.830> try<00:02:55.220> this<00:02:55.280> again<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.090> am<00:02:56.240> so<00:02:56.360> used<00:02:56.510> to

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
let's try this again so I am so used to

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.890 
let's try this again so I am so used to
doing<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.900> other<00:02:57.020> exercise<00:02:58.000> okay

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.690 

now<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.960> really<00:03:03.260> want<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.590> isolate<00:03:04.190> this

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
now I really want you to isolate this

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.970 
now I really want you to isolate this
area<00:03:05.210> here<00:03:05.870> with<00:03:06.050> your<00:03:06.170> forefinger<00:03:06.680> because

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
area here with your forefinger because

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.220 
area here with your forefinger because
as<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.400> lift<00:03:07.610> your<00:03:07.820> muscle<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.570> does<00:03:08.840> tend<00:03:09.140> to

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
as you lift your muscle it does tend to

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.780 
as you lift your muscle it does tend to
crinkle<00:03:09.530> quite<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.860> lot<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.340> need<00:03:10.640> to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
crinkle quite a lot so you need to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.280 
crinkle quite a lot so you need to
really<00:03:11.270> isolate<00:03:11.720> those<00:03:12.380> quite<00:03:13.250> firmly<00:03:14.290> it

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
really isolate those quite firmly it

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.410 
really isolate those quite firmly it
actually<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.740> a<00:03:15.770> much<00:03:16.010> more<00:03:16.670> comfortable<00:03:16.970> way

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
actually is a much more comfortable way

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.260 
actually is a much more comfortable way
to<00:03:17.480> do<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.840> cheek<00:03:18.050> lifter<00:03:18.820> okay<00:03:19.820> let's<00:03:20.090> give

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
to do the cheek lifter okay let's give

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:41.090 
to do the cheek lifter okay let's give
it<00:03:20.300> a<00:03:20.390> go

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.150 

and<00:03:41.190> really<00:03:42.150> squeeze<00:03:42.450> these<00:03:43.290> cheek<00:03:43.740> muscles

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
and really squeeze these cheek muscles

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.270 
and really squeeze these cheek muscles
now<00:03:44.850> as<00:03:45.000> we<00:03:45.120> spoke<00:03:45.360> before<00:03:45.950> these<00:03:46.950> cheek

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
now as we spoke before these cheek

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.520 
now as we spoke before these cheek
muscles<00:03:47.700> will<00:03:48.330> get<00:03:48.450> Dornan<00:03:48.810> out<00:03:48.960> these<00:03:49.380> are

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
muscles will get Dornan out these are

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.840 
muscles will get Dornan out these are
the<00:03:49.560> muscles<00:03:49.770> we're<00:03:50.040> moving<00:03:50.250> here<00:03:50.430> there's<00:03:50.670> I

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
the muscles we're moving here there's I

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.680 
the muscles we're moving here there's I
go<00:03:51.090> magic<00:03:51.540> muscles<00:03:52.200> along<00:03:52.650> here<00:03:53.210> we're<00:03:54.210> using

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
go magic muscles along here we're using

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.720 
go magic muscles along here we're using
the<00:03:55.020> levitated<00:03:55.650> muscles<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.100> certain<00:03:56.490> point

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
the levitated muscles to a certain point

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.280 
the levitated muscles to a certain point
on<00:03:56.880> our<00:03:56.940> nose<00:03:57.240> but<00:03:57.570> we<00:03:57.660> don't<00:03:57.870> want<00:03:57.990> to<00:03:58.050> lift

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
on our nose but we don't want to lift

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.560 
on our nose but we don't want to lift
our<00:03:58.470> nose<00:03:58.680> we<00:03:58.980> want<00:03:59.520> to<00:03:59.610> squeeze<00:04:00.090> these

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
our nose we want to squeeze these

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.030 
our nose we want to squeeze these
muscles<00:04:01.110> along<00:04:01.320> here<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:02.460> getting<00:04:03.240> our<00:04:04.040> our

once more with the hand place where the

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.000 
once more with the hand place where the
new<00:04:30.600> hand<00:04:30.840> placement<00:04:31.260> saw<00:04:31.350> we<00:04:31.440> put<00:04:31.890> our

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
new hand placement saw we put our

really really plant them there because

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.970 
really really plant them there because
as<00:04:38.370> you're<00:04:38.580> lifting<00:04:38.700> it<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.210> going<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.600> cause

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
as you're lifting it is going to cause

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.360 
as you're lifting it is going to cause
the<00:04:40.980> wrinkling<00:04:41.310> of<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:42.110> of<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:44.160> cheek

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
the wrinkling of that of the cheek

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.360 
the wrinkling of that of the cheek
muscles<00:04:44.760> of<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.180> skin<00:04:45.530> okay<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:46.590> really<00:04:47.010> plant

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
muscles of the skin okay so really plant

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.930 
muscles of the skin okay so really plant
them<00:04:47.520> there

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
them there

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.060 
them there
make<00:04:48.480> sure<00:04:48.720> your<00:04:48.930> middle<00:04:49.350> fingers<00:04:49.740> are<00:04:49.860> right

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.220 

now<00:05:07.440> I'm<00:05:07.590> lifting<00:05:08.300> alone<00:05:09.300> from<00:05:09.690> here<00:05:09.930> as<00:05:10.020> well

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
now I'm lifting alone from here as well

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.520 
now I'm lifting alone from here as well
and<00:05:10.820> initiating<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.910> movement<00:05:11.940> from<00:05:12.930> this

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
and initiating the movement from this

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.820 
and initiating the movement from this
area<00:05:13.949> is<00:05:14.130> also<00:05:14.730> moving<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:16.169> zygomaticus

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
area is also moving the zygomaticus

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.770 
area is also moving the zygomaticus
muscles<00:05:17.190> along<00:05:17.520> here<00:05:17.880> so<00:05:18.330> you're<00:05:18.479> squeezing

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
muscles along here so you're squeezing

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.010 
muscles along here so you're squeezing
up<00:05:19.410> from<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.949> jaw<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.400> you're<00:05:20.880> squeezing<00:05:21.389> out

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
up from the jaw and you're squeezing out

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.500 
up from the jaw and you're squeezing out
this<00:05:22.680> way<00:05:22.889> your<00:05:23.370> muscle<00:05:23.699> says<00:05:23.910> I<00:05:24.060> go<00:05:24.120> Medicus

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
this way your muscle says I go Medicus

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.790 
this way your muscle says I go Medicus
muscles<00:05:24.870> ok

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
muscles ok

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.000 
muscles ok
so<00:05:26.070> that's<00:05:26.430> how<00:05:26.729> you<00:05:27.090> do<00:05:27.270> this<00:05:27.389> exercise<00:05:28.010> so

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
so that's how you do this exercise so

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.379 
so that's how you do this exercise so
there's<00:05:29.250> a<00:05:29.340> finger<00:05:29.610> placements<00:05:30.090> there<00:05:30.240> new

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
there's a finger placements there new

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.500 
there's a finger placements there new
ones<00:05:30.600> for<00:05:30.840> you<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:32.160> use<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:32.669> would<00:05:33.180> like<00:05:33.360> you

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
to do that in front of the mirror first

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.550 
to do that in front of the mirror first
get<00:05:35.520> used<00:05:35.880> to<00:05:36.030> doing<00:05:36.180> your<00:05:36.720> finger<00:05:37.110> placements

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
get used to doing your finger placements

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.710 
get used to doing your finger placements
with<00:05:37.740> that<00:05:37.979> because<00:05:38.639> you<00:05:38.760> need<00:05:39.030> to<00:05:39.210> learn<00:05:39.419> how

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
with that because you need to learn how

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.440 
with that because you need to learn how
to<00:05:40.020> isolate<00:05:40.470> these<00:05:41.370> muscles<00:05:41.910> when<00:05:42.270> you're

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
to isolate these muscles when you're

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.629 
to isolate these muscles when you're
lifting<00:05:42.570> you<00:05:43.350> need<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:43.650> know<00:05:43.830> how<00:05:44.400> your

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
lifting you need to know how your

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.300 
lifting you need to know how your
fingers<00:05:45.060> are<00:05:45.270> moving<00:05:46.110> with<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.979> muscle

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
fingers are moving with the muscle

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.830 
fingers are moving with the muscle
because<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.639> muscle<00:05:48.000> moves<00:05:48.240> in<00:05:48.419> a<00:05:48.510> certain

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
because the muscle moves in a certain

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.960 
because the muscle moves in a certain
configuration<00:05:49.020> and<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:50.280> fingers<00:05:50.700> might<00:05:50.940> be

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
configuration and the fingers might be

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.050 
configuration and the fingers might be
sliding<00:05:51.479> up<00:05:51.600> and<00:05:51.660> down<00:05:51.780> so<00:05:52.229> as<00:05:52.470> you<00:05:53.040> learn<00:05:53.580> this

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
sliding up and down so as you learn this

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.180 
sliding up and down so as you learn this
exercise<00:05:54.540> you<00:05:54.690> need<00:05:54.870> to<00:05:54.930> just<00:05:55.169> work<00:05:55.560> out<00:05:55.830> how

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
exercise you need to just work out how

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.580 
exercise you need to just work out how
your<00:05:56.460> fingers<00:05:56.820> are<00:05:56.940> moving<00:05:56.970> with<00:05:57.479> it<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:57.840> then

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
your fingers are moving with it and then

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.310 
your fingers are moving with it and then
in<00:05:59.030> that<00:06:00.030> way<00:06:00.210> if<00:06:00.389> you<00:06:00.510> do<00:06:00.720> that<00:06:00.900> then<00:06:01.139> you'll

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
in that way if you do that then you'll

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.870 
in that way if you do that then you'll
be<00:06:01.440> able<00:06:01.560> to<00:06:01.710> learn<00:06:01.830> to<00:06:02.010> isolate<00:06:02.520> all<00:06:02.729> the

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
be able to learn to isolate all the

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.330 
be able to learn to isolate all the
