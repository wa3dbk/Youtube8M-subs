to a one of my youtube videos where I

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.520 
to a one of my youtube videos where I
talked<00:00:07.319> about<00:00:07.700> removing<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:09.320> the<00:00:10.320> heater

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
talked about removing the the heater

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.499 
talked about removing the the heater
unit<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.190> MGB<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:13.790> the<00:00:14.790> reply<00:00:15.330> was

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
unit of the MGB and the reply was

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.040 
unit of the MGB and the reply was
something<00:00:15.900> along<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.350> lines<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:17.930> you<00:00:18.930> know<00:00:18.960> I

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
something along the lines of you know I

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.710 
something along the lines of you know I
can<00:00:19.289> feel<00:00:22.519> the<00:00:23.519> hot<00:00:23.699> coolant<00:00:24.000> feels<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:24.570> it's

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
can feel the hot coolant feels like it's

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.109 
can feel the hot coolant feels like it's
coming<00:00:24.980> through<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.220> end<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:26.580> not<00:00:26.760> coming

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
coming through one end but not coming

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.060 
coming through one end but not coming
out<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> other<00:00:27.420> heater<00:00:28.109> isn't<00:00:28.470> working<00:00:28.830> I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
out the other heater isn't working I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.490 
out the other heater isn't working I
guess<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> first<00:00:29.789> question<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:33.500> when

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
guess the first question I have is when

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.260 
guess the first question I have is when
you<00:00:34.590> flip<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> switch<00:00:34.980> does<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.000> sound<00:00:36.180> like

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you flip the switch does it sound like

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.680 
you flip the switch does it sound like
the<00:00:36.450> blowers<00:00:36.750> running<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:38.420> do<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.480> hear<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the blowers running so do you hear the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.010 
the blowers running so do you hear the
fan<00:00:39.930> come<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.040> any<00:00:41.780> hot<00:00:42.780> air<00:00:42.930> or

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
fan come on this is any hot air or

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.240 
fan come on this is any hot air or
anything<00:00:43.350> come<00:00:43.649> out<00:00:44.300> if<00:00:45.300> no<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.680> could<00:00:46.980> be

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
anything come out if no it could be

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
anything come out if no it could be
could<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.120> bad<00:00:48.329> bad<00:00:50.629> electrical<00:00:51.629> connection

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
could be a bad bad electrical connection

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.630 
could be a bad bad electrical connection
to<00:00:52.110> your<00:00:52.350> blower<00:00:52.590> or<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.129> could<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> bed

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
to your blower or it could be the bed

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.979 
to your blower or it could be the bed
floor<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.980> think<00:00:55.980> one<00:00:56.280> way<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.430> test<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.180> would

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
floor I think one way to test it would

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.219 
floor I think one way to test it would
just<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.690> unplug<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:03.719> electrical

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
just be to unplug it the electrical

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.789 
just be to unplug it the electrical
connection<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:06.110> hook<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.500> 12

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
connection and just hook up like a 12

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.230 
connection and just hook up like a 12
volt<00:01:07.979> battery<00:01:08.010> or<00:01:08.490> something<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.060> these

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
volt battery or something for these

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.080 
volt battery or something for these
leads<00:01:09.540> see<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> runs

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
leads see if it runs

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.510 
leads see if it runs
if<00:01:12.090> not<00:01:12.479> then<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:14.610> most<00:01:14.729> likely<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.240> bad

if there's actually a a fog in the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
radiator here it's basically all the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.880 
radiator here it's basically all the
heated<00:01:44.600> floor<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:44.990> it's<00:01:45.320> just<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.740> little

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
heated floor is it's just a little

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.880 
heated floor is it's just a little
radiator<00:01:46.400> because<00:01:47.000> here<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:49.340> coolant<00:01:49.790> passes

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
radiator because here the coolant passes

radiator because here the coolant passes
through<00:01:51.890> these<00:01:53.080> input<00:01:54.610> connections<00:01:55.610> and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
through these input connections and

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.039 
through these input connections and
beauty<00:01:56.950> if<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.070> get<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.280> clog<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.729> some<00:01:59.000> sort<00:01:59.930> in

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
beauty if you get a clog of some sort in

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.039 
beauty if you get a clog of some sort in
there<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.770> could<00:02:00.920> take<00:02:01.100> an<00:02:01.220> air<00:02:01.340> compressor

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
there you could take an air compressor

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.020 
there you could take an air compressor
pull<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.140> hoses<00:02:03.290> up<00:02:03.710> each<00:02:04.250> side<00:02:04.549> you<00:02:04.759> probably

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
pull the hoses up each side you probably

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.690 
pull the hoses up each side you probably
have<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.240> little<00:02:05.450> bit<00:02:05.540> of

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.940 

not<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> whole<00:02:08.970> lot<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:10.380> try<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> blowing

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
not a whole lot but just try to blowing

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.850 
not a whole lot but just try to blowing
it<00:02:11.070> out<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.820> Spica<00:02:12.600> diamond<00:02:12.960> I'm<00:02:13.590> an<00:02:13.740> air

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
it out with the Spica diamond I'm an air

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.830 
it out with the Spica diamond I'm an air
compressor<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.400> think<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.850> clears<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.300> out<00:02:15.360> if

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
compressor I think that clears it out if

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.290 
compressor I think that clears it out if
it<00:02:15.990> does<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.530> maybe<00:02:16.790> flush<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.940> out<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.090> little

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
it does and maybe flush it out a little

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.560 
it does and maybe flush it out a little
bit<00:02:18.450> with<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:21.500> garden<00:02:22.500> hose<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.830> something<00:02:23.570> and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
bit with a garden hose or something and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.630 
bit with a garden hose or something and
if<00:02:25.410> it's<00:02:25.680> if<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.160> pretty<00:02:26.760> clogged<00:02:27.060> up<00:02:28.640> that's

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
if it's if it's pretty clogged up that's

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.910 
if it's if it's pretty clogged up that's
not<00:02:29.820> working<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:31.050> couple<00:02:31.620> different

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
not working for you a couple different

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.070 
not working for you a couple different
options<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.520> could<00:02:32.850> take<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:35.270> hide<00:02:36.270> I'd

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
options you could take it to hide I'd

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.020 
options you could take it to hide I'd
probably<00:02:37.290> recommend<00:02:37.560> taking<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.760> local

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
probably recommend taking it to a local

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.420 
probably recommend taking it to a local
shop<00:02:39.300> or<00:02:39.570> something<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.200> seeing<00:02:41.130> if<00:02:41.220> they<00:02:41.370> can

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
shop or something and seeing if they can

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.860 
shop or something and seeing if they can
use<00:02:41.670> some<00:02:41.850> sort<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.090> solid<00:02:42.330> lifter<00:02:42.840> plastic

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
use some sort of solid lifter plastic

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.160 
use some sort of solid lifter plastic
liquid<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.970> kind<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.209> soak<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.660> cleared

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
liquid to kind of soak it and cleared

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.360 
liquid to kind of soak it and cleared
out<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:50.740> dependent<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:51.800> don't<00:02:51.980> know<00:02:52.040> how<00:02:52.190> much

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
out that dependent I don't know how much

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.780 
out that dependent I don't know how much
that<00:02:52.580> would<00:02:52.670> cost<00:02:52.730> or<00:02:53.120> whatever<00:02:54.069> but<00:02:55.069> you<00:02:55.640> can

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
that would cost or whatever but you can

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.510 
that would cost or whatever but you can
also<00:02:56.200> Victoria<00:02:57.200> British<00:02:57.380> in<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.860> Box<00:02:58.220> mortar

tells<00:02:58.730> itself<00:02:59.090> just<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.600> heater<00:02:59.810> core<00:03:00.080> itself

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
tells itself just the heater core itself

tells itself just the heater core itself
I<00:03:00.800> think<00:03:01.520> bath<00:03:02.030> month's<00:03:02.569> book<00:03:02.720> hunter<00:03:02.989> bucks

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
I think bath month's book hunter bucks

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.610 
I think bath month's book hunter bucks
so<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.489> with<00:03:04.850> that<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.780> replace<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.319> you'd

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
so and with that to replace that you'd

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.040 
so and with that to replace that you'd
have<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:07.010> pull<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:07.400> assembly<00:03:07.910> out<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.480> then

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
have to pull this assembly out and then

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.540 
have to pull this assembly out and then
once<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:09.709> get<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:09.950> out<00:03:10.040> it's<00:03:10.250> pretty

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
once you get it out it's pretty

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.120 
once you get it out it's pretty
straightforward<00:03:10.850> there's<00:03:11.330> just<00:03:11.569> these<00:03:12.130> clips

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
straightforward there's just these clips

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.880 
straightforward there's just these clips
around<00:03:13.520> the<00:03:14.239> sides<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:15.319> you<00:03:15.440> can<00:03:15.560> just<00:03:15.739> pop

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
around the sides that you can just pop

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.330 
around the sides that you can just pop
up<00:03:16.130> with<00:03:16.459> like<00:03:17.709> lightning<00:03:18.709> screwdriver<00:03:19.130> or

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
up with like lightning screwdriver or

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.920 
up with like lightning screwdriver or
something<00:03:19.630> this

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.270 

laughs<00:03:26.500> I

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.120 

throw<00:03:29.940> your<00:03:30.090> new<00:03:30.180> one<00:03:30.360> in

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
throw your new one in

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.580 
throw your new one in
the<00:03:31.190> other<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:32.630> that's<00:03:33.350> in<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.750> that<00:03:35.750> if

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the other and that's in that so that if

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.590 
the other and that's in that so that if
you're<00:03:36.740> having<00:03:36.890> flow<00:03:37.250> issues<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:38.060> might<00:03:38.570> be

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
you're having flow issues that might be

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.410 
you're having flow issues that might be
that<00:03:38.900> there's<00:03:39.140> one<00:03:39.380> other<00:03:39.500> thing<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:40.270> think<00:03:41.270> and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
that there's one other thing I think and

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.150 
that there's one other thing I think and
that<00:03:41.570> might<00:03:41.810> be<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.170> bowel<00:03:42.490> and<00:03:43.690> that's<00:03:45.160> this

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
that might be the bowel and that's this

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.780 
that might be the bowel and that's this
this<00:03:46.550> guy<00:03:46.760> right<00:03:47.030> down<00:03:47.240> here<00:03:47.570> that<00:03:48.760> got<00:03:49.760> a

this guy right down here that got a
holistic<00:03:50.240> goes<00:03:50.390> from<00:03:50.600> here<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:52.660> heater

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
holistic goes from here to the heater

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.750 
holistic goes from here to the heater
unit<00:03:53.870> that<00:03:54.860> would<00:03:54.980> be<00:03:55.100> sitting<00:03:55.340> right<00:03:55.430> there

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
unit that would be sitting right there
