00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.980 
strategy game involved to pad things out
but<00:03:55.280> did<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:55.610> main<00:03:55.820> game<00:03:56.090> really<00:03:56.450> need<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.870> be

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
but did the main game really need to be

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.470 
but did the main game really need to be
that<00:03:57.200> short<00:03:57.500> five<00:03:58.190> or<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.580> extra<00:03:58.970> levels<00:03:59.330> and

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
that short five or so extra levels and

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.180 
that short five or so extra levels and
this<00:03:59.630> would<00:03:59.780> have<00:03:59.870> been<00:03:59.900> highly<00:04:00.470> recommended

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
this would have been highly recommended

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.370 
this would have been highly recommended
but<00:04:01.610> at<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.880> moment<00:04:02.060> i<00:04:02.390> would<00:04:02.570> say<00:04:02.750> wait<00:04:03.050> until

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
but at the moment i would say wait until

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.260 
but at the moment i would say wait until
it<00:04:03.500> drops<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.950> price<00:04:03.980> before<00:04:04.580> you<00:04:04.610> snap<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:05.150> up

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
it drops in price before you snap it up

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.630 
it drops in price before you snap it up
because<00:04:05.959> there<00:04:06.320> is<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.500> great<00:04:06.890> game<00:04:07.190> in<00:04:07.430> here

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
because there is a great game in here

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.820 
because there is a great game in here
it's<00:04:07.970> just<00:04:08.209> hard<00:04:08.420> to<00:04:08.480> find<00:04:08.990> and<00:04:09.260> when<00:04:09.440> you<00:04:09.560> do
