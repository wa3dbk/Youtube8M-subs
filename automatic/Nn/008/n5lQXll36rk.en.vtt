black reflective tape though that might

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.630 
black reflective tape though that might
be<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> little<00:02:17.150> more<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:18.200> safety<00:02:18.410> also<00:02:19.190> put

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.290 
and I figured that'll help for some
reflectivity<00:02:26.660> in<00:02:27.290> any<00:02:27.500> case<00:02:28.030> mounted<00:02:29.030> really

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
reflectivity in any case mounted really

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.270 
reflectivity in any case mounted really
well<00:02:29.480> they<00:02:30.200> have<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> little<00:02:30.560> articulated<00:02:31.100> arm

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
well they have a little articulated arm

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.790 
well they have a little articulated arm
there<00:02:31.580> was<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> pretty<00:02:32.690> good<00:02:32.900> hardware<00:02:33.290> prefer

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
there was a pretty good hardware prefer

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.440 
there was a pretty good hardware prefer
if<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:33.980> was<00:02:34.070> black<00:02:34.310> some<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.880> shiny<00:02:35.120> chrome

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
if it was black some of the shiny chrome

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.670 
if it was black some of the shiny chrome
but<00:02:35.750> that's<00:02:35.930> okay

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
but that's okay

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.660 
but that's okay
this<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:39.440> right<00:02:39.650> side<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.430> brake

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
this is the the right side the brake

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.440 
this is the the right side the brake
side<00:02:42.070> at<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.220> same<00:02:43.430> time<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.760> mounted<00:02:44.330> these

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
side at the same time I mounted these

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.360 
side at the same time I mounted these
are<00:02:44.660> right<00:02:44.780> before<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.110> mounted<00:02:45.530> these<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:46.040> also

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
are right before I mounted these I also

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.150 
are right before I mounted these I also
picked<00:02:46.880> up<00:02:47.060> from<00:02:47.209> SV<00:02:47.690> racing<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.709> skid<00:02:48.980> plate

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
picked up from SV racing the skid plate

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.490 
picked up from SV racing the skid plate
which<00:02:49.580> is<00:02:49.610> in<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.910> separate<00:02:50.270> video<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:52.300> the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
which is in a separate video and the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.010 
which is in a separate video and the
extended<00:02:54.500> brake<00:02:55.340> hose<00:02:55.640> because<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.510> have<00:02:56.720> some

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
extended brake hose because I have some

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.830 
extended brake hose because I have some
1<00:02:57.320> inch<00:02:57.530> risers<00:02:58.070> on<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.520> bars<00:02:58.760> there<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
1 inch risers on the bars there the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.699 
1 inch risers on the bars there the
front<00:03:00.530> hydraulic<00:03:01.190> line<00:03:01.459> was<00:03:01.760> very<00:03:02.060> tight<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.650> I

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
front hydraulic line was very tight so I

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.440 
front hydraulic line was very tight so I
bought<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:04.489> one<00:03:04.670> has<00:03:04.850> like<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.000> 2<00:03:05.239> inch

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
bought the this one has like a 2 inch

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.430 
bought the this one has like a 2 inch
extended<00:03:06.140> line<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:07.270> mounted<00:03:08.270> that<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:09.320> it

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
extended line and mounted that and it

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.710 
extended line and mounted that and it
was<00:03:09.530> suggested<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.100> also<00:03:10.280> get<00:03:10.640> on<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.270> upper

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
was suggested I also get on the upper

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.860 
was suggested I also get on the upper
banjo<00:03:12.560> bolt<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:16.060> replacement<00:03:17.060> banjo<00:03:17.660> bolt

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
banjo bolt and a replacement banjo bolt

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.930 
banjo bolt and a replacement banjo bolt
that<00:03:18.050> has<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.200> upper<00:03:18.739> brake<00:03:18.950> bleeder<00:03:19.250> up<00:03:19.670> by<00:03:19.880> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
that has a upper brake bleeder up by the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.330 
that has a upper brake bleeder up by the
master<00:03:20.390> cylinder<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:21.350> I<00:03:21.410> purchased<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:22.040> and

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
master cylinder so I purchased that and

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.800 
master cylinder so I purchased that and
it<00:03:22.400> did<00:03:22.550> make<00:03:22.730> bleeding<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.239> brakes<00:03:23.360> after<00:03:23.660> I

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
it did make bleeding the brakes after I

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.650 
it did make bleeding the brakes after I
replaced<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.320> line<00:03:24.530> much<00:03:25.519> simpler<00:03:25.940> in<00:03:26.299> any<00:03:26.420> case

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
replaced a line much simpler in any case

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.770 
replaced a line much simpler in any case
back<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.140> hand<00:03:27.590> guards<00:03:28.450> these<00:03:29.450> are<00:03:29.570> kind

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
back to the hand guards these are kind

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.860 
back to the hand guards these are kind
of<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:29.900> universal<00:03:30.110> fit<00:03:30.650> they<00:03:31.489> did<00:03:31.700> fit<00:03:32.030> like<00:03:32.810> I

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
of a universal fit they did fit like I

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.320 
of a universal fit they did fit like I
say<00:03:33.049> with<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.519> banjo<00:03:34.519> bolt<00:03:34.880> with<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.030> bleeder

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
say with the banjo bolt with a bleeder

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.240 
say with the banjo bolt with a bleeder
was<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.600> very<00:03:35.810> tight<00:03:36.080> fit<00:03:36.380> but<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.769> works<00:03:36.980> and

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
was a very tight fit but it works and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.940 
was a very tight fit but it works and
there's<00:03:37.400> there's<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.790> space<00:03:38.120> in<00:03:38.330> there<00:03:38.950> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
there's there's a space in there the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.050 
there's there's a space in there the
only<00:03:40.070> thing<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:40.280> don't<00:03:40.519> like<00:03:40.700> one<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:41.000> the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
only thing I don't like one of the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.490 
only thing I don't like one of the
reasons<00:03:41.209> I<00:03:41.450> bought<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.810> hand<00:03:42.049> guards<00:03:42.350> was

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
reasons I bought the hand guards was

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.030 
reasons I bought the hand guards was
they<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:43.390> protect<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.510> controls<00:03:44.930> but<00:03:45.620> also<00:03:45.769> in

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
they to protect the controls but also in

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.979 
they to protect the controls but also in
these<00:03:46.220> winter<00:03:46.459> days<00:03:46.700> like<00:03:46.970> today<00:03:47.150> or<00:03:47.600> it's<00:03:47.900> in

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
these winter days like today or it's in

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.199 
these winter days like today or it's in
the<00:03:48.110> 40s<00:03:48.530> even<00:03:48.769> with<00:03:49.190> thicker<00:03:49.430> gloves<00:03:49.850> my

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
the 40s even with thicker gloves my

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.000 
the 40s even with thicker gloves my
hands<00:03:50.420> get<00:03:50.600> quite<00:03:50.810> cold<00:03:51.019> well<00:03:51.739> unfortunately

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
hands get quite cold well unfortunately

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.970 
hands get quite cold well unfortunately
these<00:03:52.489> half<00:03:52.760> as<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.090> can<00:03:53.239> see<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.920> got<00:03:54.920> some

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
these half as you can see I got some

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.440 
these half as you can see I got some
glare<00:03:55.280> on<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.489> screen<00:03:55.610> here<00:03:56.000> but<00:03:56.090> I<00:03:56.180> believe

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
glare on the screen here but I believe

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.750 
glare on the screen here but I believe
you<00:03:56.570> can<00:03:56.750> see<00:03:57.160> there's<00:03:58.160> supposed<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.549> air

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
you can see there's supposed to air

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.640 
you can see there's supposed to air
holes<00:03:59.000> in<00:03:59.180> them<00:03:59.329> so<00:03:59.600> I<00:04:00.019> haven't<00:04:00.260> decided<00:04:00.470> if<00:04:00.560> I

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
holes in them so I haven't decided if I

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.500 
holes in them so I haven't decided if I
want<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:00.920> try<00:04:01.070> to<00:04:02.260> hack<00:04:03.260> up<00:04:03.470> some<00:04:03.709> sort<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.070> a

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
want to try to hack up some sort of a

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.140 
want to try to hack up some sort of a
way<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.590> block<00:04:06.590> those<00:04:06.860> off<00:04:07.100> I<00:04:07.370> may<00:04:07.760> buy<00:04:07.910> some

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
way to block those off I may buy some

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.690 
way to block those off I may buy some
more<00:04:08.329> of<00:04:08.390> that<00:04:08.480> 3m<00:04:09.079> reflective<00:04:09.230> tape<00:04:09.829> that

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
more of that 3m reflective tape that

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.900 
more of that 3m reflective tape that
that<00:04:10.880> was<00:04:11.030> 1/2<00:04:11.239> inch<00:04:11.480> there<00:04:11.840> so<00:04:12.739> I<00:04:12.769> believe<00:04:13.310> the

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
that was 1/2 inch there so I believe the

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.630 
that was 1/2 inch there so I believe the
lumina<00:04:14.630> bracket<00:04:15.049> is<00:04:15.140> probably<00:04:15.440> 3/8<00:04:15.980> thick<00:04:16.370> by

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
lumina bracket is probably 3/8 thick by

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.710 
lumina bracket is probably 3/8 thick by
about<00:04:16.910> 5/8<00:04:17.540> wide<00:04:19.090> you<00:04:20.090> can<00:04:20.239> sort<00:04:20.450> of<00:04:20.510> see<00:04:20.690> a

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
about 5/8 wide you can sort of see a

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.630 
about 5/8 wide you can sort of see a
little<00:04:21.109> bit<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.709> glare<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.040> think<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.580> the

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
little bit of the glare I think of the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.000 
little bit of the glare I think of the
reflectivity<00:04:23.150> I<00:04:23.630> can<00:04:24.169> see<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:24.440> here<00:04:24.650> in<00:04:24.740> person

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
reflectivity I can see it here in person

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.140 
reflectivity I can see it here in person
I<00:04:25.040> don't<00:04:25.160> know<00:04:25.220> if<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.340> cameras<00:04:25.700> picking<00:04:26.060> it

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
I don't know if the cameras picking it

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.529 
I don't know if the cameras picking it
up<00:04:26.270> but<00:04:27.080> in<00:04:27.200> any<00:04:27.290> case<00:04:27.820> does<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:28.850> good<00:04:29.030> job<00:04:29.090> and

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
up but in any case does a good job and

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.480 
up but in any case does a good job and
think<00:04:30.020> about<00:04:30.169> getting<00:04:30.229> some<00:04:30.380> light<00:04:30.710> or<00:04:30.740> 3m

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
think about getting some light or 3m

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.430 
think about getting some light or 3m
reflective<00:04:31.610> tape<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.479> maybe<00:04:32.960> trying<00:04:33.320> to

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
reflective tape and maybe trying to

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.500 
reflective tape and maybe trying to
cover<00:04:33.650> some<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:33.950> those<00:04:34.070> holes

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
cover some of those holes

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.430 
cover some of those holes
also<00:04:35.900> on<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.140> 3m<00:04:36.410> tape<00:04:36.440> I<00:04:36.800> put<00:04:37.010> some<00:04:37.250> on<00:04:37.430> the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
also on the 3m tape I put some on the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.440 
also on the 3m tape I put some on the
down<00:04:39.440> tube<00:04:39.710> at<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:39.980> front<00:04:40.220> shock<00:04:41.090> there<00:04:41.300> the
