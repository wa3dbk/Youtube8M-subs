00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.000
 &gt;&gt; See how many items we have here that we throw away on a daily basis, or maybe we will make a great garage out of them. 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.200
 &gt;&gt; To create a garage, we need: 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.200
 &gt;&gt; Two cardboard rectangles. 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.000
 &gt;&gt; Five tubes on toilet paper. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.100
 &gt;&gt; Scissors. 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 &gt;&gt; Double-sided adhesive tape. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.000
 &gt;&gt; And poster paint to paint our garage. 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.500
 &gt;&gt; Cut the end of the cardboard with the horns along one and the other side. 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.000
 &gt;&gt; We bend down. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.000
 &gt;&gt; With the help of a crayon, we designate places for cars, on one and the other carton 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.000
 &gt;&gt; Using double-sided tape, we combine three rolls of toilet paper. 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.500
 &gt;&gt; We paint all the elements and wait for them to dry. 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.500
 &gt;&gt; In the middle of a one-story rectangle, we glue the main pillar of our construction. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.300
 &gt;&gt; Stick through the tape. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.900
 &gt;&gt; We take two more rolls and glue them at the end of the single-story cardboard box. 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.600
 &gt;&gt; To mount the second level, cut out of a double-sided tape one large square matching the main pillar. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 &gt;&gt; And two small ones that match the other rolls. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.000
 &gt;&gt; For such a construction, we fit the first floor. 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.100
 &gt;&gt; We connect the floors of the garage. 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.000
 &gt;&gt; The roads connecting the first and second part, connect from the bottom of the structure with the help of adhesive tape. 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.500
 &gt;&gt; Garage ready. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 &gt;&gt; After every game we have to clean up and remember that waste is thrown into appropriate containers. Plastics 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 And what do we throw into a green container? 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.300
