now I really want to discuss about call

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.890 
now I really want to discuss about call
of<00:00:22.650> duty<00:00:23.040> in<00:00:23.070> general<00:00:23.750> specifically<00:00:24.750> about

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
their game modes now I have one major

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.480 
their game modes now I have one major
question<00:00:28.200> that<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.590> really<00:00:28.950> would<00:00:29.100> like<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.400> ask

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
you guys they and that actually involves

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.369 
you guys they and that actually involves
designing<00:00:32.520> your<00:00:33.000> own<00:00:33.059> game<00:00:33.540> mode<00:00:33.809> for<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> call

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
designing your own game mode for a call

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.590 
designing your own game mode for a call
to<00:00:34.500> duty<00:00:34.680> game<00:00:34.950> whether<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.059> call<00:00:36.359> did<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
to duty game whether it's a call did a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.689 
to duty game whether it's a call did a
game<00:00:36.809> from<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.109> past<00:00:37.410> or<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.219> black<00:00:38.399> ops

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
game from the past or if it's black ops

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.509 
game from the past or if it's black ops
2<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.839> a<00:00:39.929> new<00:00:40.109> cold<00:00:40.410> dude<00:00:40.649> title<00:00:41.070> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
you have in mind further from black ops

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.250 
you have in mind further from black ops

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
into the game itself what would it be

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.380

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
people's creativity you know when they

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
people's creativity you know when they
have<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.759> game<00:01:15.000> modes<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.450> call<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.689> duty<00:01:16.049> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
have in game modes for call of duty I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.529 
have in game modes for call of duty I
myself<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.490> would<00:01:17.640> definitely<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> see

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
myself I would definitely like to see

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.020 
myself I would definitely like to see
something<00:01:19.100> something<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> global

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
something something like a global

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.209 
something something like a global
thermonuclear<00:01:21.420> war<00:01:21.860> number<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:22.979> was<00:01:23.100> this

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
thermonuclear war number there was this

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.370 
thermonuclear war number there was this
thing<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:24.240> was<00:01:24.390> called<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.869> way<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.170> would

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
thing that was called that way you would

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.920 
thing that was called that way you would
arm<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.740> nuclear<00:01:26.250> bomb<00:01:26.549> well<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.539> think<00:01:27.659> that

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
arm a nuclear bomb well I think that

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.749 
arm a nuclear bomb well I think that
would<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.140> an<00:01:28.229> amazing<00:01:28.590> idea<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.549> did

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
would be an amazing idea if they did

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.490 
would be an amazing idea if they did
that<00:01:29.969> like<00:01:30.479> it'll<00:01:30.719> be<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:30.990> center<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that like it'll be in the center of the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.310 
that like it'll be in the center of the
map<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.399> to<00:01:32.520> go<00:01:32.670> there<00:01:32.939> hold<00:01:33.509> X<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.140> your

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
map you have to go there hold X on your

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.520 
map you have to go there hold X on your
xbox<00:01:34.530> 360<00:01:35.250> or<00:01:35.719> you<00:01:36.719> know<00:01:36.840> whatever<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.409> no

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
xbox 360 or you know whatever it is no

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.490 
xbox 360 or you know whatever it is no
ps3<00:01:37.859> I<00:01:38.159> forgot<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.539> you're<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> middle

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
ps3 I forgot but if you're in the middle

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.529 
ps3 I forgot but if you're in the middle
of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.680> map<00:01:40.979> holding<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> button<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
of the map holding the button on the

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.080 
of the map holding the button on the
bomb<00:01:42.719> for<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.469> number<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.460> let's<00:01:44.670> say<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
bomb for a number like let's say for a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.459 
bomb for a number like let's say for a
minute<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.960> hold<00:01:46.109> it<00:01:46.289> for<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
minute and if you can hold it for a

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.459 
minute and if you can hold it for a
minute<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.219> nuke<00:01:47.490> goes<00:01:47.520> off<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.929> I<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
minute the nuke goes off so I think that

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.139 
minute the nuke goes off so I think that
would<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.649> an<00:01:49.740> interesting<00:01:49.859> game<00:01:50.189> mode<00:01:50.549> but

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
would be an interesting game mode but

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.810 
would be an interesting game mode but
aside<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:51.479> my<00:01:51.929> actual<00:01:52.350> ideas<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.399> would<00:01:53.640> love

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
aside from my actual ideas I would love

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.459 
aside from my actual ideas I would love
to<00:01:53.880> hear<00:01:54.179> what<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.359> guys<00:01:54.630> actually<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.200> in

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
to hear what you guys actually have in
