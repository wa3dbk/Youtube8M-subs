00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.170
 and 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.269
 and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.900
 or not 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.449
 hello youtube people as you know I do 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.280
 almost a year I talked about a small console 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.340
 that attracted the attention of the players 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.500
 this was obvious everything indicated that he was going to 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.930
 be a resounding success in sales for its 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.120
 price and downloadable games but it was not 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.370
 so, as the title says, I'll talk about 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.199
 the mediocre start of an idea 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.390
 promising I will say the problems and 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.190
 advantages of this console and the reason for 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.190
 that does not have the success that was thought 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.229
 well let's start today we hung him 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.790
 quickly the next poster 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.190
 revolution of the video game when 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.320
 managed to raise more than 8 million 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.330
 dollars in the most successful campaign of the 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.009
 history of kickstarter and the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.860
 time to know if you have complied with the 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.380
 expectations the concept of the console 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.570
 certainly a machine is striking 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.670
 cheap based on android and that forces 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.240
 all your games to have something of free 2 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.100
 play the final result is not so much 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.869
 despite being a promising idea today 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.090
 stumbles because of problems of 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.340
 poor performance design and a lack 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.560
 bleeding content even though 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.500
 cost less than 100 euros and have 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.640
 potential to improve but despite 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.700
 all your points 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.220
 today already does a few things well for 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.350
 cost less than one hundred euros has a 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.810
 exceptional design launching a 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.360
 pot is relatively simple the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.580
 you connect synchronize the controls through 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.160
 of bluetooth you configure the connection to 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.680
 internet you create an account in one and already 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.390
 you can give cane the only problem that 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.880
 we meet during installation 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.070
 were repeated failures at the time of 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.840
 download us a firmware update 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.610
 the wifi of the console is 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.290
 surprisingly weak and had 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.970
 problems to achieve a connection 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.520
 stable in an area where others 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.320
 devices are able to recognize the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.690
 connection without problems 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.610
 too simple menus just like 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.190
 happens with the console itself 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.050
 today's interface are already simple though 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.630
 they lack some features 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.750
 basic in the main menu there's only 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.790
 four options play discover make image 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.100
 the first option takes you to your 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.900
 collection of games and apps the second is 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.060
 Direct access to the store while 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.800
 the third is reserved for the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.720
 developers and gives access to 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.090
 tools needed 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.130
 man ag as you can imagine da 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.860
 access to the basic configuration of the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.900
 console the two menus related to 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.330
 the play discover games are 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.100
 presented in a similar way with rows 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.890
 of games in which we can see each 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.110
 one in a horizontal miniature that yes 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.300
 in the store we can separate the games 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.220
 by different filters while not 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.920
 there is a way to organize the titles that 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.810
 we own browse the menus is very 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.600
 simple at the beginning but it's going 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.610
 tangling little by little is not complicated 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.680
 gather a large library taking in 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.230
 account that all games can be 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.240
 try for free the catalog of 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.160
 Today is already huge for a 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.080
 platform that has just been born but 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.500
 lacks games that excel over 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.660
 the rest there are ports of ancient games 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.970
 carnival final fantasy third shadow 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.470
 bull that are already on other platforms and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.920
 Most exclusive games 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.750
 work well for 20 minutes what 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.760
 worse is that today he no longer allows the game 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.890
 cross platform so you'll have to 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.900
 return to pay for games that maybe 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.569
 you already own on your phone or tablet 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.579
 even when the only difference is 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.889
 the title of the console is adapted to 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.780
 its interface and the command to the console 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:53.409
 they also drag some problems 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.780
 technical under the game which hides 1 gb 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.969
 of ram and 8 gigabytes of storage and 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.129
 comes with an nvidia tegra 3 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.739
 a generation behind the model 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.959
 current although it has power of leftovers 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.389
 to move games in two dimensions e 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.989
 even some 3d titles as used 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:13.659
 a to 720p and 1080p its performance is 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.939
 inconsistent some games work 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.489
 well while others suffer pulls 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.650
 during the action sequences of 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.660
 done today already it passes bad even to the 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.940
 time to load the main menu with 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.729
 Obvious problems to move the scroll 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.919
 in a fluid way the command a trouble 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.169
 of head the obvious attempt to make 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.259
 a command to match those of ps3 and 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.759
 xbox360 is worth admiring although it has 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.460
 certain problems both in your 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.380
 performance as in its ergonomics continue 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.660
 existing problems of lag between 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.300
 the buttons and the response time in 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.430
 screen some games work better 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.529
 than others but today it still can not 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.689
 compete with precision and 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:55.239
 of the microsoft polling controls 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:58.269
 while the bumpers of ps3 and 

00:04:55.239 --> 00:05:00.459
 xbox360 are designed for your indexes 

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:02.259
 those of today already have edges that 

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:04.749
 make the possibility of power difficult 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.849
 activate them quickly the command 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:09.309
 has a raptor like the next dual 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.469
 shock 4 although there are few games that 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.599
 they make use of it there is a button that you 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:15.729
 leads to the main menu but does not exist 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.319
 none that is able to stop the 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.299
 action so many developers 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.939
 have had to assign one of the 

00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:23.829
 command buttons for this action but 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.989
 the model is not standard in some 

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:28.359
 games is the button or in others the a in 

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:30.609
 other words it is absurd that there is no 

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:32.679
 a button dedicated to the pause or so 

00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:35.469
 less an alternative than all the 

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:37.539
 games implemented for the moment is one of 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.059
 those measures that ruin the experience 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.429
 of user because you can really 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:44.859
 improve the console I do not say it's bad 

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:46.779
 it can only improve as the control and 

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:49.809
 so far the video I hope you 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.729
 I liked it if it's like that, comment, like it 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:53.619
 and subscribe and then with nothing more than 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.390
 say see you in a next video 

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:58.380
 until next time 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.380
 Y
