00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.670 
and it's really tiny that's one of the
reason<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.800> don't<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.420> wire<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.990> I

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
reason I don't like it the wire is I

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.470 
reason I don't like it the wire is I
don't<00:00:29.160> know<00:00:29.279> if<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.519> see<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.210> only

is<00:00:34.079> about<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.980> big<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:37.140> hard<00:00:37.260> for

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
is about like that big and it's hard for

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.650

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
him to get the hay out so he gets really

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.810 
him to get the hay out so he gets really

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.010 
it and throwing it around he doesn't
really<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.270> only<00:00:45.390> about<00:00:45.570> two

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
really like it and it's only about two

really like it and it's only about two
inches<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:47.010> way<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.140> when<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.170> stick<00:00:49.559> hay<00:00:49.829> in

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
inches this way so when I stick hay in

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.220 
inches this way so when I stick hay in
it<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:51.469> there's<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:53.100> doesn't<00:00:53.399> hold<00:00:53.610> like

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
it and there's it doesn't hold like

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.020 
it and there's it doesn't hold like
anything<00:00:55.230> at<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.579> shove<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
anything at all but when I like shove a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.029 
anything at all but when I like shove a
whole<00:00:57.210> bunch<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.539> hay<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.320> gets<00:00:58.680> so

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
whole bunch of hay in there it gets so

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
whole bunch of hay in there it gets so
compacted<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.059> they<00:01:00.210> can't<00:01:00.449> even<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
compacted that they can't even get the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.139 
compacted that they can't even get the
hay<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> don't<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.059> what

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
hay out so I don't know if you know what

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.010 
hay out so I don't know if you know what
I<00:01:03.210> mean<00:01:03.449> by<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.739> not<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
I mean by that but it's not I I like it

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.929 
I mean by that but it's not I I like it
because<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.470> doesn't<00:01:07.500> make<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.189> much<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
because it doesn't make as much as a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.940 
because it doesn't make as much as a
mess<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.680> still<00:01:11.420> it's<00:01:12.420> way<00:01:12.720> too<00:01:12.780> small<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
mess but I still it's way too small so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
mess but I still it's way too small so
if<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.820> works<00:01:15.000> perfect<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.720> when<00:01:15.840> he<00:01:15.990> was<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
if it works perfect for when he was a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.429 
if it works perfect for when he was a
baby<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.490> much<00:01:17.670> anymore<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> might

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
baby but not so much anymore so I might

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.030 
baby but not so much anymore so I might
use<00:01:19.740> an<00:01:20.130> N<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.509> grid-like<00:01:22.110> fold<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.009> half

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
use an N I see grid-like fold it in half

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.580 
use an N I see grid-like fold it in half
like<00:01:23.640> I've<00:01:24.000> seen<00:01:24.299> people<00:01:24.810> forgetting<00:01:25.170> pigs<00:01:25.409> do

did<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.780> take<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> rubber<00:02:01.740> off<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:03.649> flip<00:02:04.649> it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
did was take the rubber off and flip it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.520 
did was take the rubber off and flip it
up<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.399> zip<00:02:05.700> tie<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> wall

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
up like this and zip tie it to the wall

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.960 
up like this and zip tie it to the wall
the<00:02:07.530> only<00:02:07.799> thing<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.069> don't<00:02:08.129> like<00:02:08.429> about<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.819> is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the only thing I don't like about it is

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.999 
the only thing I don't like about it is
it's<00:02:09.509> only<00:02:09.690> an<00:02:09.959> inch<00:02:10.229> by<00:02:10.530> inch

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
it's only an inch by inch

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.250

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
so mochas head

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.500 
so mochas head
is<00:02:13.439> so<00:02:13.799> big<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.340> he<00:02:14.370> can't<00:02:14.489> reach<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.390> get

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
is so big that he can't reach in and get

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.780 
is so big that he can't reach in and get
it<00:02:15.569> out<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.620> reason<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.950> mentioned<00:02:17.310> mocha<00:02:17.640> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
it out the reason I mentioned mocha and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.399 
it out the reason I mentioned mocha and
not<00:02:17.939> Lulu<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.390> because<00:02:18.629> Lulu<00:02:18.840> has<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> bigger

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
not Lulu is because Lulu has a bigger

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:19.880 
not Lulu is because Lulu has a bigger
head

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
head

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.250 
head
I<00:02:19.920> mean<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> longer<00:02:20.579> head<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.629> like<00:02:22.049> his

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
I mean a longer head so like his

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.440 
I mean a longer head so like his
skinnier<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:22.950> then<00:02:23.069> it<00:02:23.159> gets<00:02:23.340> bigger<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.390> she

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
skinnier and then it gets bigger so she

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.380 
skinnier and then it gets bigger so she
has<00:02:24.840> an<00:02:24.959> easier<00:02:25.290> time<00:02:25.560> getting<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.040> hay<00:02:26.189> out

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.149 
has an easier time getting the hay out
but<00:02:27.390> she<00:02:27.540> still<00:02:27.780> gets<00:02:28.200> frustrated<00:02:28.829> with<00:02:29.040> this

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159
