have<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> make<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> cut<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.500> below<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
have to make a cut out below this on the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.670 
have to make a cut out below this on the
back<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.670> all<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.329> there<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
back to get all of that in there and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.969 
back to get all of that in there and
then<00:01:53.640> put<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> little<00:01:54.119> cover<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> back

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
then put a little cover on the back

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.749 
then put a little cover on the back
anyway<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> prototype<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.579> idea

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
anyway this is a prototype and the idea

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.289 
anyway this is a prototype and the idea
here<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:01.560> take<00:02:01.890> five<00:02:02.549> years<00:02:02.820> or<00:02:03.090> for

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
here is to take five years or for

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.419 
here is to take five years or for
research<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.930> testing<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:06.140> make<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
research and testing and make a

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.440 
research and testing and make a
performance-oriented

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
performance-oriented

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.040 
performance-oriented
product<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.709> anyway<00:02:13.160> looks<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> regular

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
product so anyway looks like a regular

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.580 
product so anyway looks like a regular
Telecaster<00:02:17.180> pickguard<00:02:18.180> it's<00:02:19.019> just<00:02:19.379> been

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
Telecaster pickguard it's just been

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.119 
Telecaster pickguard it's just been
extended<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:22.680> make<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.980> look<00:02:23.069> more

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
extended to make it look more

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.559 
extended to make it look more
aesthetically<00:02:23.819> pleasing<00:02:25.130> basically<00:02:26.130> on

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
aesthetically pleasing basically on

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.970 
aesthetically pleasing basically on
completing<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.660> curve<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.260> I'm<00:02:28.530> going<00:02:28.860> to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
completing the curve that I'm going to

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.339 
completing the curve that I'm going to
believe<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:32.580> original<00:02:33.349> Telecaster

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
believe the original Telecaster

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.420 
believe the original Telecaster
prototype<00:02:35.040> probably<00:02:35.549> had<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:37.650> know<00:02:37.769> on<00:02:38.010> what

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
prototype probably had you know on what

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.509 
prototype probably had you know on what
we<00:02:38.549> can<00:02:38.670> buy<00:02:38.879> now<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.810> part<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.470> part<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.340> that

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
we can buy now this part is part of that

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.130 
we can buy now this part is part of that
part<00:02:41.819> they've<00:02:42.030> all<00:02:42.150> been<00:02:42.330> cut<00:02:42.630> off<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.840> i

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
part they've all been cut off and i

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.020 
part they've all been cut off and i
guess<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.500> back<00:02:44.280> in<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.519> day<00:02:44.549> made<00:02:44.880> it

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
guess that back in the day made it

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.960 
guess that back in the day made it
easier<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.510> manufacture<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.440> i<00:02:46.819> think<00:02:47.819> this

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
easier to manufacture but i think this

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.949 
easier to manufacture but i think this
looks<00:02:48.269> better<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.840> certainly<00:02:50.720> makes<00:02:51.720> more

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
looks better and certainly makes more

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.289 
looks better and certainly makes more
sense<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.160> volume<00:02:53.489> control<00:02:53.849> in<00:02:54.150> a

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
sense you have to volume control in a

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.960 
sense you have to volume control in a
place<00:02:55.069> where<00:02:56.420> it's<00:02:57.420> easy<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.959> operate<00:02:57.989> and

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
place where it's easy to operate and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.420 
place where it's easy to operate and
it's<00:02:59.970> out<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.420> way<00:03:00.950> got<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.069> pickup

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
it's out of the way got the pickup

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.680 
it's out of the way got the pickup
selector<00:03:03.380> in<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.590> back<00:03:05.329> they<00:03:06.329> can<00:03:06.480> kind<00:03:06.599> of

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
selector in the back they can kind of

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.069 
selector in the back they can kind of
work<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.989> with<00:03:07.110> your<00:03:07.260> pinky<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:09.079> mold

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
work it with your pinky the mold

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.729 
work it with your pinky the mold
selectors<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:11.549> front<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> volume<00:03:12.739> control

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
selectors in front of the volume control

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.660 
selectors in front of the volume control
and<00:03:14.160> it's<00:03:14.880> like<00:03:15.120> all<00:03:15.389> three<00:03:16.430> controls<00:03:17.430> are

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
and it's like all three controls are
