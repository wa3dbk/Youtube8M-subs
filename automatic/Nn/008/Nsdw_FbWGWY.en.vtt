they were supposed to come on about 4:30
but<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> think<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> sprinkles<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.630> prevented

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
but I think the sprinkles have prevented

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.510 
but I think the sprinkles have prevented
that<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.410> performance<00:00:34.950> from<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.370> on

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
confirmation of that as far as the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.380 
confirmation of that as far as the
crowds<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.160> today<00:00:50.399> we're<00:00:50.640> estimating<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
crowds here today we're estimating that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240 
crowds here today we're estimating that
there's<00:00:51.570> probably<00:00:52.020> double<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.829> number<00:00:53.160> of

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
there's probably double the number of

people that were in attendance yesterday

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.010 
people that were in attendance yesterday
I<00:00:55.680> think<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.250> estimates<00:00:56.640> were<00:00:56.760> about<00:00:57.020> 500,000

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
I think the estimates were about 500,000

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.750 
I think the estimates were about 500,000
yesterday<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> police<00:00:59.070> around<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.460> are
