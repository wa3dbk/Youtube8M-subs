00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.800 
my laptop webcam and it's it's very poor
quality<00:03:21.730> it's<00:03:22.730> really<00:03:23.359> up<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:25.630> pictures<00:03:26.630> are

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
quality it's really up the pictures are

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.270 
quality it's really up the pictures are
really<00:03:26.959> bad<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.930> sound<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.980> really

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
really bad and the sound is really

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.790 
really bad and the sound is really
choppy<00:03:31.940> and

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
choppy and

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.970 
choppy and
sound<00:03:34.130> right<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:35.290> I'm<00:03:36.290> not<00:03:36.470> gonna<00:03:36.680> use<00:03:36.950> that

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
sound right so I'm not gonna use that

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.220 
sound right so I'm not gonna use that
because<00:03:37.670> it<00:03:37.940> would<00:03:38.060> just<00:03:38.150> make<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:38.630> really<00:03:38.960> bad

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
because it would just make a really bad

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.170 
because it would just make a really bad
video<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.300> don't<00:03:41.540> want<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.950> make<00:03:43.180> something

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
video and I don't want to make something

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.120 
video and I don't want to make something
really<00:03:44.360> bad<00:03:47.170> because<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.290> don't<00:03:48.500> have<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.710> camera

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
really bad because I don't have a camera

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.530 
really bad because I don't have a camera
for<00:03:49.580> it<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.200> if<00:03:51.200> all<00:03:51.560> this<00:03:51.770> goes<00:03:51.830> well<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.820> will

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
for it so if all this goes well I will

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.040 
for it so if all this goes well I will

game that I had in mind must I quits PGA
Tour<00:05:14.020> simply<00:05:15.020> because<00:05:15.490> Gogh<00:05:16.490> is<00:05:16.850> already<00:05:17.840> a

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
Tour simply because Gogh is already a

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.420 
Tour simply because Gogh is already a
relaxing<00:05:18.800> smart<00:05:19.130> to<00:05:19.310> watch<00:05:19.690> and<00:05:20.690> I<00:05:21.380> believe<00:05:22.250> it

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
relaxing smart to watch and I believe it

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.159 
relaxing smart to watch and I believe it
would<00:05:22.490> make<00:05:22.730> a<00:05:23.260> pretty<00:05:24.260> good<00:05:24.590> guess<00:05:24.800> more

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
would make a pretty good guess more

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.390 
would make a pretty good guess more

already that though it'd be kind of
weird<00:06:34.620> and<00:06:35.150> how<00:06:36.150> it<00:06:36.360> feel<00:06:36.960> kind<00:06:37.289> of<00:06:37.729> concerned

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
weird and how it feel kind of concerned

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:43.629 
weird and how it feel kind of concerned
about<00:06:39.570> myself<00:06:40.490> and<00:06:41.490> how<00:06:41.880> my<00:06:42.240> voice<00:06:42.270> sounds<00:06:42.930> so

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
about myself and how my voice sounds so

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.680 
about myself and how my voice sounds so
hopefully<00:06:44.639> that's<00:06:44.880> not<00:06:45.229> a<00:06:47.030> question<00:06:48.030> in<00:06:48.630> your

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
hopefully that's not a question in your

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:55.510 
hopefully that's not a question in your
mind<00:06:49.010> but<00:06:50.010> uh<00:06:50.070> I<00:06:50.699> am<00:06:51.659> 17<00:06:52.620> and<00:06:53.330> I'm<00:06:54.330> from<00:06:54.810> Alabama

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
mind but uh I am 17 and I'm from Alabama

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.800 
mind but uh I am 17 and I'm from Alabama
so<00:06:56.520> if<00:06:56.610> you<00:06:56.760> can<00:06:57.320> tell<00:06:58.320> to<00:06:58.500> have<00:06:58.710> an<00:06:58.860> accent

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
so if you can tell to have an accent

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.279 
so if you can tell to have an accent
that's<00:07:00.810> why<00:07:01.080> I<00:07:01.669> thought<00:07:02.669> that<00:07:03.050> being<00:07:04.050> from

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:04.289 
that's why I thought that being from

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:08.420 
that's why I thought that being from
Alabama<00:07:04.740> I<00:07:05.130> might<00:07:06.060> be<00:07:06.270> able<00:07:06.389> to<00:07:07.010> have<00:07:08.010> a<00:07:08.099> little

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
Alabama I might be able to have a little

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.010 
Alabama I might be able to have a little
different<00:07:08.820> sound<00:07:09.150> then<00:07:10.139> mouse<00:07:10.380> whispers

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
different sound then mouse whispers

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.010 
different sound then mouse whispers
because<00:07:13.020> I<00:07:13.289> don't<00:07:13.500> know<00:07:13.680> of<00:07:13.860> many<00:07:14.070> that<00:07:14.430> are<00:07:15.020> on

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
because I don't know of many that are on

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.860 
because I don't know of many that are on
you<00:07:16.320> do<00:07:16.760> so<00:07:17.760> I<00:07:17.820> thought<00:07:18.000> that<00:07:18.150> might<00:07:18.360> be<00:07:18.419> an

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
you do so I thought that might be an

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.810 
you do so I thought that might be an
interesting<00:07:20.090> twist<00:07:21.090> on<00:07:21.449> things<00:07:21.510> oh<00:07:22.669> the<00:07:23.669> way<00:07:23.789> I

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:23.820 
interesting twist on things oh the way I

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.879 
interesting twist on things oh the way I
sound<00:07:24.919> so

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:26.889 
sound so

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:29.459 
sound so
