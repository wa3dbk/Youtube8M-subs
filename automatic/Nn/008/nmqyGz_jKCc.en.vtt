their bag and we're gonna try to figure

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.189 
their bag and we're gonna try to figure
out<00:00:17.560> why<00:00:17.980> it<00:00:18.010> happens<00:00:18.550> and<00:00:18.750> hopefully<00:00:19.750> have<00:00:20.140> a

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
out why it happens and hopefully have a

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.370 
out why it happens and hopefully have a
few<00:00:20.439> fixes<00:00:20.619> for<00:00:20.830> you<00:00:21.100> in<00:00:21.189> the<00:00:21.250> same<00:00:21.400> process

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
okay you know we're trying to figure out

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.839 
okay you know we're trying to figure out
a<00:00:25.060> why<00:00:25.510> we<00:00:25.750> chunk<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.199> golf<00:00:26.410> ball<00:00:26.679> and<00:00:26.710> B<00:00:27.099> how

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
a why we chunk the golf ball and B how

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.550 
a why we chunk the golf ball and B how
do<00:00:27.910> we<00:00:28.060> stop<00:00:28.240> doing<00:00:28.510> it<00:00:28.570> so<00:00:28.960> here<00:00:29.140> I<00:00:29.199> am<00:00:29.320> about

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
do we stop doing it so here I am about

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.800 
do we stop doing it so here I am about
ten<00:00:29.830> feet<00:00:29.980> off<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.189> green<00:00:30.550> very<00:00:31.359> scorable

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
ten feet off the green very scorable

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.690 
ten feet off the green very scorable
position<00:00:32.470> this<00:00:33.040> is<00:00:33.190> where<00:00:33.340> I<00:00:33.370> should<00:00:33.550> easily

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
position this is where I should easily

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.720 
position this is where I should easily
make<00:00:34.120> an<00:00:34.870> up-and-down<00:00:35.320> par<00:00:35.770> and<00:00:36.040> this<00:00:36.489> seems

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
make an up-and-down par and this seems

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.729 
make an up-and-down par and this seems
to<00:00:36.850> be<00:00:36.879> where<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.300> chunk<00:00:37.809> shot<00:00:38.050> will<00:00:38.260> rear

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
to be where that chunk shot will rear

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.220 
to be where that chunk shot will rear
its<00:00:38.770> ugly<00:00:38.980> head<00:00:39.219> more<00:00:40.210> often<00:00:40.390> than<00:00:40.719> not<00:00:40.780> the

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
its ugly head more often than not the

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.500 
its ugly head more often than not the
reason<00:00:41.440> for<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:41.980> chunk<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:43.030> direction

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
reason for the chunk is the direction

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.799 
reason for the chunk is the direction
that<00:00:43.719> your<00:00:43.930> spine<00:00:44.200> is<00:00:44.230> angling<00:00:44.860> at<00:00:45.160> impact<00:00:45.820> we

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
that your spine is angling at impact we

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.540 
that your spine is angling at impact we
need<00:00:46.989> to<00:00:47.110> get<00:00:47.200> our<00:00:47.559> sternum<00:00:48.039> in<00:00:48.160> front<00:00:48.430> of<00:00:48.489> the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
need to get our sternum in front of the

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.790 
need to get our sternum in front of the
golf<00:00:48.760> ball<00:00:49.030> but<00:00:49.629> that<00:00:49.780> chunk<00:00:50.230> shot<00:00:50.469> usually

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
golf ball but that chunk shot usually

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.100 
golf ball but that chunk shot usually
happens<00:00:51.190> when<00:00:51.309> our<00:00:51.579> body<00:00:51.820> goes<00:00:52.149> backwards<00:00:52.899> are

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
happens when our body goes backwards are

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.349 
happens when our body goes backwards are
you<00:00:53.379> can<00:00:53.530> see<00:00:53.710> my<00:00:53.890> spine<00:00:54.280> now<00:00:54.520> is<00:00:54.760> rotated

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
you can see my spine now is rotated

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.720 
you can see my spine now is rotated
behind<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.870> golf<00:00:56.020> ball<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.559> that's<00:00:57.460> going<00:00:57.640> to

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
behind the golf ball and that's going to

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.479 
behind the golf ball and that's going to
create<00:00:57.850> me<00:00:58.120> to<00:00:58.359> ground<00:00:58.960> out<00:00:59.170> behind<00:00:59.980> my<00:01:00.219> golf

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
create me to ground out behind my golf

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.459 
create me to ground out behind my golf
ball<00:01:00.730> and<00:01:00.940> then<00:01:01.390> we<00:01:01.660> usually<00:01:01.960> get<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.199> dreaded

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
ball and then we usually get the dreaded

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.189 
ball and then we usually get the dreaded
scoop<00:01:02.920> which<00:01:03.879> of<00:01:04.090> the<00:01:04.150> hands<00:01:04.540> continue<00:01:04.900> the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
scoop which of the hands continue the

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.950 
scoop which of the hands continue the
arm<00:01:05.350> stop<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:06.090> any<00:01:07.090> time<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:07.420> hit<00:01:07.630> behind<00:01:07.810> the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
arm stop and any time you hit behind the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.780 
arm stop and any time you hit behind the
golf<00:01:08.110> ball<00:01:08.380> like<00:01:08.590> that<00:01:08.620> it's<00:01:09.310> not<00:01:09.520> going<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.730> be

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
golf ball like that it's not going to be

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.300 
golf ball like that it's not going to be
a<00:01:09.850> very<00:01:09.970> good<00:01:10.060> shot<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.870> this<00:01:11.680> is<00:01:11.860> what<00:01:12.100> a

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
a very good shot and this is what a

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.200 
a very good shot and this is what a
chunk<00:01:12.730> shot<00:01:12.970> looks<00:01:13.510> like<00:01:17.790> okay<00:01:18.790> so<00:01:18.850> when

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
watch that display you know the chunk

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.180 
watch that display you know the chunk
shot<00:01:28.240> is<00:01:28.420> terrible<00:01:28.870> and<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.260> does<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.100> will

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
shot is terrible and it does it will

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.250 
shot is terrible and it does it will
wreck<00:01:30.400> your<00:01:30.550> round<00:01:30.790> so<00:01:31.510> let's<00:01:31.900> figure<00:01:32.050> out<00:01:32.170> how

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
wreck your round so let's figure out how

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.530 
wreck your round so let's figure out how
we<00:01:32.410> get<00:01:32.920> rid<00:01:33.070> of<00:01:33.130> it<00:01:33.280> one<00:01:33.970> cool<00:01:34.150> little<00:01:34.390> device

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
we get rid of it one cool little device

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.600 
we get rid of it one cool little device
here<00:01:34.690> is<00:01:35.080> just<00:01:35.320> it's<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.800> driveway<00:01:36.070> stick<00:01:36.460> we

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
here is just it's a driveway stick we

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.830 
here is just it's a driveway stick we
use<00:01:36.760> up<00:01:36.910> here<00:01:37.090> in<00:01:37.180> northern<00:01:37.510> parts<00:01:37.750> of

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
use up here in northern parts of

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.650 
use up here in northern parts of
Michigan<00:01:38.290> for<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.220> snowplows<00:01:39.670> it's<00:01:40.390> great

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
Michigan for the snowplows it's great

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.530 
Michigan for the snowplows it's great
it's<00:01:41.140> cheap<00:01:41.380> thin<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.580> it<00:01:42.700> has<00:01:43.150> a<00:01:43.180> bunch<00:01:43.390> of
