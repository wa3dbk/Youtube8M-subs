00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
for you is if you take little belt loops

for you is if you take little belt loops
that<00:00:33.180> pretty<00:00:33.719> much<00:00:33.840> exists<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.350> any<00:00:34.530> kind<00:00:34.739> of

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
that pretty much exists on any kind of

that pretty much exists on any kind of
short<00:00:35.219> or<00:00:35.430> pants<00:00:35.880> or<00:00:36.000> anything<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.360> that

short or pants or anything like that
what<00:00:37.170> should<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> other<00:00:38.399> side<00:00:38.899> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
what should do is on the other side you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.910 
what should do is on the other side you
cut<00:00:40.290> where<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.610> belt<00:00:41.879> loop<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.770> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
cut where the belt loop was and then you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.440 
cut where the belt loop was and then you
hot<00:00:44.250> glue<00:00:44.280> gun<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:46.140> belt<00:00:46.649> loop<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.850> inside

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
hot glue gun the belt loop to the inside

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.090 
hot glue gun the belt loop to the inside
of<00:00:49.039> the<00:00:50.039> pants<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.770> I'll<00:00:52.770> give<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
of the pants like that I'll give you

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.939 
of the pants like that I'll give you
another<00:00:53.250> example<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:54.739> it's<00:00:55.739> not

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
another example and it's not

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.670 
another example and it's not
uncomfortable<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:56.899> like<00:00:57.899> he<00:00:58.379> doesn't<00:00:58.620> even

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
uncomfortable they like he doesn't even

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.950 
uncomfortable they like he doesn't even
feel<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> big<00:00:59.670> deal<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.809> want

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
feel it it's not a big deal if you want

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.510 
feel it it's not a big deal if you want
to<00:01:01.020> get<00:01:01.140> creative<00:01:01.350> though<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.920> also<00:01:02.070> sew

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
to get creative though you can also sew

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.100 
to get creative though you can also sew
it<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.879> think<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.359> looks<00:01:03.390> better<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.840> use<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
it I think it looks better to use the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.630 
it I think it looks better to use the
hot<00:01:04.290> glue<00:01:04.320> gun<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.189> can't<00:01:05.400> see

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
hot glue gun because then you can't see

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880 
hot glue gun because then you can't see
it<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.630> an<00:01:06.840> example<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.530> what<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it but that's an example of what it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.679 
it but that's an example of what it
looks<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.520> sew<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.479> just

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
looks like to sew it on there and I just

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.960 
looks like to sew it on there and I just
used<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.080> whip<00:01:10.320> stitch

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
used a little whip stitch

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.580 
used a little whip stitch
there's<00:01:12.270> sorry<00:01:12.810> there's<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> whip<00:01:13.350> stitch

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
there's sorry there's the whip stitch

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.999 
there's sorry there's the whip stitch
and<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.100> regular<00:01:14.909> straight<00:01:15.630> stitch

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
and that's this regular straight stitch

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.520 
and that's this regular straight stitch
and<00:01:17.090> then<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> also<00:01:18.360> used<00:01:18.659> hot<00:01:18.840> glue<00:01:19.020> gun<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and then I also used hot glue gun on the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.929 
and then I also used hot glue gun on the
back<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.189> make<00:01:20.220> sure<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.610> super

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
back just to make sure it was super

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.310 
back just to make sure it was super
secure<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.259> one<00:01:22.560> way<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:24.320> using

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
secure so that's one way and so using

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.630 
secure so that's one way and so using
this<00:01:25.409> method<00:01:25.799> depending<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.189> how<00:01:26.280> many<00:01:26.340> belt

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
this method depending on how many belt

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.830 
this method depending on how many belt
loops<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.509> two<00:01:27.810> three

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
loops you have this is one two three

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.670 
loops you have this is one two three
four<00:01:28.369> five<00:01:29.369> six<00:01:29.759> seven<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.270> each<00:01:30.900> doing<00:01:31.500> this

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
four five six seven and each doing this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.140 
four five six seven and each doing this
method<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.130> each<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.549> loop<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.939> takes<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
method to each about loop it takes a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.819 
method to each about loop it takes a
little<00:01:33.240> bit<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.450> time<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.350> took<00:01:34.619> me<00:01:34.740> like

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
little bit of time and it took me like

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.770 
little bit of time and it took me like
half<00:01:34.920> an<00:01:35.159> hour<00:01:35.220> actually<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.329> don't<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.659> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
half an hour actually if you don't so it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.940 
half an hour actually if you don't so it
takes<00:01:36.990> half<00:01:37.170> an<00:01:37.290> hour<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.590> saw<00:01:37.740> us<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
takes half an hour if you saw us a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
takes half an hour if you saw us a
little<00:01:38.070> longer<00:01:38.250> obviously<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.840> there<00:01:39.960> are

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
little longer obviously so there are

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.510 
little longer obviously so there are
seven<00:01:40.259> belt<00:01:40.439> loops<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.770> here<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.340> adds

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
seven belt loops on here and it adds

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280 
seven belt loops on here and it adds
about<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.790> quarter<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.299> an<00:01:42.360> inch<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.630> each<00:01:42.960> one

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
about a quarter of an inch to each one

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.039 
about a quarter of an inch to each one
so<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.250> seven<00:01:45.119> belt<00:01:45.420> loops<00:01:45.659> then

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
so if you do all seven belt loops then

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.830 
so if you do all seven belt loops then
you<00:01:46.560> go<00:01:46.710> ahead<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.070> add<00:01:47.280> almost<00:01:48.030> two<00:01:48.540> inches

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
you go ahead and add almost two inches

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.920 
you go ahead and add almost two inches
of<00:01:49.409> fabric<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.640> waist<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.570> gives<00:01:51.810> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
of fabric to the waist so that gives you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.109 
of fabric to the waist so that gives you
a<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.140> bit<00:01:52.290> more<00:01:52.439> give<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.070> then<00:01:53.369> wear<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
a little bit more give and then wear the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.569 
a little bit more give and then wear the
shirts<00:01:54.329> again<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.590> that's<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.009> one<00:01:56.250> that's

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
shirts again so that's that one that's

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.520 
shirts again so that's that one that's
one<00:01:56.759> method<00:01:56.969> another<00:01:57.509> method<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> adding

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
one method another method is the adding

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.679 
one method another method is the adding
fabric<00:01:58.950> method<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.000> did<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.479> took<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
fabric method what I did is I took a

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.929 
fabric method what I did is I took a
little<00:02:00.960> bit<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.140> fabric<00:02:01.350> from<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> pocket<00:02:02.399> so

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
little bit of fabric from the pocket so

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.319 
little bit of fabric from the pocket so
what<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:03.960> did<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.530> basically<00:02:05.159> stitched<00:02:06.119> up

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
what I did is I basically stitched up

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.059 
what I did is I basically stitched up
one<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.719> pockets<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.409> took<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.799> fabric

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
one of the pockets and I took the fabric

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.979 
one of the pockets and I took the fabric
from<00:02:08.550> inside<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.179> pocket<00:02:09.569> make<00:02:09.720> sure<00:02:09.869> it's

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
from inside the pocket make sure it's

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.660 
from inside the pocket make sure it's
the<00:02:10.080> same<00:02:10.110> fabric<00:02:10.679> because<00:02:11.009> some<00:02:11.220> pockets

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the same fabric because some pockets

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.070 
the same fabric because some pockets
only

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
only

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.680 
only
white<00:02:12.320> on<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.650> inside<00:02:12.940> or<00:02:13.940> anywhere<00:02:14.540> else

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
white on the inside or anywhere else

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.120 
white on the inside or anywhere else
that<00:02:14.780> has<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.020> little<00:02:15.230> bit<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.500> extra<00:02:15.770> fabric

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
that has a little bit of extra fabric

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.680 
that has a little bit of extra fabric
that<00:02:16.490> you<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:16.790> kind<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.060> play<00:02:17.240> with<00:02:17.270> like<00:02:17.570> if

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
that you can kind of play with like if

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.560 
that you can kind of play with like if
there's<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.960> big<00:02:18.520> hem<00:02:19.520> at<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.910> bottom<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.540> can

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
there's a big hem at the bottom you can

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.200 
there's a big hem at the bottom you can
kind<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.930> take<00:02:21.110> off<00:02:21.230> some<00:02:21.440> of<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.620> hem<00:02:22.210> that's

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
kind of take off some of the hem that's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.430 
kind of take off some of the hem that's
a<00:02:23.270> little<00:02:23.390> bit<00:02:23.510> more<00:02:23.660> work<00:02:23.810> but<00:02:23.840> anyway<00:02:24.260> I

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
a little bit more work but anyway I

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.940 
a little bit more work but anyway I
found<00:02:24.710> place<00:02:25.190> where<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:26.410> button<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.920> the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
found place where the button to the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.720 
found place where the button to the
pocket<00:02:28.370> goes<00:02:28.520> in<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.120> cut<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.600> off<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.110> then

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
pocket goes in and I cut it off and then

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.690 
pocket goes in and I cut it off and then
I<00:02:31.730> added<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:34.040> inside

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
I added it to the inside

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.680 
I added it to the inside
I<00:02:34.730> need<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.480> cut<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.160> then<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.190> made<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:37.760> pulled<00:02:38.540> it

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
I need a cut and then I made a pulled it

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.260 
I need a cut and then I made a pulled it
apart<00:02:38.780> into<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> V<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.860> then<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.490> hot<00:02:40.760> glue<00:02:41.030> gun

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
apart into a V and then I hot glue gun

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.650 
apart into a V and then I hot glue gun
to<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.720> piece<00:02:41.960> of<00:02:42.110> fabric<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:44.090> extra<00:02:44.450> spare

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
to that piece of fabric that extra spare

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.210 
to that piece of fabric that extra spare
piece<00:02:44.840> fabric<00:02:45.170> on<00:02:45.320> there<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.740> this<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:45.890> about

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
piece fabric on there and this is about

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.940 
piece fabric on there and this is about
an<00:02:46.430> extra<00:02:46.790> inch<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.840> again<00:02:48.500> like<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.800> one

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
an extra inch and again like the one

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.320 
an extra inch and again like the one
before<00:02:49.100> we<00:02:49.400> needed<00:02:49.610> two<00:02:49.760> inches<00:02:50.000> added

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
before we needed two inches added

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.300 
before we needed two inches added
approximately<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.770> then<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:51.950> put<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.280> the

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
approximately so then I put it to the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.720 
approximately so then I put it to the
other<00:02:52.400> side<00:02:52.850> too<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.500> that's<00:02:55.220> what<00:02:55.490> it<00:02:55.580> looks

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
other side too so that's what it looks

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.880 
other side too so that's what it looks
like<00:02:55.880> from<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.090> back<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.750> don't<00:02:57.500> think<00:02:57.620> it's

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
like from the back I don't think it's

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.199 
like from the back I don't think it's
that<00:02:58.070> obvious<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.550> mean<00:02:58.580> it's<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.910> little<00:02:59.000> bit

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
that obvious I mean it's a little bit

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.550 
that obvious I mean it's a little bit
more<00:02:59.330> obvious<00:02:59.750> than<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.990> belt<00:03:00.200> loop<00:03:00.350> method

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
more obvious than the belt loop method

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.400 
more obvious than the belt loop method
but<00:03:01.459> if<00:03:01.730> you're<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.090> pinch<00:03:02.330> this<00:03:02.780> method

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
but if you're in a pinch this method

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.290 
but if you're in a pinch this method
took<00:03:03.830> about<00:03:04.010> ten<00:03:04.280> minutes<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.730> other<00:03:04.850> method

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
took about ten minutes the other method

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.300 
took about ten minutes the other method
is<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.510> little<00:03:05.570> bit<00:03:05.840> longer<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:07.100> it<00:03:07.160> just

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
is a little bit longer so it just

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.710 
is a little bit longer so it just
depends<00:03:07.640> on<00:03:07.700> how<00:03:07.760> much<00:03:08.000> time<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.330> effort<00:03:08.450> you

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
depends on how much time and effort you

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.900 
depends on how much time and effort you
want<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.959> do<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:10.130> other<00:03:10.280> great<00:03:10.550> thing<00:03:10.760> with

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
want to do the other great thing with

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.760 
want to do the other great thing with
this<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.450> then<00:03:11.570> then<00:03:11.750> they<00:03:11.959> can<00:03:12.110> still<00:03:12.320> use<00:03:12.380> the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
this is then then they can still use the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.230 
this is then then they can still use the
belt<00:03:12.950> loop<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:13.459> if<00:03:13.550> there's<00:03:13.790> somebody<00:03:13.970> that

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
belt loop so if there's somebody that

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.509 
belt loop so if there's somebody that
wears<00:03:14.390> belts<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.810> lot<00:03:14.990> then<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.470> is<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.650> handy

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
wears belts a lot then this is a handy

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.330 
wears belts a lot then this is a handy
way<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:16.790> doing<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.300> um<00:03:18.140> so<00:03:18.470> yeah<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.920> like<00:03:19.190> I

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
way of doing that um so yeah and like I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.250 
way of doing that um so yeah and like I
said<00:03:19.489> before<00:03:19.610> with<00:03:20.000> this<00:03:20.180> method<00:03:20.600> you<00:03:20.780> can

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
said before with this method you can

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.550 
said before with this method you can
also<00:03:21.410> whip<00:03:22.190> stitch<00:03:22.430> or<00:03:22.700> straight<00:03:23.090> stitch<00:03:23.560> this

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
also whip stitch or straight stitch this

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.500 
also whip stitch or straight stitch this
to<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.100> actual<00:03:25.430> fabric<00:03:25.670> if<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.120> don't<00:03:26.300> have<00:03:26.480> a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
to the actual fabric if you don't have a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.000 
to the actual fabric if you don't have a
hot<00:03:26.750> glue<00:03:26.930> gun<00:03:26.959> or<00:03:27.260> anything<00:03:27.410> like<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.680> um

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
hot glue gun or anything like that um

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.590 
hot glue gun or anything like that um
you<00:03:28.430> can<00:03:28.550> also<00:03:28.610> see<00:03:28.790> something<00:03:29.030> called<00:03:29.180> liquid

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
you can also see something called liquid

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.330 
you can also see something called liquid
stitch<00:03:29.810> in<00:03:30.110> my<00:03:30.170> experience<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.070> liquid

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
stitch in my experience the liquid

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.160 
stitch in my experience the liquid
stitch<00:03:31.519> is<00:03:31.790> expensive<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.690> doesn't<00:03:32.720> work

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
stitch is expensive and it doesn't work

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.170 
stitch is expensive and it doesn't work
that<00:03:33.350> well<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.280> would<00:03:34.580> stick<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:35.000> hot

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
that well so I would stick to the hot

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.360 
that well so I would stick to the hot
glue<00:03:35.360> gun<00:03:35.390> method<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.350> like<00:03:36.709> I<00:03:36.830> said<00:03:36.890> most<00:03:37.220> the

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
glue gun method and like I said most the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.710 
glue gun method and like I said most the
time<00:03:37.550> they<00:03:37.670> don't<00:03:37.760> even<00:03:38.000> feel<00:03:38.239> it<00:03:38.269> but<00:03:38.510> if<00:03:38.600> they

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
time they don't even feel it but if they

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.050 
time they don't even feel it but if they
do<00:03:38.780> feel<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.440> if<00:03:39.980> it's<00:03:40.100> uncomfortable<00:03:40.280> or<00:03:40.970> if

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
do feel it if it's uncomfortable or if

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.310 
do feel it if it's uncomfortable or if
it's<00:03:41.180> your<00:03:41.330> own<00:03:41.360> pants<00:03:41.720> because<00:03:41.870> I<00:03:41.959> know<00:03:42.019> my

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320
