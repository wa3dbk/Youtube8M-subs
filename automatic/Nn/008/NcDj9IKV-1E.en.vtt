00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.450
 that you are very well and good today I come 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.010
 with a video that to see if you like it is a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.660
 video about the accessories 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.839
 food that I am taking 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.520
 there are currently some that now 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.390
 that left but good more or less the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.340
 that the ones that I usually take is 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.019
 this big one here you'll see that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.470
 It seems that there is a lot but good either 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:33.540
 it is so much and they are all natural products 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.030
 good apart from taking care of them outside 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.329
 we like it very much we all have 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.180
 to take care of inside and depending on the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.610
 state of mind that we are then 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.450
 we can take some determined 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.980
 natural food supplements like 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.860
 base let's say to protect ourselves and be of 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.320
 quite high defenses as well as not the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.590
 pollen pollen this bee that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.860
 buy at any supermarket and yago 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.790
 in price and good pollen I take it for 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.640
 the morning 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.520
 with breakfast with my coffee and my coffee 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.010
 with cereals that I do not drink coffee I've 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.170
 left the morning coffee and I take 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.900
 cereals of these soluble types of 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.730
 mark for example of echo because that is not 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.460
 that it takes me time and the truth is that 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.160
 since I have left the coffee I am 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.010
 I'm much better I'm not a coffee maker 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.960
 I do not even drink coffee alone or 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.050
 nothing but in the morning I took a 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.990
 coffee with milk but since I'm 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.140
 the gas of all this natural because 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.530
 I found out that coffee what we 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.170
 does it steal calcium from our 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.970
 bones and we eliminate it in the urine as well 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.100
 that although I only had coffee with 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.430
 milk in the morning because I have eliminated it 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.520
 and I eat as I tell you horrible cereals 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.520
 I take my scala breakfast better by 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.720
 other courses the coffee with cereals 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.730
 with two teaspoons of brown sugar 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.280
 a half toast of bread 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.860
 your integral or normal depends on that 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.620
 have salted ham that always 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.020
 always always and then I take a 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.960
 teaspoon of pollen that has many 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.960
 fiber protein and it's also a great 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.390
 source of potassium and phosphorus and we 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.970
 it supplies us with the deficiencies that we can 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.070
 have if you want to start taking pollen 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.100
 do not think that if you take some 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.130
 how many days will it take effect no 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.970
 as you all know and if I do not tell you the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.820
 natural food supplements 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.580
 as well as those from outside as well as 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.340
 inside they need a time to start 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.070
 to make its effect do not think that in 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.020
 two days is no longer a difference this 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.210
 it is with constancy as I always say 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.570
 same as massages and in everything and in the 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:59.290
 life constancy pollen also by the 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:04.530
 tomorrow I drink the brewer's yeast 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:08.200
 is I have normal beer yeast and 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.870
 as I also read that the cinema is very 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.640
 important for our our 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.590
 our welfare above all of the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.140
 women, I bought this yeast 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.720
 beer with zinc you're 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.880
 all these little things like that in this brand of 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.280
 I bought the Shannon brand in the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.830
 Carrefour 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.050
 pollen at any supermarket and 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.610
 is buying an herbalist then 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.800
 this as I tell you is a yeast of 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.580
 beer that has the yeast of 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.010
 beer then group B vitamins that 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.410
 we are also going to for our 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.840
 nervous system and so that we do not have 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.770
 deficiencies of vitamins and zinc too 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.160
 they help us to have our mind a lot 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.069
 better so I take one for the 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.040
 morning and one after lunch and another one 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.280
 The night is three days a day 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.280
 plus 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:05.019
 well another thing I am a person who 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.480
 I suffer a lot from back pains and 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.819
 contracture me much back in 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.239
 general and especially the trapeze area 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.459
 cervical is what happens to me is that at 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.060
 compress me all that nerves are 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:22.300
 of the cervicals, sometimes not all 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.759
 certain handles that bother a lot 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.620
 and then when I'm passing, 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.470
 it means that even after an effort 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.470
 physical that by the physical effort has 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.830
 this contracture but by my way of 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.990
 be for all by all not one thing in 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.780
 concrete because it contracts a lot like 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.970
 I say all this area and then then to 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.949
 seasons like now for example that 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.020
 I already have almost two boats since I take 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.610
 this component that is ginkgo biloba 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.610
 which is very good for circulation 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.400
 cerebral and good I took 25 droplets 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.440
 also three times a day this in a boat 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.020
 is worth about 89 euros are bought at 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.750
 ministerial and to the 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.740
 it was very much the damn little ones that 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.379
 we can have because of the compression 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.409
 of the cervicals so I take myself 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:16.459
 this this complement of 5000 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:20.659
 what else do I tell you if you are going through or 

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:23.149
 have you gone through a time of nerves me in 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.399
 this case I have already spent 

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:30.139
 necessary is a little better because in 

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:31.550
 instead of using or going to the chemistry of 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.069
 pills that can send us the 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.959
 doctor for nerves because I 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:39.499
 It's been a long time since I took 

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:41.749
 valeriana valeriana is also from 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:44.269
 the healthy brand and is also bought in the 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:46.579
 carrefour and well these go 200 

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:49.489
 tablets is worth the new ten euros and 

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:52.489
 that lasts a lot then if you do not have 

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:54.469
 that at night you do not rest well and for 

00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:57.800
 the morning you will be very tired 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:06:01.099
 Well I recommend you to take 22 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.810
 Valerian pills at night one 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:06.120
 half an hour before going to bed 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.370
 and the truth is that it works very well 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.530
 you sleep much better and you feel the other 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.810
 much more relieved day are you that you can 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.290
 take the morning at noon and night if 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.730
 you want no no we are addictive and 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.340
 well my doctor recommended 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:23.160
 valerian or the passionflower that also 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.770
 I have to combine it can be 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.410
 combine the valeria in the passionflower or the 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:32.790
 valerian alone or lacquers and flora alone 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:35.550
 these 2 10 b appointments are for to attenuate 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:39.419
 Well, the nervousness that we may have 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.610
 a natural way and for this now 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.590
 number take this is and parrot this 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.260
 It is also a regulator of the state of 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.300
 courage these of the same brand go 100 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.830
 tablets and you have to take it 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.860
 also three times a day tomorrow 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.740
 noon and night and it's okay I took it 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.229
 when it was over, I started taking it 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.210
 we go when the summer is over and when 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:02.850
 already began the bad weather that always 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.030
 we have some changes depends on person 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:08.490
 we have a little change of mood and 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.950
 when we are better, it is worse and the 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:15.600
 period with what we do yesterday is going 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:18.180
 san juan is that he helps us to endure 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.190
 because the tension that we can have him 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.580
 regulates a little to the mood and 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.979
 This is the one I was taking about two months 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:29.190
 well and these wet algae with a lot that 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:31.560
 I feel quite better and good apart from 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.849
 all this because nothing a little bit of life 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.879
 fury 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:39.720
 exercise every day to 

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:42.480
 be well at least try 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.290
 try to do a little meditation 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.660
 every day in five minutes 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:51.690
 breathing deeply, leaving us aside 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.940
 problems that we have and good our 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.550
