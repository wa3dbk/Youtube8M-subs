and I really liked it and I thought I

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.200 
and I really liked it and I thought I
was<00:04:25.930> really<00:04:25.990> cool<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:27.340> liked<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:27.880> meaning

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
was really cool and I liked the meaning

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.070 
was really cool and I liked the meaning
of<00:04:28.330> it<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:30.280> can<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:31.450> can<00:04:31.480> always<00:04:31.810> leave

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
of it that you can you can always leave

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.300 
of it that you can you can always leave
but<00:04:32.380> that<00:04:32.560> doesn't<00:04:32.830> mean<00:04:32.890> you<00:04:33.010> can't<00:04:33.190> come

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
but that doesn't mean you can't come

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.570 
but that doesn't mean you can't come
back<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.680> think<00:04:35.860> that's<00:04:36.010> that's<00:04:36.310> pretty

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
back and I think that's that's pretty

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.380
