reviews that the head is very loose and

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.930 
reviews that the head is very loose and
mine<00:05:04.390> is<00:05:04.630> just<00:05:05.070> like<00:05:06.070> everybody<00:05:06.520> else<00:05:06.760> is

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
mine is just like everybody else is

neck is ball jointed so get some real
nice<00:05:15.870> angles<00:05:16.870> rotation<00:05:17.650> here<00:05:18.600> it<00:05:19.600> is<00:05:19.750> kind<00:05:19.990> of

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
nice angles rotation here it is kind of

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.260 
nice angles rotation here it is kind of
annoying<00:05:20.200> the<00:05:20.620> looseness<00:05:21.010> of<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.610> head<00:05:21.790> but<00:05:22.030> I

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
annoying the looseness of the head but I

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.240 
annoying the looseness of the head but I
tend<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.110> push<00:05:23.260> my<00:05:23.470> figures<00:05:23.800> rather<00:05:23.950> than<00:05:24.160> to

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
tend to push my figures rather than to

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.560 
tend to push my figures rather than to
play<00:05:24.460> with<00:05:24.640> them<00:05:24.760> so<00:05:25.350> shoulder<00:05:27.120> armor<00:05:28.120> piece

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
play with them so shoulder armor piece

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.860 
play with them so shoulder armor piece
is<00:05:28.870> connected<00:05:29.200> on<00:05:29.410> top<00:05:29.650> in<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.860> arm<00:05:30.070> and
