00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:16.460 

you

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:31.970 

you

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:55.630 

you

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.240 

there's<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.730> little<00:00:56.910> chunk<00:00:57.150> of<00:00:57.270> lead<00:00:57.450> right

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
there's a little chunk of lead right

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.850 
there's a little chunk of lead right
outside<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.310> the<00:00:59.460> jug<00:00:59.670> on<00:01:01.700> the<00:01:02.700> inside

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
outside of the jug on the inside

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:45.240 
outside of the jug on the inside
no<00:01:05.820> holes

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:02:09.230 

you

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.250 

no<00:02:10.240> killing<00:02:12.540> definitely<00:02:13.540> stayed<00:02:13.810> straight

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
no killing definitely stayed straight

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.800 
no killing definitely stayed straight
that's<00:02:15.070> kind<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.250> worried<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.550> might<00:02:15.640> come<00:02:16.570> off

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
that's kind of worried it might come off

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:29.610 
that's kind of worried it might come off
the<00:02:17.050> path<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:27.209> looks<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.330> maybe<00:02:28.810> not<00:02:29.350> much

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
the path so looks like maybe not much

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.300 
the path so looks like maybe not much
difference

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
difference

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:59.570 
difference
yeah<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:32.020> say

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.190 

you

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.900 

okay<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.260> neither<00:03:05.620> bullet<00:03:06.070> penetrated<00:03:06.640> both

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
okay so neither bullet penetrated both

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.000 
okay so neither bullet penetrated both
of<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.210> jugs<00:03:07.480> there<00:03:08.140> were<00:03:08.290> some<00:03:08.500> fragments

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
of the jugs there were some fragments

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.190 
of the jugs there were some fragments
that<00:03:09.100> were<00:03:09.220> recovered<00:03:09.550> from<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.910> ice<00:03:10.180> jug<00:03:10.570> but

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
that were recovered from the ice jug but

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.230 
that were recovered from the ice jug but
there<00:03:11.380> were<00:03:11.470> no<00:03:11.680> fragments<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.490> I<00:03:12.550> found<00:03:12.880> in

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
there were no fragments that I found in

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.750 
there were no fragments that I found in
the<00:03:13.660> water<00:03:13.900> jugs<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:15.070> I'm<00:03:15.160> gonna<00:03:15.310> give<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.730> to

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
the water jugs so I'm gonna give it to

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.590 
the water jugs so I'm gonna give it to
the<00:03:16.030> ice<00:03:16.240> by<00:03:16.990> a<00:03:17.020> hair<00:03:17.440> in<00:03:17.680> there<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.940> looks<00:03:19.240> like

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
the ice by a hair in there it looks like

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.270 
the ice by a hair in there it looks like
the<00:03:19.780> bullet<00:03:19.900> slowed<00:03:20.320> down<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.590> little<00:03:20.980> bit

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
the bullet slowed down a little bit

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.810 
the bullet slowed down a little bit
faster<00:03:21.760> in<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.940> ice<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:23.050> course<00:03:23.140> without<00:03:23.590> a

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
faster in the ice of course without a

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.550 
faster in the ice of course without a
statistically<00:03:24.820> valid<00:03:24.850> sample<00:03:25.720> size<00:03:26.110> it's<00:03:26.410> our

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
statistically valid sample size it's our

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.190 
statistically valid sample size it's our
say<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:27.120> then<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.150> should<00:03:28.360> probably<00:03:28.570> test<00:03:28.960> some

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
say and then I should probably test some

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.260 
say and then I should probably test some
more<00:03:29.230> calibers<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.010> all<00:03:30.070> that<00:03:30.280> but<00:03:30.580> it<00:03:31.060> looks

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
more calibers and all that but it looks

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.390 
more calibers and all that but it looks
like<00:03:31.450> ice<00:03:31.660> might<00:03:32.110> actually<00:03:32.350> stop<00:03:32.860> a<00:03:32.890> bullet<00:03:33.310> a

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
like ice might actually stop a bullet a

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.430 
like ice might actually stop a bullet a
little<00:03:33.640> bit<00:03:33.760> faster<00:03:34.240> than<00:03:34.360> water<00:03:34.600> what<00:03:35.290> do<00:03:35.350> you

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
little bit faster than water what do you

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.650 
little bit faster than water what do you
think<00:03:35.650> if<00:03:36.430> you've<00:03:36.550> got<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.850> time<00:03:37.090> take<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.570> look

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
think if you've got the time take a look

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.840 
think if you've got the time take a look
at<00:03:37.900> some<00:03:38.050> of<00:03:38.170> my<00:03:38.200> other<00:03:38.290> videos<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:39.160> consider
