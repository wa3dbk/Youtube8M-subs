00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.519
 hello everyone we are back in my 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.619
 desktop with a new how-to tutorial 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.900
 install the mini tesla demos pack that 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.189
 You have asked me so much starting from 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.599
 the base that I'm going to use the multi 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.090
 mc is a program that manages 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.310
 instances of minecraft and it's going to be the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.689
 tutorial in the multi mc for those who do not 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.460
 have I will leave the download link to 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.469
 the description of the video along with this 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.059
 from here that is the list of mods and all 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:35.340
 the real ones where they are downloaded are worth 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.899
 to facilitate a little work 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.370
 because I was missing this fall page 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.260
 but good when you go up to the description 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 the video will already be uploaded 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.530
 I imagine well let's go with 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.000
 it 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.590
 I will leave you in the description of 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.210
 video I'm also here this is here 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.680
 the configuration folder that is the one 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.340
 will avoid that you give conflicts the mods 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.940
 between them and on the other hand 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.470
 ok let's start to see start we 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.260
 here I have created the instance of 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.940
 minis led mini tesla but that show you 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.160
 To create new distance install forge 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.280
 install of mini tesla click on new 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.960
 instance load to the version of the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.550
 Minecraft versions make sure of 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.940
 that is in 151 because it could come out 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.530
 the 152 it seems to me that it comes out here not 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.790
 good some snapshot or something to have 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.650
 Be careful with this one, make sure that it is 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.570
 the 151 I'm going to call it example 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.300
 example because I already have half is the 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.770
 created but it will be exactly the same 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.770
 once we have the instance created it 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.570
 we give edith mods mc forge and go to 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.090
 upload the list of minecraft mods 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.040
 because I in the demos pack 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.480
 installed the 676 I recommend installing 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.340
 always the last to avoid the 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.350
 problems so let's go here ok 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.880
 and it's going to start downloading 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.189
 bad one stop minecraft forge 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.549
 installed we will bite 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.690
 view folder we went up one level and we 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.210
 open this folder here which is where 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.830
 is the minecraft well then now with 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.930
 this open folder we go again to 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.450
 point and put the folder 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.190
 configuration is worth with this we can already 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.740
 install the mods without problem that no 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.140
 they will give conflicts well to see one thing 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.300
 important in the list of mods there 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.250
 several mods that are essential for 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.480
 the generation of land that are the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.940
 universal electricity the theme of 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.260
 expansion and zinc is construct are 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.400
 the three most important because the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.190
 generation of land is based on 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.630
 those three mods are worth if there are any of 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.010
 Those three missing modes are not going to 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.019
 generate some you can be if you remove 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.030
 team kers neither copper nor 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.370
 tin if you remove the universal 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.370
 electricity will not charge in the omnium 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.920
 the sound good and on the other hand if 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.360
 you remove factoring does not come out the silver 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.950
 this is one that had left me balin 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.080
 I had forgotten 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.580
 well said this we will not mark it 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.590
 with an asterisk something like that surely the 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.819
 description of the video is where it goes 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.660
 be the list of many so do not you 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.830
 you have to worry about that to see a 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.030
 Once we have created the instance with the 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.550
 folder with center purpose the only thing that 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.160
 would go to the url the mods and download 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.569
 those who want more essentials without 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.999
 the essentials will not throw well 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.420
 we want you to install 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:15.219
 less the three or do not do anything and if 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.249
 has them installed better than better 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.999
 the rest and download what you want 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.620
 taking into account those that are 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.569
 obligatory for example that you do not want 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.310
 the cartographer or the twilight forest nor 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.930
 the extra bis as you do not put it and it is already 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.790
 the forester and we like it so you take it 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.819
 along with the clear extra bis because 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.530
 depends the forestry she is well a 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.569
 Once this is done I am going to catch those 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.720
 I have created not because I am willing to walk 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.480
 downloading the again 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.460
 for example we want them because I want 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.060
 these three as these three the folder 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.630
 with the mod 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.690
 that I want all of these from here 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.920
 except good these two that are versions 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.530
 old if they wear the version 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.510
 updated that I do not want in computer 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.160
 craft and I do not want the play readers either 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.709
 nor the omni tools for example and the rest 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.110
 I love them all because this copied it to the 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.340
 folder mods realize that this 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.780
 you have had to download 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.480
 I'm not going to give you the page of the 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.470
 mods package is worth once we have this 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.990
 we open through the multi mece 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.480
 we give it here to watch should the 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.200
 list of mods we close we maximize the 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.959
 another window that I have left 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.370
 small and we execute good I'll have to 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.530
 save the password 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.500
 once written download the minecraft 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.930
 download the forge and execute all good 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.690
 As you can see, 40 and 42 mods have been executed 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.220
 without any problems and if 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.970
 we created a game because there is no 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.970
 no problem 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.130
 well a little general world you know 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.130
 as usual 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.569
 Well, here you have a version of 

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:53.149
 stable mini tesla with the mods that 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:54.799
 you are chosen and downloaded and with this 

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:56.359
 you can start playing so nothing 

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:58.999
 I hope you liked the tutorial 

00:04:56.359 --> 00:05:02.409
 that you liked him and see you 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:02.409
