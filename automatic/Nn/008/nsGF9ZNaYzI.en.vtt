thinking okay I better record it

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.519 
thinking okay I better record it
blocking<00:00:24.119> against<00:00:24.660> him<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.869> really<00:00:25.230> good<00:00:25.410> if

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
blocking against him is really good if

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.529 
blocking against him is really good if
you<00:00:25.619> know<00:00:25.769> when<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.160> block<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.390> can

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
you know when to block because it can

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.259 
you know when to block because it can
just<00:00:28.199> something<00:00:28.439> quite<00:00:28.650> easily<00:00:28.800> but<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.519> was

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
just something quite easily but I was

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.510 
just something quite easily but I was
quite<00:00:30.480> happy<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:30.960> how<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.320> went<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:34.520> think

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
quite happy with how this went I think

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.310 
quite happy with how this went I think
this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.760> good<00:00:35.910> run<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.329> recommend<00:00:36.989> when<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.479 
this is a good run I recommend when you
have<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> moment<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.890> using<00:00:38.340> high

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
have a moment like that using high

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.569 
have a moment like that using high
potions<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.180> cure<00:00:39.590> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:41.070> handy<00:00:41.370> and

I potions are really used to obtain so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.020 
I potions are really used to obtain so

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
I didn't actually get in this we're

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.979 
I didn't actually get in this we're
basically<00:00:59.320> he<00:01:00.100> summons<00:01:00.789> keyblades<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:01.929> you

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
basically he summons keyblades and you

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.170 
basically he summons keyblades and you
can<00:01:02.140> take<00:01:02.350> them<00:01:02.589> from<00:01:02.829> him<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.250> you<00:01:04.030> can

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
can take them from him and you can

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.330 
can take them from him and you can
pretty<00:01:04.390> much<00:01:04.479> destroy<00:01:05.110> this<00:01:05.350> like<00:01:05.619> final<00:01:06.100> form

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
but more powerful I think it's really

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.639

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
quite a bit in that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.930
