00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.730

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.160
 this console a console that everyone 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.350
 they wanted to fuck you 20 years ago but 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.240
 however everyone would have wanted it while 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.010
 the money designed the playstation 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.990

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.750
 in hand except May, which however is 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.490
 was arrested for harassment of the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.260
 colleagues who also the older ones 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.439
 which they are not were spared 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.110
 mario pervert so we decided to 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.270
 Give the world the ics hicks box 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.010
 the console that would revolutionize both 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.440
 the gaming sector and that's it 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.629
 pharmaceutical like because its games 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.489
 highly frantic they would have done 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.890
 convulsions even yours 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.530
 neighbour 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.289
 wow wow and console 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.180
 after more than 20 years of work we had to 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.610
 only more to design the console but alas 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.100
 the threshold had already presented the play 1 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.960
 lap the two thieves 3 and the naples 4 then 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.550
 could have done things in a hurry to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.500
 give the world the console he would have 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.720
 well revolutionize your mother said 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.100
 this box we find the console that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.900
 will revolutionize the world 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.409
 but we hear the words of Giorgio 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.049
 holder of single player puntocom floor 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.659
 tract of video games as the currency 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.619
 our console first I want to see the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.700
 money and then yes this is the best of the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.220
 world 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.009
 why should i choose ps4 when i can 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.729
 have the hicks box that can't stand 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.729
 not even the hd 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:40.290
 I give them 15 out of 10 to say a vote 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.150
 deserved for this console but now 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.460
 let's find out the contents almost 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.380
 my hands are shaking like I am 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.110
 see the twenty years of work for the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.979
 box have paid off 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.079
 and they are also good I think google to his 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.180
 inside we can find a very small one 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.530
 it is very practical for every power supply 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.940
 Now 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.100
 play with designers to suck 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.750
 also the soul while if you will play for 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.119
 two hours in a row, then paying for cooking 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.619
 bill would heal the public debt on 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.700
 which is good with this country now 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.009
 is giving up 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.110
 then we can also find a ram that 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.330
 we forgot to install is a 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.190
 ultra comfortable joypad as you see we have 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.780
 removed all unnecessary keys for 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.300
 give you a gaming experience indeed 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.120
 only I know maybe it sucks but 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.190
 however it will remain unique as you see the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.140
 ergonomic shape of this joypad 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.180
 reminiscent of the fucking hina 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.440
 chocolate bars which will work 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.840
 as a remedy for our videos 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.580
 extremely obese players because one 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.190
 time I bite this material highly 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.620
 toxic will enter the blood that I am 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.300
 it will spread instantly and then into 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.100
 later days at the hospital you will lose 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.140
 really a lot of pounds there 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.970
 believed enough then we feel in 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.430
 videoconference doctor cottolengo 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.200
 one patient on one dies donates one euro 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.140
 thanks ocre where the piece that everyone 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.959
 they were waiting for the beautiful ones 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.370
 sexy gaming headphones are so beautiful 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.720
 that I would like to imitate them at dinner and then 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.579
 have fun in the night 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.010
 as you can see they are equipped with a classic 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.290
 cable jack unfortunately the console does not have 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.989
 spaces to insert one you can piccard 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.239
 supreme sails and I'm pretty sure that 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.370
 someone will like everyone well 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.680
 forgot the console as you see in 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.579
 we have this fantastic console 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.290
 forgotten hdmi blu ray reader cable of 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.450
 network in short we have forgotten a little 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.519
 of things but in return we left 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.299
 the cassette player and the internet 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.310
 explorer 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.290
 obviously without internet as you will be 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.850
 thinking it won't work but it does n't matter 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.829
 because he would have made so much change 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.350
 however, all serious omissions 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.750
 will be sold individually shops 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.730
 computer science or military engineering but 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.630
 we will see each other on February 3rd for 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.269
 out of the box the stone of 499 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:56.200
 euro that is for us closed but it must be said that 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.200
 they included so many ports they buy it
