the<00:00:50.430> vowels<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:51.210> learned<00:00:51.480> before<00:00:51.750> all<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the vowels we learned before all have a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.970 
the vowels we learned before all have a
long<00:00:53.340> vertical<00:00:53.640> stroke<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:55.230> new<00:00:55.649> vols

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
long vertical stroke and this new vols

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.689 
long vertical stroke and this new vols
have<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> long<00:00:57.120> horizontal<00:00:57.539> stroke<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.530> fact<00:00:59.370> if

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
have a long horizontal stroke in fact if

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.959 
have a long horizontal stroke in fact if
you<00:01:00.420> rotated<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.170> first<00:01:01.440> five<00:01:01.710> vowels<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
you rotated the first five vowels you

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.569 
you rotated the first five vowels you
would<00:01:03.149> end<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.079> new<00:01:04.799> vowels<00:01:05.280> we're

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
would end up with the new vowels we're

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.660 
would end up with the new vowels we're
going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.029> learn<00:01:06.209> today<00:01:06.950> when<00:01:07.950> writing<00:01:08.310> the

going to learn today when writing the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.389 
going to learn today when writing the
levels<00:01:09.029> in<00:01:09.209> Korean<00:01:09.539> it's<00:01:10.350> important<00:01:11.009> to<00:01:11.369> think

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
levels in Korean it's important to think

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.669 
levels in Korean it's important to think
about<00:01:11.759> whether<00:01:12.179> the<00:01:12.450> vowel<00:01:12.689> you're<00:01:13.109> using<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679 
about whether the vowel you're using is

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:17.269 
about whether the vowel you're using is
a<00:01:13.709> total<00:01:14.369> or<00:01:14.700> effect<00:01:15.450> fall<00:01:15.719> the<00:01:16.649> reason<00:01:17.039> is

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:17.279 
a total or effect fall the reason is

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.249 
a total or effect fall the reason is
that<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:17.969> you<00:01:18.029> assemble<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> characters

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
that the way you assemble the characters

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.609 
that the way you assemble the characters
into<00:01:19.799> blocks<00:01:20.069> will<00:01:20.849> change<00:01:21.179> depending<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.959> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
into blocks will change depending on the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.940 
into blocks will change depending on the
shape<00:01:22.889> of<00:01:23.099> the<00:01:23.249> vowel<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:24.389> example<00:01:24.959> you<00:01:25.799> know

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
shape of the vowel for example you know

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.039 
shape of the vowel for example you know
what<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.279> do<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:26.789> the<00:01:26.939> wall<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.149> tall<00:01:27.749> right

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
what to do when the wall is tall right

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.039 
what to do when the wall is tall right
you<00:01:29.009> add<00:01:29.219> the<00:01:29.490> consonant<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.479> left<00:01:30.719> of<00:01:30.929> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you add the consonant to the left of the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.339 
you add the consonant to the left of the
vowel<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:32.249> if<00:01:32.399> the<00:01:32.579> vowel<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.029> fat<00:01:33.359> you<00:01:34.169> would

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:34.349 
vowel but if the vowel is fat you would

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:37.370 
vowel but if the vowel is fat you would
add<00:01:34.529> the<00:01:34.740> consonant<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.459> top<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:36.899> about<00:01:37.169> it

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
add the consonant on top think about it

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.039 
add the consonant on top think about it
like<00:01:37.649> this<00:01:37.759> you<00:01:38.759> need<00:01:39.029> to<00:01:39.149> fill<00:01:39.359> up<00:01:39.389> a<00:01:39.659> square

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
like this you need to fill up a square

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.190 
like this you need to fill up a square
so<00:01:40.859> the<00:01:41.039> consonant<00:01:41.579> adjust<00:01:41.999> to<00:01:42.569> fill<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> rest

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
so the consonant adjust to fill the rest

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.010 
so the consonant adjust to fill the rest
of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.529> space<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.389> first<00:01:45.659> five
