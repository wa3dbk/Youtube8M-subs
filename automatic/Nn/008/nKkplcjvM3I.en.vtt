from<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.200> it<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.340> does<00:01:02.490> the<00:01:02.580> same<00:01:02.790> kind<00:01:02.820> of

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
from there it just does the same kind of

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.990 
from there it just does the same kind of
pattern<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.720> starting<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.500> new<00:01:05.129> note<00:01:05.460> so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
pattern but starting on that new note so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.180 
pattern but starting on that new note so
that<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:06.600> would<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:10.880> from<00:01:11.880> there

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100

take one section and get it down so you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.660 
take one section and get it down so you

probably want to start at the top and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:32.140 
probably want to start at the top and
just<00:02:19.850> go<00:02:23.980> get<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.070> much<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:31.150> well

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
downstroke and thing that really keeps

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.980 
downstroke and thing that really keeps
me<00:02:36.350> on<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.500> ball<00:02:36.770> doing<00:02:37.370> this<00:02:37.610> is

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
me on the ball doing this is

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.500 
me on the ball doing this is
concentrating<00:02:38.990> on<00:02:39.080> where<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.440> left<00:02:39.650> hand

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
concentrating on where the left hand

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.270 
concentrating on where the left hand
shifts<00:02:41.510> positions<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.260> for<00:02:42.680> some<00:02:42.860> reason<00:02:43.160> it

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
shifts positions and for some reason it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.890 
shifts positions and for some reason it
always<00:02:43.460> ends<00:02:43.760> up<00:02:43.820> being<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:44.150> down<00:02:44.330> stroke<00:02:44.660> there

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
always ends up being a down stroke there

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.850 
always ends up being a down stroke there
so<00:02:45.110> if<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.380> sync<00:02:45.710> up<00:02:45.920> my<00:02:46.520> left<00:02:46.730> hand<00:02:46.970> shifts<00:02:47.420> and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
so if I sync up my left hand shifts and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.770 
so if I sync up my left hand shifts and
my<00:02:48.860> down<00:02:49.040> stroke<00:02:49.400> seems<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.790> help<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:50.000> lot<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:50.720> I

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
my down stroke seems to help a lot so I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.860 
my down stroke seems to help a lot so I
concentrated<00:02:51.020> on<00:02:51.350> going<00:02:53.230> down<00:02:55.330> down<00:02:56.330> because

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
concentrated on going down down because

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.390 
concentrated on going down down because
those<00:02:57.050> are<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.200> two<00:02:57.380> shifts<00:02:58.390> down<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.830> I

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
those are the two shifts down and I

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.160 
those are the two shifts down and I
found<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:02.060> really<00:03:02.420> keeps<00:03:02.600> me<00:03:02.750> in<00:03:02.840> sync

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
found that that really keeps me in sync

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.620 
found that that really keeps me in sync
with<00:03:03.290> my<00:03:03.470> two<00:03:03.530> hands<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.300> let<00:03:05.300> me<00:03:05.360> play<00:03:05.510> the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
with my two hands so let me play the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.930 
with my two hands so let me play the
