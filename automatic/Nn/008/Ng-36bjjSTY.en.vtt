00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.880
 Hi, I'm not crazy and it's starting more 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.719
 a bar of the cami today on the video 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.090
 retrospective 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.679
 however before you start the video a trick 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.750
 of magic to relax 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.750
 This is my thumb, there is no 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.220
 oh my God, by no means 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.410
 felipe thiago questioned how the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.420
 will be the first will be 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.230
 the request was not processed in the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.060
 cruise village 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.250
 the PT was received on my cruise 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.290
 but he was no longer an enemy in the galley 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.080
 already're more to an anti hero 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.730
 the mister souza he asked what the name 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.760
 of the Frisa breed 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.950
 they say on the internet there are some 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.470
 magazines until the name of the radio 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.690
 ufs changeling but this is not a 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.059
 official information has none 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.760
 error has no official publication 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.350
 and such and must have been invented by 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.360
 someone to really refer to 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.260
 But atrophy is that you can separate 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.280
 the name changeling net kuchen of change 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.780
 changing it is something that the cold already 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.700
 long ago someone must have created 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.369
 that name more or less thinking about the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 they change a lot so it is not enough to 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.200
 most just had not're one odelin brat 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.010
 xandinho 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.530
 maybe maybe it's better not even xandinho 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.170
 but it's not, it's not, it's not, it does not exist 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.830
 Information which is the name of fifa 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.790
 renan 00774 said nelson got a 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:46.060
 doubt the frisa still voice 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.450
 I live the pair of the villain our dear 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.280
 carlos campanile and we hope that 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.450
 he is in the pack the freezer in the year he 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.580
 Come on, come on, play. 4 said I'm with a 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.800
 hypothesis in the head because who saw 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.630
 remember that facebook and the edict will be that 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.900
 he will kill fries with some kind of 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.900
 revenge 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.360
 I find it very difficult for this to happen. 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.250
 but perhaps at some point the chorus 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.769
 moment of anger you will see and hear 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.030
 bottle can hit a kick a 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.310
 just gonna know 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.110
 and talking about deaths and remembered that I did it 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.330
 mattel the wildcard alias that was the joke 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.010
 that everyone did the workshop will come back 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
 and die and die if not already died 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.549
 When did you know that I did it ? 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.989
 to return there 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.820
 that the son has killed several people 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.910
 not only by me but prevented from 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.569
 to sell I have a feeling 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.730
 feeling at 20 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.680
 I'm feeling I'm feeling someone 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.629
 more women movie because I do not know if 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.150

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:47.049
 no terraces and no character of the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.799

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:58.269
 But the video did not end 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.180

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:05.319

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.750
 It was something to change for you. I did. 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.430
 this retrospective video highlights of course 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.900
 because I did go back to a new 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.239

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.159

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.769
