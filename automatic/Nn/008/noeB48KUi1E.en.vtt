 this bait is absolutely unanimous and 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.639

 with a length of 33 millimeters a wobbler has a weight 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.240
 3 plans grams which suggests 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.700
 about good flight characteristics 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.669
 models lure size of 44 millimeters 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.440
 will be able to throw much further 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:23.500
 This model differs from the previous one 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.990
 that 44 is longer by one whole one 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.440

 rather large predator but fine 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.960
 working even on small solitary 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:43.780
 Whose lure weight is 7 grams 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.030

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:56.000
 I still have bait and others 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.650
 manufacturers try to catch them 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.110

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.389
