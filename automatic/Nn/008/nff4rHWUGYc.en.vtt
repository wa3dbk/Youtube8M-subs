 to get some data on the 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.030
 born within is important for 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.460
 chewing and for management but also 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.440
 has a synthetic paper the tooth is 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.050
 covered with an outer layer called 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.290
 hard and white color enamels 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.700
 that allow them to bite to tear and crush 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:53.330
 low-enamel food finds this 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.230
 yellow girl - hard and that 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:00.140
 constitutes the major part of the inside 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.150
 center within the party and China is 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.500
 pulp known as nerve 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.500
 also contains blood vessels 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.259
 due to a blow 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.850
 the detainee may leave if the 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.850
 will depend on the severity of the fracture 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.130

 by a composite resin this has the 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.690
 inconvenient to be sensitive to 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.640
 dyes tea coffee and tobacco and stone 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.280
 to win in a dangerous way 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 for this reason the most advisable is 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.470
 have the prosthesis technician publish 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.470
 the missing ceramic fragment 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.740
 after a fracture 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.569
 They are needed regular visits to 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.770
 dentist to arise from health

 perfect dissident 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.869
 however it is not always possible to maintain 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.429
 inside with life 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.160
 In such cases it is appropriate to 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:07.220
 wind operation which consists of removing the 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:12.200
 pulp in its entirety and replace it 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.819
 by an operating material only the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.380
 placement of a ceramic crown 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.380
 may establish aesthetics
