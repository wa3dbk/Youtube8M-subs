00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 all that this video to answer 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.240
 for as much the big subjects rather to follow a lot of blows on the net in this 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.419
 moment we get the problem for chris o donnell wildlife 4 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.669
 if apparently understood attacks against sony 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.169
 could not on the part courchevel wildlife especially we sleep 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.430
 2 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.430
 so poor because I'm a little fed up with your students 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.689
 on the net we find san suu kyi and tourcoing problem if we even 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.499
 not worth it they have 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.500
 I completely useless because they no longer have a penny catena 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.880
 absolutely by more problems 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.720
 künzle ceo truphone 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.120
 q 'smartphones' sauces 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.200
 so for me it's a small feat when you break 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.240
 why turkey 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.340
 to the firmware 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.170
 80 0 points 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.560
 meet 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.980
 the phone 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.199
 supported 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.199
 left parties béthune two reasons 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900
 3by horizon 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.860
 bordeaux network 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.899
 the g6 and on iphone 3gs is exactly the same as if m 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.870
 so I expected 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.240
 we have in a few words 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.300
 rather low 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.550
 network 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.550
 we were at four a few 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.550
 so here I think that m 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.670
 just that these people have found their expensive cost on the fake 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.960
 plaster 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.040
 so the good 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.540
 but without looking for the little beast 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.500
 the weather 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.630
 when you have 5 years of mental age 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.340
 you must always look for the little beast 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.280
 it amuses them 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 they make talk 2 on December 30 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.060
 and unfortunately everyone follows all the sheep to follow they are 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.079
 happy to end up on the iphone 4 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.249
 either there will be a game because they are not the means to buy a prize 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.709
 actively fluctuate all over all mail 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.929
 a raffle 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:23.999
 for me 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.519
 so the problem 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.519
 and just as well on the links us even 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.629
 on the sand under my team 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.229
 on them 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.919
 blackberry in bed 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.099
 and it's clear 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.069
 happy man 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.229
 I tested on a lot of laptops the same problem comes from 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.789
 so we know polynice like on the iphone 3gs rocker to exceed memory worse 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.269
 eq it was rare 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.370
 polemics on the 3g and that safely it's curious 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.039
 it occupies a little more 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.989
 as a camera with its lands 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.050
 so there was nothing wrong with the iphone 4 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.989
 stock market title 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.949
 we will talk 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.349
 to the priests 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.399
 we will be mistaken for good but unfortunately 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:17.399
 you are 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.679
 also to answer I saw on the net just as a calm 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.329
 let's open our eyes photos for example men 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.729
 of the local wildlife pub iphone 4 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.729
 their power on the pictures tonight on paris 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.849
 swell the pq holds so his iphone like that during when he made his vision 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.519
 so 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.629
 for all useful that includes five is he pursuing everything on the site just for 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.309
 we draw life the ofc listed it seems to me that if wifi 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:52.599
 so it has nothing to do with the edges 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.549
 so had the course when returning it 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.609
 without wanting to offend you 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.639
 2 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.879
 much more to the trouble 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.879
 for loses all his shares of resolve focone gillette 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.209
 item for hair in four 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 and for then to break the peace the world drill 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.519
 for the current month demonstrates dupuch counts because he is supported by a 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.519
 shape why 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.469
 online harassment 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.069
 I'm not a fanboy 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.159
 I'm not a fan 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.889
 I want 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.909
 it takes just a little late 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.909
 love at first sight pay me this lack of quality 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.199
 and a client 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.400
 they put forward a good reputation of universe time of 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.319
 phones 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.009
 thank you all 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:49.539
