so<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:06.190> ranged<00:04:06.670> my<00:04:06.820> songs<00:04:07.090> here<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.720> decide

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
so you ranged my songs here and decide

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.050 
so you ranged my songs here and decide
happy<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:10.060> slow<00:04:10.570> and<00:04:11.459> most<00:04:12.459> month<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:12.910> the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.520 

it's<00:04:19.070> quite<00:04:19.340> neat

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
it's quite neat

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.700 
it's quite neat
so<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:22.130> really<00:04:22.310> ranges<00:04:22.670> 54<00:04:23.270> fastest<00:04:23.810> fast<00:04:24.140> slow

is brilliant

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.620 
is brilliant
that<00:04:50.060> they<00:04:50.210> add<00:04:50.360> podcast<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.860> audiobook
