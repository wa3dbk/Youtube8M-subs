00:00:02.683 --> 00:00:03.683
 Bigbag! 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.736
 Yes ~~ Bigbag shoulder (above Bigbag!) 

00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:12.021
 uh? uh? uh? uh! Yes 

00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:15.524
 uh? uh? uh? uh! 

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:18.015
 ZE: A! 

00:00:21.374 --> 00:00:22.374
 Zea Five Anti 

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:26.261
 The day I broke up with you 

00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:32.047
 Omissing oil 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.683
 After you leave 

00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:37.493
 I can not do anything. 

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:40.926
 Me place 

00:00:43.413 --> 00:00:44.946
 You could write a lot 

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:48.961
 How about you? 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.710
 I'm going to save you now 

00:00:57.806 --> 00:00:58.806
 It's dull. 

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:04.046
 Since then. 

00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:05.991
 He cares. 

00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.471
 I can forget you (sir) 

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.637
 Leave it alone! You 

00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:12.991
 Why? 

00:01:13.888 --> 00:01:14.005
 I'll still forget you, though. 

00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:16.231
 I want to go without a swing. 

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:17.678
 The day I broke up with you 

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:20.674
 Momi cries too. 

00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:21.713
 After you have accumulated 

00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:24.221
 I feel sick. 

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:26.521
 It's all about that. 

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:29.712
 I'm angry and crazy. 

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.591
 I broke up with you. 

00:01:34.516 --> 00:01:35.582
 I hug the fry. 

00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:37.911
 Leave me to the ground 

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.531
 I can not feel it. 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.190
 Come back to me. 

00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:44.748
 I'm angry and crazy. 

00:01:46.547 --> 00:01:46.777
 The day you haired with me 

00:01:48.183 --> 00:01:49.916
 I've been a star all day 

00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:52.541
 I had a long ring, 

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:55.431
 The world without the swing is different from the gold. 

00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:00.131
 When the time goes ~~~~ 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.529
 Even if I look at you, I can use clothes. 

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:04.055
 That's it. 

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:06.192
 She cares. 

00:02:07.016 --> 00:02:08.616
 This is how you do it. 

00:02:10.017 --> 00:02:11.550
 But why are you sick? 

00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:12.907
 Why do not you 

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:15.499
 But I'll forget you. 

00:02:16.056 --> 00:02:17.087
 I want to live without a swing. 

00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:19.091
 The day you haired with me 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.170
 I cry a lot. 

00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:20.987
 After you have accumulated 

00:02:22.755 --> 00:02:23.888
 My chest hurts. 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.116
 It's all about that. 

00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:29.787
 I was angry and crazy. 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.805
 I'll break up with you! 

00:02:34.194 --> 00:02:35.260
 I hug the fry. 

00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:37.735
 Leave me to the earth 

00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:39.092
 I do not feel it. 

00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:41.464
 Come back. Come back. 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.756
 I'm angry and crazy. 

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:46.721
 The day you haired with me 

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:49.355
 You look stunned 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.205
 Why I'm sadder 

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.507
 I own a business. 

00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:00.967
 I can not forget you now 

00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:05.281
 I cry a lot. 

00:03:06.226 --> 00:03:08.092
 After you have accumulated 

00:03:08.186 --> 00:03:09.519
 My heart was sore. 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.956
 That's all a lie. 

00:03:13.224 --> 00:03:14.824
 I got angry and angry. 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.679
 I'm going to hurt you. 

00:03:18.976 --> 00:03:20.042
 I hug the fry. 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.160
 He left with me. 

00:03:22.992 --> 00:03:24.392
 It is not textured. 

00:03:24.752 --> 00:03:25.885
 Tora Wah Dharma 

00:03:28.256 --> 00:03:29.722
 I'm angry and crazy. 

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:33.936
 The day you haired up with me ~
