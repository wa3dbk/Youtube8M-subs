00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
ever done before my channel and I feel

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.660 
ever done before my channel and I feel
this<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.080> good<00:01:16.350> way<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:16.979> doing<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.430> don't

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.460 
this is a good way of doing it and don't
get<00:01:17.729> me<00:01:17.790> wrong<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.450> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.720> concept<00:01:18.990> has

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
get me wrong this kind of concept has

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.469 
get me wrong this kind of concept has
been<00:01:19.500> dabbed<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> bit<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
been dabbed on a bit but it really I

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.270 
been dabbed on a bit but it really I
really<00:01:21.869> haven't<00:01:22.170> seen<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.590> around<00:01:22.830> for

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
really haven't seen it around for

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.390 
really haven't seen it around for
literally<00:01:24.090> over<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> year<00:01:24.689> now<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:25.979> feel<00:01:26.280> like

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
literally over a year now so I feel like

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.010 
literally over a year now so I feel like
it's<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.670> good<00:01:26.820> opportunity<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.330> me<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.600> go<00:01:27.869> in

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
it's a good opportunity for me to go in

got Dennis Bergkamp in the striker
position<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:48.240> would<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.720> team<00:01:48.960> that

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229

for example if repair to match with this
team<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.860> we're<00:01:55.979> doing<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.280> idea<00:01:57.200> if<00:01:58.200> Dennis

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
team if we're doing this idea if Dennis

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.740 
team if we're doing this idea if Dennis
Bergkamp<00:01:58.860> scored<00:01:59.430> or<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.969> won<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.270> match<00:02:00.450> then

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
Bergkamp scored or we won the match then

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.359 
Bergkamp scored or we won the match then
we<00:02:00.869> could<00:02:00.899> take<00:02:01.229> say<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.799> other<00:02:01.920> team<00:02:02.100> had

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
we could take say that other team had

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.090 
we could take say that other team had
say<00:02:02.610> Willian<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.450> their<00:02:03.960> team<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.799> could

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
say Willian in their team then I could

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.190 
say Willian in their team then I could
take<00:02:05.340> out<00:02:05.460> William<00:02:05.790> from<00:02:05.969> their<00:02:06.149> team<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.630> use

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
take out William from their team and use

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.339 
take out William from their team and use
him<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.680> my<00:02:08.009> team<00:02:08.280> writing<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.060> team<00:02:09.239> that

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
him in my team writing that team that

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.230 
him in my team writing that team that
however<00:02:10.349> if<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.950> were<00:02:11.129> using

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
however if we were using

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.870 
however if we were using
this<00:02:13.050> team<00:02:13.320> here<00:02:13.620> which<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> hybrid<00:02:14.790> that

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
this team here which is the hybrid that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.990 
this team here which is the hybrid that
I've<00:02:15.030> made<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:16.260> will<00:02:16.500> be<00:02:16.680> shown<00:02:17.040> shortly<00:02:17.790> as

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
I've made it will be shown shortly as

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.870 
I've made it will be shown shortly as
you<00:02:18.240> can<00:02:18.360> see<00:02:18.510> here<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.930> team<00:02:19.700> we've<00:02:20.700> got

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
you can see here the team we've got

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.340 
you can see here the team we've got
quite<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.120> few<00:02:21.390> highly<00:02:21.690> rated<00:02:21.840> players<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.260> this

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
quite a few highly rated players in this

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.010 
quite a few highly rated players in this
team<00:02:22.560> don't<00:02:22.800> get<00:02:22.920> me<00:02:23.010> wrong<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.720> would<00:02:24.990> be

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
team don't get me wrong and it would be

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.840 
team don't get me wrong and it would be
kind<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.440> stupid<00:02:25.890> ish<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.220> add<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.610> players

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
kind of stupid ish to add the players

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.210 
kind of stupid ish to add the players
from<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.360> other<00:02:27.600> opponents<00:02:28.380> team<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.010> put

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
from the other opponents team and put

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.410 
from the other opponents team and put
them<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.580> squad<00:02:29.790> because<00:02:29.910> it's<00:02:30.090> got<00:02:30.210> full

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
them in this squad because it's got full

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.300 
them in this squad because it's got full
chemistry<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.050> team<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.350> pretty<00:02:31.590> good<00:02:32.070> as<00:02:32.190> it

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
chemistry this team is pretty good as it

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.120 
chemistry this team is pretty good as it
as<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.580> can<00:02:32.730> see<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.380> so<00:02:34.380> what<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.590> would<00:02:34.770> do<00:02:34.920> if

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
as you can see and so what I would do if

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.430 
as you can see and so what I would do if
I<00:02:35.250> was<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.550> use<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.940> team<00:02:36.270> then<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.170> would

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
I was to use this team then I would

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.950 
I was to use this team then I would
basically<00:02:37.740> create<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.670> second<00:02:39.210> team<00:02:39.390> with<00:02:39.720> all

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
basically create a second team with all

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.150 
basically create a second team with all
the<00:02:40.080> players<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.350> will<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.560> taking<00:02:40.890> from<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
the players that will be taking from the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.790 
the players that will be taking from the
opponent's<00:02:41.550> team<00:02:41.670> if<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:42.000> won<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.390> match<00:02:42.800> now

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
opponent's team if I won the match now

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.560 
opponent's team if I won the match now
if<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.640> guys<00:02:44.820> think<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.330> good<00:02:45.510> idea

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
if you guys think this is a good idea

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.060 
if you guys think this is a good idea
