00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
had to learn that the hard way also that

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.610 
had to learn that the hard way also that
if<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.149> don't<00:00:54.360> make<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.570> enough<00:00:54.960> time<00:00:55.230> for

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.069 
if you don't make that enough time for
somebody<00:00:56.100> then<00:00:56.280> things<00:00:56.760> go<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> right

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
somebody then things go not in the right

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.459 
somebody then things go not in the right
direction<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.579> think<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:00.930> 50

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
direction but I think in you know 50

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.850 
direction but I think in you know 50
years<00:01:01.680> later<00:01:01.910> it's<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.510> about

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
years later it's really just about

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.260 
years later it's really just about
respecting<00:01:04.860> each<00:01:04.949> other<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.489> still<00:01:05.939> making

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
respecting each other and still making

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.250 
respecting each other and still making
time<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.659> each<00:01:06.900> other

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.160 
that it's time to talk about it anymore
but<00:02:12.099> in<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.730> way<00:02:12.849> it's<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:13.269> refreshing<00:02:13.629> for<00:02:14.140> me

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
but in a way it's so refreshing for me

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.220 
but in a way it's so refreshing for me
to<00:02:14.470> have<00:02:15.160> no<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.849> think<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.599> comes<00:02:16.810> also<00:02:17.049> with

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
to have no I think it comes also with

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.640 
to have no I think it comes also with
maturing<00:02:18.120> having<00:02:19.120> no<00:02:19.269> like<00:02:19.720> not<00:02:19.900> no<00:02:20.170> filter

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
maturing having no like not no filter

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.699 
maturing having no like not no filter
