take a look at the Apple case for the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.490 
take a look at the Apple case for the
iPad<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.719> Apple<00:00:15.900> doesn't<00:00:16.139> make<00:00:16.320> too<00:00:16.440> many

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
iPad you Apple doesn't make too many

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.720 
iPad you Apple doesn't make too many
cases<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.100> know<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.580> little

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
cases you know so this is a little

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.250 
cases you know so this is a little
unusual<00:00:17.910> for<00:00:18.240> them<00:00:18.420> come<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.810> case<00:00:19.020> for

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
unusual for them come all the case for

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.380 
unusual for them come all the case for
one<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.470> their<00:00:19.590> products<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.880> case<00:00:21.119> adds

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
one of their products but this case adds

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.300 
one of their products but this case adds
some<00:00:21.600> value<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.439> iPad<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.189> that's

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
some value to the iPad so that's

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.650 
some value to the iPad so that's
probably<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> big<00:00:23.970> reasons<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.510> add

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
probably one of the big reasons they add

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.099 
probably one of the big reasons they add
it<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.869> it

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109

it to it
we'll<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:25.680> second<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.490> I

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519

and part one of the reasons is this is
pretty<00:00:32.099> floppy<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:33.030> know<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.750> me<00:00:33.840> kinda<00:00:34.020> seems

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
pretty floppy you know to me kinda seems

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.810 
pretty floppy you know to me kinda seems
like<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.290> batwing<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.219> know<00:00:35.340> has<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
like a batwing kind of you know has a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.270 
like a batwing kind of you know has a
it's<00:00:36.570> not<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> very<00:00:37.020> rigid<00:00:37.290> design<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.250> here

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
it's not a very rigid design right here

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.680 
it's not a very rigid design right here
this<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.700> pretty<00:00:38.879> Ridge<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.270> has<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.420> little

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
this is pretty Ridge it has a little

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.959 
this is pretty Ridge it has a little
flex<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.440> pretty<00:00:40.500> rigid<00:00:40.969> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
flex to it but it is pretty rigid so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.459 
flex to it but it is pretty rigid so
it's<00:00:42.239> not<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> real<00:00:42.600> substantial<00:00:42.750> case<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it's not a real substantial case you

it's not a real substantial case you
know<00:00:43.559> there's<00:00:43.710> no<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> whole<00:00:44.789> lot<00:00:44.940> of

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
padding or anything like that but it's

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.270 
padding or anything like that but it's
basically<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> folio<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> portfolio<00:00:48.480> style<00:00:48.750> case

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.710 
and you know it comes right off you know
just<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:28.920> muscle<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
just a little muscle to get it in the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.800 
just a little muscle to get it in the
last<00:01:31.049> portion<00:01:31.729> it's<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> pretty<00:01:33.030> tight<00:01:33.270> fit<00:01:33.540> so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
last portion it's a pretty tight fit so

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.190 
last portion it's a pretty tight fit so
it's<00:01:33.960> definitely<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.409> going<00:01:34.770> anywhere<00:01:36.200> there

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it's definitely not going anywhere there

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.140 
it's definitely not going anywhere there
we<00:01:37.350> go<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.770> got<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.009> nice<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.250> secure<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:39.090> you

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
we go we got it nice and secure then you

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.429 
we go we got it nice and secure then you
have<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.329> little<00:01:39.540> flap<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.049> what<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.380> want

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
have this little flap here what you want

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.020 
have this little flap here what you want
to<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.040> actually<00:01:41.340> tuck<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.729> just

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
to do with that is actually tuck it just

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.050 
to do with that is actually tuck it just
behind<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.600> eye<00:01:42.630> pad<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.909> will

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
behind the eye pad and this will

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.969 
behind the eye pad and this will
probably<00:01:45.329> keep<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.960> there<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.619> know<00:01:46.740> I'm

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
probably keep it in there you know I'm

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:47.960 
probably keep it in there you know I'm
guessing<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.670> give<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.880> little

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
guessing and it give it a little

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.700 
guessing and it give it a little
protection<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.659> your<00:01:48.780> iPad<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.140> definitely

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
protection but your iPad is definitely

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.770 
protection but your iPad is definitely
not<00:01:49.860> falling<00:01:50.460> out<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.790> thing<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.689> have

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
not falling out of this thing so we have

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.969 
not falling out of this thing so we have
to<00:01:51.840> worry<00:01:51.990> about<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.619> makes<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.920> a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
to worry about that so that makes it a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.580 
to worry about that so that makes it a
nice<00:01:53.189> nice<00:01:53.729> secure<00:01:54.060> fit<00:01:54.090> nice<00:01:54.540> look<00:01:54.840> view<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
nice nice secure fit nice look view you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
nice nice secure fit nice look view you
know<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.770> don't<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.159> open<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.390> know

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
know we don't have this open you know

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.389 
know we don't have this open you know
all<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> edges<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.200> pretty<00:01:58.439> well<00:01:58.649> secured<00:01:59.219> so

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
all the edges are pretty well secured so

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.190 
all the edges are pretty well secured so
nice<00:01:59.579> protection<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.390> nice<00:02:00.540> secure<00:02:01.170> fit

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
nice protection and it's nice secure fit

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.469 
nice protection and it's nice secure fit
so<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:01.950> how<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.159> looks<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.969> mean

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
so that's how it looks in there I mean

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.300 
so that's how it looks in there I mean
overall<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.770> know<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> whole

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
overall you can see you know not a whole

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.160 
overall you can see you know not a whole
lot<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.520> bulk<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.750> does<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> looks

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
lot of bulk to this and it does it looks

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.749 
lot of bulk to this and it does it looks
like<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.469> like<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:07.950> portfolio<00:02:08.310> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
like just like a little portfolio that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
little edge on it let me zoom in just a

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.280 
little edge on it let me zoom in just a
little<00:02:19.830> bit<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.220> see<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:22.050> know<00:02:22.110> this

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
little bit to see it and I know this

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.990 
little bit to see it and I know this
gives<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.590> little<00:02:22.680> protection<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.460> know<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:23.760> if

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
gives a little protection you know so if

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.190 
gives a little protection you know so if
you<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.450> know<00:02:24.540> bump<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.870> up<00:02:24.960> against

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
you you know bump it up against

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.560 
you you know bump it up against
something<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.770> know<00:02:26.730> protect<00:02:27.120> your<00:02:27.240> ports<00:02:27.480> a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
something you know protect your ports a

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.210 
something you know protect your ports a
little<00:02:27.810> bit<00:02:27.960> maybe<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.800> little<00:02:28.920> bit<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.190> a

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
little bit maybe it's a little bit of a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.770 
little bit maybe it's a little bit of a
design<00:02:29.550> thing<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.030> don't<00:02:30.240> know<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.510> don't<00:02:30.660> really

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
design thing I don't know I don't really

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.990 
design thing I don't know I don't really
care<00:02:30.990> for<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.490> frankly<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.580> looks<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:32.880> they

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
care for it frankly it looks like they

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.460 
care for it frankly it looks like they
didn't<00:02:33.210> actually<00:02:33.480> trim<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.320> then<00:02:34.410> in

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
didn't actually trim and then in

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.620 
didn't actually trim and then in
production<00:02:34.860> they<00:02:34.920> didn't<00:02:35.130> trim<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.400> case

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
production they didn't trim the case

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.240 
production they didn't trim the case
fully<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.230> looks<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.410> little<00:02:37.530> weird<00:02:37.770> not<00:02:38.100> too

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
fully so it looks a little weird not too

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.440 
fully so it looks a little weird not too
crazy<00:02:38.460> about<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.060> goes<00:02:39.150> all<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.360> way

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
crazy about it and it goes all the way

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.570 
crazy about it and it goes all the way
around<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:40.020> know<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.320> comes<00:02:40.500> all<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.770> way<00:02:40.800> you

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
around you know so comes all the way you

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.880 
around you know so comes all the way you
know<00:02:41.670> down<00:02:41.940> over<00:02:42.210> here<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.900> whatever<00:02:43.470> not<00:02:43.800> too

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
know down over here so whatever not too

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.350 
know down over here so whatever not too
crazy<00:02:44.070> about<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.730> little<00:02:44.820> makes<00:02:45.210> it<00:02:45.300> a

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
crazy about it it's a little makes it a

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.700 
crazy about it it's a little makes it a
little<00:02:45.450> difficult<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.990> use<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.410> know<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.650> if

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
little difficult to use you know so if

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.010 
little difficult to use you know so if
you<00:02:46.800> bring<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.100> over<00:02:47.460> fold<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.850> over<00:02:48.020> you

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
you bring this over fold it over you

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.660 
you bring this over fold it over you
know<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.200> got<00:02:49.350> your<00:02:49.530> your<00:02:50.100> hand<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.640> know

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
know you got your your hand you know

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.540 
know you got your your hand you know
right<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.650> not<00:02:52.800> too<00:02:53.340> too

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
right on it just like so so not too too

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.310 
right on it just like so so not too too
crazy<00:02:53.820> about<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.780> just<00:02:54.930> feels<00:02:55.080> like<00:02:55.230> you

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
crazy about that it just feels like you

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.900 
crazy about that it just feels like you
have<00:02:55.350> some<00:02:55.560> extra<00:02:55.860> material<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.610> know<00:02:56.670> get<00:02:56.820> in

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
have some extra material you know get in

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.370 
have some extra material you know get in
between<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.420> your<00:02:57.480> iPad<00:02:57.810> maybe<00:02:58.170> that's

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
between you and your iPad maybe that's

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.990 
between you and your iPad maybe that's
the<00:02:58.440> best<00:02:58.560> way<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.740> describe<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.130> but

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the best way to describe it but

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.790 
the best way to describe it but
otherwise<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.510> let's<00:03:00.660> take<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> look<00:03:01.050> at<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
otherwise so let's take a look at the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.040 
otherwise so let's take a look at the
ports<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.220> everything<00:03:02.550> that<00:03:02.670> has<00:03:02.820> with<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.180> on

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
ports and everything that has with it on

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.270 
ports and everything that has with it on
the<00:03:04.170> bottom<00:03:04.410> here<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.680> have<00:03:04.770> access<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.190> your

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the bottom here you have access to your

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.070 
the bottom here you have access to your
30-pin<00:03:05.670> dock<00:03:05.700> connector<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.480> don't<00:03:06.840> have<00:03:06.959> my

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
30-pin dock connector I don't have my

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.510 
30-pin dock connector I don't have my
dock<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.470> yet<00:03:07.680> but<00:03:07.800> I'm<00:03:07.920> assuming<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.310> it's

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
dock in yet but I'm assuming that it's

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.580 
dock in yet but I'm assuming that it's
not<00:03:08.670> going<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.090> fit<00:03:09.330> inside<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.720> dock<00:03:09.990> if<00:03:10.410> you

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
not going to fit inside the dock if you

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.570 
not going to fit inside the dock if you
want<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.800> actually<00:03:10.920> dock<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.370> you're<00:03:11.490> gonna

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
want to actually dock it you're gonna

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.890 
want to actually dock it you're gonna
have<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.820> remove<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.240> from<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.660> case<00:03:12.870> and

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
have to remove it from the case and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.230 
have to remove it from the case and
removing<00:03:13.470> from<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.709> case<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.100> uh<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.970> takes<00:03:15.120> a

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
removing from the case is uh it takes a

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.730 
removing from the case is uh it takes a
little<00:03:15.390> bit<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.600> work<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.810> have<00:03:15.990> to<00:03:16.170> kind<00:03:16.709> of

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
little bit of work you have to kind of

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.680 
little bit of work you have to kind of
pry<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.040> out<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.280> there<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.430> little<00:03:17.580> bit<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.570> it's

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
pry it out of there a little bit so it's

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.380 
pry it out of there a little bit so it's
not<00:03:18.750> doesn't<00:03:19.170> slide<00:03:19.500> in<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.739> out<00:03:19.769> super<00:03:20.130> easy

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
not doesn't slide in and out super easy

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.430 
not doesn't slide in and out super easy
so<00:03:21.390> there's<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.690> dock<00:03:21.840> connector<00:03:22.200> but<00:03:22.380> you

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
so there's the dock connector but you

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.770 
so there's the dock connector but you
can<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.950> can<00:03:22.980> obviously<00:03:23.370> get<00:03:23.640> your<00:03:23.940> your

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
can you can obviously get your your

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.030 
can you can obviously get your your
charging<00:03:25.080> cable<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.470> there<00:03:25.560> with<00:03:25.769> no<00:03:25.890> problem

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
charging cable in there with no problem

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.620 
charging cable in there with no problem
we<00:03:26.610> have<00:03:26.700> some<00:03:26.820> cutouts<00:03:27.060> here's<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.480> little

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
we have some cutouts here's a little

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.360 
we have some cutouts here's a little
circle<00:03:27.959> cutouts<00:03:28.260> for<00:03:28.530> your<00:03:28.680> speakers<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.220> your

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
circle cutouts for your speakers so your

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.800 
circle cutouts for your speakers so your
speaker<00:03:29.700> will<00:03:29.850> how<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.030> won't<00:03:30.180> be<00:03:30.300> muffled<00:03:30.690> or

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
speaker will how it won't be muffled or

speaker will how it won't be muffled or
anything<00:03:30.989> coming<00:03:31.260> out<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.500> here<00:03:31.590> up<00:03:32.160> here<00:03:32.220> you

have access to the volume rocker and the
rotate<00:03:35.190> lock<00:03:35.400> switch<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:36.360> over<00:03:36.570> here<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:36.840> have

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
rotate lock switch and over here we have

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.490 
rotate lock switch and over here we have
the<00:03:37.650> power<00:03:37.830> button<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.459> we<00:03:38.910> have<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.500> the

the power button and we have the the
microphone<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.160> audio<00:03:41.430> jack<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.000> full<00:03:42.810> access

microphone and audio jack so full access
to<00:03:43.260> all<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.470> ports<00:03:43.680> works<00:03:44.040> pretty<00:03:44.220> well

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
to all the ports works pretty well

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.370 
to all the ports works pretty well
on<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.760> back<00:03:44.910> here<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.390> probably<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.019> feature

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
on the back here is probably the feature

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.560 
on the back here is probably the feature
the<00:03:46.650> best<00:03:46.890> feature<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.340> this<00:03:47.459> case<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.480> got

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
the best feature of this case is you got

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.300 
the best feature of this case is you got
this<00:03:48.660> little<00:03:48.840> tab<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:50.100> know<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.220> way

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
this little tab and you know the way

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.290 
this little tab and you know the way
this<00:03:50.430> works<00:03:50.640> you've<00:03:50.820> probably<00:03:50.970> seen<00:03:51.180> the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
this works you've probably seen the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.400 
this works you've probably seen the
pictures<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.660> everything<00:03:52.170> if<00:03:52.290> you've

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
pictures and everything if you've

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.900 
pictures and everything if you've
checked<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.739> out<00:03:52.890> is<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.550> just<00:03:53.670> take<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
checked this out is you just take the

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.970 
checked this out is you just take the
bottom<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.810> want<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.350> what<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.650> do<00:03:55.830> is

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
bottom and you want and what you do is

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.100 
bottom and you want and what you do is
just<00:03:56.010> tuck<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.880> under<00:03:57.209> there<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.660> this<00:03:57.989> will

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
just tuck it under there and this will

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.590 
just tuck it under there and this will
hold<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.470> in<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:59.070> space<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.640> then<00:03:59.940> this

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
hold it in this space and then this

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.140 
hold it in this space and then this
gives<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.709> little<00:04:02.400> lift<00:04:02.489> for<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.060> I'll

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
gives you a little lift for it so I'll

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.030 
gives you a little lift for it so I'll
holds<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.450> up<00:04:03.600> off<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.840> table<00:04:04.320> so<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:04.680> can<00:04:04.830> see

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
holds it up off the table so you can see

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.330 
holds it up off the table so you can see
this<00:04:05.370> right<00:04:05.730> there<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.360> by<00:04:07.320> doing<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.620> let's

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
this right there and by doing that let's

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.470 
this right there and by doing that let's

open up a web browser and so what you
could<00:04:15.540> do<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.769> could<00:04:16.859> easily<00:04:17.150> just<00:04:18.150> type

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
could do is you could easily just type

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.090 
could do is you could easily just type
on<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.810> so<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.260> know<00:04:19.470> we'll<00:04:19.590> just<00:04:19.620> type<00:04:19.919> you

on it so you know we'll just type you
know<00:04:20.190> this<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:21.120> test<00:04:21.860> so<00:04:22.860> pretty<00:04:23.100> cool<00:04:23.310> um

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
know this is a test so pretty cool um

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.340 
know this is a test so pretty cool um
this<00:04:24.570> is<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.720> test<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.229> emergency

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
this is the test of the emergency

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.060 
this is the test of the emergency
broadcast<00:04:26.070> system<00:04:26.160> how<00:04:26.550> about<00:04:26.700> that

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
broadcast system how about that

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.730 
broadcast system how about that
so<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.700> really<00:04:28.120> makes<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.360> easy<00:04:28.540> to<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:29.260> type<00:04:29.500> on

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
so it really makes it easy to to type on

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.370 
so it really makes it easy to to type on
the<00:04:30.040> on<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.790> iPad<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:31.420> lifts<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:32.050> fingers
