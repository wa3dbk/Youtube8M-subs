famous as a joke or two face no um
however<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.220> think<00:02:38.580> when<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.540> get<00:02:39.840> amongst

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
however I think when you get amongst

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.840 
however I think when you get amongst
comic<00:02:41.250> book<00:02:41.430> people<00:02:41.700> all<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.750> well-respected

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
comic book people all the well-respected

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.190 
comic book people all the well-respected
definitely<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.910> know<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.300> he's<00:02:45.510> he's<00:02:45.930> right

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
definitely you know like he's he's right

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.470 
definitely you know like he's he's right
up<00:02:46.380> there<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.890> he's<00:02:47.160> odd<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.670> mean<00:02:47.970> he<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.240> newer

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
up there and he's odd I mean he is newer

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.360 
up there and he's odd I mean he is newer
so<00:02:48.810> that's<00:02:48.960> another<00:02:49.140> thing<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.650> he<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:50.340> a

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
so that's another thing like he is a

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.920 
so that's another thing like he is a
more<00:02:50.850> recent<00:02:50.880> villain<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.600> that's<00:02:51.750> another

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
more recent villain so that's another

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.750 
more recent villain so that's another
thing<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.320> tribute<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.250> know<00:02:53.340> not<00:02:53.580> quite

thing to tribute is you know not quite

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.860 
thing to tribute is you know not quite
as<00:02:53.970> wide<00:02:55.820> success<00:02:56.820> yeah<00:02:57.390> sure<00:02:58.080> um<00:02:59.540> however<00:03:00.540> he

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
as wide success yeah sure um however he

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.570 
as wide success yeah sure um however he
works<00:03:01.080> off<00:03:01.320> in<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> venom<00:03:01.950> though<00:03:02.160> which<00:03:02.459> is

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
works off in the venom though which is

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.640 
works off in the venom though which is
kind<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:02.880> like<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.060> sci-fi<00:03:03.360> concept<00:03:04.230> wouldn't

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
kind of like a sci-fi concept wouldn't

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.500 
kind of like a sci-fi concept wouldn't
with<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.100> tubes<00:03:05.370> going<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:05.880> his<00:03:05.970> head<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.420> he

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
with the tubes going in his head and he

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.540 
with the tubes going in his head and he
injects<00:03:07.260> himself<00:03:07.440> with<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.130> it's

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
injects himself with this like it's

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.520 
injects himself with this like it's
called<00:03:08.940> Athena<00:03:09.180> venom<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.840> was<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.200> super

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
called Athena venom it was a super

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.520 
called Athena venom it was a super
steroid<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.670> he<00:03:11.790> gets<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.530> abnormally

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
steroid and so he gets like abnormally

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.820 
steroid and so he gets like abnormally
like<00:03:13.890> muscular<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.790> like<00:03:14.940> superhuman

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
like muscular and like superhuman

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.830 
like muscular and like superhuman
superhuman<00:03:16.830> aspects<00:03:17.489> are<00:03:17.610> not<00:03:17.640> common<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.630> the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
superhuman aspects are not common in the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.720 
superhuman aspects are not common in the
Christopher<00:03:19.260> Nolan<00:03:19.290> universe<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:20.400> it'll<00:03:20.700> be

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
Christopher Nolan universe so it'll be
