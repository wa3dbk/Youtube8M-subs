a flow control valve that's manually

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.149 
a flow control valve that's manually
adjustable<00:01:50.600> we<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:52.049> our<00:01:52.320> temperature

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
adjustable we can do our temperature

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.639 
adjustable we can do our temperature
units<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.970> Celsius<00:01:54.479> Fahrenheit<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.829> Kelvin

units in Celsius Fahrenheit or Kelvin

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.109 
units in Celsius Fahrenheit or Kelvin
Scott<00:01:58.649> ghoulia<00:01:58.979> Mino<00:01:59.219> wanted<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.700> Kelvin

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
Scott ghoulia Mino wanted to do Kelvin

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.359 
Scott ghoulia Mino wanted to do Kelvin
so<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.509> Kelvin<00:02:00.950> volume<00:02:01.950> units<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.310> be

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
so we have Kelvin volume units can be

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.450 
so we have Kelvin volume units can be
displayed<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.670> milliliters<00:02:03.180> or<00:02:03.210> ounces<00:02:04.460> under

we're reading out in milliliters you'll

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.700 
we're reading out in milliliters you'll
see<00:02:58.530> when<00:02:58.680> we<00:02:58.770> dispense<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.190> program<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:01.620> we

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
see when we dispense a program that we

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.580 
see when we dispense a program that we
start<00:03:01.950> counting<00:03:02.340> milliliters<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.440> right<00:03:04.440> now

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
start counting milliliters and right now

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.440 
start counting milliliters and right now
yet<00:03:04.770> there's<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.010> pause<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:05.550> line<00:03:05.730> volume<00:03:06.150> so

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
yet there's a pause for line volume so

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.360 
yet there's a pause for line volume so
now<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.630> we're<00:03:06.810> dispensing<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:08.070> see<00:03:08.220> that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
now that we're dispensing you see that

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.590 
now that we're dispensing you see that
we're<00:03:08.490> counting<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.910> milliliters<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.510> are

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
we're counting the milliliters that are

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.140 
we're counting the milliliters that are
dispensed<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.130> good<00:03:11.250> way<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.430> calibrate

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
dispensed so the good way to calibrate

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.770 
dispensed so the good way to calibrate
this<00:03:12.450> features<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.260> just<00:03:13.500> weigh<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.520> water

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
this features to just weigh the water

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.540 
this features to just weigh the water
that<00:03:15.780> you've<00:03:15.930> dispensed<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:18.620> then<00:03:19.620> see<00:03:20.340> what

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
that you've dispensed and then see what

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.040 
that you've dispensed and then see what
the<00:03:20.580> milliliter<00:03:21.030> readout<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.450> on<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.690> display

the milliliter readout is on the display

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.780 
the milliliter readout is on the display
and<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.350> can<00:03:22.560> make<00:03:22.830> an<00:03:22.950> adjustment<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.580> line

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and you can make an adjustment to line

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.250 
and you can make an adjustment to line
volume<00:03:24.240> based<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.900> differential<00:03:27.260> okay

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
volume based on the differential okay

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.980 
volume based on the differential okay
now<00:03:29.130> when<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.459> comes<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.700> temperatures<00:03:30.120> we

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
now when it comes to temperatures we

to<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.830> outlet<00:04:05.100> boiler<00:04:05.400> temperature<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.930> make

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
to the outlet boiler temperature to make

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.360 
to the outlet boiler temperature to make
a<00:04:07.110> change<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.500> these<00:04:07.680> temperatures<00:04:07.980> all<00:04:08.280> you

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
a change to these temperatures all you

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.479 
a change to these temperatures all you
do<00:04:08.459> is<00:04:08.550> touch<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.760> temperature<00:04:10.190> it's<00:04:11.190> good<00:04:11.400> to

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
do is touch the temperature it's good to

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.790 
do is touch the temperature it's good to
know<00:04:11.610> that<00:04:11.850> our<00:04:12.120> indications<00:04:13.080> here<00:04:13.200> for<00:04:13.410> PV

for all of mod bars modules is when the
machine<00:04:50.550> heats<00:04:50.910> there's<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.720> red<00:04:51.990> light<00:04:52.290> up

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
machine heats there's a red light up

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.080 
machine heats there's a red light up
here<00:04:52.740> indicating<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.340> heat<00:04:53.490> element<00:04:53.610> is<00:04:53.880> on

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
here indicating the heat element is on

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.890 
here indicating the heat element is on
it's<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.750> good<00:04:54.900> thing<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.170> reference<00:04:55.530> sometimes

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.030 

they're<00:05:00.900> not<00:05:00.930> needing<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.440> eat<00:05:01.500> right<00:05:01.740> now<00:05:01.770> so

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
they're not needing to eat right now so

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.010 
they're not needing to eat right now so
we're<00:05:02.130> not<00:05:02.190> seeing<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.700> red<00:05:03.030> flash<00:05:03.600> but<00:05:03.930> we

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
we're not seeing the red flash but we

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.450 
we're not seeing the red flash but we
will<00:05:04.230> see<00:05:04.440> that<00:05:04.590> happen<00:05:05.010> when<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.310> heat

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
will see that happen when the heat

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.700 
will see that happen when the heat
elements<00:05:05.820> are<00:05:05.940> on<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.420> that's<00:05:07.110> individual

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
elements are on and that's individual

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.910 
elements are on and that's individual
per<00:05:07.890> boiler<00:05:08.280> there's<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.670> flash<00:05:08.880> right<00:05:09.030> there

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
per boiler there's the flash right there

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.470 
per boiler there's the flash right there
okay<00:05:10.920> so<00:05:10.980> to<00:05:11.160> change<00:05:11.310> temperatures<00:05:11.790> what<00:05:12.390> we

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
okay so to change temperatures what we

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.640 
okay so to change temperatures what we
do<00:05:12.600> is<00:05:12.690> select<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:13.050> boiler<00:05:13.230> we'd<00:05:13.440> like<00:05:13.560> to

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
do is select the boiler we'd like to

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.580 
do is select the boiler we'd like to
change<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:14.670> highlights<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.240> for<00:05:15.810> us<00:05:15.960> if<00:05:16.470> you

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
change it highlights it for us if you

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.020 
change it highlights it for us if you
want<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.800> do<00:05:16.860> one<00:05:17.160> whole<00:05:17.400> degree<00:05:17.610> increments

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
want to do one whole degree increments

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.410 
want to do one whole degree increments
you<00:05:18.540> just<00:05:18.720> turn<00:05:19.170> the<00:05:19.460> turn<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.640> encoder<00:05:20.910> right

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
you just turn the turn the encoder right

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.950 
you just turn the turn the encoder right
or<00:05:21.540> left<00:05:22.250> there's<00:05:23.250> 100<00:05:23.640> see<00:05:23.880> if<00:05:24.150> we<00:05:24.630> want<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:24.870> do

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
or left there's 100 see if we want to do

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.720 
or left there's 100 see if we want to do
decimal<00:05:25.350> as<00:05:25.410> we<00:05:25.530> just<00:05:25.680> push<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:26.070> joystick<00:05:26.370> up

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
decimal as we just push the joystick up

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.050 
decimal as we just push the joystick up
and<00:05:26.910> down<00:05:28.580> there<00:05:29.580> we<00:05:29.700> go

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
and down there we go

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.890 
and down there we go
so<00:05:30.750> 99.9<00:05:31.740> push<00:05:32.220> enter<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:32.730> you're<00:05:33.060> set<00:05:33.270> the

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
so 99.9 push enter and you're set the

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.390 
so 99.9 push enter and you're set the
same<00:05:34.110> thing<00:05:34.350> you<00:05:34.560> can<00:05:34.770> go<00:05:34.920> to<00:05:34.980> the<00:05:35.130> inlet

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
same thing you can go to the inlet

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.870 
same thing you can go to the inlet
boiler<00:05:35.730> and<00:05:35.970> make<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.420> same<00:05:36.570> adjustments

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
boiler and make the same adjustments

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.480 
boiler and make the same adjustments
just<00:05:38.880> like<00:05:39.030> that<00:05:39.770> so<00:05:40.770> now<00:05:40.800> I<00:05:40.920> want<00:05:41.220> to<00:05:41.280> show<00:05:41.430> you
