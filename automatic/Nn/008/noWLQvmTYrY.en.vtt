hey guys backlight here and i just

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.400 
hey guys backlight here and i just
finished<00:00:13.289> rendering<00:00:13.530> my<00:00:15.199> video<00:00:16.199> about<00:00:16.230> my

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
finished rendering my video about my

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.259 
finished rendering my video about my
tour<00:00:16.679> of<00:00:16.769> my<00:00:16.920> house<00:00:17.130> but<00:00:17.580> let's<00:00:17.910> jump<00:00:18.210> right

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
tour of my house but let's jump right

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.140 
tour of my house but let's jump right
into<00:00:18.509> this<00:00:18.689> video<00:00:19.019> and<00:00:19.259> this<00:00:19.949> one<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.429> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
into this video and this one is the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.620 
into this video and this one is the
promised<00:00:21.570> piston<00:00:22.199> video<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.710> how<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.919> make<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
promised piston video on how to make the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.820 
promised piston video on how to make the
hidden<00:00:24.630> storage<00:00:24.929> room<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.349> very<00:00:25.500> simple

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
hidden storage room it's a very simple

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.349 
hidden storage room it's a very simple
contraption<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:26.640> may<00:00:26.849> be<00:00:26.880> kind<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.240> confusing

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
contraption but may be kind of confusing

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.540 
contraption but may be kind of confusing
if<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.199> can't<00:00:28.589> see<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> wiring<00:00:29.130> at<00:00:29.220> all<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
if you can't see the wiring at all and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.030 
if you can't see the wiring at all and
while<00:00:30.390> i<00:00:30.419> was<00:00:30.570> doing<00:00:30.749> this<00:00:30.990> i<00:00:31.169> simplified<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
while i was doing this i simplified the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.590 
while i was doing this i simplified the
heck<00:00:32.280> out<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.490> this<00:00:32.730> thing<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.150> this<00:00:33.300> will<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
heck out of this thing so this will be a

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.940 
heck out of this thing so this will be a
pretty<00:00:33.840> short<00:00:33.930> video<00:00:34.460> um<00:00:36.620> next<00:00:37.620> I'm<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:37.830> going

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
pretty short video um next I'm not going

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.170 
pretty short video um next I'm not going
to<00:00:38.010> show<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.220> back<00:00:38.340> yet<00:00:38.550> I'm<00:00:39.060> getting

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
to show you the back yet I'm getting

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.060 
to show you the back yet I'm getting
really<00:00:39.510> weird<00:00:39.720> like<00:00:39.990> whenever<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.530> record<00:00:40.980> in

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
really weird like whenever I record in

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.010 
really weird like whenever I record in
single<00:00:41.370> player<00:00:41.400> I<00:00:41.580> always<00:00:42.030> get<00:00:42.180> them<00:00:42.360> mouse

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
single player I always get them mouse

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.660 
single player I always get them mouse
lag<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.500> I'll<00:00:43.620> turn<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.160> then<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> will<00:00:44.460> take<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
lag so I'll turn and then it will take a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.910 
lag so I'll turn and then it will take a
second<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.120> turn<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.690> kind<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> weird<00:00:46.080> but

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
second to turn it's kind of weird but

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.430 
second to turn it's kind of weird but
this<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.330> contraption<00:00:48.930> that's<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.410> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
this is the contraption that's what it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.840 
this is the contraption that's what it
looks<00:00:49.650> like<00:00:49.770> from<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.130> side<00:00:50.160> where<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.700> can't

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
looks like from the side where you can't

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.180 
looks like from the side where you can't
see<00:00:50.970> any<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> Redstone<00:00:51.800> very<00:00:52.800> polished

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
see any of the Redstone very polished

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.640 
see any of the Redstone very polished
you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.820> any<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> wiring<00:00:54.630> works<00:00:55.530> like

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
you can see any of the wiring works like

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.250 
you can see any of the wiring works like
a<00:00:55.740> charm<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:57.180> never<00:00:57.450> it's<00:00:57.810> a<00:00:57.870> very<00:00:58.020> stable

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
a charm and never it's a very stable

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.870 
a charm and never it's a very stable
surfing<00:00:59.300> it'll<00:01:00.300> still<00:01:00.540> be<00:01:00.660> fine<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:02.670> that's

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
surfing it'll still be fine so that's

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.080 
surfing it'll still be fine so that's
pretty<00:01:03.030> cool<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:04.800> can<00:01:04.830> make<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.790> many<00:01:05.820> of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
pretty cool and you can make as many of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.250 
pretty cool and you can make as many of
these<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.450> want<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> hook

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
these as you want you just have to hook

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.300 
these as you want you just have to hook
it<00:01:07.410> up<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.680> might<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> use<00:01:08.100> some

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it up and you might have to use some

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.120 
it up and you might have to use some
repeaters<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:09.060> UM<00:01:09.620> lengthen<00:01:10.620> the<00:01:10.710> circuit<00:01:11.040> but

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
repeaters to UM lengthen the circuit but

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.470 
repeaters to UM lengthen the circuit but
other<00:01:11.310> than<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.550> all<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.060> use<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
other than that all that use this is

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.080 
other than that all that use this is
redstone<00:01:12.870> wire<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> here's<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> wiring<00:01:14.940> you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
redstone wire so here's the wiring you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.660 
redstone wire so here's the wiring you
can<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.480> really<00:01:15.690> not<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.870> much<00:01:16.140> wiring

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
can see it's really not that much wiring

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.910 
can see it's really not that much wiring
um<00:01:18.980> hold<00:01:19.980> on<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.220> second<00:01:21.590> alright<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.680> seems<00:01:22.800> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
um hold on a second alright that seems a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.950 
um hold on a second alright that seems a
little<00:01:22.980> better<00:01:23.690> so<00:01:24.690> right<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:26.090> where<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
little better so right here is where the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.100 
little better so right here is where the
switches<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:30.330> can<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.690> switches<00:01:30.990> right

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
switches you can see the switches right

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.590 
switches you can see the switches right
there<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:33.170> here's<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.500> chests<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:35.940> they

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
there and here's all the chests and they

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300 
there and here's all the chests and they
correspond<00:01:37.020> our<00:01:37.229> suits<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.680> other<00:01:37.860> side<00:01:38.070> I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
correspond our suits to the other side I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.969 
correspond our suits to the other side I
don't<00:01:38.940> think<00:01:39.120> you<00:01:39.180> need<00:01:39.330> to<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.510> that<00:01:39.540> and

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
don't think you need to see that and

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.050 
don't think you need to see that and
yeah<00:01:40.979> there's<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.340> mouse<00:01:41.490> lag<00:01:41.700> right<00:01:41.850> there

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
yeah there's the mouse lag right there

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.440 
yeah there's the mouse lag right there
and<00:01:42.540> here's<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> Pistons<00:01:43.380> under<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.450> up

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and here's the Pistons under here and up

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.180 
and here's the Pistons under here and up
there<00:01:45.479> basically<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.350> consists<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.950> two

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
there basically this consists of two

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.080 
there basically this consists of two
rows<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.700> upper<00:01:47.970> row<00:01:48.120> and<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> lower<00:01:48.690> row<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
rows in upper row and a lower row and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.170 
rows in upper row and a lower row and
the<00:01:51.090> lower<00:01:51.270> row<00:01:51.510> is<00:01:52.580> you<00:01:53.580> have<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> make<00:01:53.940> it<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the lower row is you have to make it a

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.630 
the lower row is you have to make it a
level<00:01:54.510> below<00:01:54.810> or<00:01:55.590> two<00:01:55.830> levels<00:01:56.190> below<00:01:56.250> your

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
level below or two levels below your

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.969 
level below or two levels below your
chest<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.420> here's<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.720> chest<00:01:57.990> here's<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.740> layer

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
chest so here's the chest here's a layer

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.120 
chest so here's the chest here's a layer
and<00:01:59.190> then<00:01:59.310> they're<00:01:59.520> layer<00:01:59.880> below<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.450> and

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
and then they're layer below that and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.620 
and then they're layer below that and
what<00:02:02.130> happens<00:02:02.400> is<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.760> didn't<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
what happens is you didn't have the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.180 
what happens is you didn't have the
redstone<00:02:04.020> wire<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.500> come<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.770> power<00:02:04.950> those

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
redstone wire just come and power those

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.940 
redstone wire just come and power those
and<00:02:05.460> when<00:02:05.700> they're<00:02:05.850> powered

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and when they're powered

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.219 
and when they're powered
they<00:02:08.520> push<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.940> block<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.569> front<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
they push the block up in front of the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.839 
they push the block up in front of the
chest<00:02:10.410> when<00:02:10.800> they're<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.069> powered<00:02:11.400> they

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
chest when they're not powered they

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.940 
chest when they're not powered they
retract<00:02:12.450> down<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.379> can<00:02:13.530> see<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.680> chest

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
retract down and you can see the chest

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.280 
retract down and you can see the chest
again<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.849> can<00:02:14.940> access<00:02:15.269> your<00:02:15.300> stuff<00:02:16.519> and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
again and you can access your stuff and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.309 
again and you can access your stuff and
the<00:02:19.580> upper<00:02:20.580> chest<00:02:20.819> oh<00:02:21.090> no<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.750> actually<00:02:22.050> got

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
the upper chest oh no I actually got

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.990 
the upper chest oh no I actually got
that<00:02:22.470> wrong<00:02:22.590> one<00:02:22.830> it's<00:02:22.980> powered<00:02:23.370> oh<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.790> don't

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
that wrong one it's powered oh I don't

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.120 
that wrong one it's powered oh I don't
whatever<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.080> know<00:02:25.530> what<00:02:25.650> i<00:02:25.680> mean<00:02:25.830> when<00:02:25.890> it's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
whatever you know what i mean when it's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.589 
whatever you know what i mean when it's
powered<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:26.580> down<00:02:26.790> when<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.180> not<00:02:27.269> it's<00:02:27.480> up

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
powered it's down when it's not it's up

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.600 
powered it's down when it's not it's up
and<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.959> can<00:02:28.110> see<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.260> chest<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.340> upper

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
and you can see the chest on the upper

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.640 
and you can see the chest on the upper
row<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:30.000> basically<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.110> same<00:02:31.230> thing<00:02:31.290> as<00:02:31.560> the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
row is basically the same thing as the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.320 
row is basically the same thing as the
lower<00:02:31.800> row<00:02:31.980> except<00:02:32.340> reverse<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.940> has<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.239> be

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
lower row except reverse it has to be

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.990 
lower row except reverse it has to be
two<00:02:33.480> layers<00:02:33.750> above<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.620> chest<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.069> here's<00:02:35.880> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
two layers above the chest so here's the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.380 
two layers above the chest so here's the
chest<00:02:36.209> one<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.980> place<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.129> piston<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.640> you

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
chest one to place the piston and you

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.120 
chest one to place the piston and you
just<00:02:39.510> put<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.780> redstone<00:02:40.140> wire<00:02:40.380> right<00:02:40.799> next<00:02:41.069> to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
just put the redstone wire right next to

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.259 
just put the redstone wire right next to
the<00:02:41.220> piston<00:02:41.580> that's<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.910> cool<00:02:42.090> thing<00:02:42.120> about

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
the piston that's the cool thing about

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.839 
the piston that's the cool thing about
pistons<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.739> way<00:02:43.860> they<00:02:44.040> work<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.519> can<00:02:44.670> just

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
pistons the way they work you can just

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.460 
pistons the way they work you can just
have<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> powered<00:02:45.420> block<00:02:45.630> next<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.140> them<00:02:46.290> like

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
have a powered block next to them like

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.140 
have a powered block next to them like
the<00:02:46.560> red<00:02:46.680> stone<00:02:46.860> can<00:02:47.040> be<00:02:47.069> above<00:02:47.489> them<00:02:47.700> as<00:02:47.849> well

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
the red stone can be above them as well

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.330 
the red stone can be above them as well
you<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:48.900> see<00:02:49.049> it's<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.319> not<00:02:49.860> even<00:02:49.980> facing

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
you can see it's like not even facing

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.130 
you can see it's like not even facing
the<00:02:50.579> Pistons<00:02:50.910> which<00:02:51.060> most<00:02:51.390> things<00:02:51.599> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
the Pistons which most things the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.420 
the Pistons which most things the
restaurant<00:02:52.500> has<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.709> face<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:53.099> for<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.340> be

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
restaurant has to face it for to be

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.610 
restaurant has to face it for to be
powered<00:02:53.760> but<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:54.720> pistons<00:02:55.079> it<00:02:55.230> doesn't<00:02:55.530> what

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
powered but with pistons it doesn't what

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.140 
powered but with pistons it doesn't what
is<00:02:55.739> which<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.130> what<00:02:56.280> makes<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.579> so<00:02:56.760> easy<00:02:56.790> to

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
is which is what makes it so easy to

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.580 
is which is what makes it so easy to
make<00:02:57.209> this<00:02:57.420> circuit<00:02:59.750> what<00:03:00.750> else<00:03:00.900> what<00:03:01.170> else<00:03:01.200> I

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
make this circuit what else what else I

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.699 
make this circuit what else what else I
think<00:03:02.340> that's<00:03:02.579> basically<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.299> if<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.349> want<00:03:04.590> to

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
think that's basically it if you want to

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.500 
think that's basically it if you want to
make<00:03:05.130> more<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.459> these<00:03:05.640> you'll<00:03:05.910> just<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:06.299> to

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
make more of these you'll just have to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.620 
make more of these you'll just have to
either<00:03:07.579> watch<00:03:08.579> this<00:03:08.760> here<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.090> can<00:03:09.269> either

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
either watch this here you can either

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.319 
either watch this here you can either
just<00:03:09.989> like<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.829> know<00:03:10.950> make<00:03:11.549> multiple<00:03:12.269> of

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
just like you know make multiple of

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.910 
just like you know make multiple of
these<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.989> current<00:03:13.350> runs<00:03:13.530> out<00:03:13.709> of<00:03:13.739> power

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
these if the current runs out of power

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.319 
these if the current runs out of power
because<00:03:14.609> it's<00:03:14.730> too<00:03:14.850> far<00:03:15.030> away<00:03:15.120> from<00:03:15.209> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
because it's too far away from the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.270 
because it's too far away from the
switch<00:03:15.569> just<00:03:15.900> add<00:03:16.049> a<00:03:16.079> repeater<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.590> there

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
switch just add a repeater and there

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.039 
switch just add a repeater and there
will<00:03:17.400> be<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.549> small<00:03:17.760> delay<00:03:18.209> but<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.810> doesn't

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
will be a small delay but it doesn't

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.270 
will be a small delay but it doesn't
really<00:03:19.109> matter<00:03:19.350> i<00:03:19.560> have<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.709> small<00:03:19.829> delay<00:03:20.069> on

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
really matter i have a small delay on

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.120 
really matter i have a small delay on
actually<00:03:20.639> my<00:03:20.760> one<00:03:20.910> on<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.120> server<00:03:21.980> but<00:03:22.980> yeah

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
actually my one on the server but yeah

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.620 
actually my one on the server but yeah
it's<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> very<00:03:23.519> simple<00:03:23.670> design<00:03:24.120> it's<00:03:24.359> cool

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
it's a very simple design it's cool

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.900 
it's a very simple design it's cool
