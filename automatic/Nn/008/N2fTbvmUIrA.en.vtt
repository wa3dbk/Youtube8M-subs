00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:10.790
 and so hello my name is Misha and we 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:16.279
 you will learn some tricks with chips 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:26.749
 and let's begin the first trick with us 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:27.849
 looks like you make big 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:39.590
 finger 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:45.950
 I understand here's the first chip here and pull 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:53.000
 back that is lifted back days ago 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:54.980
 there we stretched it up here we 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.920
 we pull up she herself there as 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.920
 spinning and we press there with them and 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:16.179
 get a trick with salt again 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:23.659
 understand exactly let's tighten everything 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:26.170
 cub looks like a trick he sees 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.170
 so here 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:50.409
 why did he call a hurricane there 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:56.860
 what we do we take this way 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:02:00.840
 chips and we are trying to 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:04.560
 pull out your finger 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:09.369
 another here we behold it until your and 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.130
 Here is such a thing that we do 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.440
 further we here believe 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.010
 finger here click her chip 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.350
 scrolls and look and leave then 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:28.840
 there is a difference from degrees scrolling and 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:31.239
 and insert and all that is here we olive 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.910
 twisted pasted got scrolled 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:39.540
 pasted in principle easy to explain 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:42.239
 do you look at it again 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.720
 By these we constantly understand 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.720
 scrolled all 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:03:12.310
 let's move on to the next trick 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:16.799
 step looks like he don't know like that 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:25.060
 shadow don't know what to do with laziness but 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:32.220
 I hope that will be seen in general such 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:37.200
 the trick we divide the stack into two parts are equal and 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:48.190
 then look at my finger 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:04:01.299
 that is, here also see how to 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:04:06.120
 we are not worth the height of the shadow to do it and we 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.120
 I'll explain more 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:17.080
 sharing out 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:25.470
 and here we are raising the stack 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:25.470
 here and then they will fall part 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:34.330
 We raise this finger here and actually 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:42.070
 saying let's say so throw them they enter 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:47.909
 in another, that is, I lift and watch my 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:50.710
 then everything will turn out later 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:05:01.970
 it is necessary to train 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:05:06.920
 since something like this, and now turn to the 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:11.420
 last trick probably later we will study 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:14.690
 another twos tricks he placing me not 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:19.640
 straight ideally as if all the main pit 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:31.930
 it seemed like I know well looks 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:31.930
 he never paid me like this yet 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:49.040
 one turns out in general it's probably 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.590
 in the next video we will study this one 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.290
 trick 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.140
 well i'm his good better 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.729
 when I will get better on him 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:06.590
 I haven't paid my daughter yet 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:15.910
 too, and I begin to learn and another trick well 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:15.910
 and failures
