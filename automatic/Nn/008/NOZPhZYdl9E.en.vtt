film was going to be in here

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.340 
film was going to be in here
so<00:00:17.150> first<00:00:18.150> thing<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.390> can<00:00:18.630> do<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.109> check

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
so first thing you can do is just check

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.070 
so first thing you can do is just check
to<00:00:19.380> see<00:00:19.529> if<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.010> counter<00:00:20.550> here<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.060> set<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.840> s

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
to see if this counter here is set to s

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.810 
to see if this counter here is set to s
that<00:00:22.500> means<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.250> empty<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.670> there's

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
that means that it's empty and there's

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.599 
that means that it's empty and there's
no<00:00:23.970> exposures<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:26.130> doesn't<00:00:26.460> really

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
no exposures but that doesn't really

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.160 
no exposures but that doesn't really
matter<00:00:26.849> because<00:00:27.060> there<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> safety<00:00:28.140> device

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
matter because there is a safety device

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.080 
matter because there is a safety device
here<00:00:28.710> called<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.010> dark<00:00:29.310> slide<00:00:29.490> which<00:00:29.939> will

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
here called the dark slide which will

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.709 
here called the dark slide which will
prevent<00:00:30.359> any<00:00:30.630> light<00:00:30.960> getting<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.250> film<00:00:32.719> so

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
prevent any light getting to the film so

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.240 
prevent any light getting to the film so
make<00:00:33.870> sure<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.380> otherwise<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.160> won't

like I said just pull it down and then

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.950 
like I said just pull it down and then
open<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
open it up and then here you have the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.440 
open it up and then here you have the
magazine<00:01:28.700> or<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.439> insert<00:01:32.090> then<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.299> is

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
magazine or the the insert then this is

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.819 
magazine or the the insert then this is
the<00:01:33.540> holder<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.350> set<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.650> aside

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the holder you can just set this aside

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.499 
the holder you can just set this aside
for<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.979> previously<00:01:38.549> shot<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> roll<00:01:39.360> of

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
for now so I previously shot a roll of

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
for now so I previously shot a roll of
film<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.340> is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
film in here so you can see that this is

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.280 
film in here so you can see that this is
not<00:01:41.909> going<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> take-up<00:01:42.630> spool<00:01:43.020> which

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
not going to be the take-up spool which

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.429 
not going to be the take-up spool which
is<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.799> over<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.220> now<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:46.049> reason

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
is going to go over here now the reason

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.319 
is going to go over here now the reason
I<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.770> tell<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.159> take<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> spool<00:01:47.700> also<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
I can tell you to take a spool also is

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.179 
I can tell you to take a spool also is
there's<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.689> nice<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.229> arrow<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.740> which

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
there's a nice little arrow here which

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.770 
there's a nice little arrow here which
shows<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> film<00:01:50.790> coming<00:01:51.119> here<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.600> going

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
shows the film coming here and going

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.480 
shows the film coming here and going
around<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.619> also<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> marker<00:01:55.490> where

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
around and also this is the marker where

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.340 
around and also this is the marker where
the<00:01:56.640> new<00:01:57.740> film<00:01:58.740> goes<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.689> order<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the new film goes so in order to do that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.709 
the new film goes so in order to do that
you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> push<00:02:01.950> down<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.790> that

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
you can push down on this and that

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.550 
you can push down on this and that
releases<00:02:04.189> this<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.990> take<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.350> and

thing<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:06.069> prefer<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:09.629> this<00:03:10.629> is<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.109> paper

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
thing if you prefer so this is the paper

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.880 
thing if you prefer so this is the paper
backing

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
backing

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.819 
backing
so<00:03:12.519> is<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:12.879> but<00:03:13.720> once<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:14.049> rolls<00:03:14.260> out<00:03:14.500> which

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
so is this but once it rolls out which

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.339 
so is this but once it rolls out which
I'm<00:03:14.980> not<00:03:15.130> going<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.430> do<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.870> can<00:03:16.900> see<00:03:17.230> the

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
I'm not going to do you can see the

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.860 
I'm not going to do you can see the
actual<00:03:17.709> film<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.030> paper<00:03:19.239> backing<00:03:19.569> is

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
actual film so the paper backing is

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.440 
actual film so the paper backing is
actually<00:03:20.169> going<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.380> go<00:03:20.500> like<00:03:20.650> around<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:22.090> like

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
actually going to go like around it like

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.539 
actually going to go like around it like
this<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.989> then<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.829> means<00:03:23.980> eventually<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
this and then that means eventually the

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.009 
this and then that means eventually the
film<00:03:24.760> will<00:03:24.910> be<00:03:25.000> exposed<00:03:25.419> and<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.780> will<00:03:25.870> come

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
film will be exposed and it will come

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.949 
film will be exposed and it will come
back<00:03:26.230> around<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.090> want<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.569> take<00:03:28.690> this

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
back around so you want to take this

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.599 
back around so you want to take this
with<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.319> tab<00:03:29.560> sticking<00:03:29.859> out<00:03:30.129> and<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.459> want

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
with the tab sticking out and you want

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:42.860 
with the tab sticking out and you want
to<00:03:30.700> put<00:03:30.849> it<00:03:30.940> here

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.670 

all<00:03:43.870> right<00:03:43.990> you<00:03:44.080> want<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.260> make<00:03:44.380> sure<00:03:44.530> that's

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
all right you want to make sure that's

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.020 
all right you want to make sure that's
in<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:46.530> then<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.710> can<00:03:50.550> bring<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.730> film

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
in and then you can bring the film

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:03.270 
in and then you can bring the film
around<00:03:58.830> and<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:01.840> can<00:04:02.050> probably<00:04:02.380> do<00:04:02.860> this<00:04:03.010> with

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
around and you can probably do this with

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.220 
around and you can probably do this with
it<00:04:03.460> in<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.790> camera<00:04:04.030> outside<00:04:04.360> of<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.840> camera

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
it in the camera outside of the camera

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.780 
it in the camera outside of the camera
I've<00:04:06.160> probably<00:04:06.430> done<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.790> both<00:04:06.970> ways<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:09.640> then

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
I've probably done it both ways and then

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:31.550 
I've probably done it both ways and then
you<00:04:09.910> can<00:04:10.090> just<00:04:10.240> stick<00:04:10.510> this<00:04:10.750> back<00:04:10.990> in

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.540 

you<00:04:32.560> want<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.800> make<00:04:32.919> sure<00:04:32.949> everything<00:04:33.520> is

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
you want to make sure everything is

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:41.309 
you want to make sure everything is
lined<00:04:33.789> up<00:04:34.319> correctly<00:04:38.430> like<00:04:39.430> so<00:04:40.139> make<00:04:41.139> sure

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
lined up correctly like so make sure

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.140 
lined up correctly like so make sure
this<00:04:41.560> goes<00:04:41.860> across<00:04:42.219> you<00:04:42.699> want<00:04:42.879> this<00:04:42.969> to<00:04:43.120> be

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
this goes across you want this to be

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.990 
this goes across you want this to be
straight<00:04:43.599> and<00:04:43.830> nice<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.069> flat<00:04:45.370> which<00:04:45.729> it<00:04:45.909> will

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
straight and nice and flat which it will

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.740 
straight and nice and flat which it will
do<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.659> then<00:04:47.169> what<00:04:47.319> you<00:04:47.379> can<00:04:47.500> do<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:47.979> can

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
do and then what you can do is you can

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.439 
do and then what you can do is you can
start<00:04:49.750> giving<00:04:49.990> this<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.289> few<00:04:50.710> pulls<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.729> then

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
start giving this a few pulls and then

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.270 
start giving this a few pulls and then
once<00:04:52.629> you<00:04:52.719> see<00:04:52.900> this<00:04:53.020> arrow<00:04:53.379> you're<00:04:54.069> going<00:04:54.219> to

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
once you see this arrow you're going to

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.909 
once you see this arrow you're going to
want<00:04:54.430> to<00:04:54.490> line<00:04:54.669> that<00:04:55.030> arrow<00:04:55.389> going<00:04:55.810> down<00:04:56.139> with

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
want to line that arrow going down with

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.730 
want to line that arrow going down with
this<00:04:57.659> so<00:04:58.659> I'm<00:04:58.750> going<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:58.960> just<00:04:59.169> wind<00:04:59.469> it<00:04:59.620> a

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
this so I'm going to just wind it a

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.950 
this so I'm going to just wind it a
little<00:05:00.129> bit<00:05:00.430> till<00:05:00.879> it<00:05:01.000> gets<00:05:01.180> there

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.839 

that<00:05:04.960> looks<00:05:05.169> about<00:05:05.289> right<00:05:05.580> you'll<00:05:06.580> see<00:05:06.669> the

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
that looks about right you'll see the

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.260 
that looks about right you'll see the
counter<00:05:07.240> is<00:05:07.419> still<00:05:07.569> on<00:05:08.039> on<00:05:09.039> the<00:05:09.490> S<00:05:09.639> if<00:05:09.969> you<00:05:10.090> can

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
counter is still on on the S if you can

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.890 
counter is still on on the S if you can
see<00:05:10.419> that<00:05:11.909> and<00:05:12.909> we're<00:05:13.360> going<00:05:13.449> to<00:05:13.509> want<00:05:13.659> to<00:05:13.719> stop

start advancing the film and let me take
this<00:06:07.300> off<00:06:07.479> so<00:06:07.690> you<00:06:07.779> can<00:06:07.900> see
