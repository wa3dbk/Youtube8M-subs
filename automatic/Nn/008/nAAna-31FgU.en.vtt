it seems to be a good amount length
basically<00:00:58.829> enough<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.280> it'll<00:00:59.699> fit<00:01:00.050> nice

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
basically enough so that it'll fit nice

so<00:01:06.020> once<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.380> cut<00:01:07.830> what<00:01:08.340> we'll<00:01:08.520> do

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
so once we have that cut what we'll do

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.609 
so once we have that cut what we'll do
next<00:01:09.200> grab<00:01:10.200> our<00:01:10.350> lighter

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619

and we will sing the enemies of this one
side<00:01:22.689> of<00:01:22.810> this

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.720 

the<00:01:36.650> idea<00:01:36.950> behind<00:01:37.130> this<00:01:37.520> straw<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:39.830> contain

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
the idea behind this straw is to contain

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.770 
the idea behind this straw is to contain
the<00:01:41.420> cotton<00:01:42.140> ball<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.320> petroleum<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:44.360> keep<00:01:44.570> it

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
the cotton ball and petroleum to keep it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.570 
the cotton ball and petroleum to keep it
watertight<00:01:47.020> so<00:01:48.020> just<00:01:48.500> kind<00:01:48.650> of<00:01:48.680> squeeze<00:01:49.040> on<00:01:49.430> it

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
watertight so just kind of squeeze on it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:57.370 
watertight so just kind of squeeze on it
until<00:01:50.620> slowly<00:01:51.620> melts<00:01:55.660> be<00:01:56.660> sure<00:01:56.840> not<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.080> hold

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
until slowly melts be sure not to hold

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.770 
until slowly melts be sure not to hold
the<00:01:57.740> lighter<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.250> for<00:01:58.400> too<00:01:58.520> long<00:01:58.550> or<00:01:59.090> it

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
the lighter to it for too long or it

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.350 
the lighter to it for too long or it
will<00:01:59.960> obviously<00:02:00.410> burn<00:02:00.770> too<00:02:00.980> much<00:02:01.160> so<00:02:04.150> so<00:02:05.150> blow

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
will obviously burn too much so so blow

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.630 
will obviously burn too much so so blow
on<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.750> end<00:02:05.870> of<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.080> here<00:02:06.350> just<00:02:06.650> to<00:02:06.800> see<00:02:07.010> to

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
on the end of it here just to see to

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.460 
on the end of it here just to see to
make<00:02:07.670> sure<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.300> actually<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:09.520> watertight

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
make sure that it actually is watertight

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.880 
make sure that it actually is watertight
that's<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.740> very<00:02:13.310> important<00:02:13.700> step<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.680> there
