00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
first you can see kind of all the angles

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.420 
first you can see kind of all the angles
of<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.209> but<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:09.500> everything<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.190> comes

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
in there I don't know if you could

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:38.510 
in there I don't know if you could
really<00:04:30.520> tell<00:04:30.789> or<00:04:30.969> not<00:04:31.090> but<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:35.650> then<00:04:36.370> we<00:04:37.060> have

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
really tell or not but and then we have

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.860 
really tell or not but and then we have
this<00:04:39.520> which<00:04:39.939> is<00:04:40.120> supposed<00:04:40.419> to<00:04:40.509> be<00:04:40.659> an

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
this which is supposed to be an

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.570 
this which is supposed to be an
all-terrain<00:04:41.530> tank<00:04:42.340> vehicle<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:44.219> we<00:04:45.219> kind<00:04:45.460> of

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
all-terrain tank vehicle and we kind of

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.689 
all-terrain tank vehicle and we kind of
try<00:04:45.759> to<00:04:45.789> move<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.360> for<00:04:46.509> you<00:04:46.599> guys<00:04:47.219> go<00:04:48.219> like<00:04:48.430> this

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
try to move it for you guys go like this

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.629 
try to move it for you guys go like this
and<00:04:49.090> it's<00:04:49.870> supposed<00:04:50.199> to<00:04:50.349> move<00:04:50.530> both<00:04:51.370> of<00:04:51.550> these

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
and it's supposed to move both of these

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.309 
and it's supposed to move both of these
on<00:04:51.849> the<00:04:51.969> side<00:04:52.180> at<00:04:52.389> the<00:04:52.509> same<00:04:52.689> time<00:04:52.990> and

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
on the side at the same time and

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.320 
on the side at the same time and
sometimes<00:04:54.129> that<00:04:54.490> works<00:04:54.729> well<00:04:54.969> and<00:04:55.180> sometimes

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
sometimes that works well and sometimes

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.189 
sometimes that works well and sometimes
it<00:04:55.689> doesn't

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
it doesn't

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.959 
it doesn't
I<00:04:56.229> think<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.860> just<00:04:56.889> don't<00:04:57.189> have<00:04:57.400> them<00:04:57.490> angled

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:57.969 
I think I just don't have them angled

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:00.749 
I think I just don't have them angled
exactly<00:04:58.900> right<00:04:59.139> but<00:04:59.949> you<00:05:00.099> can<00:05:00.279> see<00:05:00.460> how<00:05:00.580> it

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
exactly right but you can see how it

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.990 
exactly right but you can see how it
moves<00:05:01.029> you<00:05:01.240> want<00:05:01.360> to<00:05:01.659> do<00:05:01.779> that<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.789> it's<00:05:03.789> hard

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
moves you want to do that so it's hard

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.760 
moves you want to do that so it's hard
to<00:05:04.060> get<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.330> side<00:05:04.539> pieces<00:05:04.840> just<00:05:05.259> right<00:05:05.560> so

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
to get the side pieces just right so

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.300 
to get the side pieces just right so
they<00:05:05.919> do<00:05:05.979> turn<00:05:06.449> but<00:05:07.449> it<00:05:08.169> does<00:05:08.319> work<00:05:08.560> sometimes

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
they do turn but it does work sometimes

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.550 
they do turn but it does work sometimes
I<00:05:09.789> think<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.360> works<00:05:10.509> better<00:05:10.629> going<00:05:11.020> backwards

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
I think it works better going backwards

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.399 
I think it works better going backwards
but<00:05:12.279> anyway<00:05:12.699> let<00:05:13.240> me<00:05:13.300> give<00:05:13.449> you<00:05:13.539> a<00:05:13.599> closer<00:05:14.139> look

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409 
but anyway let me give you a closer look

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.100 
but anyway let me give you a closer look
at<00:05:14.590> this<00:05:14.770> this<00:05:15.729> is<00:05:15.909> the<00:05:16.060> side<00:05:16.270> part<00:05:16.659> here<00:05:16.960> a

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
at this this is the side part here a

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.559 
at this this is the side part here a
little<00:05:18.039> blade<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.580> turns<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:20.490> it<00:05:21.490> does<00:05:21.819> you

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
little blade that turns and it does you

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.209 
little blade that turns and it does you
can<00:05:22.779> turn<00:05:23.020> it<00:05:23.169> all<00:05:23.349> the<00:05:23.439> way<00:05:23.560> around<00:05:23.889> but

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:24.219 
can turn it all the way around but

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.640 
can turn it all the way around but
that's<00:05:25.150> kinda<00:05:25.539> how<00:05:25.599> it's<00:05:25.779> supposed<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.139> go<00:05:26.229> and

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
that's kinda how it's supposed to go and

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.050 
that's kinda how it's supposed to go and
you've<00:05:27.129> got<00:05:27.279> the<00:05:27.400> same<00:05:27.580> thing<00:05:27.610> on<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.029> other

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
you've got the same thing on the other

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.170 
you've got the same thing on the other
side<00:05:30.479> right<00:05:31.479> over<00:05:31.509> here<00:05:32.339> and<00:05:33.339> there's<00:05:33.819> kind<00:05:34.029> of

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
side right over here and there's kind of

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.360 
side right over here and there's kind of
just<00:05:34.539> the<00:05:34.690> side<00:05:34.930> view<00:05:35.259> of<00:05:35.289> this<00:05:35.860> in<00:05:36.039> general

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370

whole part off I'm gonna attempt to do

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.860 
whole part off I'm gonna attempt to do
this<00:06:09.699> without<00:06:09.879> breaking<00:06:10.419> it

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
this without breaking it

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.499 
this without breaking it
there<00:06:11.770> we<00:06:11.889> go<00:06:12.039> see<00:06:13.000> there's<00:06:13.180> this<00:06:13.300> little

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
there we go see there's this little

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:17.459 
there we go see there's this little
piece<00:06:13.779> here<00:06:13.810> that<00:06:14.289> it<00:06:14.860> goes<00:06:15.610> on<00:06:15.819> -<00:06:16.089> you<00:06:17.080> can<00:06:17.199> see

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:17.469 
piece here that it goes on - you can see

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:20.070 
piece here that it goes on - you can see
it<00:06:18.069> just<00:06:18.099> goes<00:06:18.430> on<00:06:18.610> right<00:06:18.969> there<00:06:19.240> and<00:06:19.839> you<00:06:19.930> can

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
it just goes on right there and you can

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.050 
it just goes on right there and you can
push<00:06:20.289> it<00:06:20.409> down<00:06:20.589> and<00:06:20.800> it<00:06:21.339> stays<00:06:21.699> on<00:06:21.819> there

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
push it down and it stays on there

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.890 
push it down and it stays on there
really<00:06:22.419> well<00:06:22.830> but<00:06:23.830> ok<00:06:24.699> so<00:06:25.389> that's<00:06:25.599> what<00:06:25.810> it

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
really well but ok so that's what it

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.129 
really well but ok so that's what it
looks<00:06:26.080> like<00:06:26.259> without<00:06:27.089> his<00:06:28.089> extra<00:06:28.659> little<00:06:28.839> part

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
looks like without his extra little part

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:35.280 
looks like without his extra little part
on<00:06:29.319> there

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:41.290 

and<00:06:36.290> so<00:06:37.240> here<00:06:38.240> is<00:06:38.770> this<00:06:39.770> part<00:06:40.130> that<00:06:40.280> he<00:06:40.460> uses

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
and so here is this part that he uses

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.280 
and so here is this part that he uses
and<00:06:41.660> you<00:06:41.750> can<00:06:41.930> move<00:06:42.110> these<00:06:42.320> arms<00:06:42.860> in<00:06:43.040> the<00:06:43.100> back

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
and you can move these arms in the back

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.010 
and you can move these arms in the back
it's<00:06:45.290> kind<00:06:45.530> kind<00:06:46.280> of<00:06:46.400> neat<00:06:46.580> I<00:06:46.790> mean<00:06:47.000> it<00:06:47.630> kind<00:06:47.930> of

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
it's kind kind of neat I mean it kind of
