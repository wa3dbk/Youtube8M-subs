00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.470
 in order to grow tomatoes without 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.530
 fawn all summer you need them first 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.750
 grow seedlings right 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.910
 seedlings grown flax film 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.539
 here it is only three tablespoons 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.539
 soil means you when peter go away seedlings 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:28.260
 then you do the following you pour two 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.619
 spoons of soil turn the film like 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.950
 at child roll you put on an elastic band and 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.809
 write what kind of make them here 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.230
 such a box you see them as many 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.390
 here it fits 6 7 8 pieces and takes 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.059
 just from as many places and so many 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.910
 soil but when the plant becomes 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.640
 big he needs to add a third spoon 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.129
 soil you add add more 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.219
 one spoonful of soil and no longer bending 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.789
 film roll up such a cylinder 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.469
 wear gum and put it here again 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.220
 that's all 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.369
 Why is this done because usually 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.920
 when picking, it recommends a third lower 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.049
 tear off the roots so that he looks like a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.619
 I don't need this I need all the roots 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.939
 grew solely down and look 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:25.080
 what happens next means here I take 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:28.280
 doing well, let's say a landing here 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.180
 we have free space now doing 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.829
 pay attention to the hole 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.640
 ordinary feather feather and old pillow 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.119
 for what first is warm secondly 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.290
 rots in season 1 overheats and it's clean 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.570
 organic silicon 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.000
 which makes the vessels of plants very 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.659
 strong I am amazed a lot of different 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.560
 diseases 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.619
 now look since there from big 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.229
 phosphorus lover then i put in that hole 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.640
 right here on this feather well about 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.479
 tablespoon granulated 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.149
 superphosphate because he needs more 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.099
 and micronutrients then I'm down below small 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.970
 a pinch of field faction ago 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.230
 and the main secret is to pour it into this. 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:23.370
 well 5 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:25.739
 liters of water I take and turn the seedlings 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.500
 this diaper you look i shake off 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.950
 see how the soil is located 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.090
 roots see they don't branch they all 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.349
 grow down it unlike all all 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.079
 recommend books to pinch when 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.269
 census ditch and lower thorn roots 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:46.829
 they did not branch then they all go here 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.599
 and then they go on the surface and stereo 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.349
 cp dad surface becomes 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.269
 dependents 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.299
 and you have to water with them there 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.750
 at a very low layer of soil and magicians 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:01.349
 will go down because the tip of each 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.319
 the root has, let's say, scent all 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.030
 water where is the water and the food I brought out 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:11.359
 There and many and she now will 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:16.079
 pass down I drop the seedlings and 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:18.450
 I fall asleep 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.930
 and the last moment not to 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.099
 let the moisture evaporate from the surface berg 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.910
 I wear this bib on these tomatoes 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.099
 from the newspaper 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.049
 here's a plain black and white newspaper not 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.750
 fear no lead there is no all photo 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:37.769
 way printed here she can see in 4 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:42.120
 addition yes I'm like this here by mail 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:46.709
 I move at times in 1 gap the cut and all 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.450
 and the more I do not water them all summer 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.870
 can pay attention so planted 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.930
 all the tomatoes in this wonderful greenhouse 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.220
 brighter all at once tomatoes and peppers and 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.739
 eggplants and cucumbers are watermelons and melons and they 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.569
 fine all get along spring everyone wants 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.940
 and there already my shovel all the leaves 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.579
 put everything in order displaces everything 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.769
 leaves burn more besides it 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.750
 wrong approach 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.209
 of nature it is not provided for all this 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.160
 should perry rot and be first 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.930
 food for soil microorganisms and 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.000
 secondly reborn 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.230
 period 3 humus which is food 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.200
 natural 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.420
 and plants therefore by no means 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.890
 nothing you can not remove the leaves nothing if 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.160
 afraid that there was a lot there 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.640
 Do you see illnesses and burn in spring 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.860
 and in the fall everything is under those plants 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.950
 phytosporin or let's say spray all 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.360
 church food and no diseases 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.360
 no pests nothing
