00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
that's good and bad there's something to

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.349 
that's good and bad there's something to
be<00:03:21.650> said<00:03:21.859> about<00:03:21.890> having<00:03:22.519> a<00:03:22.579> car<00:03:22.819> that<00:03:22.849> no<00:03:23.209> one

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
be said about having a car that no one

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.720 
be said about having a car that no one
else<00:03:23.540> has<00:03:23.810> it's<00:03:24.379> rare<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.370> makes<00:03:25.579> it

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
else has it's rare and that makes it

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.699 
else has it's rare and that makes it
cool<00:03:25.969> but<00:03:26.930> here's<00:03:27.109> another<00:03:27.200> school<00:03:27.680> of

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
cool but here's another school of

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.009 
cool but here's another school of
thought<00:03:28.000> maybe<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.239> have<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.420> card<00:03:29.719> that<00:03:29.780> no

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
thought maybe you have a card that no

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.050 
thought maybe you have a card that no
one<00:03:30.170> else<00:03:30.290> has<00:03:30.500> because<00:03:30.890> it's<00:03:31.219> terrible<00:03:31.730> and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
one else has because it's terrible and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.240 
one else has because it's terrible and
maybe<00:03:32.569> there's<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:32.989> many<00:03:33.109> 911s<00:03:33.829> on<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.069> road

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
maybe there's so many 911s on the road

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.940 
maybe there's so many 911s on the road
because<00:03:34.790> it's<00:03:35.120> so<00:03:35.299> brilliant<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:36.079> think<00:03:36.560> that's

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
because it's so brilliant I think that's

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.420
