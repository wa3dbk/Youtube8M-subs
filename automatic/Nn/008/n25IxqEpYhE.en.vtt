to six dollars if you have coupons a
little<00:00:53.460> bit<00:00:53.579> cheaper<00:00:53.789> some<00:00:54.270> stores<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
little bit cheaper some stores are a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.389 
little bit cheaper some stores are a
little<00:00:54.870> bit<00:00:55.050> more<00:00:55.079> that's<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> average

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
little bit more that's just the average

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
so every time I clean so once a month I

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.479 
so every time I clean so once a month I
may<00:00:59.670> run<00:00:59.969> out<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.180> paths<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.800> solution<00:01:02.280> I

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
may run out of paths and of solution I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.630 
may run out of paths and of solution I
would<00:01:03.149> come<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.719> come<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.290> about

a<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.840> differently<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:14.750> even

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
a way to to do that differently I even

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.359 
a way to to do that differently I even
went<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.049> far<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.619> time<00:01:16.799> punching<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.340> hole

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
went as far as one time punching a hole

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.070 
went as far as one time punching a hole
in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.850> bottle<00:01:18.210> trying<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> refill<00:01:18.960> the

in the bottle trying to refill the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.649 
in the bottle trying to refill the
bottle<00:01:19.500> thus<00:01:20.100> whimpers<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.549> can't<00:01:20.820> refill<00:01:21.360> I

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
bottle thus whimpers you can't refill I

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.190

tried<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> whole<00:01:22.619> hole<00:01:23.310> didn't<00:01:23.640> work<00:01:24.020> we<00:01:25.020> be

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
tried the whole hole didn't work we be

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.109 
tried the whole hole didn't work we be
used<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.619> paths<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.340> didn't<00:01:26.729> work<00:01:26.909> either

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.399 
used to paths that didn't work either
fit<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.290> was<00:01:28.500> quite<00:01:28.680> costly<00:01:29.509> and<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.840> haven't

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
fit so it was quite costly and I haven't

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.219 
fit so it was quite costly and I haven't
really<00:01:31.710> used<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:32.220> Swiffer<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.670> lot<00:01:33.110> because<00:01:34.110> of

checked it out when when the Swiffer out

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.609 
checked it out when when the Swiffer out
the<00:01:53.399> Lippman<00:01:53.759> arrived<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.350> how<00:01:55.500> it
