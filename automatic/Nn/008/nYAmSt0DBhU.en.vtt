00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.940
 I'm mario and today we start with 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.309
 that series of videos in which we're going 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.650
 to go showing them as the final user 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.600
 It is already a fact that it will come out on the 18th 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.279
 September the final version for 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.640
 all users who have what is 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.099
 an iphone 5 an iphone 4s at the moment 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.019
 and ipad 2 onwards all of them are going to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.699
 to be able to access what is 7 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.579
 let's hope that soon for what is the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.440
 iphone 4 but good reviewing a little bit 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.170
 I already have the codemasters version and they are 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.239
 observers from the left side of his 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.059
 screen will find what is a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.160
 ips w in this case is the file that 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.289
 apple lets me download as 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.719
 developer called gone master 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.820
 which is the final version if you do not have 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.309
 this license do not worry exit 18 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.360
 it's going to come out, do not despair, you're missing 8 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.879
 days and you will be able to download 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.770
 completely free only that there is 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.390
 people who want to start testing the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.469
 video of what you are going to deal with today is a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.500
 little bit about what the configuration is 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.270
 there are two new changes one in the tones 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.620
 the funds I want to show you 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.510
 then I go into what is 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.760
 quickly to the configuration option 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.470
 to continue testing it and realize 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.690
 the icons as my friend said he took out the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.130
 what we were doing is going 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.750
 appearing little more detail 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.180
 icons are doing the smallest 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.900
 tighter and there are two new options 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.310
 one is the brightness and wallpapers in 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.740
 brightness and screen fusion we are going to 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.229
 enter where it says select fund of 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.150
 screen and bevel good and we had 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.950
 seen but now in dynamic appear 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.570
 the colors that you will be able to use 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.509
 directly on the new devices 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.960
 iphone 5 realize yellow green 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.430
 blue gray and blue red of which is 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.100
 there by default 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.480
 also still images appear in this 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.580
 remember that when you 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.010
 they are going to add they are applying with a 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.240
 suburb and we will be in the background 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.490
 green 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.939
 wonderful is enough as an android 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.439
 as they say but it really looks very good 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.659
 apart if you are doing the movement 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.500
 when you let it go it's going to go 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.170
 moving a little bit let's see another one 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.729
 very good for apple began to change what 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.370
 which are the designs new designs 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.350
 completely that make you already 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.270
 when they have this version they will be able to 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.030
 remember them this is the gold version 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.160
 master you are going to be able to start 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.600
 work with her as of 18 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.270
 September and if you account 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.140
 developer can do it 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.030
 automatically at the moment that the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.860
 downloads good I wanted to show you the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.510
 remember we are going to have is showing in 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.330
 this channel all the options here you 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.000
 you put in both I'm going to say yes and 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.280
 there is the version completely in your 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.780
 device what 's fine is not the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.400
 another is the other advantage also the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.220
 we manage in configurations that are in 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.410
 funds and I 'm also going to show you what 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.480
 that you have in the option of sounds there 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.970
 seven new warning sounds in this 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.440
 case in ring tones opening in the 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.440
 shore of the sea because if they listen 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.560
 are those new sounds 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.790
