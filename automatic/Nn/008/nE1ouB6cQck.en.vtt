shift<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.879> definitely<00:02:09.690> subtle<00:02:10.050> because<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
shift is definitely subtle because the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.860

it<00:02:23.930> like<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.709> kind<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:24.950> reminds<00:02:25.370> me<00:02:25.430> of

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
it like that it kind of reminds me of

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.180 
it like that it kind of reminds me of
club<00:02:26.030> from<00:02:26.660> Mac<00:02:27.260> if<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.650> have<00:02:27.830> that<00:02:27.950> color

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
club from Mac if you have that color

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.250 
club from Mac if you have that color
it's<00:02:28.370> very<00:02:28.430> similar<00:02:28.849> but<00:02:29.180> it's<00:02:29.299> got<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.690> nicer

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
it's very similar but it's got a nicer

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.280 
it's very similar but it's got a nicer
texture<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.950> would<00:02:31.340> say<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.599> green<00:02:32.900> shift

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
texture I would say that the green shift

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.920 
texture I would say that the green shift
is<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.739> main<00:02:33.920> thing<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.370> see<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.849> do<00:02:35.299> see<00:02:35.660> kind

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
is the main thing you see I do see kind

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.710 
is the main thing you see I do see kind
of<00:02:36.049> a<00:02:36.170> reddish<00:02:36.709> brown<00:02:37.209> undertone<00:02:38.209> but<00:02:38.239> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
of a reddish brown undertone but the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.660 
of a reddish brown undertone but the
green<00:02:38.989> definitely<00:02:39.680> comes<00:02:40.010> through<00:02:40.129> more<00:02:40.489> than

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
green definitely comes through more than

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.190 
green definitely comes through more than
that<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:41.120> green<00:02:41.420> comes<00:02:41.720> through<00:02:41.989> more<00:02:42.170> than

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
that the green comes through more than

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.900 
that the green comes through more than
any<00:02:42.530> of<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.830> other<00:02:43.010> shifts<00:02:43.549> in<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.760> other

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
any of the other shifts in the other

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.990 
any of the other shifts in the other
colors<00:02:44.329> next<00:02:44.900> shade<00:02:45.410> is<00:02:45.709> tonic<00:02:46.340> this<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.819> a

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
colors next shade is tonic this is a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.630 
colors next shade is tonic this is a
lilac<00:02:47.450> with<00:02:47.690> blue<00:02:47.930> shift<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.560> really<00:02:49.250> like<00:02:49.430> this

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
lilac with blue shift I really like this

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.069 
lilac with blue shift I really like this
color<00:02:49.940> it's<00:02:50.180> definitely<00:02:50.599> on<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.840> lighter

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
color it's definitely on the lighter

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.319 
color it's definitely on the lighter
side<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.769> if<00:02:51.829> you<00:02:51.920> wanted<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.310> apply<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.670> as<00:02:52.970> a

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
side so if you wanted to apply it as a

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.809 
side so if you wanted to apply it as a
main<00:02:53.959> lid<00:02:54.230> color<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.590> would<00:02:54.799> probably<00:02:55.069> use<00:02:55.519> a

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
main lid color I would probably use a

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.119 
main lid color I would probably use a
white<00:02:55.880> eyeshadow<00:02:56.510> base<00:02:56.989> but<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.769> has<00:02:57.950> like<00:02:58.099> a

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
white eyeshadow base but it has like a

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.119 
white eyeshadow base but it has like a
really<00:02:58.670> cool<00:02:58.970> blue<00:02:59.269> shift<00:02:59.629> to<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.079> and<00:03:00.379> I<00:03:00.709> think

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
really cool blue shift to it and I think

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.979 
really cool blue shift to it and I think
it<00:03:01.220> would<00:03:01.340> look<00:03:01.370> really<00:03:01.640> nice<00:03:01.819> actually<00:03:02.120> as<00:03:02.599> an

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
it would look really nice actually as an

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.630 
it would look really nice actually as an
inner<00:03:03.200> corner<00:03:03.590> highlight<00:03:03.620> if<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.280> use<00:03:04.430> it

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
inner corner highlight if you use it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.369 
inner corner highlight if you use it
over<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> white<00:03:05.209> eyeshadow<00:03:05.450> base<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.170> make<00:03:06.260> it

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
over a white eyeshadow base to make it

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.250 
over a white eyeshadow base to make it

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
burgundy with a purple shift so this is

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
Burgundy I don't know if I describe it

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.440 
Burgundy I don't know if I describe it
as<00:03:36.829> Burgundy<00:03:37.280> but<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.639> color<00:03:37.849> is<00:03:38.120> beautiful

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
as Burgundy but the color is beautiful

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.180 
as Burgundy but the color is beautiful
nonetheless<00:03:38.989> so<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.590> really<00:03:39.859> like<00:03:40.010> these

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.949 
because I love duochrome
dual<00:03:43.040> tone<00:03:43.370> shadows<00:03:43.880> like<00:03:44.090> this<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.540> have<00:03:44.720> a

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
dual tone shadows like this that have a

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.140

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
shift of another color in them so you

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.180 
shift of another color in them so you
kind<00:03:47.389> of<00:03:47.450> get<00:03:47.569> like<00:03:47.660> two-tone<00:03:48.260> going<00:03:48.680> on<00:03:48.829> all
