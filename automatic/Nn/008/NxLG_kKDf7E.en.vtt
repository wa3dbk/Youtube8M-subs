00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello people on youtube, how are you? 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.710
 this is a table more in the video and then people 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.690
 all right with you as you have seen 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.660
 in the title I'm going to bring today to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.230
 You are the review of my race or 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.090
 My capture card is pretty cute and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.010
 I think after five months with 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.580
 She may already bring a verdict to 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.439
 you on my opinion is the sign and 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.790
 if she is very simple people 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.760
 it has entries in the component and ademir 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.920
 and here the outputs both so it is not 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.140
 a simple board is not even because the price 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.510
 of it is at least 600 reais at least 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.460
 What I paid for and she a good sign is 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.379
 imported and I thoroughly enjoyed the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.210
 quality and now I'm talking about a 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.210
 little more to you 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.530
 well then let's go to the good points 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.320
 of the next positive board is that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.439
 I can record both my xbox 360 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.420
 how about my computer because the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.180
 my video card it transmits to 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.509
 computer image and hdmi then 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.340
 connectu to an hdmi cable and I know that I 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.799
 my video card connect to here and 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.509
 here I record in camera software 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.009
 another good point is that I can 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:32.880
 recording at 480 b 720p and 1080p actual is not 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.600
 1080 lines is not the best right there 1080 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.090
 are 1080p really good 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.950
 in class is very good too because she 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.399
 It gives you the opportunity to do 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.649
 her life after she invaded and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.570
 to assert commenting a bad side 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.600
 Who are you doing here? 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.970
 it's a problem and I what I am 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.280
 facing but it is not that it is a point 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.750
 negative but it is something that is worth 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.299
 It's worth noting that I have 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.280
 enough problem so let's go to me 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.869
 because 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.940
 so my card is plugged into my 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.979
 so if my notebook is 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.770
 turned off automatically or will not 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.270
 image of my pc or my notebook 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.520
 always have to be connected by a 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.069
 person is working because that 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.959
 from here it 's moved to usb and what I do is that 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.780
 USB drive that is connected to the 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.050
 notebook or when I turn off my 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.730
 notebook and my computer to 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.830
 plate turns off his computer does not have 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.140
 image only when I'm going to turn the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.900
 computer again, I have to connect the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.870
 notebook only when I call it is as if 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.370
 the board did not recognize the meeting 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.980
 because I have to do I have to 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.940
 remove the sbt from the card or disconnect 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.530
 computer 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.410
 if this does not solve I have to come 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.510
 here disengage the hdmi cable that comes in 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.190
 my video card unplug and connect 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.260
 again in my opinion this is one of the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.880
 main programs that basically 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.950
 I have to do it every day . 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.330
 who says it completes the way and has 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.800
 What are you calling again? 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.220
 so let's go there for the negatives 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.220
 now 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.720
 It's good, the way I said it before. 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.400
 You who live stream are very 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.590
 interesting that the book cover option 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.910
 of the board alone has a large 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.650
 problem 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.740
 you need to first have to have 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.840
 a very good shot the plate goes late 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.900
 advising you to do this in the least 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.290
 700 kbps per second this would give about 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.810
 70 cabin of one rider per second 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.630
 not like I do not have only at home not 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.610
 is trying to seal trying to improve the 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.260
 quality in the cloud for now 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.650
 have lightning and playing with 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.260
 But the main problem is the delay 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.080
 What does it cause in yours on your video? 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.630
 Let's say I'm playing here. 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.860
 You 're just going to see me playing a 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.140
 minute later 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.950
 so it's really like it's not the 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.110
 heard 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.050
 I'll bring new ones here, you're not alone. 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.330
 Good, you do not see live so it's okay. 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.110
 I know it's kind of weird. 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.870
 but created as the reason for the connection of the 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.269
 Component cable here right now I've never tested 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.190
 I've never done that part of testing so 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.700
 really you ask me not to vote 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.500
 whether or not it can work. 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.180
 being burned football might not 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.430
 The videos I bring to you are 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.840
 all in hdmi this is one thing that 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.780
 Very happy that as I said I 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.729
 may I be bringing you the question 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.700
 so of pc and video gameplay 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:31.490
 or is it in my opinion a way 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.800
 very good of course has better 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.930
 What the market has is the cat, for example. 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.669
 a much better plate that you will 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.430
 be at the same price as the 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.169
 that 's just that I really liked this low 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.800
 when I thought 'no I want this 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:48.260
 up to cost-benefit 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.390
 here in my same great state of the south 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.640
 nor the plate on the scene very cute soon 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.620
 leave here for fox channel 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.110
 She's very cute, even here. 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.850
 right 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.580
 here is a little light today when she 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.980
 It is working and that there is this guys 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.080
 teaches very good only one to complement 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.330
 it has software that is the program that 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.600
 You use it for recording and it has some 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.040
 only one of the problems that I 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.880
 I do not know where I go every time I 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.440
 grave river 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.020
 so I record the video only the 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.940
 universe can not recognize the video 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.220
 which comes out straight on the plate because 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.320
 because in fact it recognizes the 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.150
 video only audio from your gameplay 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.460
 Then the lawyer can not get 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.500
 I can seal edit video has to 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.960
 pick up unused software coming 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.220
 here together and then thereafter go through sony 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.520
 then this is a process that 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.070
 It takes a little bit but nothing much. 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.380
 I do not know anything that bothers you much more 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.000
 are classes where you might have had a 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.700
 update they could change the 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.130
 format is to wash wmv or avi that they stay 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.990
 importing the universes of the 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.490
 series guys so does she if you 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.680
 any doubt about that mark 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.270
 can you ask me, I already have a good 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.190
 knowledge about her imagine I'm 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.200

 put here but guys so that was it
