00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
but then on the other hand we have

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.029 
but then on the other hand we have
testificandum<00:00:23.930> for<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> pretty<00:00:25.230> long<00:00:25.410> time<00:00:25.470> and

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
hand we just don't have that at the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.380 
hand we just don't have that at the
moment<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:11.039> bring<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.400> saddle<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.940> here

so

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.490 
so
rather<00:02:13.180> than<00:02:13.450> actually<00:02:13.630> just<00:02:13.930> right-clicking

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
rather than actually just right-clicking

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.110 
rather than actually just right-clicking
with<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.770> saddle<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.220> having<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.820> equipped

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
with the saddle and having it equipped

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.700 
with the saddle and having it equipped
and<00:02:16.300> not<00:02:16.600> being<00:02:16.840> able<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.110> fetch<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.290> ever

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.240 
and not being able to fetch it ever
again

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
again

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.850 
again
now<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:18.910> can<00:02:19.180> actually<00:02:19.360> fetch<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.500> off<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.770> him

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
now you can actually fetch it off of him

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.220 
now you can actually fetch it off of him
if<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.130> want<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.610> say<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:22.210> don't<00:02:22.690> know<00:02:22.780> exchange
