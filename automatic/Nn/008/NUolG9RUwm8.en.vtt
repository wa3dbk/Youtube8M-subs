the a-pillars they're all completely

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.410 
the a-pillars they're all completely
reinforced<00:02:03.859> this<00:02:04.009> is<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.159> heavier<00:02:04.579> car<00:02:04.939> than

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420

its other PT Cruiser siblings and it

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.449 
its other PT Cruiser siblings and it
makes<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.289> actually<00:02:09.560> drive<00:02:09.739> better<00:02:09.979> it<00:02:10.280> feels

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
makes it actually drive better it feels

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.100 
makes it actually drive better it feels
a<00:02:10.670> little<00:02:10.789> bit<00:02:10.970> better<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.540> road<00:02:11.690> also

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
a little bit better on the road also

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.110 
a little bit better on the road also
smaller<00:02:12.709> cars<00:02:13.040> like<00:02:13.280> this<00:02:13.489> in<00:02:13.670> convertibles

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
smaller cars like this in convertibles

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.240 
smaller cars like this in convertibles
tend<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.629> be<00:02:14.750> very<00:02:15.049> very<00:02:15.349> loud<00:02:15.560> on<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.890> open

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
tend to be very very loud on the open

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.940 
tend to be very very loud on the open
road<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.940> PT<00:02:17.299> Cruiser<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.349> opposite<00:02:18.830> of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
road the PT Cruiser is the opposite of

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.380 
road the PT Cruiser is the opposite of
that<00:02:19.129> it's<00:02:19.340> one<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.760> quietest

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
that it's one of the quietest

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.770 
that it's one of the quietest
convertibles<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.620> not<00:02:21.830> only<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.780> really

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
convertibles so not only is it a really

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.740 
convertibles so not only is it a really
party

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.990 

relaxing<00:02:27.410> car<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.740> drive<00:02:27.920> as<00:02:28.130> well<00:02:28.280> now<00:02:28.790> this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
relaxing car to drive as well now this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000 
relaxing car to drive as well now this
isn't<00:02:29.270> actually<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:29.930> roll<00:02:30.230> bar<00:02:30.410> they<00:02:30.590> call<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:30.920> a

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
isn't actually a roll bar they call it a

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.310 
isn't actually a roll bar they call it a
sport<00:02:31.490> bar<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:32.540> what's<00:02:32.720> nice<00:02:32.900> about<00:02:32.930> the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
sport bar and so what's nice about the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.050 
sport bar and so what's nice about the
sport<00:02:33.560> bar<00:02:33.800> it's<00:02:33.920> actually<00:02:34.370> lit<00:02:34.580> underneath

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
sport bar it's actually lit underneath

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.850 
sport bar it's actually lit underneath
and<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.660> have<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> lot<00:02:36.020> more<00:02:36.050> lighting<00:02:36.680> than

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
and so you have a lot more lighting than

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.070 
and so you have a lot more lighting than
you<00:02:36.980> do<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:37.430> other<00:02:37.760> convertibles<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.930> also

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
you do in other convertibles it also

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.380 
you do in other convertibles it also
reinforces<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:40.310> entirety<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.150> chassis

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
reinforces the entirety of the chassis

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.170 
reinforces the entirety of the chassis
and<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.260> again<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.830> rock-solid<00:02:43.670> feel

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
and so again it's that rock-solid feel

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.760 
and so again it's that rock-solid feel
that<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.600> really<00:02:44.930> sell<00:02:45.260> them<00:02:45.440> fine<00:02:45.740> and

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
that you really sell them fine and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.710 
that you really sell them fine and
smaller<00:02:46.370> convertibles<00:02:47.000> really<00:02:47.480> in<00:02:47.570> any

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
smaller convertibles really in any

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.030 
smaller convertibles really in any
convertible<00:02:48.380> for<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.680> matter

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
convertible for that matter

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.220 
convertible for that matter
these<00:02:49.459> PT<00:02:49.820> cruisers<00:02:50.209> are<00:02:50.450> actually<00:02:50.870> quite

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
these PT cruisers are actually quite

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.280 
these PT cruisers are actually quite
stout<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.850> if<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.209> look<00:02:53.360> around<00:02:53.660> no

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
stout and so the if you look around no

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.990 
stout and so the if you look around no
scratches<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:54.950> any<00:02:55.070> kind<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.550> wheels<00:02:55.760> look

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
scratches of any kind the wheels look

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.630 
scratches of any kind the wheels look
fantastic<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:57.140> GT<00:02:57.709> turbo<00:02:58.070> comes<00:02:58.280> with<00:02:58.520> its

fantastic the GT turbo comes with its

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.400 
fantastic the GT turbo comes with its
own<00:02:58.760> wheel<00:02:59.060> they<00:02:59.480> thought<00:02:59.780> that<00:03:00.020> wasn't<00:03:00.200> good

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
own wheel they thought that wasn't good

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.900 
own wheel they thought that wasn't good
enough<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.830> they<00:03:00.920> upgraded<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.580> something

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
enough and they upgraded it to something

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.000 
enough and they upgraded it to something
even<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.180> little<00:03:02.300> bit<00:03:02.480> more<00:03:02.660> expensive<00:03:03.010> heated
