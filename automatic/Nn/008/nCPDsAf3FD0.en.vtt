00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:09.100
 hello good today I bring you a goal 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:12.370
 canon is a canon 35 70 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.290
 and it is because it does not have m that is to say no 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.840
 we have the typical little button to put it 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:21.020
 in a manual in manual focus 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.560
 and good as you can see is a super goal 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.260
 simple we do not have much that much 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.380
 teach the truth because good as you 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.070
 commented because we do not have m button or 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.900
 nothing is a very fast objective focuses 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.300
 very fast although it makes a lot of noise 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.710
 they have pretty fast approaches the 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.739
 entrance lights 3,545 and good already has 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.430
 a few years of second-hand what 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.910
 you can find between 70 and 100 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.329
 euros more or less as you can see 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.930
 has the mobile body that is to say that the 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.060
 approach is internal and good for example and 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.420
 cooked you have a camera then 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.280
 reel 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.730
 OK 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.600
 and it works perfectly 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.600
 two 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.300
 OK 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.920
 so you can see that it works 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.740
 perfectly 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.970
 as if you have a camera 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.970
 Professional 5 inside 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.560
 to 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.060
 let's put it on 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.060
 it would also work for us 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.070
 that is, we are talking about what is 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.070
 a goal that works for us 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.640
 so turn it off 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:03.530
 it's not a heavy goal it 's a goal 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.479
 well rather light and good what I'm going 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.750
 to do is mount it in the camera and go 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.550
 to try a little bit, how are the 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.580
 approaches I tell you a little about the noise that 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.580
 do and I do some quality test 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.260
 we just put it together, we have it 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.110
 mounted and good as you see the qualities 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.700
 Well, they are not bad either 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.880
 the approaches are quite fast 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.230
 we focus on the objective 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.230
 we focus on the apple 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.640
 and as you can see, the objectives are 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.040
 the approaches are going very well this 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.000
 right now we have it in 35 if the 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.000
 we would have 70 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.390
 you see the depths of field that 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.830
 It is very good 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.830
 let's focus the apple 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.290
 and good as you see the depths of 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.020
 field are very good qualities of 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.630
 video photo are also not bad 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.030
 let's take out the landscape so you can see 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.030
 the landscape as it reacts 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.810
 24 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.580
 and the qualities that we have in the 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.580
 objective 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.990
 and if we go up to 70 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.270
 well more of the same 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.400
 the qualities are not bad 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.690
 we have good contrasts good lights 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.820
 we do not have chromatic aberrations and the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.270
 approaches are pretty fast like os 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.270
 I was commenting 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.510
 OK 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.130
 it's not a slow target although if Rus 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.130
 noisy I'm going to bring the microphone 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.140
 ok check that is a goal 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.380
 quite noisy but still being noisy 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.220
 we have very good focusing qualities 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.840
 and photography 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.780
 I'm not going to tell you that for videos it's a 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.880
 tremendous goal more than anything for the 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.550
 noise but if we have a microphone 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.320
 externally, and so on, 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.800
 nothing bad 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.060
 the issue of quality and 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.190
 photography, you can see the 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.550
 Depths of field are exquisite 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.550
 OK 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.610
 We can not complain for the price that 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.610
 has so we take it apart 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.380
 and well you can check the 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.840
 qualities is not bad 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.540
 and is that the qualities is something that 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.550
 he was very surprised to have the years 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.290
 that has these kinds of goals in addition 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.960
 that are quite durable are 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.520
 pretty well built as you see no 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.710
 we can get the dust from behind 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.450
 is totally closed is to say that the 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.450
 mobile part is internal 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.500
 and ahead because it is not easy for 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.530
 we get between the dust since it always goes to 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.860
 be a sheltered so well in 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.390
 dust issues is fine and 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.090
 well also for the price that 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.190
 has is more than good so nothing 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.530
 I hope you liked it and that you 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.530
 you were going to my channel a greeting
