00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.990
 balanced but before getting 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.630
 effective recommendations need to perform

 on what level you choose will be 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.590
 depend on the amount of availability of heroes 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.750

 at master level may be recommended 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.889
 hero of any complexity 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.680
 rollin selection is the most crucial moment 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.780
 depends on the correct roles 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.200
 efficiency of your team on the corpse 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.180
 kerry 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.969
 roles can be divided into roles and 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:46.989
 position of the role of what role the character 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:49.790
 Karim takes Cathedral ganker pusher 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.280
 initiator and positions 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.049
 where it will be located at the beginning of the game 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.069
 jungler solo hard solomid solo easy 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.939
 clip and 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.829
 or triple hard more with horns can 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:07.540
 read click on the question 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.540
 appropriate help point 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.130
 first we need to decide what 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.440
 we will choose the same tactics in this manual 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.970
 I suggest using classic 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.940
 option 3 pool or 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.870
 for this, the first cell will define the role 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.980
 and a support position TRIP easy what 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.620
 not bad then a grater take shadow demon 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.510
 in the second cell choose solomid because 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.880
 as you know without the right hero on 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.080
 mid chance of losing significantly 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.570
 increase take rubick th as we 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.640
 we use the trip line tactic we need 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.630
 a hero who alone stand against 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.810
 three enemies 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.670
 put the position solo hard 3 seagull and 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.240
 trent protector would be a great option 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.940
 fourth cell 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.770
 take an additional support which 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.920
 will help kerry prisoner 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.060
 For this cell, we specify the position of the third 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:08.750
 kizi and the role of support take taydhuntera 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.510
 and in the last cell we take the hero 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.980
 who will bring us victory for this 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:20.000
 we indicate the role of kerry and the position of the stands easy 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.590
 leg would be a great option about 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.470
 so we can pick up 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.190
 optimal bundles for any game on 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.410
 today everything 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.540
 I wish you easy victories and fighting 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.360

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.110

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.740
 experimental 3 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.740
 Here are the gods
