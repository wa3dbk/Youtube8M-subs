00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
so I guess we'll go up and then down and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.900 
so I guess we'll go up and then down and
then<00:01:59.850> maybe<00:02:00.060> that'll<00:02:00.330> go<00:02:00.540> back<00:02:01.190> not<00:02:02.190> sure<00:02:02.460> or

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
then maybe that'll go back not sure or

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.670 
then maybe that'll go back not sure or
we<00:02:02.940> can<00:02:03.150> just<00:02:03.330> hang<00:02:03.660> a<00:02:03.780> u-turn<00:02:04.080> somewhere<00:02:04.530> on
