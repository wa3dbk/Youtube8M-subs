00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
this week well there's some really

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.390 
this week well there's some really
interesting<00:00:24.330> cards<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.289> surfaced<00:00:25.769> several

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
interesting cards that surfaced several

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.160 
interesting cards that surfaced several
years<00:00:26.609> back<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.269> think<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.990> would

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
years back and I think that you would

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.099 
years back and I think that you would
really<00:00:28.380> like<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.800> see<00:00:28.830> something<00:00:29.250> like<00:00:29.400> this

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
really like to see something like this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.810 
really like to see something like this
now<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.980> only<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.640> have

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
now this is the only one that I have

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.549 
now this is the only one that I have
because<00:00:33.059> these<00:00:33.329> really<00:00:33.719> are<00:00:33.750> hard<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.320> come<00:00:34.500> by

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
because these really are hard to come by

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.069 
because these really are hard to come by
but<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> disruptive<00:00:36.329> student<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
but this is a disruptive student and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.690 
but this is a disruptive student and
it's<00:00:37.260> from<00:00:37.500> ursa<00:00:37.770> saga<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.540> I<00:00:39.540> think<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.230> is

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
it's from ursa saga and I think this is

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.030 
it's from ursa saga and I think this is
Chinese<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.329> I'm<00:00:42.600> not<00:00:42.629> entirely<00:00:43.320> sure<00:00:43.559> but

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
Chinese but I'm not entirely sure but

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.250 
Chinese but I'm not entirely sure but
the<00:00:44.460> neat<00:00:44.670> thing<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.600> card<00:00:45.989> has

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the neat thing is that this card has

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.830 
the neat thing is that this card has
three<00:00:46.980> little<00:00:47.250> circles<00:00:48.239> down<00:00:48.420> there<00:00:48.690> at<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
three little circles down there at the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.709 
three little circles down there at the
bottom<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.719> scratch-off

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
bottom and they are of the scratch-off

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.830 
bottom and they are of the scratch-off
material<00:00:52.440> variety<00:00:53.180> this<00:00:54.180> looks<00:00:54.539> something

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
material variety this looks something

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.080 
material variety this looks something
like<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.500> lottery<00:00:55.829> ticket<00:00:56.219> more<00:00:56.640> than<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.910> does

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
like a lottery ticket more than it does

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.990 
like a lottery ticket more than it does
look<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.539> magic<00:00:57.989> card<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.730> each<00:00:59.969> one

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
look like a magic card and so each one

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360 
look like a magic card and so each one
of<00:01:00.270> these<00:01:00.449> has<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:01.050> little<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.980> stuff

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
of these has that little little stuff

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.090 
of these has that little little stuff
that's<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.899> card<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> mean<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> really

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that's on the card so I mean you really

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.030 
that's on the card so I mean you really
can<00:01:05.460> feel<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.290> very<00:01:07.380> similar

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
can feel it but it is it's very similar

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.649 
can feel it but it is it's very similar
to<00:01:08.189> what<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.610> would<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.939> know<00:01:09.060> bust<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.630> your

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to what you would you know bust out your

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.950 
to what you would you know bust out your
quarter<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.350> scratch<00:01:10.650> off<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> lottery<00:01:11.340> ticket

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
quarter and scratch off a lottery ticket

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.490 
quarter and scratch off a lottery ticket

like<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.900> now<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.140> searching<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
like this and now in searching the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 
like this and now in searching the
information<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.610> was<00:01:29.640> unable<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.750> find

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
information I was unable to really find

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
information I was unable to really find
a<00:01:31.350> whole<00:01:31.680> lot<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> information<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.270> of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
a whole lot of information but one of

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.630 
a whole lot of information but one of
the<00:01:33.479> things<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.900> really<00:01:34.229> kind<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.280> sort<00:01:35.520> of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the things that really kind of sort of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.520 
the things that really kind of sort of
make<00:01:35.790> sense<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.270> connoisseur<00:01:36.840> doesn't<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
make sense the connoisseur doesn't is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830 
make sense the connoisseur doesn't is
there<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> game<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.000> was<00:01:39.119> called<00:01:39.360> battle

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
there is a game and it was called battle

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.170 
there is a game and it was called battle
cards<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.470> apparently<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.220> only<00:01:41.490> lasted<00:01:42.000> for

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
cards and apparently it only lasted for

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.899 
cards and apparently it only lasted for
a<00:01:42.240> little<00:01:42.390> while<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.590> card<00:01:44.399> game<00:01:44.610> had

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
a little while but this card game had

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.780 
a little while but this card game had
that<00:01:45.119> exact<00:01:45.600> same<00:01:45.899> concept<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.799> which<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.640> mean

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
that exact same concept in which I mean

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.190 
that exact same concept in which I mean
the<00:01:47.970> cards<00:01:48.270> were<00:01:48.390> different<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the cards were different and all that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
the cards were different and all that
but<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.560> was<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> point<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.399> which<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.909> were

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
but there was a point in which you were

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.819 
but there was a point in which you were
supposed<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> scratch<00:01:51.840> off<00:01:52.049> certain<00:01:52.439> parts<00:01:52.740> of

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
supposed to scratch off certain parts of

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.880 
supposed to scratch off certain parts of
these<00:01:53.009> cars<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.079> you<00:01:55.079> know<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> really<00:01:55.619> cool

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
these cars so you know a really cool

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.100 
these cars so you know a really cool
concept<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> thing<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.030> given<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
concept but the thing is given the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.959 
concept but the thing is given the
limited<00:01:58.500> information<00:01:58.860> i<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.369> able<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.670> find

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
limited information i was able to find

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.969 
limited information i was able to find
out<00:02:00.149> about<00:02:00.270> those<00:02:00.509> cards<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.320> doesn't<00:02:01.770> seem

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
out about those cards it doesn't seem

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.830 
out about those cards it doesn't seem
like<00:02:02.009> they<00:02:02.399> would<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.790> been<00:02:02.909> printed<00:02:03.420> at<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
like they would have been printed at the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.950 
like they would have been printed at the
same<00:02:04.110> time<00:02:04.469> that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
same time that

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.180 
same time that
saga<00:02:05.409> was<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:06.900> you<00:02:07.900> know<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.319> again<00:02:08.619> there<00:02:09.069> was

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
saga was so you know and again there was

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.919 
saga was so you know and again there was
very<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.729> mean<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:10.000> really<00:02:10.330> hard<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.750> find

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
very I mean it's really hard to find

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.380 
very I mean it's really hard to find
good<00:02:11.260> information<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:12.100> all<00:02:12.400> these<00:02:12.610> old<00:02:12.850> defunk

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
good information on all these old defunk

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.780 
good information on all these old defunk
card<00:02:13.720> games<00:02:13.959> that<00:02:14.260> barely<00:02:14.500> lasted<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.340> 90s

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
card games that barely lasted in the 90s

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.440 
card games that barely lasted in the 90s
but<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.959> could<00:02:17.260> be<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.819> that<00:02:19.209> would<00:02:19.420> be

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
but that could be it so that would be

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.990 
but that could be it so that would be
the<00:02:19.569> most<00:02:19.990> likely<00:02:20.140> suspect<00:02:20.830> but<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.550> mean<00:02:21.850> who

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
the most likely suspect but I mean who

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.640 
the most likely suspect but I mean who
knows<00:02:22.209> maybe<00:02:22.720> there<00:02:22.989> were<00:02:23.080> some<00:02:23.110> lottery

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
knows maybe there were some lottery

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.050 
knows maybe there were some lottery
tickets<00:02:23.830> or<00:02:24.340> something<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.880> they<00:02:25.000> were

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
tickets or something that they were

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.890 
tickets or something that they were
printing<00:02:25.450> off<00:02:25.890> really<00:02:26.890> hard<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.190> say<00:02:27.400> but<00:02:28.150> i<00:02:28.480> do

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
printing off really hard to say but i do

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.960 
printing off really hard to say but i do
think<00:02:29.020> they're<00:02:29.410> cool<00:02:29.620> i<00:02:29.860> haven't<00:02:30.730> seen<00:02:30.910> any

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
think they're cool i haven't seen any

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.830 
think they're cool i haven't seen any
duplicates<00:02:31.840> but<00:02:32.800> again<00:02:33.640> this<00:02:34.209> is<00:02:34.540> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
duplicates but again this is a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.690 
duplicates but again this is a
disruptive<00:02:35.410> student<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.010> i<00:02:36.130> think<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.489> looks

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
disruptive student and i think it looks

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.990 
disruptive student and i think it looks
really<00:02:36.819> neat<00:02:37.620> price-wise<00:02:38.620> I've<00:02:39.070> not<00:02:39.370> seen<00:02:39.730> any

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
really neat price-wise I've not seen any

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.570 
really neat price-wise I've not seen any
cell<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.019> recent<00:02:41.560> past<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.160> it's<00:02:42.310> really

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
cell in the recent past so it's really

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.430 
cell in the recent past so it's really
hard<00:02:42.910> for<00:02:42.970> me<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.239> say<00:02:43.510> but<00:02:44.019> these<00:02:44.230> aren't

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
hard for me to say but these aren't

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.050 
hard for me to say but these aren't
exactly<00:02:44.860> going<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.160> be<00:02:45.220> cheap<00:02:45.519> or<00:02:45.700> anything

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
exactly going to be cheap or anything

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.870 
exactly going to be cheap or anything
and<00:02:46.269> of<00:02:47.110> course<00:02:47.170> address<00:02:48.010> is<00:02:48.250> going<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.459> go<00:02:48.670> for

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
and of course address is going to go for

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.550 
and of course address is going to go for
more<00:02:49.060> than<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.600> know<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.930> overwhelming

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
more than you know the overwhelming

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.759 
more than you know the overwhelming
majority<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.220> cards<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.989> again<00:02:52.989> only<00:02:53.470> the

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
majority of the cards and again only the

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.270 
majority of the cards and again only the
commons<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.459> have<00:02:54.790> seen<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.620> just

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
commons that I have seen so I just

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.440 
commons that I have seen so I just
thought<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.640> would<00:02:57.850> share<00:02:58.090> those<00:02:58.420> with

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
thought that I would share those with

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.080 
thought that I would share those with
you<00:02:58.720> because<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.650> mean<00:02:59.830> you<00:03:00.310> know<00:03:00.459> it's<00:03:00.850> not
