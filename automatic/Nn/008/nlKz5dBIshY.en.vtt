00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.040
 Let's talk a little more about scripts. 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.310
 of comics and heard of 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.500
 today will define two terms used to 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.840
 people who work the next story 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.760
 comic and differential because a lot 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.130
 People think the same thing. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.949
 What is the difference between the script 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.960
 argument in history things also 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.770
 revealed but they are different 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.409
 the plot is the plot are the ideas is the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.059
 and who has the ideas of the 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:45.180
 characters what the story is about 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.360
 all the basic plot of the universe is 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.909
 constructing the dramatic premise 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.540
 personality of the characters and everything 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.210
 more 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.030
 this very conceptual part of creation 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.489
 even this is work that does 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.040
 The argument is clear that it involves a lot of 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.949
 research knowledge on the subject and 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.960
 above all a lot of creativity 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.760
 so who wants to work with arguments 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.280
 with a story needs to be a person 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.330
 very clear about certain 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.280
 very creative subjects the screenwriter is the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.420
 person who will work with these 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.600
 arguments and structure them and how it 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.790
 will be in touch and get involved is the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.170
 knowledge of how to work with the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.360
 chosen language 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.580
 We are in comic form so the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.500
 good mood comic magazine needs 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.220
 know very well this in the active 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 about recording the frames over time 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.650
 of history it is necessary to have good 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.470
 writing techniques with writing skills 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.240
 create good dialogues know-how hooks 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.610
 in certain events so that they have 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.100
 consistency know how to organize all 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.010
 structured ideas in the argument for 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.950
 that all this be coherent rabbit and 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.450
 concise the three magic words that 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.790
 we already talked 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.040
 so a driver need a lot already 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.290
 on the language that this work is 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.300
 very creative too 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.610
 in many cases the person doing the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.060
 document writes the script is the same 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.800
 but in some cases this is not worth alone 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.260
 for more proactive comics too 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.090
 there are authors who have a test that is 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.730
 pass but has difficulty 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.070
 write delete I have like 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.650
 to organize these ideas, my name is 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.110
 Someone to write to him 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.900
 organized in such a way that person 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.150
 would be the screenwriter of his book and a 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.200
 face that has the arguments that go from 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.750
 Chamorro tennis player ends up being the owner of the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.450
 arguments the work then the script is 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.280
 also a very technical thing because 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.980
 involves knowledge about the narrative 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.320
 about java language working on 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.570
 story time much experience in 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.100
 do this and the work of those who do the 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.680
 arguments and there was a lot of research 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.180
 knowledge and creativity 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.350
 anyone can be a good 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.300
 screenwriter 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.870
 If you stop to think it involves 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.000
 a lot of technique and if yes, give it all 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.489
 world become a good tennis that as 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.780
 nation use gomes gives everyone to do 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.269
 with the documents 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.250
 there you get a fairly subjective base 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.280
 and I have my reservations with 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.799
 relation to this always active know how to have 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.010
 good arguments 12 aspirations 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.200
 is such an unpredictable and subjective thing 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.739
 that it is difficult for you to measure if someone 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.170
 Can you be good or do we believe that? 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.400
 some people have more facilities 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.780
 and objective 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.120
 I will not say it's impossible to 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.130
 some people make good arguments 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.280
 but I can see some trends in 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.690
 people who have a good facility 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.600
 arguments in history 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.330
 some of them are the person is allowed 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.660
 make a person read a lot 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.150
 the person likes the knowledge she likes 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.400
 what is smart she likes 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.000
 activities that stimulate thinking 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.570
 her then solve puzzles 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.820
 philosophy questions that 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.060
 like to know the origin of things 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.569
 Who really likes history, is not it? 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.790
 that something came from the point to the point z and 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.680
 likes to know what it's all about 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.239
 this is a natural tendency of some 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.100
 people like this 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.590
 today they do not call a delay because they are 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.360
 ready, this is my final point 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.960
 I found a lot to do with the profile of 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.630
 person then some really have more 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.460
 ability to be creative and to 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.100
 to create good arguments in history 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.410
 and what is more important I can not 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.110
 see a more or less important 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.600
 I think it makes a good story. 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.120
 good arguments good scripts walk 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.610
 together I've seen stories of ideas 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.570
 were good but the way it was 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.100
 told she was confused without a headache 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.919
 the things that showed a way 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.840
 stranger end up being successful whose 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.500
 story that the script is well rounded 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:08.360
 well closed clear coherent concise 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.979
 but ideas do not have great news there 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.190
 it's nothing abusive beginner 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:15.440
 Things have to walk together. 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.229
 that is why the person often does the 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.850
 argument and script is the same in 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.280
 comics of the great north industry 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.320
 American are never the same 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.590
 generally different people have 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.840
 rule will be better or worse not everything 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.360
 dependent on your relationship from your 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.910
 profile that you focus on than your 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.150
 The goal is to do a great job to 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.340
 This works for you sometimes. 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.430
 solitary in some parts when 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.770
 this is going to be a better future solution 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.039
 so I hope I have clarified this 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.960
 topic and we'll talk more about 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.419
 scripts in comics 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.220
 Very well, that's it then. 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.220
 we are talking 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.360
 was
