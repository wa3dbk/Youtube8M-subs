manipulate Herk from one end of the tank
to<00:01:46.300> maybe<00:01:46.540> behind<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.200> scenes<00:01:47.440> why<00:01:47.680> what's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
to maybe behind the scenes why what's

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.560 
to maybe behind the scenes why what's
the<00:01:48.130> advance<00:01:48.460> there's<00:01:48.730> a<00:01:48.820> couple<00:01:49.000> reasons<00:01:49.210> why

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
the advance there's a couple reasons why

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.570 
the advance there's a couple reasons why
we'd<00:01:49.810> want<00:01:49.870> to<00:01:50.110> move<00:01:50.230> a<00:01:50.260> shark<00:01:50.530> around<00:01:50.770> first

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
we'd want to move a shark around first

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.040 
we'd want to move a shark around first
of<00:01:51.700> all<00:01:51.760> so<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.210> other<00:01:52.450> animals<00:01:52.810> can<00:01:52.930> get<00:01:53.020> a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
of all so the other animals can get a

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.980 
of all so the other animals can get a
chance<00:01:53.230> to<00:01:53.410> eat<00:01:53.560> she<00:01:54.070> has<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.220> large<00:01:54.490> shark<00:01:55.060> when

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
chance to eat she has a large shark when

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.740 
chance to eat she has a large shark when
we<00:01:56.050> put<00:01:56.230> a<00:01:56.260> diver<00:01:56.470> in<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:56.680> water<00:01:56.770> she<00:01:57.310> will

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
we put a diver in the water she will

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.940 
we put a diver in the water she will
she's<00:01:58.750> like<00:01:58.870> a<00:01:58.900> puppy<00:01:59.110> she'll<00:01:59.440> beg<00:01:59.620> for<00:01:59.830> food

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
she's like a puppy she'll beg for food

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.100 
she's like a puppy she'll beg for food
from<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.220> diver<00:02:00.430> its<00:02:01.360> owner<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.840> give<00:02:02.020> the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
from the diver its owner to give the

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.080 
from the diver its owner to give the
other<00:02:02.230> fish<00:02:02.410> a<00:02:02.440> chance<00:02:02.800> especially<00:02:03.550> sharks

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
other fish a chance especially sharks

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.760 
other fish a chance especially sharks
like<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.330> may<00:02:04.870> be<00:02:04.930> more<00:02:05.170> timid<00:02:05.380> bonnethead

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
like the may be more timid bonnethead

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.530 
like the may be more timid bonnethead
sharks<00:02:06.220> that<00:02:06.460> we<00:02:06.580> feed<00:02:06.760> from<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.940> surface<00:02:07.330> if

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
sharks that we feed from the surface if

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.880 
sharks that we feed from the surface if
the<00:02:07.630> zebra<00:02:07.870> shark<00:02:08.110> were<00:02:08.230> in<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.440> way<00:02:08.560> they

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
the zebra shark were in the way they

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.170 
the zebra shark were in the way they
wouldn't<00:02:09.100> come<00:02:09.250> over<00:02:09.430> to<00:02:09.490> eat<00:02:09.640> okay

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
wouldn't come over to eat okay

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.240 
wouldn't come over to eat okay
so<00:02:10.540> we<00:02:10.630> pull<00:02:10.810> her<00:02:10.869> off<00:02:11.020> exhibit<00:02:11.500> when<00:02:11.980> we<00:02:12.040> feed

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
so we pull her off exhibit when we feed

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.290 
so we pull her off exhibit when we feed
certain<00:02:12.490> animals<00:02:12.790> just<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.060> make<00:02:13.180> sure

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
certain animals just to make sure

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.910 
certain animals just to make sure
everybody<00:02:13.630> gets<00:02:13.750> enough<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.050> eat

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
everybody gets enough to eat

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.080 
everybody gets enough to eat
the<00:02:15.220> second<00:02:15.520> reason<00:02:15.610> would<00:02:15.820> be<00:02:15.940> from

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
the second reason would be from

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.930 
the second reason would be from
physicals<00:02:16.620> she<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.980> trained<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.520> swim<00:02:18.760> into

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
physicals she is trained to swim into

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.580 
physicals she is trained to swim into
this<00:02:19.060> back<00:02:19.240> holding<00:02:19.600> pool<00:02:19.750> behind<00:02:20.110> us<00:02:20.260> which

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
this back holding pool behind us which

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.130 
this back holding pool behind us which
is<00:02:20.710> where<00:02:20.860> we<00:02:20.980> give<00:02:21.100> her<00:02:21.280> her<00:02:21.430> annual<00:02:21.700> physical

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
is where we give her her annual physical

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.840 
is where we give her her annual physical
it's<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.260> lot<00:02:23.380> less<00:02:23.590> stressful<00:02:23.980> on<00:02:24.220> her<00:02:24.460> we

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
it's a lot less stressful on her we

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.340 
it's a lot less stressful on her we
don't<00:02:24.970> have<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.150> get<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.420> water<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.900> make

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
don't have to get in the water and make

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.810 
don't have to get in the water and make
her<00:02:26.620> go<00:02:26.830> somewhere<00:02:27.220> she<00:02:27.250> goes<00:02:27.640> there

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
her go somewhere she goes there

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.800 
her go somewhere she goes there
voluntarily<00:02:28.530> once<00:02:29.530> she's<00:02:29.740> back<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.250> pool

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
voluntarily once she's back in that pool

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.700 
voluntarily once she's back in that pool
she's<00:02:31.810> also<00:02:31.990> trained<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.320> swim<00:02:32.500> into<00:02:32.620> a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
she's also trained to swim into a

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.080 
she's also trained to swim into a
stretcher<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:33.400> we<00:02:33.490> can<00:02:33.610> pull<00:02:33.730> her<00:02:33.790> out<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
stretcher so we can pull her out of the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.730 
stretcher so we can pull her out of the
water<00:02:34.270> get<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.750> weight<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.050> her<00:02:35.230> put<00:02:35.530> her<00:02:35.560> back

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
water get a weight on her put her back

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.010 
water get a weight on her put her back
down<00:02:36.120> then<00:02:37.120> we<00:02:37.210> can<00:02:37.330> flip<00:02:37.480> her<00:02:37.630> upside<00:02:37.660> down

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
down then we can flip her upside down

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.920 
down then we can flip her upside down
actually<00:02:38.460> when<00:02:39.460> sharks<00:02:40.330> are<00:02:40.450> flipped<00:02:40.630> upside

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
actually when sharks are flipped upside

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.380 
actually when sharks are flipped upside
down<00:02:41.080> they<00:02:41.230> kind<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.470> go<00:02:41.590> catatonic<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.520> kind

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
down they kind of go catatonic and kind

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.450 
down they kind of go catatonic and kind
of<00:02:43.450> go<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.570> sleep<00:02:43.870> at<00:02:44.710> that<00:02:44.800> point<00:02:45.130> we<00:02:45.220> can<00:02:45.310> give

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
of go to sleep at that point we can give

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.550 
of go to sleep at that point we can give
her<00:02:45.550> an<00:02:45.670> ultrasound<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.540> do<00:02:46.660> blood<00:02:46.870> draws<00:02:46.900> and

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
her an ultrasound and do blood draws and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.229 
her an ultrasound and do blood draws and
when<00:02:47.650> she<00:02:47.830> wakes<00:02:47.980> up<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.459> flips<00:02:48.730> back<00:02:48.910> over

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
when she wakes up and flips back over

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.170 
when she wakes up and flips back over
she<00:02:49.720> gets<00:02:49.870> her<00:02:49.959> treat<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.260> know<00:02:51.250> she's<00:02:52.000> good

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
she gets her treat you know she's good

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.530 
she gets her treat you know she's good
to<00:02:52.239> go

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
to go

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.800 
to go
so<00:02:52.690> you<00:02:53.050> do<00:02:53.260> an<00:02:53.380> annual<00:02:53.680> exam<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.270> training

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
so you do an annual exam so is training

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.830 
so you do an annual exam so is training
every<00:02:56.260> day<00:02:56.290> or<00:02:56.860> is<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.160> only<00:02:57.340> every<00:02:58.120> month<00:02:58.330> we

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
every day or is that only every month we

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.600 
every day or is that only every month we
keep<00:02:59.050> up<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.290> training<00:02:59.590> every<00:02:59.770> day<00:02:59.920> just

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
keep up the training every day just

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.300 
keep up the training every day just
because<00:03:01.230> that's<00:03:02.230> her<00:03:02.500> routine<00:03:02.860> she<00:03:02.890> knows

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
because that's her routine she knows

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.620 
because that's her routine she knows
that<00:03:03.550> when<00:03:03.700> she<00:03:03.820> swims<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.300> back<00:03:04.420> she's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
that when she swims to the back she's

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.320 
that when she swims to the back she's
gonna<00:03:04.750> get<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.989> treat<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:06.340> when<00:03:06.880> she<00:03:07.060> does<00:03:07.209> it

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
gonna get a treat it's when she does it

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.940 
gonna get a treat it's when she does it
on<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.450> physical<00:03:07.780> day<00:03:08.170> it's<00:03:08.380> nothing<00:03:08.709> new<00:03:08.830> to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
on a physical day it's nothing new to

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.740 
on a physical day it's nothing new to
her<00:03:09.100> it's<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:09.880> what<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.060> do<00:03:10.150> every<00:03:10.239> day<00:03:10.540> I'm

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
her it's this is what I do every day I'm
