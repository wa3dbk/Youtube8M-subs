stabilization<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:37.670> think<00:01:38.210> that's<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.480> great

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
stabilization I think that's a great

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.170 
stabilization I think that's a great
feature<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.230> in<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.830> cinema<00:01:40.250> world<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.120> the

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
feature and in the cinema world and the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.210 
feature and in the cinema world and the
videographer<00:01:41.810> space<00:01:42.530> I<00:01:42.740> think<00:01:42.800> they're<00:01:43.070> going

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
videographer space I think they're going

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.980 
videographer space I think they're going
to<00:01:43.280> really<00:01:43.520> appreciate<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.090> because<00:01:44.240> it'll

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
to really appreciate it because it'll

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.020 
to really appreciate it because it'll
allow<00:01:45.170> them<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.710> perhaps<00:01:45.920> do<00:01:46.250> some<00:01:46.460> work<00:01:46.850> with

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
allow them to perhaps do some work with

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.640 
allow them to perhaps do some work with
less<00:01:47.270> rigging<00:01:47.720> or<00:01:47.900> if<00:01:48.110> they're<00:01:48.260> doing

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
less rigging or if they're doing

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.270 
less rigging or if they're doing
run-and-gun

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
run-and-gun

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.680 
run-and-gun
or<00:01:49.550> if<00:01:49.700> they<00:01:49.820> want<00:01:49.970> it<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.120> be<00:01:50.240> very<00:01:50.390> discreet

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
or if they want it to be very discreet

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.780 
or if they want it to be very discreet
low<00:01:50.990> profile<00:01:51.590> they'll<00:01:52.130> still<00:01:52.370> be<00:01:52.400> able<00:01:52.700> to

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
low profile they'll still be able to

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.750 
low profile they'll still be able to
shoot<00:01:52.940> stabilized<00:01:53.600> video<00:01:53.840> with<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.560> camera

the<00:01:55.760> second<00:01:56.150> thing<00:01:56.270> that<00:01:56.299> Sony's<00:01:56.750> done<00:01:56.960> is

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
the second thing that Sony's done is

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.170 
the second thing that Sony's done is
improve<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.680> autofocus<00:01:58.070> system<00:01:58.430> they've

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
improve the autofocus system they've

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.080 
improve the autofocus system they've
taken<00:01:59.420> things<00:01:59.750> from<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.080> a6000<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.130> a77<00:02:01.760> mark

taken things from the a6000 the a77 mark
ii<00:02:02.299> that<00:02:02.540> are<00:02:02.659> part<00:02:02.870> of<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.020> 4d<00:02:03.440> focus<00:02:03.920> system

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.550 
ii that are part of the 4d focus system
and<00:02:04.430> brought<00:02:04.970> them<00:02:05.180> into<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:05.570> camera<00:02:05.930> while

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
and brought them into this camera while

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.040 
and brought them into this camera while
it's<00:02:06.740> not<00:02:06.950> as<00:02:07.220> fast<00:02:07.520> as<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.850> a6000<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:09.020> a

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
it's not as fast as the a6000 it is a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.160 
it's not as fast as the a6000 it is a
definite<00:02:09.770> improvement<00:02:10.150> from<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.330> a7<00:02:11.959> it's

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
definite improvement from the a7 it's

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.640 
definite improvement from the a7 it's
sure<00:02:12.709> it's<00:02:12.950> faster

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
sure it's faster

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.460 
sure it's faster
focus<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.370> lock<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.209> acquire<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.200> stay

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
focus to lock and acquire and to stay

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.960 
focus to lock and acquire and to stay
with<00:02:16.650> your<00:02:16.799> subject<00:02:17.220> they<00:02:17.310> say<00:02:17.489> it's<00:02:17.640> 30%

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
with your subject they say it's 30%

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.089 
with your subject they say it's 30%
faster<00:02:18.569> in<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.989> autofocus<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.739> believe

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
faster in the autofocus and I believe

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.220 
faster in the autofocus and I believe
that<00:02:20.129> it's<00:02:20.879> definitely<00:02:21.510> definitely<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
that it's definitely definitely a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.720 
that it's definitely definitely a
noticeable<00:02:22.920> upgrade<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.489> think

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
noticeable upgrade and I think

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.280 
noticeable upgrade and I think
photographers<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.659> me<00:02:24.870> who<00:02:25.049> shoot<00:02:25.260> people

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
photographers like me who shoot people

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.429 
photographers like me who shoot people
in<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:26.069> motion<00:02:26.640> moving<00:02:26.879> at<00:02:27.420> weddings<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.019> with

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
in in motion moving at weddings and with

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.319 
in in motion moving at weddings and with
portraits<00:02:28.799> we<00:02:29.010> are<00:02:29.189> gonna<00:02:29.280> find<00:02:29.549> that<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.790> very

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
portraits we are gonna find that a very

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.039 
portraits we are gonna find that a very
very<00:02:30.890> nice<00:02:31.890> upgrade<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.609> finally<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.840> third

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
very nice upgrade and finally the third

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.660 
very nice upgrade and finally the third
thing<00:02:34.079> that<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.470> want<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.739> talk<00:02:34.980> about<00:02:35.129> was<00:02:35.459> in

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
thing that I want to talk about was in

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.339 
thing that I want to talk about was in
the<00:02:35.819> video<00:02:36.060> space<00:02:36.329> they've<00:02:36.629> upgraded<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.319> a

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
the video space they've upgraded to a

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.380 
the video space they've upgraded to a
professional<00:02:37.950> video<00:02:38.220> codec<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:39.180> they're

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
professional video codec now they're

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.319 
professional video codec now they're
using<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.780> X<00:02:40.019> ABC<00:02:40.709> X<00:02:41.519> AVC<00:02:42.239> X<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.470> VCS<00:02:44.150> codec<00:02:45.150> and

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
using the X ABC X AVC X a VCS codec and

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.470 
using the X ABC X AVC X a VCS codec and
then<00:02:45.870> also<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.319> S<00:02:46.470> log<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.980> profile<00:02:47.549> starting

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
then also the S log to profile starting

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.080 
then also the S log to profile starting
at<00:02:48.599> 1600<00:02:49.290> ISO<00:02:49.379> so<00:02:49.739> that's<00:02:49.920> much<00:02:50.129> like<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.400> a7<00:02:50.940> s

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
at 1600 ISO so that's much like the a7 s

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.009 
at 1600 ISO so that's much like the a7 s
which<00:02:51.269> appeals<00:02:51.599> to<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.810> lot<00:02:51.989> of

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
which appeals to a lot of

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.170 
which appeals to a lot of
cinematographers<00:02:52.889> as<00:02:53.040> well<00:02:53.280> because<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
cinematographers as well because of the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.110 
cinematographers as well because of the
pro<00:02:54.420> codec<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.230> s<00:02:55.349> log<00:02:55.680> profile<00:02:56.549> now

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
pro codec and the s log profile now

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.330 
pro codec and the s log profile now
they've<00:02:57.359> got<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.690> at<00:02:57.810> 1600<00:02:58.500> in<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.769> camera<00:02:59.189> as

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
they've got it at 1600 in this camera as

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.440 
they've got it at 1600 in this camera as
opposed<00:02:59.879> to<00:02:59.970> 3200<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.989> a7<00:03:01.439> s<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:03.090> those<00:03:03.299> are

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
opposed to 3200 in the a7 s so those are

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.420 
opposed to 3200 in the a7 s so those are
the<00:03:03.569> three<00:03:03.840> key<00:03:04.290> features<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:04.889> I<00:03:04.950> see<00:03:05.220> for

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
the three key features that I see for

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.800 
the three key features that I see for
this<00:03:05.519> camera<00:03:05.819> there's<00:03:06.120> several<00:03:06.420> more<00:03:06.689> that

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
this camera there's several more that

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.929 
this camera there's several more that
I've<00:03:06.959> talked<00:03:07.200> about<00:03:07.319> below<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.040> expanded<00:03:08.819> on

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
I've talked about below and expanded on

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.030 
I've talked about below and expanded on
those<00:03:09.090> three<00:03:09.359> features<00:03:09.569> too<00:03:10.019> but<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.980> think

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
those three features too but I think

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.220 
those three features too but I think
what<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:11.609> camera<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> really<00:03:12.689> important

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
what this camera is a really important

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.289 
what this camera is a really important
camera<00:03:13.409> in<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.739> photo<00:03:13.920> space<00:03:14.280> photo<00:03:14.730> industry

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
camera in the photo space photo industry

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.869 
camera in the photo space photo industry
because<00:03:15.599> I<00:03:15.629> think<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:16.019> really<00:03:16.139> has<00:03:16.409> appeal

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
because I think it really has appeal

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.339 
because I think it really has appeal
particularly<00:03:17.879> to<00:03:18.120> my<00:03:18.299> realm<00:03:18.810> which<00:03:19.049> is<00:03:19.079> the

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
particularly to my realm which is the

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.530 
particularly to my realm which is the
portrait<00:03:19.889> world<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.400> wedding<00:03:20.760> world<00:03:20.970> but<00:03:21.510> I

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
portrait world the wedding world but I

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.750 
portrait world the wedding world but I
also<00:03:21.720> think<00:03:22.019> it<00:03:22.139> could<00:03:22.290> be<00:03:22.410> really<00:03:22.760> especially

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
also think it could be really especially

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.099 
also think it could be really especially
advantageous<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.599> advertising

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
advantageous for the advertising

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.470 
advantageous for the advertising

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
commercial and editorial photographers

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.180

this<00:03:28.109> is<00:03:28.319> a<00:03:28.349> camera<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:28.769> gives<00:03:29.069> you<00:03:29.159> a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
this is a camera that gives you a

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.920 
this is a camera that gives you a
full-frame<00:03:29.669> sensor<00:03:30.150> with<00:03:30.599> image

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
full-frame sensor with image

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.170 
full-frame sensor with image
stabilization<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.799> much<00:03:32.370> more<00:03:32.579> responsive

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180

stabilization and much more responsive
autofocus<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.930> think<00:03:34.169> that's<00:03:34.319> gonna<00:03:34.500> make<00:03:34.799> a

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
autofocus I think that's gonna make a

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.330 
autofocus I think that's gonna make a
lot<00:03:35.639> of<00:03:35.669> people<00:03:35.879> who<00:03:36.120> have<00:03:36.209> been<00:03:36.329> on<00:03:36.419> the<00:03:36.569> fence

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
lot of people who have been on the fence

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.949 
lot of people who have been on the fence
say<00:03:38.340> I'm<00:03:38.579> gonna<00:03:38.849> get<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.209> mirrorless<00:03:39.599> camera

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
say I'm gonna get this mirrorless camera

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.059 
say I'm gonna get this mirrorless camera
and<00:03:40.169> this<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.409> going<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.829> one<00:03:40.949> I'm

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
and this is going to be the one I'm

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.939 
and this is going to be the one I'm
going<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.280> try<00:03:42.030> first<00:03:42.449> or<00:03:42.810> if<00:03:43.530> they've<00:03:43.769> tried

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
going to try first or if they've tried

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.619 
going to try first or if they've tried
them<00:03:44.159> in<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.340> past<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.819> they<00:03:44.879> disappointed<00:03:45.510> I

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
them in the past and they disappointed I

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:46.640 
them in the past and they disappointed I
think<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:45.930> is<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.169> one<00:03:46.260> that's<00:03:46.409> going<00:03:46.590> to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
think this is the one that's going to

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.349 
think this is the one that's going to
restore<00:03:47.430> their<00:03:47.609> confidence<00:03:47.639> in<00:03:48.269> the

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
restore their confidence in the

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.300 
restore their confidence in the
mirrorless<00:03:48.690> systems<00:03:49.079> because<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:50.099> is<00:03:50.280> a

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
mirrorless systems because this is a

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.580 
mirrorless systems because this is a
really<00:03:50.639> pro<00:03:51.000> grade<00:03:51.209> build<00:03:51.540> quality<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.560> has

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
really pro grade build quality it has

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.619 
really pro grade build quality it has
improved<00:03:53.069> autofocus<00:03:53.849> and<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.150> think<00:03:54.419> it's<00:03:54.540> the

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
improved autofocus and I think it's the

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:55.849 
improved autofocus and I think it's the
kind<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.840> camera<00:03:55.139> that<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.319> lot<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.620> people<00:03:55.799> are

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
kind of camera that a lot of people are

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.559 
kind of camera that a lot of people are
gonna<00:03:55.949> say<00:03:56.129> yes<00:03:56.459> that's<00:03:57.030> going<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.359> be<00:03:57.419> my
