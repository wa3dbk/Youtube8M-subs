how does how do you have fellow
physicians<00:00:03.460> surgeons<00:00:03.960> feel<00:00:04.960> about<00:00:05.200> what

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:05.440 
physicians surgeons feel about what

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.009 
physicians surgeons feel about what
you're<00:00:05.590> saying

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:07.019 
you're saying

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.990 
you're saying
well<00:00:08.019> my<00:00:08.290> own<00:00:08.440> group<00:00:08.860> right<00:00:09.460> now<00:00:09.490> none<00:00:09.849> of<00:00:09.940> us

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
well my own group right now none of us

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.290 
well my own group right now none of us
do<00:00:10.150> fusions<00:00:10.540> for<00:00:10.690> back<00:00:10.840> pain<00:00:11.340> but<00:00:12.340> almost<00:00:13.000> all

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.300 
do fusions for back pain but almost all

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.580 
do fusions for back pain but almost all
of<00:00:13.330> us<00:00:13.480> had<00:00:13.660> have<00:00:13.990> had<00:00:14.170> to<00:00:14.260> go<00:00:14.349> through<00:00:14.500> the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
of us had have had to go through the

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.739 
of us had have had to go through the
evolution<00:00:15.040> because<00:00:15.849> right<00:00:16.090> now<00:00:16.209> that's<00:00:16.480> still

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:16.749 
evolution because right now that's still

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:21.089 
evolution because right now that's still
what<00:00:16.900> that<00:00:17.439> still<00:00:17.739> is<00:00:17.949> what<00:00:18.189> is<00:00:18.369> taught<00:00:20.099> so

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
what that still is what is taught so

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.329 
what that still is what is taught so
it's<00:00:21.579> very<00:00:22.029> very<00:00:22.569> tricky<00:00:23.019> right<00:00:23.289> now<00:00:23.470> is<00:00:23.739> that

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
it's very very tricky right now is that

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.249 
it's very very tricky right now is that
again<00:00:24.880> I<00:00:24.909> spent<00:00:25.419> eight<00:00:25.599> years<00:00:25.630> doing

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
again I spent eight years doing

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.009 
again I spent eight years doing
aggressive<00:00:26.949> fusions<00:00:27.640> for<00:00:27.999> back<00:00:28.149> pain<00:00:28.390> I<00:00:28.659> mean

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
aggressive fusions for back pain I mean

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.580 
aggressive fusions for back pain I mean
I<00:00:29.079> was<00:00:29.229> jealous<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.599> I<00:00:31.869> went<00:00:32.079> after<00:00:32.230> we're

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
I was jealous so I went after we're

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.040 
I was jealous so I went after we're
surgeons<00:00:32.890> we're<00:00:33.370> trained<00:00:33.850> to<00:00:34.510> help<00:00:34.750> people

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
surgeons we're trained to help people

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.710 
surgeons we're trained to help people
out<00:00:35.500> so<00:00:35.970> again<00:00:36.970> I'm<00:00:37.090> not<00:00:37.180> being<00:00:37.240> critical<00:00:37.480> of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
out so again I'm not being critical of

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.560 
out so again I'm not being critical of
surgeons<00:00:38.080> that<00:00:38.140> are<00:00:38.320> doing<00:00:38.560> the<00:00:38.650> fusions

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
surgeons that are doing the fusions

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.910 
surgeons that are doing the fusions
everybody<00:00:40.570> has<00:00:40.810> the<00:00:40.990> intent<00:00:41.440> of<00:00:41.680> doing<00:00:41.860> the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
everybody has the intent of doing the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.290 
everybody has the intent of doing the
best<00:00:42.040> thing<00:00:42.160> they<00:00:42.280> can<00:00:42.430> for<00:00:42.670> their<00:00:42.790> patients

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
best thing they can for their patients

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.920 
best thing they can for their patients
just<00:00:44.140> that<00:00:44.290> right<00:00:44.470> now<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:45.550> data<00:00:46.000> isn't<00:00:46.390> clear

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
just that right now the data isn't clear

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.320 
just that right now the data isn't clear
it's<00:00:47.620> become<00:00:47.950> sort<00:00:48.070> of<00:00:48.220> a<00:00:48.250> cultural<00:00:48.880> belief

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
it's become sort of a cultural belief

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.850 
it's become sort of a cultural belief
system<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:49.750> this<00:00:50.080> is<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.350> right<00:00:50.500> thing<00:00:50.740> to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
system that this is the right thing to

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.190 
system that this is the right thing to
do<00:00:51.040> is<00:00:51.820> what<00:00:52.030> we're<00:00:52.180> trained<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.450> do<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:52.930> we're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
do is what we're trained to do and we're

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.700 
do is what we're trained to do and we're
paid<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.560> do<00:00:53.710> it<00:00:54.030> we're<00:00:55.030> actually<00:00:55.180> not<00:00:55.690> paid<00:00:56.410> to

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
paid to do it we're actually not paid to

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.510 
paid to do it we're actually not paid to
talk<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.460> patients<00:00:59.010> that's<00:01:00.010> actually<00:01:00.400> it's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
talk to patients that's actually it's

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.680 
talk to patients that's actually it's
more<00:01:00.640> effective<00:01:00.880> we'll<00:01:01.180> talk<00:01:01.420> about<00:01:01.510> that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
more effective we'll talk about that

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.270 
more effective we'll talk about that
later<00:01:01.750> as<00:01:02.050> president<00:01:02.380> as<00:01:02.530> far<00:01:02.829> as<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.010> central

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
later as president as far as the central

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.099 
later as president as far as the central
nervous<00:01:03.370> system<00:01:03.509> but<00:01:04.509> actually<00:01:04.809> look<00:01:04.929> at<00:01:05.019> the

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:05.109 
nervous system but actually look at the

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:06.239 
nervous system but actually look at the
central<00:01:05.350> nervous<00:01:05.469> system<00:01:05.649> part<00:01:06.069> of<00:01:06.159> this

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:06.249 
central nervous system part of this

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:08.700 
central nervous system part of this
thing<00:01:06.429> is<00:01:06.549> a<00:01:06.579> big<00:01:06.789> deal<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.350> when<00:01:08.469> I<00:01:08.499> initially

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
thing is a big deal so when I initially

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.999 
thing is a big deal so when I initially
made<00:01:09.520> this<00:01:09.640> transition<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:11.229> was<00:01:11.499> that<00:01:11.979> I

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
made this transition it was that I

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.770 
made this transition it was that I
didn't<00:01:12.429> know<00:01:12.490> what<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.729> alternative<00:01:12.789> was<00:01:13.450> I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
didn't know what the alternative was I

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.779 
didn't know what the alternative was I
just<00:01:14.740> think<00:01:14.859> that<00:01:14.920> surgery<00:01:15.219> wasn't<00:01:15.369> working

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
just think that surgery wasn't working

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:16.700 
just think that surgery wasn't working
so<00:01:15.939> I<00:01:16.060> stopped

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so I stopped

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.359 
so I stopped
so<00:01:17.710> from<00:01:17.920> 1993<00:01:18.759> till<00:01:19.270> about<00:01:19.649> 1999<00:01:20.649> I'd<00:01:21.039> sort<00:01:21.310> of

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
so from 1993 till about 1999 I'd sort of

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.270 
so from 1993 till about 1999 I'd sort of
drifted<00:01:21.880> didn't<00:01:22.630> do<00:01:22.689> the<00:01:22.780> operations<00:01:23.319> worth

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
drifted didn't do the operations worth

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.760 
drifted didn't do the operations worth
the<00:01:24.460> rehab<00:01:24.789> doctors<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.569> then<00:01:26.469> it's<00:01:26.619> when<00:01:26.710> I

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
the rehab doctors and then it's when I

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.520 
the rehab doctors and then it's when I
went<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:26.979> send<00:01:27.189> Valley<00:01:27.399> in<00:01:27.670> 1999<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:29.409> by

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
went to send Valley in 1999 that by

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.709 
went to send Valley in 1999 that by
about<00:01:29.679> 2001<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.819> started<00:01:31.149> getting<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.600> better

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719 
about 2001 I started getting a better

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.739 
about 2001 I started getting a better
idea<00:01:32.079> about<00:01:32.530> how<00:01:32.709> all<00:01:33.310> this<00:01:33.429> fits<00:01:33.609> together<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:36.749 
idea about how all this fits together so

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:40.020 
idea about how all this fits together so
the<00:01:37.889> sorts<00:01:38.889> of<00:01:39.009> pain<00:01:39.219> again<00:01:39.520> can<00:01:39.969> be

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
the sorts of pain again can be

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.870 
the sorts of pain again can be
structural<00:01:40.479> and<00:01:40.920> often<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.249> have<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.670> perform

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
structural and often you have to perform

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.709 
structural and often you have to perform
a<00:01:43.920> surgery<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:45.189> know<00:01:45.399> is<00:01:45.549> structural<00:01:46.389> promise

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
a surgery I know is structural promise

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.599 
a surgery I know is structural promise
demand<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.020> structural<00:01:47.409> solution<00:01:47.799> so<00:01:48.490> if<00:01:48.549> you

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
demand a structural solution so if you

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:49.889 
demand a structural solution so if you
came<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:48.880> my<00:01:48.969> clinic<00:01:49.149> on<00:01:49.389> a<00:01:49.420> given<00:01:49.719> day<00:01:49.840> you

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
came to my clinic on a given day you

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.899 
came to my clinic on a given day you
would<00:01:50.139> see<00:01:50.319> a<00:01:50.350> very<00:01:50.490> high<00:01:51.490> percent<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:51.819> my

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
would see a very high percent of my

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.510 
would see a very high percent of my
patients<00:01:52.060> doing<00:01:52.389> very<00:01:52.659> very<00:01:52.719> well<00:01:53.109> and<00:01:53.709> it's

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
patients doing very very well and it's

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.739 
patients doing very very well and it's
not<00:01:54.579> because<00:01:54.700> I'm<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.939> better<00:01:55.119> surgeon<00:01:55.329> I'm<00:01:55.659> an

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
not because I'm a better surgeon I'm an

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:56.910 
not because I'm a better surgeon I'm an
excellent<00:01:56.109> surgeon<00:01:56.289> but<00:01:56.529> so<00:01:56.679> are<00:01:56.799> both

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
excellent surgeon but so are both

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.980 
excellent surgeon but so are both
surgeons<00:01:57.310> we're<00:01:58.060> all<00:01:58.240> trained<00:01:58.689> well<00:01:58.840> these

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
surgeons we're all trained well these

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.379 
surgeons we're all trained well these
days<00:01:59.200> but<00:02:00.039> we're<00:02:00.159> extremely<00:02:00.670> clear<00:02:00.969> on<00:02:01.179> what

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
days but we're extremely clear on what

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:03.209 
days but we're extremely clear on what
we're<00:02:01.509> operating<00:02:01.779> on<00:02:02.049> so<00:02:02.799> if<00:02:02.859> you<00:02:02.950> go<00:02:03.069> to<00:02:03.130> a

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
we're operating on so if you go to a

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.980 
we're operating on so if you go to a
tent<00:02:03.579> if<00:02:03.789> you<00:02:03.909> go<00:02:03.999> to<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.149> dentist<00:02:04.389> for<00:02:04.659> instance

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
tent if you go to a dentist for instance

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.499 
tent if you go to a dentist for instance
with<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.409> painful<00:02:05.649> tooth<00:02:06.099> you<00:02:07.029> can't<00:02:07.240> rehab<00:02:07.479> a

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
with the painful tooth you can't rehab a

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:08.850 
with the painful tooth you can't rehab a
painful<00:02:07.899> tooth<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.259> got<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.470> pull<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.710> tooth

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
painful tooth you got to pull the tooth

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.580 
painful tooth you got to pull the tooth
or<00:02:09.040> fill<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.340> or<00:02:09.430> wherever<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.729> do<00:02:09.930> so<00:02:10.930> but<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
or fill it or wherever you do so but the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.690 
or fill it or wherever you do so but the
structural<00:02:11.860> problem<00:02:12.220> I'm<00:02:12.340> very<00:02:12.550> aggressive

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
structural problem I'm very aggressive

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.500 
structural problem I'm very aggressive
about<00:02:13.030> doing<00:02:13.240> sir

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
about doing sir

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.720 
about doing sir
and<00:02:13.900> we<00:02:13.989> do<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.110> lot<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.379> surgery<00:02:14.709> but<00:02:15.459> it's<00:02:15.610> for

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
and we do a lot of surgery but it's for

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.910 
and we do a lot of surgery but it's for
very<00:02:15.970> specific<00:02:16.239> identifiable<00:02:17.140> problems

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
very specific identifiable problems

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.740 
very specific identifiable problems
again<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.430> structural<00:02:18.909> identifiable<00:02:19.360> problem

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
again a structural identifiable problem

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.899 
again a structural identifiable problem
with<00:02:19.870> matching<00:02:20.290> symptoms<00:02:20.680> when<00:02:21.519> it<00:02:21.610> comes<00:02:21.790> to

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
with matching symptoms when it comes to

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.059 
with matching symptoms when it comes to
back<00:02:22.150> pain<00:02:22.470> you're<00:02:23.470> doing<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.769> major

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
back pain you're doing a major

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.770 
back pain you're doing a major
structural<00:02:24.489> intervention<00:02:25.000> for<00:02:25.480> something

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
structural intervention for something

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.520 
structural intervention for something
that<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.019> don't<00:02:26.140> know<00:02:26.290> where<00:02:26.409> it's<00:02:26.500> coming

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
that you don't know where it's coming

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.199 
that you don't know where it's coming
from<00:02:26.769> so<00:02:27.159> you<00:02:27.519> did<00:02:27.670> major<00:02:27.849> structural

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
from so you did major structural

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.399 
from so you did major structural
intervention<00:02:28.629> for<00:02:28.840> back<00:02:28.959> pain<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.260> could<00:02:29.319> be

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
intervention for back pain it could be

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.890 
intervention for back pain it could be
the<00:02:29.530> muscles<00:02:29.860> tendons<00:02:30.489> ligaments<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.420> discs

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
the muscles tendons ligaments the discs

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.850 
the muscles tendons ligaments the discs
themselves<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.080> big<00:02:35.230> leap<00:02:35.440> to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
themselves and so it's a big leap to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.990 
themselves and so it's a big leap to
make<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.129> big<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.340> an<00:02:36.430> intervention

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
make that big of an intervention

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.880 
make that big of an intervention
now<00:02:37.450> if<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.599> downside<00:02:37.989> wasn't<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.440> severe

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
now if the downside wasn't so severe

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.890 
now if the downside wasn't so severe
let's<00:02:39.670> try<00:02:39.790> an<00:02:39.910> operation<00:02:40.360> see<00:02:40.450> what<00:02:40.569> happens

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
let's try an operation see what happens

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.610 
let's try an operation see what happens
no<00:02:41.230> no<00:02:41.470> big<00:02:41.650> deal<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.989> would<00:02:43.989> be<00:02:44.230> reasonable

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
no no big deal that would be reasonable

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.449 
no no big deal that would be reasonable
correct<00:02:45.329> but<00:02:46.329> unfortunately<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:48.069> doesn't<00:02:48.280> my

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
correct but unfortunately it doesn't my

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.220 
correct but unfortunately it doesn't my
cut<00:02:48.640> there's<00:02:48.879> a<00:02:48.940> for<00:02:49.150> instance<00:02:49.420> with<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.930> back

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
cut there's a for instance with a back

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.949 
cut there's a for instance with a back
fusion<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.640> are<00:02:51.760> between<00:02:51.940> 15<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.510> 20<00:02:52.660> percent

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
fusion that are between 15 to 20 percent

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.339 
fusion that are between 15 to 20 percent
reoperation<00:02:53.950> rate<00:02:54.010> within<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.670> first<00:02:54.879> year

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
reoperation rate within the first year

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.680 
reoperation rate within the first year
so<00:02:56.349> Austin<00:02:56.680> almost<00:02:57.310> 24<00:02:57.879> almost<00:02:58.209> one<00:02:58.359> in<00:02:58.480> five

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
so Austin almost 24 almost one in five

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.420 
so Austin almost 24 almost one in five
now<00:02:59.109> have<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.290> second<00:02:59.560> operation<00:03:00.010> within<00:03:00.280> the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
now have a second operation within the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.339 
now have a second operation within the
first<00:03:00.640> year<00:03:00.870> for<00:03:01.870> an<00:03:01.930> operation<00:03:02.260> that

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
first year for an operation that

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.599 
first year for an operation that
pregnant<00:03:02.739> didn't<00:03:03.010> need<00:03:03.129> to<00:03:03.160> be<00:03:03.280> done<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:03.519> the

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
pregnant didn't need to be done in the

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.759 
pregnant didn't need to be done in the
first<00:03:03.760> place<00:03:04.200> then<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.290> course<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:05.560> spine

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
first place then of course is spine

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:06.839 
first place then of course is spine
within<00:03:06.010> three<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.190> five<00:03:06.400> years<00:03:06.609> so<00:03:06.670> it's

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
within three to five years so it's

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.930 
within three to five years so it's
breaking<00:03:07.120> down<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:08.109> doubt<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.470> within

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
breaking down and the doubt is within

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.880 
breaking down and the doubt is within
ten<00:03:09.940> years<00:03:10.299> about<00:03:10.629> 30<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.319> 40<00:03:11.590> percent<00:03:11.680> of

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
ten years about 30 to 40 percent of

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.309 
ten years about 30 to 40 percent of
spines<00:03:12.160> break<00:03:12.400> down<00:03:12.549> around<00:03:12.760> fusions<00:03:13.359> if

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
spines break down around fusions if

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.270 
spines break down around fusions if
you're<00:03:14.470> Auto<00:03:14.620> straight<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.040> dimmer

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
you're Auto straight that dimmer

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.520 
you're Auto straight that dimmer
probably<00:03:15.940> goes<00:03:16.120> up<00:03:16.359> if<00:03:16.599> you<00:03:17.230> don't<00:03:17.379> do<00:03:17.500> good

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
probably goes up if you don't do good

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.319 
probably goes up if you don't do good
posture<00:03:17.889> biomechanics<00:03:18.639> it<00:03:18.730> probably<00:03:19.000> goes<00:03:19.120> up

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
posture biomechanics it probably goes up

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.360 
posture biomechanics it probably goes up
also<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.620> you're<00:03:20.709> an<00:03:20.799> operation<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.190> has<00:03:21.340> a

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
also so you're an operation that has a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.030 
also so you're an operation that has a
significant<00:03:21.819> downside<00:03:22.329> affect<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.650> the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
significant downside affect so the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.009 
significant downside affect so the
actually<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.639> downside<00:03:25.209> effect<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:25.720> actually

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
actually the downside effect is actually

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.730 
actually the downside effect is actually
more<00:03:26.290> predictable<00:03:26.680> than<00:03:26.889> the<00:03:26.980> upside<00:03:27.430> effect
