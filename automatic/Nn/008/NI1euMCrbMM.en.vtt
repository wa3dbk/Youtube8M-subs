00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.800 

we're<00:00:17.580> trying<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.970> do<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> very<00:00:18.390> multicultural

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
we're trying to do a very multicultural

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.279 
we're trying to do a very multicultural
program<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.310> there's<00:00:21.060> no<00:00:21.300> other<00:00:21.480> country<00:00:22.020> in

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
program and there's no other country in

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.480 
program and there's no other country in
the<00:00:22.380> world<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.890> more<00:00:23.100> multicultural

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the world that is more multicultural

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.029 
the world that is more multicultural
than<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> u.s.<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.350> very<00:00:25.529> important<00:00:25.949> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
than the u.s. so it is very important to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.390 
than the u.s. so it is very important to
prove<00:00:26.279> that's<00:00:27.119> our<00:00:27.949> understanding<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.010> multi

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
prove that's our understanding of multi

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.959 
prove that's our understanding of multi
multiculturality<00:00:30.619> work<00:00:31.619> out<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> US<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
multiculturality work out in the US and

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:57.500 
multiculturality work out in the US and
apparently<00:00:33.480> does<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.110> fantastic

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.200 

there<00:00:58.510> are<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.780> lots<00:00:59.080> lots<00:00:59.710> of<00:00:59.890> messages<00:01:00.160> but<00:01:01.030> I

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
there are a lots lots of messages but I

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.850 
there are a lots lots of messages but I
think<00:01:01.450> the<00:01:01.780> most<00:01:01.930> important<00:01:02.350> one<00:01:02.470> is<00:01:02.620> also

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
think the most important one is also

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.510 
think the most important one is also
about<00:01:03.130> diversity<00:01:03.790> about<00:01:04.830> trying<00:01:05.830> things<00:01:06.250> out

about diversity about trying things out

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.550 
about diversity about trying things out
