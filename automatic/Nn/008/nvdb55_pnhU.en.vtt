the<00:03:50.370> setup<00:03:50.850> but<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.510> trick<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.780> trying<00:03:52.380> to

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
the setup but the trick is trying to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.720 
the setup but the trick is trying to
keep<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.709> away<00:03:52.799> because<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:53.130> don't<00:03:53.340> want<00:03:53.370> this

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
keep it away because you don't want this

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.310 
keep it away because you don't want this
bleeding<00:03:54.239> into<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.660> as<00:03:55.620> heavy<00:03:55.920> as<00:03:57.320> is

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
bleeding into this as heavy as is

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.960 
bleeding into this as heavy as is
bleeding<00:03:58.769> into<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.610> know

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.880 

yeah<00:04:06.970> well<00:04:07.180> basically<00:04:07.629> the<00:04:07.959> trick<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.440> is<00:04:08.650> that

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
yeah well basically the trick is is that

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.729 
yeah well basically the trick is is that
you<00:04:09.250> know<00:04:09.340> at<00:04:09.459> no<00:04:09.610> time<00:04:09.879> should<00:04:09.910> everything<00:04:10.840> or

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
you know at no time should everything or

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.979 
you know at no time should everything or
anything<00:04:12.310> clip<00:04:13.180> on<00:04:13.330> these<00:04:13.540> things<00:04:13.720> because

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
anything clip on these things because

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.710 
anything clip on these things because
that<00:04:14.379> flip<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.489> square<00:04:15.879> waves<00:04:16.150> its<00:04:16.419> best

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
that flip is the square waves its best

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.849 
that flip is the square waves its best
bad<00:04:17.410> for<00:04:17.739> you<00:04:17.829> if<00:04:17.889> you'll<00:04:18.070> notice<00:04:18.989> then<00:04:19.989> the

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
bad for you if you'll notice then the

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.190 
bad for you if you'll notice then the
kick<00:04:21.130> rides<00:04:21.459> almost<00:04:21.790> as<00:04:22.120> hot<00:04:22.419> as<00:04:22.630> it<00:04:22.780> should

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
kick rides almost as hot as it should

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.700 
kick rides almost as hot as it should
too<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:25.030> know<00:04:25.150> 11<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.690> have<00:04:25.900> more<00:04:26.169> lines<00:04:26.440> and

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
too you know 11 to have more lines and

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.620 
too you know 11 to have more lines and
you're<00:04:26.800> hitting<00:04:27.130> read<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:28.150> snare<00:04:28.389> is<00:04:28.510> the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
you're hitting read the snare is the

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.270 
you're hitting read the snare is the
same<00:04:28.840> way<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.290> reason<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.710> don't<00:04:29.830> see<00:04:29.979> the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
same way the reason you don't see the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.040 
same way the reason you don't see the
red<00:04:30.520> on<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.210> other<00:04:31.360> stuff<00:04:31.630> is<00:04:31.780> because

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
red on the other stuff is because

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.409 
red on the other stuff is because
they're<00:04:32.710> not<00:04:32.919> actually<00:04:33.220> being<00:04:33.700> hit<00:04:34.030> at<00:04:34.150> this

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
they're not actually being hit at this

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.040 
they're not actually being hit at this
time<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:35.320> notice<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:36.250> see<00:04:36.540> here<00:04:37.540> the<00:04:37.660> samples

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
time you notice you see here the samples

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.379 
time you notice you see here the samples
the<00:04:38.200> crashes<00:04:38.770> they're<00:04:39.370> just<00:04:39.400> coming<00:04:39.820> up<00:04:40.060> and

the crashes they're just coming up and

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.540 
the crashes they're just coming up and
when<00:04:41.290> he<00:04:41.440> really<00:04:41.740> hammers<00:04:42.130> them<00:04:42.310> they're

when he really hammers them they're

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.240 
when he really hammers them they're
going<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:42.760> go<00:04:42.880> a<00:04:42.910> little<00:04:43.060> higher<00:04:43.360> but<00:04:43.750> um<00:04:44.410> Tom's

cannot take that ugly away the only way
I<00:05:18.460> can<00:05:18.610> describe<00:05:18.669> it<00:05:19.060> once<00:05:19.450> you<00:05:19.570> go<00:05:19.720> into<00:05:19.840> the

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
I can describe it once you go into the

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.230 
I can describe it once you go into the
red<00:05:20.229> on<00:05:20.440> these<00:05:20.620> things<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:21.580> starts<00:05:21.940> to<00:05:22.060> get<00:05:22.180> a

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
red on these things it starts to get a

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.159 
red on these things it starts to get a
little<00:05:22.300> ugly<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:23.200> sounds<00:05:24.039> noisy<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:25.169> let's

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
little ugly and sounds noisy and let's

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.170 
little ugly and sounds noisy and let's
read<00:05:26.380> distortion<00:05:27.010> going<00:05:27.190> in<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:27.580> too<00:05:27.789> many<00:05:28.000> of

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
read distortion going in so too many of

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.110 
read distortion going in so too many of
those<00:05:28.330> you<00:05:28.720> can<00:05:29.229> imagine<00:05:29.440> what'll<00:05:29.830> make<00:05:29.979> a<00:05:30.580> and

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
those you can imagine what'll make a and

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.870 
those you can imagine what'll make a and
possibly<00:05:31.690> good<00:05:31.990> sounding<00:05:32.440> song<00:05:32.830> on<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.639> record

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
possibly good sounding song on a record

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.050 
possibly good sounding song on a record
not<00:05:34.810> feeling<00:05:35.200> so<00:05:35.380> good<00:05:35.560> so<00:05:35.889> basically<00:05:36.460> just

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
not feeling so good so basically just

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.940 
not feeling so good so basically just
you<00:05:37.210> know<00:05:37.330> be<00:05:38.289> soft<00:05:39.090> no<00:05:40.090> matter<00:05:40.330> all<00:05:40.770> rocket<00:05:41.770> is

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
you know be soft no matter all rocket is

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.510 
you know be soft no matter all rocket is
and<00:05:42.300> there's

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
and there's

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.080 
and there's
that<00:05:45.520> edge<00:05:45.849> between<00:05:46.949> and<00:05:47.949> often<00:05:48.400> too<00:05:48.580> much<00:05:48.819> and

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
that edge between and often too much and

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.939 
that edge between and often too much and
usually<00:05:49.509> it's<00:05:49.629> better<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.199> just<00:05:50.410> ride<00:05:50.680> the

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
usually it's better you just ride the

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:57.689 
usually it's better you just ride the
