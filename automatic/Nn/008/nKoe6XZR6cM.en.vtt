00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.199
 which lies to me for 100 years Chinese 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.330
 a copy of the well-known knife 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.539
 This particular case is version 21. 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.990
 well, I do sebenza hemp with carboxylic 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.990
 lining but could not ignore 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.350
 such a lip cheering never such 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.829

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.100
 sent me this knife got it in 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.320
 first of all I want to say to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.760
 I was very pleased with the quality 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.210
 in short, according to tth the total length of the knife 21 and 8 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.800
 centimeter folded 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.840
 the handle itself is 12 and 8 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.730
 blade length 9 centimeters thickness 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.580

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.009
 May for. we have what 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.900
 concave descents like 21 villages 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.909
 what do you want to say die made of 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.920
 carbon 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.640
 carbon fiber die but unlike 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.310
 original or there are more expensive replicas 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.140
 the thickness of the bowl is different due to this weight 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.979
 the knife 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.109
 116 grams while mechanics on very 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:41.420
 Please look at a good level 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:46.969
 it opens at this time, no 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.490
 there are no problems on the knife 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.099
 nothing knife wonderful opens like 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.679
 left right hand 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:02:00.549
 carbon fiber on here is polished playing 2 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:04.789
 stainless steel die 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:09.229
 well processed very clearly backlash I 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:11.900
 didn't see here with all that 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.670
 we have one puck of PTFE 2 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.819
 change to a large washer action seen 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.269
 PTFE small copper at the same time 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.760
 yours looks like a fence but it is not for her 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.299
 is let's say yes with the original 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.000
 compare half a year very similar very 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.049
 similar, respectively, to more expensive 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.200
 replicas yes there any 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:43.420
 both inexpensive and very very good 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.569
 looking knife what is interesting dress 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.000
 stamps of Chris Riva can notice something 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.130
 There is a certain 3g custom story 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.590
 origin is unknown to me that is not 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.160
 I see who saw as ilja in my opinion 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.180
 the pad was ordered separately as well 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.280
 history is silent 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.010
 clear exactly is to look for it high 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.360
 product quality that is a good level 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.370
 sharpening and fitting all parts 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.989
 principle knife painless nashinkuyu paper 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.110
 good links pretty hard 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:19.390
 I did not think it would be possible to disassemble it 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.830
 throw a flat look fit 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.090
 does she understand what's suitable but when 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.370
 this thickness 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.150
 you can see that is most likely 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.910
 fine 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.360
 she would not therefore did not disassemble 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.610
 I did not unleash a big countryman 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.500
 thank you for trusting you 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.840
 such a knife 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.200
 It will be interesting to try to find the ends 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.400
 where he is to come from or have 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.790
 on hand time 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.010
 carbon 21 and large and very small 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.829
 good knife and very little they weigh such 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.109
 everything is wonderful just super here yet 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.370
 talk a little bit about notches and notches in 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.400
 differences from the original 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.420
 larger Irina she is closer than 25 families 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.459
 but at the same time holding very confidently gives 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.549
 in principle for them heavy 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.920
 electrifying music for the role of Odessa 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.690
 quite fit 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.340
 such is wonderful in itself for and 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.070
 benzo 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.680
 according to lucas there is such for adherents 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.669
 let's say the cleanliness of the knife here yet 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.490
 I will tell you no 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.530
 Right Chris Riva then Hamit no 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.900
 at all 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:36.160
 the inscription is no longer that is a clean knife by 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:39.220

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:08.320
 nothing such an old man square well 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:11.440
 approximately 58 59 that is quite quite from 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.750
 well worth it not bad started 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.449
 Okay, how about that? 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.710
 look at the comparison with the original 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:24.840
 what they look like 21 on single 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:29.050
 this is the chinese version 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:32.610
