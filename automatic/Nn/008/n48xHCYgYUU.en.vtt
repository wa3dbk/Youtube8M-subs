underneath where you died which would be

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.700 
underneath where you died which would be
pretty<00:01:31.130> much<00:01:31.190> right<00:01:31.640> near<00:01:32.030> where<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.990> two

chess and I have even found a second
chest<00:01:57.140> right<00:01:57.740> after<00:01:58.009> reset<00:01:58.459> this<00:01:58.579> is<00:01:58.729> within

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
chest right after reset this is within

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.449 
chest right after reset this is within
like<00:01:59.299> five<00:01:59.569> minutes<00:01:59.840> until<00:02:00.020> er<00:02:00.200> they<00:02:00.319> spawn<00:02:00.619> so

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
like five minutes until er they spawn so

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:02.649 
like five minutes until er they spawn so
what<00:02:01.670> kind<00:02:01.819> of<00:02:01.849> got<00:02:01.969> lucky<00:02:02.060> with<00:02:02.240> that<00:02:02.390> one<00:02:02.509> but

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
what kind of got lucky with that one but

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:03.880 
what kind of got lucky with that one but
the<00:02:02.719> best<00:02:02.840> time<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.109> find<00:02:03.319> means<00:02:03.530> is<00:02:03.619> probably

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
the best time to find means is probably

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.699 
the best time to find means is probably
right<00:02:04.159> after<00:02:04.369> rolling<00:02:05.090> resets<00:02:05.599> the<00:02:06.500> full

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
right after rolling resets the full
