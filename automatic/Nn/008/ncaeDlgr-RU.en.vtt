plain old model 1887 it should have
better<00:00:15.309> range<00:00:15.610> then<00:00:16.059> decompose<00:00:16.840> and<00:00:17.820> um<00:00:19.710> so

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
better range then decompose and um so

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.500 
better range then decompose and um so
yeah<00:00:23.160> I'm<00:00:24.160> on<00:00:24.370> high<00:00:24.520> rise<00:00:24.760> on<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:25.120> shoot<00:00:25.420> out

887<00:01:03.400> with<00:01:03.760> FMJ<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.970> same<00:01:07.150> range

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.240 

and<00:01:16.410> now<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.190> kimbo<00:01:18.030> models<00:01:18.680> just<00:01:19.680> plain<00:01:20.040> ol

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and now the kimbo models just plain ol

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:30.680 
and now the kimbo models just plain ol
akimbo

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.050 

and<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.620> about<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:32.010> max<00:01:32.220> range<00:01:32.580> video

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and this is about the max range video

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:42.110 
and this is about the max range video
can<00:01:33.300> both<00:01:33.510> right<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:39.890> but<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.610> supposedly

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
can both right here but the supposedly

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:50.860 
can both right here but the supposedly
unpatched<00:01:42.990> models<00:01:43.730> the<00:01:44.730> akimbo<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.920> smj<00:01:49.850> are

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
unpatched models the akimbo and smj are

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.980 
unpatched models the akimbo and smj are
have<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:52.050> same<00:01:52.320> range<00:01:52.680> as<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:54.210> akimbo<00:01:54.480> models

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
have the same range as the akimbo models

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.130 
have the same range as the akimbo models
they<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.310> no<00:01:56.580> longer<00:01:56.760> unpatched<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:57.870> are

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
they are no longer unpatched they are

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.970 
they are no longer unpatched they are
the<00:01:58.470> same<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:59.510> the<00:02:00.510> Akuma<00:02:00.900> models<00:02:01.260> they<00:02:01.800> have

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
the same as the Akuma models they have

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.530 
the same as the Akuma models they have
the<00:02:02.100> same<00:02:02.280> range<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:05.490> write<00:02:05.910> about<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.240> box

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the same range and write about this box

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.890 
the same range and write about this box
you<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.290> break<00:02:07.620> through<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:11.540> windows<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
you can break through the windows and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.720 
you can break through the windows and
that's<00:02:13.200> all<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:15.330> conclusion<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.530> model<00:02:17.160> 1887

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
that's all in conclusion the model 1887

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.140 
that's all in conclusion the model 1887
is<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.410> not<00:02:19.410> much<00:02:19.650> different<00:02:20.070> from<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.580> spaz

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
is a not much different from the spaz

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.690 
is a not much different from the spaz
now<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:21.780> basically<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.590> same<00:02:22.770> thing<00:02:22.830> II<00:02:23.250> my

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
now it's basically the same thing II my

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.310 
now it's basically the same thing II my
lever<00:02:24.180> action<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.780> little<00:02:25.020> different<00:02:25.230> from

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
lever action is a little different from

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.810 
lever action is a little different from
the<00:02:25.530> pump<00:02:25.710> action<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.250> bass<00:02:26.490> but

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
the pump action of this bass but

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.980 
the pump action of this bass but
basically<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.990> same<00:02:28.170> deal<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.520> um

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
basically it's the same deal and so um

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.500 
basically it's the same deal and so um
you<00:02:30.990> know<00:02:31.550> really<00:02:32.550> i<00:02:32.670> would<00:02:33.060> say<00:02:33.210> use<00:02:33.360> this

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
you know really i would say use this

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.210 
you know really i would say use this
patch<00:02:33.720> because<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.200> Spads<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.680> use<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:34.920> for

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
patch because the Spads can use this for

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.460 
patch because the Spads can use this for
grip<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.940> model<00:02:36.150> 1887<00:02:36.780> cannot<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:38.300> really

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
grip and the model 1887 cannot so really

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.830 
grip and the model 1887 cannot so really
this<00:02:40.470> model<00:02:41.400> 1887<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.209> pretty<00:02:42.540> obsolete<00:02:42.750> now

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
this model 1887 is pretty obsolete now

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.350 
this model 1887 is pretty obsolete now
it's<00:02:45.840> it's<00:02:46.680> no<00:02:46.980> longer<00:02:47.160> worth<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.820> wait<00:02:48.030> of

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
it's it's no longer worth the wait of

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.680 
it's it's no longer worth the wait of
level<00:02:48.660> 67<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:50.150> yeah<00:02:51.530> just<00:02:53.360> don't<00:02:54.360> want<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.540> use
