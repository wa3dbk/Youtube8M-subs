sauteing<00:00:02.149> this<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.240> one<00:00:03.389> of<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.570> most<00:00:03.750> common

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
sauteing this is one of the most common

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.810 
sauteing this is one of the most common
techniques<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.670> cooking<00:00:07.010> special<00:00:08.010> pan<00:00:08.370> saute

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.209 
techniques of cooking special pan saute
pan<00:00:09.059> has<00:00:09.240> sloped<00:00:09.570> sides<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.469> can<00:00:10.710> flip<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
pan has sloped sides so you can flip the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.629 
pan has sloped sides so you can flip the
food<00:00:11.460> over<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:13.099> sort<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.130> like<00:00:14.250> flipping<00:00:14.580> a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
food over in it sort of like flipping a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.570 
food over in it sort of like flipping a
pancake<00:00:15.470> so<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.710> done<00:00:16.859> over<00:00:17.010> moderately

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
pancake so this is done over moderately

food with a small amount of oil helping
it<00:00:30.929> along<00:00:31.640> have<00:00:32.640> some<00:00:32.940> vegetables<00:00:33.899> here<00:00:34.110> that

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
it along have some vegetables here that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.360 
it along have some vegetables here that
we're<00:00:34.380> going<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.559> saute<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.070> want<00:00:38.250> your

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
we're going to saute so you want your

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.940 
we're going to saute so you want your
pan<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.760> pretty<00:00:39.000> hot<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.800> in<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
pan to be pretty hot up in the

pan to be pretty hot up in the
medium-high<00:00:41.610> range

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
medium-high range

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.470 
medium-high range
hot<00:00:42.989> enough<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.530> any<00:00:43.770> moisture<00:00:44.480> that's

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
hot enough so any moisture that's

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.260 
hot enough so any moisture that's
released<00:00:45.840> by<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.050> food<00:00:47.030> will<00:00:48.030> evaporate

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
released by the food will evaporate

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.380 
released by the food will evaporate
immediately<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.530> some<00:00:49.800> salt<00:00:50.390> salt

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
immediately this is some salt salt

food<00:00:58.829> taste<00:00:59.100> better<00:00:59.219> so<00:01:01.430> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.760> tested

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
food taste better so you can see tested

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.729 
food taste better so you can see tested
it<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> piece<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.140> onion

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
it with a piece of onion

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.800 
it with a piece of onion
you'll<00:01:05.430> hear<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> sizzling<00:01:06.450> sound<00:01:08.659> come<00:01:09.659> from

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
you'll hear a sizzling sound come from

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.649 
you'll hear a sizzling sound come from
the<00:01:09.930> pan<00:01:10.140> when<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> throw<00:01:10.680> your<00:01:11.659> materials

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the pan when you throw your materials

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.929 
the pan when you throw your materials
into<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.470> hot<00:01:13.680> enough<00:01:16.549> you<00:01:17.549> never<00:01:17.729> want

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
into it it's hot enough you never want

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
into it it's hot enough you never want
to<00:01:18.000> over<00:01:18.299> crowd<00:01:18.720> your<00:01:18.840> pan<00:01:19.110> when<00:01:19.619> you're

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to over crowd your pan when you're

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.060 
to over crowd your pan when you're
sauteing<00:01:24.110> once<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.229> throw<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> food<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
sauteing once you throw the food in it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.160 
sauteing once you throw the food in it
will<00:01:26.700> cool<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.210> surface<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> pan<00:01:27.930> down<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
will cool the surface of the pan down a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.440 
will cool the surface of the pan down a
little<00:01:28.439> bit<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.579> threw<00:01:29.820> too<00:01:30.000> much<00:01:30.210> in

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
little bit so if you threw too much in

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.260 
little bit so if you threw too much in
you'll<00:01:30.750> cool<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.140> pan<00:01:31.350> down<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> lot<00:01:32.270> reducing

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you'll cool your pan down a lot reducing

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.030 
you'll cool your pan down a lot reducing
the<00:01:33.360> temperature<00:01:33.650> reducing<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> amount<00:01:34.979> of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the temperature reducing the amount of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.810 
the temperature reducing the amount of
moisture<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.549> needs<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.939> evaporate<00:01:36.390> quickly

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
moisture that needs to evaporate quickly

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.670 
moisture that needs to evaporate quickly
so<00:01:38.820> I'm<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.210> flip<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.200> food<00:01:40.500> up

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
so I'm just going to flip this food up

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.039 
so I'm just going to flip this food up
the<00:01:40.799> side<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.400> saute<00:01:42.240> pan<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.720> allow<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the side of the saute pan and allow it

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.139 
the side of the saute pan and allow it
to<00:01:43.229> roll<00:01:43.680> back<00:01:44.450> onto<00:01:45.450> itself<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:48.030> would

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
to roll back onto itself and that would

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.910 
to roll back onto itself and that would
be<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> method<00:01:48.540> common<00:01:49.439> method<00:01:49.710> called

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
be a method common method called

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.649 
be a method common method called
sauteing<00:01:52.130> do<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> lot<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.820> kitchen

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.910 

anything<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.869> saute<00:01:58.290> should<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.649> cooked

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
anything that you saute should be cooked

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.840 
anything that you saute should be cooked
very<00:01:59.729> fast<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:01.860> wouldn't<00:02:02.130> cook<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> pot

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
very fast you wouldn't cook like a pot

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.300 
very fast you wouldn't cook like a pot
roast<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:06.350> variation<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.500> sauteing<00:02:08.009> is

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
roast like this variation on sauteing is

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
roast like this variation on sauteing is
stir<00:02:08.520> frying<00:02:08.879> which<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.390> done<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.720> wok<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
the items are stirred around rather than

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.170 
the items are stirred around rather than
flipped<00:02:14.270> rather<00:02:14.780> than<00:02:14.990> sauteed<00:02:16.000> saute<00:02:17.000> is

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
flipped rather than sauteed saute is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.470
